0	10600	It's my great joy to introduce Daniel Schmockenberger to you all.
10600	21160	Daniel is a wonderful polymath, really extraordinary public speaker who is the head of the Civilization
21160	29240	Research Institute and co-founder of the Conciliance Project and is probably, this is kind of the
29240	33360	personal story, there's two people in the last five years of my life that have really
33360	41000	dramatically shifted my world view, my spirituality, etc., and of people living, of living people
41000	45960	I would say that Daniel and Robin Wall Kimmerer, who are brave and sweet grass, have been
45960	54680	the two kind of major ships for me and have greatly not only shifted my view of the world
54680	59600	and what we need to be doing in it, but also have really grounded me spiritually, have
59600	63520	shifted my kind of heart sense of how to relate.
63520	68080	And so obviously Daniel and I have met once before, but anytime I get to see Daniel, it's
68080	74920	just a joy to bring him in and a joy to introduce him to the Quaker Earth Care Witness community,
74920	75920	all others.
75920	81440	So QEW is an organization, a Quaker organization that focuses on Earth Care concerns, we're
81440	86840	a global network, and we're really excited to bring Daniel in here today to talk about
86840	91840	a civilizational rite of passage, and obviously a rite of passage is something you don't know
91840	97080	what the end of it is, you don't know if we're going to make it, if we're not going to make
97080	103400	it, but what you can do is you can be faithful in the process, you can be true in the process.
103400	109080	And I think that this being true is something that Daniel often refers to as deep earnestness.
109080	116560	And so we're going to sort of investigate today some of what Daniel calls the metacrisis.
116560	122720	It's a term that's kind of thrown in a number of sort of sense-making communities that are
122720	130920	working on these large big picture topics, and how seeing that metacrisis coming under
130920	136520	the weight of that, how we can respond to it in a powerful and spiritual way.
136520	142000	So with that, I just want to, those are my opening comments, and I just want to invite
142000	150240	Daniel, do you have anything you want to share before we kind of dive in?
150240	154240	My mom went to a friend's school when she was a kid and always spoke very highly of
154240	161000	her experience and had a mentor for a while when I was a kid named Dr. Everett Slumis.
161000	166360	He was one of the kind of pioneers of natural medicine in the West and got to live on a
167160	171680	health retreat that he had when I was young, and he was a Quaker.
171680	176760	And so I have not got to experience Quaker community very much myself, but I have very
176760	178920	positive associations.
178920	182880	And so it was cool when you told me about this.
182880	190480	And if my schedule is not overful with the timely things we're working on, I would have
190480	195680	joined you for the whole day because I like the tone of what you shared with me that you're
195680	205560	exploring here together, the spirituality that is in service of ecology, life, well,
206840	209120	deep earnestness and deep humility.
209120	214000	So being that you've had a full day and I haven't had all that, I hope that this weaves.
214840	216320	And I'm just happy to be here.
216320	221240	And I also said yes to coming just because of the way that in our limited interaction,
221240	227600	talking once, but also just the way I've seen you post online is clear that you are a very
228080	231000	caring, thoughtful, earnest person.
231000	236760	And I, yeah, I like to support activities and people like that.
238080	243560	Yeah, I think Daniel, some of the people in our community have probably heard me say things
243560	249520	like humanity has reached a point where we've become too powerful to remain in rivalry with
249520	250240	ourselves.
251120	258240	And that, you know, the problem is that we have a profound gap between our capacities as a
258240	260120	species and the wisdom that guides them.
260760	265600	And I would say that of everyone I attribute that sort of framing to, it's you.
266640	271360	And I think that the beauty of the really extraordinary thing is that you bring out that
272280	275600	framing, not just as a way to understand our own times and what needs to be done in them, but
275600	277560	also as a way of understanding of how we got here.
277560	283600	How did a species that clearly does not want to destroy its own climate do that collectively,
283600	284680	nonetheless, right?
284680	292560	How is it that collective decisions that no one would want end up becoming, you know, almost
292560	298320	unavoidable, like the momentum is so extraordinary that nothing can seem to overcome it.
298880	303880	And so if we can kind of talk about that and talk about its relation, this is what Daniel calls
303960	310040	the metacrisis and talk about how that relates to our understanding of history.
310080	313040	I just want to open that, open that to you.
313040	316120	What is the metacrisis and where are we in that?
322080	333400	Yeah, I just share in starting that in general, I don't like talking about this publicly,
333640	339640	because it's mostly not empowering and just kind of despair causing uselessly.
340920	347800	I mostly talk about it to institutions and flancer pests and whatever where there is
347800	351000	something they can do and try to tailor it to what they they can do.
353520	358560	It's not that there isn't any way we can relate to it more effectively.
359320	361680	You come to understand the whole picture more.
361960	372800	We it's devastating before it's empowering, it can be motivating and ennobling, but it also the
372800	377440	analysis shows that most of the things that one could be hopeful about work.
379520	386000	And so there is like a there's a lot of faith actually required to want to engage with that in
386000	390400	a meaningful way because you have to go through a kind of crucible to come out on the other end
391360	392720	in some way empowered.
393520	397920	And I think if it I think it's because there's a spiritual practice and a community holding
397920	399920	each other here that I feel okay talking about it.
402880	407120	You're mentioning climate change and you know this kind of obligate nature.
410240	414720	The first paper on scientific paper on climate change was published in 1938.
415680	420560	The United Nations Environmental Programme recognizing the need for international coordination
420560	426320	on global commons issues was made in 1972 well over 50 years ago.
426320	431760	And climate change has become one of the biggest existential risk topics in the world.
431760	434160	It has over a trillion dollars a year in climate funding.
435040	441840	And every with the exception of global recessions every single year we use more fossil fuels
441920	442560	in the year before.
443680	452000	And during that whole time all of the solar wind renewable energy all the hydro and the damaging
452000	457200	effect of the dams and all of the nuclear and the entire risk of the nuclear energy hasn't even
457200	460480	slowed the increase in fossil fuels use one year.
464240	471360	And so when you look at and yet the most fascinating thing is there is literally no one
471360	474640	who wants climate change as like a strategic objective.
477280	482240	There I mean yes you can say that the Russians are capitalizing on the fact that they get a
482240	483600	new shipping route through the Arctic.
484720	490720	But no one has climate change as an objective and yet nobody can stop it.
493520	496720	Because everybody wants energy because energy is one for one course
496720	502960	related with GDP and this ability to actuate anything and money has to exponentially grow
502960	506960	every year to keep up with the interest which means that the energy demand has to exponentially
506960	507520	grow every year.
508880	514240	And the solar plant is going to take 10 years worth of the energy that it produces out of
515120	516880	fossil fuel energy to make up front.
517920	523440	And then we don't decide to make less fossil fuel energy it's we just make all of the stuff in
523440	525440	which there is energy return on energy investment.
526960	534000	While there are plenty of groups that don't care enough about species extinction nobody
534000	537600	really wants species extinction and nobody really wants
540800	543920	PFOS in literally every raindrop in the world which it is now.
545600	547920	As an ubiquitous carcinogen and stuff or
550560	555760	there's 230 million chemicals in the American Chemical Society database almost all of them
555760	560720	are toxic cancels, antigens, endocrine disruptors whatever.
561680	566640	The curve of the increasing autoimmune diseases, the increasing autism, the increasing
566640	571600	Alzheimer's, the increasing psychiatric diseases follows the curve of those chemicals
571600	575920	and nobody wants a toxic planet and also nobody can stop it.
578160	583280	And the total set of all activities that has been done since Silent Spring was written
583280	588160	since the environmental movement started we have put more toxic chemicals each year into
588160	591440	the environment than the year before and innovated more new ones.
593760	598640	And it's not just that the processes have been ineffective it's that many of them have made
598640	610480	things worse right that if we say okay because of climate change and fossil fuel use we really
610480	618080	need to push non-fossil fuel energy so we push more nuclear and so now we get increased risk of
618080	623680	warfare associated with nuclear and toxic waste and etc and it doesn't slow fossil fuels and
623680	628000	then you do more dams and so you destroy more ecosystems and create more geopolitical tensions
628000	634720	between the countries that share the river it's typically the case that the way that we go about
634720	641120	solving the problems doesn't work and makes them worse and I didn't have that analysis when I was
641120	645440	young and started and was kind of like hopeful that we could just put more energy into the things.
647520	654400	So why? Like why is this? I would also say when you were talking you mentioned that
656480	663280	there are certain kind of like principles that come from conscience that were things people
663280	668160	could choose before but they're obligate now because self-termination on this path is the
668160	675680	otherwise impending possibility. I wouldn't even say that they were possible before they were impossible
678320	688240	because if you held a set of views that did not mount effective military forces and Genghis Khan
688240	691920	and his men or Alexander the Great or the Ottomans or whatever were coming you were slaughtered.
694240	698720	And there have been a lot of peaceful beautiful cultures throughout history that listened to their
698720	706160	conscience and got slaughtered. We just did an analysis of this on you know the history of
707840	716640	selection via warfare and you know Genghis Khan and his men alone in his life not the entire
716640	724080	Mongols killed 50 million people on horseback without nuclear weapons without industrial weapons
724080	728240	killed 50 million people. That was 11% of the entire global population
731040	735280	including lots of lovely cultures that because they were lovelier didn't mount huge militaries
735760	737760	and
741200	747760	fascinatingly it's actually a really just weird irony that the current estimate is that 11% of
747760	753760	all Asians today are Genghis Khan's descendants because the amount of rape that he and then the
753760	757600	genetics of that family did so kill the people do all the raving. So
757680	763680	and then when you look at that for
765920	774240	Dutch colonization in the Congo and Attila and blah blah blah you realize that we alive today
774240	778960	are the descendants memetically and genetically of the most successful conkers
781120	786400	and that the Tibetans could keep a relatively nice set of ideas as long as they were remote
786400	790960	enough that nobody cared about their land that much and as soon as it became clear that they
790960	797920	controlled the watershed between two billion person populations uh then a violent culture
797920	804400	slaughtered them and the same with the Native Americans and the colonizers here the the population
804400	811600	of North and South America before colonizers came was 140 million people and colonization
811600	819360	wiped out over 90% of them that's it that's a lot of people and that means those those ways of being
819360	825440	those those non-alphabetic languages those non-written languages those systems of medicine
825440	832160	those poetries those all of that you know wiped out of history so I don't think it was possible
832160	835760	like an individual could try to be lovely and the tribe could try to be lovely but you didn't
835760	839440	actually make it through history that way and you most certainly didn't shape the world very much that
839440	848800	way and so this topic of the you know kind of a multipolar trap somebody does something that provides
848800	855360	so much near-term competitive advantage that everyone else is obligated to do that or lose
855360	863840	and lose means your ideas don't make it through selection that has been an amazingly powerful
863840	873760	part of a very perverse selection process and this is still the case and this is why open AI that
873760	882000	was founded to because of the fear of market-driven AI and the need to make a very well-funded
882000	889360	research institute to focus on slowing down market AI risk became the company like switched
889440	894640	from a non-profit to a for-profit and accelerate AI risk more than any and it's why then
895600	899680	seeing that that was happening and saying it was bad a part of open AI broke off created
899680	904720	anthropic to really do AI risk work and then realized that in order to do that they needed
904720	910160	a lot of money to have big AI systems they took the money became a for-profit and now are also racing
910960	917680	and so again what that happened is pretty much everyone got into the multipolar trap of
918400	924800	the dude with more power wins there is no way out of this and unless you want to just die with
924800	931360	dignity you okay we have to win and we have to do whatever violent etc thing is going to let us
931360	937040	win but then we'll be the good guys and this is basically the state of geopolitics between
937040	949440	us and china right now and many many places so in that way ethics are constraints on strategic
949440	955520	possibilities and those who have less of them have less constraints and those win at strategy
956400	965840	and so one cannot afford to have them right which is why there are so many
966640	972400	real politic theorists to basically say if you have any ethics you're an asshole
974000	978080	because what you're actually saying is that you don't care about anything enough to be effective
979840	984320	yeah and if you really want to be effective you have to win and you got to do what it takes
984320	990480	so if you care you'll be you know you'll you'll do the Machiavellian thing which is such a weird
990480	994720	you know basically it's what happened to Soromon and Lord of the Rings right it's what happens
994720	1005200	again and again power winning is inevitable and therefore embracing it is actually ethical
1005200	1009840	because it's your only way to influence it and so that's the co-opting of the ethics right
1009840	1015600	but what's the other choice so there's a way in which just choosing to die with dignity well
1015600	1022560	we'll be ethical our hands will be clean while the world burns yeah um and if you look at the history
1024080	1028480	the Jane Goodall's of the world have not had the level of influence on the world system the
1028480	1041120	Kissingers have had not by a billion to one and the minds and heart the the developmental process
1041120	1047120	that makes a Jane Goodall does not give you Kissinger skills the developmental process
1047120	1051200	that gives you Kissinger skills does not give you Jane Goodall values they are almost developmentally
1051200	1057200	mutually exclusive yeah and yet we don't make it if we don't actually get both of those in
1057200	1065680	the same beings now but where those skills are not in service to power and the perpetuation
1065680	1071600	of the system but are in service to all sentience now and into perpetuity but that's that hard in
1071600	1084480	that mind together right in the same beings and yeah so right now we obviously you know
1084720	1090240	you know the crossed six of the nine planetary boundaries radically rapidly crossing the other
1090240	1098240	ones all of the curves are accelerating if we tried to turn it around it's not even clear that we
1098240	1109920	could um nobody really understands and obviously the the post-war order that maintained relative
1110560	1115920	peace between superpowers meaning we only proxy ward through korean vietnam and whatever other
1115920	1122880	places and economic warfare and etc that has completely broken down that kind of post-war
1122880	1129120	order is not uh effective anymore at preventing major power conflict and so we can see that we
1129120	1136080	have multiple three world war three escalation pathways hot right now which is why the atomic
1136080	1140400	scientists moved the nuclear clock closer to midnight than it was during the cuba missile crisis
1142400	1148400	and we see actually an increase in hawkishness everywhere and
1150960	1156160	if you look at just even the rate of say ai and the reason that ai is so important more than
1156800	1164080	any other category of tech it's because i can i can't use a nuclear weapon to make a bio weapon
1164400	1169280	i can't use a nuclear weapons to make a financial system i can't use a bio weapon to make a financial
1169280	1173600	system i can use ai to make better nukes and better bio weapons and better financial systems and
1173600	1185040	better manufacturing and better propaganda so the race there the you know more's law was completely
1186000	1190640	unprecedented in history being doubling the computing power every two years
1193120	1200640	but every 18 months so you get an exponential curve currently just the hardware alone on gpu's
1201440	1208400	is 10 xing the compute efficiency every six months not to mention that you also have an
1208400	1216640	exponential curve on the software on the amount of data on the parameters and so every and this
1216640	1222000	is why there's you know been about 30 trillion just invested in the last couple years trillion
1222960	1231680	to win ai supremacy as the ring to rule them all and nobody who thinks they can win has any
1231680	1242800	interest in multilateral agreements to slow it down so you could say these are times that were
1242800	1253760	prophesied you could say that the end of kali yuga and the beginning of the possible beginning of
1253760	1259600	satyuga you could say the time of purgatory or the end of the mayan calendar or whatever we're all
1259680	1266640	roughly speaking to a similar thing and you could say that once you got the written word
1267280	1271120	so you got history you know like a more kind of formal version of history
1273440	1279600	it wasn't that hard for philosophers of the time to recognize that with populations increasing
1279600	1285440	the wars killed more people because the number of people that gang is conkilled was more than
1285440	1290160	the entire world population at the beginning of the agricultural revolution like just to have a
1290160	1294800	sense right so with the increasing population killed more people with the increasing technology
1294800	1299120	we killed more people from further distance right you get the crossbow you get the cannon you get
1299120	1306960	the fowlings you get the and it's pretty clear to see that humans were not very good stewards of
1306960	1313760	their power right every culture had class subjugation torture or whatever once we got into empire not
1313760	1320960	pre-empire um and so the idea that we have that kind of mixed bag of some really lovely stuff
1320960	1325040	but really wicked stuff but that the wicked stuff is getting larger populations with more tech
1326640	1332400	and the wars are killing more people and we're like early civilizations were destroyed because of
1332400	1338160	environmental overshoot right if you read tainter in the collapse of complex civilizations you can
1338160	1342240	see that cutting down all the trees eroding the topsoil and the civilization fails has been
1342240	1351200	happening for thousands of years so um but obviously with the capacity to destroy environments at
1351200	1358480	larger scale you know the beginning of big belly ships and greater fishing and blah blah blah uh
1358480	1363920	so you could prophesize hey this time is going to come to an end there's going to be a great
1363920	1367920	reckoning the wickedness of our ways is going to have to be reconciled there's going to be a hard
1367920	1374240	fork and either everybody decides we stop this kind of wickedness of our ways we become good
1374240	1379680	stewards of power and as such as good stewards of power we reinstate the garden or something
1379680	1385920	like that or we don't and it goes from purgatory to hell some to an end uh because this thing self
1385920	1398960	terminates i i think those prophecies were pretty straightforward actually like pretty
1398960	1409360	straightforwardly accurate and i do think we are at a time now where until nuclear weapons that
1409360	1414000	couldn't have been you couldn't destroy everything that quickly obviously until industrial scale
1414080	1419680	globalization you couldn't destroy the environment so uh we're really to the first time in the history
1419680	1424560	of the world at this place where the ongoing viability of the world is up to us we couldn't
1424560	1433680	have destroyed it before even when we tried and so it is it is true that it is obligate for us to
1433680	1437520	become good stewards of power because if we continue to steward it the way we have we'll destroy
1437520	1443920	ourselves it is also true that some people doing that not in the presence of other people doing
1443920	1449360	it lose the game of influence if not the game of survival in the very short term to be able to make
1449360	1459040	it through there's a book of romans the path to heaven is narrow and steep the path to hell is
1459040	1465040	wide and many there is something like that there there is basically a needle that has to be thread
1465280	1474080	and that is the uh hope for this time is the ability to properly thread the needle of
1476400	1481760	that which will make us good stewards of power that can also navigate the space of power currently
1481760	1485440	to influence it enough that it on its current trajectory doesn't mess everything up
1489280	1493520	well i think that you know i want to talk a bit more about threading that needle
1493600	1500720	and in particular it's become pretty clear to me in my study of you know when in academia we would
1500720	1506720	call collective action problems or social traps which is what daniel just called the multi-polar
1506720	1514160	trap that situation where you know vying geopolitical entities seek power and that the only way to get
1514160	1519120	around this like i actually came to that realization at some level when i took western political
1519200	1524000	philosophy too and i was reading thomas hobs and hobs you know has that war at all against all and
1524960	1529200	i think that there's a lot of people in this room probably thinking well aren't there cooperative
1529200	1534320	forces not just competitive forces and human history as well as an evolution i think that's a
1534320	1540240	really valid argument maybe we'll come back to that but i want to talk about you know there's two
1540240	1547600	kind of ways to get around a collective action problem and one of them is what hobs refer to
1547600	1551520	as the little viathon which is you get enough power and you impose power and you make it so
1551520	1557520	anyone who would do something that's not good you know that's competitive and trying to do the power
1557520	1565040	gain you shut them down that's way one and the other way is through cooperation and that one's
1565040	1569680	really hard i mean if anyone is you know folks who might have started the eco village or something
1569680	1575280	like that in this talk and even getting just a few people to get along is hard right so we might
1575280	1582400	come back to that but i think that what is really insightful here is that um we have to at some level
1584160	1590480	through conscience through without ever getting you know you know as soon as you start down that road
1590480	1596400	once you start down the dark path right through conscience we gain influence through conscience
1596400	1601200	we have to at some level push in the same way that donby or others would have done you had
1601280	1606720	extraordinary influence but you know he gained that influence not by being a really terrible
1606720	1611760	player on the world stage but by acting in a conscientious way because we're a social species
1611760	1621040	and we respond you know we we have a an immediate response to you know a mirror neuron type response
1621040	1629200	if you're if you are acting a certain way i i feel that in my own self and and so there's a way in
1629200	1637040	which um i just i guess i guess i wanted to talk to that a bit daniel do you see um that sort of
1637040	1646320	path of like uniting conscience with um with uh i hate to call it spirit with strategy but i really
1646320	1652000	you know maybe emphasis on the conscience part and then the strategy part has to be born of that
1652720	1658880	right has to be born from the conscience piece um and then moving from there do you think that
1658880	1666080	there's a pathway to thread that needle through the force of conscience through um prophetic voice
1670960	1677440	now as a kid i was my mom was taking me to a bunch of protests and
1678720	1684480	um you know various nonprofits pita and greenpeace and like that engage in an activism work
1684880	1695360	i remember there was a few NGOs that came together to protest a nuclear waste dump being created
1696560	1704000	and i got to see how the activists were organizing and i got to see how the
1707360	1712160	nuclear and financial and legal entities on the other side were organizing a little bit just
1712160	1718240	watching as a kid and there was this insight that came the the first level of the insight was the
1720880	1728320	the activists are obviously motivated by something that is much less self-interest
1728320	1732640	they're chaining themselves to things where they get hurt um they're willing to go to jail they're
1733360	1738240	but their tools of strategy are chaining themselves to things and picket signs and like that
1738960	1746000	and the tools of strategy on the other side are employing heaps of mathematicians and physicists
1746000	1751920	and chemists and lobbyists and financiers and etc and it's just it's so obvious who's winning
1752560	1758000	and you know like who's going to win and why but also who should right that distinction and i saw it as
1758000	1763440	like a head heart divide at the level of humanity that had to be unified and then i looked a little
1763440	1769840	bit later and thought of it as like a a head heart will um because i could see people where
1771920	1776640	there if any two of the three didn't work right if someone had a lot of will and a lot of
1777200	1781920	heart meaning like there was a lot of care about other beings and the willingness to take a lot of
1781920	1788640	action but they didn't understand strategy well they were most activists if they could think about
1788640	1792960	the complexity of the world well and the perverse incentives of financial motivations the lobbying
1793040	1797200	on the other side etc and they cared a lot but they didn't have a lot of empowerment they were like
1797760	1805440	kind of broken devastated liberal academics um if the heart was kind of shut down and they were
1805440	1810480	mostly pursuing self-interest but they understood strategy and they were pretty empowered with
1810480	1815360	will they were the people who ran the world and ran big oil companies and finance companies and
1815440	1822960	military industrial companies and things like that and um so it was very clear that those coming
1822960	1832160	together was necessary kind of requisite right and it is obvious that the strategy does not actually
1832160	1840960	pick what is valuable it figures out how to do effective work towards what is valuable that
1840960	1850720	comes from deeper places and so uh intellect and strategy in service of conscience is necessary
1850720	1855920	right like there's no uh conscience that doesn't know how to be very effective
1857840	1867360	is kind of a death with dignity strategy um and you know for me seeing that and being like
1867360	1875680	if I work my ass off and all the animals are still in the factory farm I don't feel okay about that
1875680	1883840	I don't feel some self-relief I don't feel proud like I I want to be effective at it and so
1885920	1889600	a lot of people talk about not caring about the result as much but the process because in the
1889600	1894320	when one over focuses on results they can go out of integrity I care about the relationship between
1894320	1904800	the results and the process both right um now if you one other thing though is like let's say you
1904800	1908640	take a look at Gandhi which is you know as good an exemplars you could get of this
1911920	1917520	if you do a realism analysis right the kind of political school of realism coming out of
1917520	1923840	real politic analysis of non-violence movements you get a very different perspective than the
1923840	1930320	story the non-violence movements tell and I think it is a more historically and politically accurate
1930320	1937360	one and it's important to understand if you want to be effective the realist analysis is
1939600	1944240	Gandhi said that what happened with the British and India could have worked against Hitler
1944320	1950720	total gibberish like complete obvious total gibberish um and
1953520	1960320	in the only reason there were a few but the reason why at that particular time in India
1960320	1968720	that was able to work is because as he said early in the career in his career there 20,000 British
1968720	1974800	soldiers cannot rule 400 million Indians if the 400 million Indians don't consent they were already
1974800	1980560	getting to the place of the willingness to have enough of their people die to violently kill all
1980560	1985520	of the 20,000 soldiers there was a violence movement that he was holding at bay with the
1985520	1991040	non-violence which is why they didn't kill him and every non-violence movement that has been
1991040	1996720	effective against very against powers that are willing to enact violence has only been effective
1996720	2001680	when it was the better alternative against violence as the alternative and a very similar
2001680	2008160	thing was that in the assessment that so like if they'd killed Gandhi then the Indians would
2008160	2013920	have started killing British soldiers at scale right the only reason he didn't get killed and
2014560	2020640	so it's just important to understand that the reason that the US went ahead and made some
2020640	2024560	provisions with Martin Luther King was because the power Malcolm X and the Black Panthers were
2024560	2029280	getting a scaring the shit out of them and the idea of move the attention over here to the
2029280	2038640	non-violence thing was like positive so the reason I bring this up is because if you want to look at
2038640	2043920	previous precedents of things that were successful to be able to try to do successful work do your
2043920	2054080	research well enough to say was it actually successful and how did it work so that's really
2054080	2060560	powerful Daniel and I still you know sitting here I have a pretty deep conviction about
2062720	2070480	using moving from a place of conscience to to shift the world in a better way and I think
2070480	2076480	that conscience calls us to strategy I think that if we're really deeply in touch with conscience
2077360	2081120	we do the strategy because we actually don't want to live in a world where what's happening in
2081120	2086160	factory farms is happening in factory farms and we want to live in a world which is beautiful and
2086160	2094080	hopeful I think a one step beyond the three part will art mine the chakras are a lovely system
2094960	2100480	right if you I don't know if people here are familiar with it but the you know the yogic
2100480	2104560	system and the egyptian system the chinese system are pretty similar so whenever there's a bunch of
2104560	2109520	independent origination it's kind of interesting but each of them are different are thought of as
2109520	2119280	different types of intelligence and that a full human approach is all of them and so if you
2121040	2124960	I don't need to go through them here and take the time for it but if you are to think about
2127120	2131520	to it we want to engage not with a part of the world but all of the world but we want to engage
2131520	2138640	with all of the world with all of our self right and all of our self means all of our agency and
2138720	2142800	all of our intellect all of our intuition all of our instinct all of those things in service of
2142800	2151280	all the world so I think there was a talk that I really liked that Eckhart and the Dalai Lama
2151280	2157440	did together one time where Eckhart was saying something about like in his language when you
2157440	2162240	access the power of now you have increased coherence for capabilities at whatever it is that you're
2162240	2167120	going to do and then somebody in the audience asked something about when you access that is
2167120	2170480	it like accessing the Akashic records where you can just get anything and do anything
2171440	2176720	and Eckhart was like I don't have that experience because like a great soccer player
2178400	2181680	who gets quiet and goes into a place of stillness comes out and does the
2183840	2188480	the free kick better than he would have otherwise but he's like if I went to do that I still wouldn't
2188480	2193120	make the goal as Eckhart right he's like I don't I don't do that thing well when Einstein would go
2193120	2198000	into silence he'd come out with math but Eckhart was like I never get math like I never get
2198000	2201600	general relativity coming out of there and he asked the Dalai Lama he's like no I don't ever
2201600	2206960	get general relativity because I didn't take that in and the same reason that when someone goes
2206960	2211760	deeply into prayer they usually get answers in languages they speak they usually don't get them
2211760	2216240	in Sanskrit or Mandarin or some language they don't speak so there's a place where listening
2216240	2220720	to conscience it can only tell you things that you have also cultivated your being to understand
2220720	2228800	so this is where the the models of what does it take to be effective such that you develop those
2228800	2235200	in yourself such that as you're going into prayer and going into listening those languages exist
2235200	2243760	within you to be spoken to is also important yeah well I feel like we've gone really deep
2243760	2249760	and I think that I can imagine folks in the audience right now being like that is a harsh
2249760	2258720	view of human history or of what we're what we're up against I suppose and the strategies that might
2258720	2269280	work or approaches that might work and I mean I feel like I want to sort of finish out by
2270080	2276720	sort of entering some of that stillness together and wondering if there's in particular a message to
2276720	2282480	the QEW community to Quakers that you feel you know you were just mentioning you know like
2283120	2288880	Einstein comes out with this what is the unique role of faith communities in this time
2289600	2297280	and and what would what is the earnestness I don't know how many people here saw
2297360	2302400	when this pope got put in place and he wrote the Lodato si encyclical
2304080	2308800	if you saw it awesome if not it's really worth reading it's actually very beautiful and
2310320	2317120	basically what he said was and I'm grossly paraphrasing there's been this kind of
2318400	2324560	forever conversation or debate about is God transcendent beyond the creation or eminent
2324560	2333360	indwelling within the creation I would say that the error in the direction of an overemphasis on
2333360	2339840	transcendent over eminent has caused a lot of problems because we can destroy things here in a
2339840	2345920	holy war for going to heaven or for good reincarnation or for getting off the wheel or whatever it is
2345920	2354240	that makes that denies some of the sacredness of here and if you hold the creator indwells
2354240	2365840	within its creation and any harm against creation is sin against the creator uh there's a much safer
2365840	2371600	ethics that emerges so if you take the direction of eminence and basically what he said in the
2371600	2378160	Lodato si is the eminence matters and that if you aren't an environmentalist protecting God's creation
2378160	2384320	you aren't a Catholic now of course that was a fucking big deal to say like a God created all
2384320	2391280	of this thing this is all sacred if you are harming God's creation you're in sin that doesn't mean
2391280	2396400	that really changed anything because like so often would happen in something like Catholicism it's
2396400	2400800	kind of like easy to moralize people while not actually changing the things that dispose their
2400800	2409600	beliefs and behaviors and so what I would love to see follow is a okay what would it take then
2410240	2418000	the Vatican to leverage its resources to say how do we help people deepen their understanding
2418000	2422800	of nature their connection to it and change the perverse incentives that force you know
2422800	2428320	environmental harm and things like that that'd be amazing I think all the faith communities have
2428320	2435680	beliefs that could be emphasized you know like there are some Christians who focus on the wrath
2435680	2440240	of the Leviticus God and the reasons to kill someone for violating the Sabbath or who focus
2440240	2443760	on the forgiveness of Jesus and let he who has no sins cast the first stone you can kind of
2443760	2451440	emphasize different aspects of it I think most of the faiths have things that if they were emphasized
2451520	2460880	would be profoundly relevant to the situation today and when it comes to Quakers
2464560	2468320	I don't I don't know I would need to ask a lot of questions and spend some time
2468320	2472720	and to be very interested in but the you know there's like the starting place is
2478400	2478640	if
2482400	2489280	total global Quakers is a few hundred thousand right yeah probably yeah and
2489680	2498400	so if we were to say that well that's a small population in one way it's a lot of people
2499120	2505200	like a lot of people that have a some shared sense of what is meaningful sacred etc that
2505200	2509840	they're willing to obviously live their lives differently based on make some sacrifices based on
2511040	2516240	if they could come to understand the state of the world more rather than just kind of local issues
2516800	2522960	understand you know the metacrisis the drivers and what addressing that would take and have
2525040	2534160	their life as a group not just individually be coordinated in service of helping the world move
2534720	2539040	through this point in history
2539760	2546560	not to the direction of self-destruction or totalizing dystopias but in the direction of
2547280	2552960	you know something like reinstatement of a garden what would it mean for that to actually become
2552960	2558480	the timely imperative of Quakers as a whole that they could coordinate towards that'd be very interesting
2559520	2567120	yeah well I think it's actually we're almost perfectly on track I want to kind of transition at the 45-minute mark
2567840	2574000	since our opening worship to bring in some questions from the audience and do you want to ask your question
2575840	2586080	yeah um yeah so in humanity's phase shift which is what Keith the video that a lot of us watched before
2588080	2594960	coming to hear you today Daniel um you said that reconditioning our felt sense of
2595520	2602960	interconnectedness with everything um won't won't be easy and will require a fundamental shift of our consciousness
2604400	2610800	um and I thought that the ways you the three things that you offered as ways to reconnect were
2612000	2618720	we're humorous and I wanted to ask how that has changed but the three things you offered were
2618960	2624960	to be in nature, do psychedelics and have more intimate relationships with more people
2626400	2632800	and so how have your modes of reconnection changed in the last five years since that conversation in that video?
2636640	2645760	first I'll say um there's a woman named Vanessa Andreade she wrote a beautiful book called
2646080	2652880	Hospicing Modernity and I got to speak with recently um indigenous woman who's actually a
2653520	2658800	leading some amazing educational projects in Canada and we just talked and she told me that the way that her
2659600	2666720	chief defines colonialism and I thought this was very beautiful uh had nothing to do with taking other people's land or
2667760	2673760	violence or property ownership or whatever that those were all epiphenomenon that the heart of colonialism
2674000	2678000	is believing there are separable things
2680800	2686960	and deeper than believing that is perceiving the world as separable things the pattern of perception cultivated
2688880	2690880	and
2691760	2693760	that
2693840	2695840	that conditioning of mind
2698320	2700560	I don't think can avoid
2700880	2706400	creating more separation more externalities more rivalry in the process of everything it does
2707440	2712400	intrinsic to the nature of how it perceives and as a result in how it sense makes and what it does
2713200	2715200	so
2715200	2719760	and that's not intrinsic to the nature of mind it's intrinsic to the way that
2720880	2723280	most modern civilizations have cultivated mind
2724880	2729360	and so uh cultivating and
2730320	2731680	you know
2731680	2737360	David Bohm and Krishna Murthy and so many said something almost identical about what the root of all the problems is
2738800	2740480	so
2740480	2742480	at the basis having a
2743200	2745200	perception
2745920	2750720	where you don't see things as separate things that you label in words with a
2751280	2753280	packet of information
2753280	2755280	that is fairly static about what that thing is
2756080	2758080	you um
2758160	2762160	you have unmediated contact with reality not mediated through words and concepts
2762960	2768400	that increases the depth of your sensing because your sense making can't be better than your sensing is and most of the time
2768400	2775200	we were perceiving so shallowly so little of the total bandwidth of the thing and then our sense making is almost all based on abstractions
2776320	2782960	and the abstraction that the the world of our ideas of what a tree is and what everything is is not the world it's a simulation
2782960	2787920	and so we live in that simulation on the world so the ability to have much
2788480	2792160	deeper sensing that is not mediated through word and concept
2794400	2800080	where the interconnectedness of everything is intrinsic and the uniqueness of everything is intrinsic both
2801920	2803360	uh
2803360	2808640	I would say it's only from there all you know what you're calling conscience internally
2809600	2811200	in a
2811200	2812960	reality
2812960	2814960	that is
2815760	2817760	where there's no separation
2817760	2823360	there's no separability I can say i'm a separate thing but take plants away and I don't exist take the gravitational field away
2823360	2829040	I don't exist take the sun away I don't exist so the concept of me as a separable thing is nonsense because it depends
2829600	2832000	I depend on a lot of things that are outside of the definition of me
2834480	2837360	in that inseparable nature of reality
2837920	2841280	listening within and listening without are both kind of the same
2842400	2845920	I mean they're both valuable they're they have different qualities so
2848240	2850240	meditating and listen and
2850960	2852960	being still and listening internally
2853600	2856640	in different ways to the sensations in my body to the emotions
2857200	2858400	to
2858400	2860400	subtle intuition
2860400	2862400	is all very important
2862480	2864480	really deeply witnessing
2864720	2869920	nature and really deeply witnessing people and listening is just as important as another kind of prayer
2875360	2882880	So I I find conscience and spirit distributed everywhere right because there's nothing in which spirit is not indwelling
2886080	2888080	so
2888480	2890480	that mode of perception
2890480	2894640	the interconnectedness the uniqueness of everything and really being with the
2895600	2897600	instantiated details fully
2898160	2905040	is the only mode of mind from which strategies about how to make things better are rightly grounded I feel
2908400	2913840	How do you cultivate that I mean I think we could raise children in a way where that was the default state
2914160	2916720	We don't but I think that's a possible thing
2918160	2920160	for
2920800	2922400	people who
2922400	2926480	Have already been conditioned to see everything as separate things and are having to recondition that
2928560	2930560	Yeah, I think
2930560	2934960	time not just in nature but in wilderness particularly if you can get an old growth
2936240	2943520	Right where you can because a young forest does not have the complexity that's been clear cut and regrown with a few species of tree
2944000	2947600	Does not have the complexity of an old growth forest doesn't do the same thing if you can get
2948160	2951120	deep into wilderness and spend enough time there and enough silence
2952240	2953440	um
2953440	2958000	A tremendous amount of transformation in your mind and being starts to happen
2959360	2961920	And a tremendous amount of understanding about things so I think
2962880	2964880	That's about as good as anything
2965520	2967520	um
2968000	2970000	I think you know when I said psychedelics
2970960	2976560	There are lots of experiences that can induce states that change the nature of perception through
2977520	2981520	fasting through vision quests through sweat lodges through, you know
2982960	2985360	Medicines are one of them, but uh
2987840	2995120	Inducing states in which your perception of reality is experientially very different can help people realize more in a more embodied way
2995120	2996960	How limited their
2996960	2998960	perceptional space usually it's
2999920	3002640	And the thing that I had said then about relationships
3005520	3007520	Yeah, I think really
3007520	3009520	uh
3009520	3011520	deeply loving more
3012240	3014240	beings really helps
3014320	3020480	And in really deeply loving them seeking to understand them and imagine what it's like to be them and realize that you don't know
3020480	3023520	But really try to try to feel what it's like to be other beings
3024240	3025920	um
3025920	3029760	Your own ego can't actually imagine what it's like to be other beings
3030960	3035920	Because it's its own set of things like to really take on what it's like to be them
3038000	3043840	The part of me that the the aspect of me that can do that is not my identity. It's something deeper than identity
3045600	3047600	and um
3049200	3053360	And the pattern of putting myself at the center all the time
3054320	3056720	Is very transcended in that process
3059360	3061360	There's a bunch of other things for this a few
3067920	3070880	Um, so the next question we have is from hogan williams
3073360	3078000	So i'm someone who's deeply concerned about the sense-making crisis aspect of all of this
3078560	3086640	Addressing sense-making seems to call for humility listening and slow process
3088560	3090560	Yet addressing existential risk
3091280	3093280	seems to call for boldness
3094160	3095680	prophetic speech
3095680	3097040	and action
3097040	3099040	over contemplation
3099040	3103120	At least that would be one way to slice it. You may deconstruct that
3103680	3107040	It seems that if we have one without the other we are likely lost
3108000	3111120	Yet they seem so different as to be working at cross purposes
3112400	3116000	Can you speak to this tension between contemplation and boldness?
3116800	3121120	These divergent approaches and how might wisely weave them?
3122320	3124320	Yeah, totally. Um
3125760	3127760	Everybody's familiar with the dunning kruger curve
3130000	3132880	Uh this idea and sociology i'll explain it that
3133760	3136160	When someone doesn't know anything about a field
3136640	3142560	They can actually have a lot of unearned confidence in their ideas about the space because they're not aware of how much stuff
3142560	3144000	they don't know
3144000	3145040	and
3145040	3149040	Then as they start to study the field they their confidence drops radically because
3149920	3154320	All the things that were in the unknown unknown for them move into the known unknown. They're like shit. There's so much stuff
3154320	3156320	I don't know and so
3157760	3160240	It is common that people who have
3161120	3165120	Much less depth of thought have more confidence on a topic and people have more confidence
3165120	3168800	Understand how complex the thing is the idea of the dunning kruger curve as you start here
3169600	3173840	And then as you gain more knowledge you drop and then you slowly kind of come back up as you gain expertise
3175040	3177040	what I find
3177760	3179760	is
3179760	3180720	in
3180720	3187120	Trying to not study a specialty where I can eventually know most of the field I got my phd and it whatever but
3187440	3192720	In trying to study the nature of reality and trying to study how to make a big difference in the world
3194800	3196800	My uh
3196880	3199600	Sense of how much I know just keeps dropping forever the more I
3200800	3208720	The more I learn the more things i'm aware really matter that I don't know continuously so um
3210800	3216480	Uh, I don't I don't think you ever end up getting something like a similar type of confidence
3217840	3220080	I think what you get is a place where
3221360	3227360	You understand a topic well enough to know that your best ideas might not only be wrong but even harmful
3228640	3235040	And yet you're pretty clear that your assessment is factoring more things than the other assessments that are currently running the world
3236160	3242240	And so there's an obligation to start to act but not with confidence more with like
3243120	3245120	a
3247120	3249120	Sacred obligation that
3251840	3253840	Feels
3257040	3262560	It doesn't feel like egoic a empowered agency. Fuck I got this. I know what to do. I'm gonna go solve this thing
3262560	3266800	I'm gonna crusade doesn't feel like that. It feels like really fucking scared to fuck stuff up
3268320	3271280	And really continuously listening
3272720	3274720	um and
3278880	3280720	So
3280720	3284800	That's my sense is that if you are trying to address nuclear risk
3286480	3291840	Or ai risk or whatever and you proceed confidently you'll almost certainly make it worse
3292880	3294880	Which is almost always the case
3294880	3299280	So you want if you don't have good sense making about the cause of the issues and how
3300240	3302240	The nature of what you I mean
3302800	3304160	Classically
3304160	3309040	It's not just you can optimize for a project and end up externalizing harmels or what happens all the time
3309040	3312240	It's things like you create a movement the movement becomes very effective
3312240	3315200	But it appeals to some people and actually anti appeals to other people
3316000	3318660	So you drive the counter movement. It's called schismogenesis
3320000	3322000	and so
3322560	3323760	Uh
3323760	3327760	Has the like racial justice movement enlightened everybody
3328320	3330320	No, the anti woke
3330480	3335200	culture actually emerged as a counter response to the nature of how kind of
3336000	3338000	woke social justice moved forward
3338320	3339360	and
3339360	3342400	Every time the way that reparations were talked about
3343120	3349520	Uh was expressed that did not do good sense making about how that would appeal to everybody a lot more people joined the far
3349520	3351520	Are alt right and things like that so
3352160	3353360	um
3353360	3355360	if you
3355440	3359520	Want to actually make things better in the death hing it says uh
3361280	3365920	The master navigates the world as careful as one walking on black ice
3369200	3372240	And what I like about that so much is if you're walking on black ice
3373600	3379520	You don't have to want to split your head open just the the tiniest lapse of awareness and you can split your head open
3379760	3385920	And so recognizing that navigating the world is like walking on black ice, especially if you try to do things at scale
3387280	3391280	But it also doesn't say the master stays at home because there's black ice. He's navigating the world
3394000	3399120	But it is full and it's not full of fearfulness. It's full of carefulness the depth of care
3404800	3406800	Yes
3406960	3414160	Yeah, so I think we've got one last one from the folks who wrote any questions and then we've got um
3414880	3420240	Uh all I think seven six hands raised hands raised so hopefully we can get to everybody. Um
3421040	3426800	I want to turn finally to Pamela Haynes Pamela. Do you want to unmute and ask your question?
3428000	3433920	Sure. Yeah, thank you. I think that some of my question got answered by your response to mich and
3434640	3436160	um
3436160	3441840	Keith's suggestion that people speak that you speak to hope in response to everything. I'll just leave that part of it out
3442320	3445520	So my question is really simple and it's what do you love?
3460400	3462880	And I can't answer that very well
3464080	3466080	um
3467440	3470400	Because it because it is definitely beyond words
3474480	3476480	I I love reality
3478080	3480880	And all of the unique expressions
3480880	3482880	Um
3487760	3492000	If you like if you were to ask what motivates
3493840	3497920	My work like what I'm working for I'm not working for the end of
3499840	3504560	AI arms races or nuclear races or to get the chemicals out of the ocean or like
3505280	3508160	I mean, yes, those are specific things, but um
3511120	3513120	I
3518720	3520720	I close my eyes I meditate and I
3521760	3523440	see
3523440	3524560	kids
3524560	3526560	playing in the future
3526560	3531600	I see them and I see through their eyes and I see them learning to climb a tree for the first time and loving trees
3531600	3535360	I see them falling in love for the first time. I see them doing aw at sunsets
3535440	3540160	I see the mom falling in love with them. I see them learning to communicate with animals
3541360	3546000	And just that that gets to continue is what I love and I'm in service to
3547360	3550160	All the rest is complicated strategy in service to that
3552480	3554880	And for the non-human world as much as the human world
3559200	3561200	Daniel film
3562800	3564800	Daniel brilliant presentation
3564960	3571200	I'm a scholar of the relationship between the sciences and the world's religious and spiritual traditions
3572000	3577280	From that perspective, it struck me. It's really interesting the the pattern or the formal analysis of your presentation
3577600	3580720	Which is you gave us the facts the situations the background
3581280	3586320	You gave us the the practices that people engage in psychedelics meditation and so forth
3586800	3589360	You brought those two right next to each other
3590240	3597040	Keith and I and many people on this call engage in a kind of reflection right there at that meeting point of the two
3597600	3603280	You engage in almost no reflection at that particular point. You spoke of actions
3604000	3605600	and facts
3605600	3607600	wishes visions
3607600	3610080	But surely there's a kind of reflection
3610720	3612720	That is right at that intersection
3612960	3615680	I have the intuition that you'd be able to help us
3616240	3622320	If you sort of open up the doors to that particular room, I'm interested to see how you respond to that invitation
3623600	3626800	Yeah, you mean specifically at the intersection of something like
3627520	3629920	the sciences and spirituality
3630880	3634080	Right, which is a kind of self-involving intersection
3634320	3639760	You often answer like a religious studies scholar, which is what my tribe does and describes externally
3640320	3642160	powerful internal experiences
3642160	3648320	But there's a kind of internally driven reflection that stems from the motivation or the psychedelic experiences
3648640	3652320	And you're surprisingly silent at that that intersection point
3657200	3663760	The um when I when I was growing up I was um homeschooled and I
3665360	3666880	studied
3666880	3668880	I had a
3668880	3672080	Got to make my own curriculum didn't have a fixed curriculum and
3673920	3680160	The kind of braid of topics of interest was all the sciences all of the kind of spiritual mystical traditions
3680720	3682720	and philosophic traditions
3682800	3684800	and um
3685040	3688240	And then also the kind of all the domains of uh activism
3688800	3692240	And they all felt like the exact same thing to me. I had the same
3693200	3694800	And
3694800	3698000	And particularly because at that time growing up in the 80s
3698640	3706080	And what just a fortune of getting exposed to like my exposure to science was first fritchoff capra and david boom and
3706480	3712160	Like the whole idea that something at the nature of ecology and complexity science and quantum mechanics would reveal the perennial
3712160	3714240	truths of the spiritual traditions and things like that
3714320	3720160	So I didn't get science as kind of reductionist atheism first. I got the critique of that first
3720960	3722960	and um
3724320	3726320	There's a
3726480	3728960	Paper I wrote maybe Keith will share it with people called
3730320	3732560	The dance of the dow and the 10,000 things
3733600	3735600	and because you know
3736720	3738960	The dow that is nameable is not the eternal dow
3739680	3743760	Naming is the beginning of the 10,000 things typically we take it that then
3746640	3749520	Engagement with the 10,000 things deadens us to the dow
3751120	3754720	But it doesn't have to it can do the exact opposite right it can actually
3758240	3764160	Deep in the nature of the appreciation of the dow that's what I meant by the dance between them and uh
3765120	3766320	so
3766320	3770320	one of the areas that I really got into was uh limits of no ability
3771200	3775600	and whether it was kind of girdle and mathematics or the incompleteness theorem or
3776400	3779040	uh tarski with the limits of formal logic or
3779760	3780560	um
3780560	3783040	Heisenberg bell, you know on and on there's these kind of
3783840	3790000	Pearson semiotics the upper bounds of no ability are ways that logic can transcend itself because it can identify
3790880	3794640	its formal upper boundaries and then identify how much of reality is outside of it
3795600	3800720	And then there's the question. Well, what is the right epistemology for that then? What is the right way to relate to it?
3801360	3806160	Um, so there's like these are some of my favorite topics. There's a lot I could say there
3806720	3810160	I'm not sure exactly which part of the inquiry is um,
3812240	3815440	Most interesting and live for you, but it would be a fun conversation
3816480	3821440	At some point I look forward to that there is a way to speak at precisely that intersection point
3821440	3826400	Which is not just silence and many of the hundred people on this call are practiced in that
3826720	3829840	I would love to in in explore that openness
3830400	3833600	To a form of discourse that was surprisingly silent
3834240	3836880	Over the last hour. Thanks again for your talk
3841840	3848800	Yeah, well, that's really lovely film. I really love that invitation. Um, and I hope that connection happens
3849440	3850720	um
3850720	3856560	Stan I got Stan's message and I don't know if Stan's here, but he wrote it to me in the chat
3856640	3863520	So I'm going to go ahead and just read it out. Um, we have you mentioned population collapse and tainter's analysis
3864080	3868320	Four or five groups of ecologists have estimated that the world can only sustain
3868880	3874800	Sustainably support three or four billion people at a reasonable standard living i.e. the european standard
3875200	3878880	Given we are at eight billion now. This is not a small problem
3879600	3884880	Given this what is your prognosis on collapse or not in the years and decades ahead?
3893920	3900080	Um prognosis on collapse includes population as one factor but lots of other factors
3901280	3903280	um
3906000	3908560	The topic of caring capacity is a very tricky topic
3909280	3911840	It's very tricky for like so many reasons
3912720	3916080	Caring capacity meaning how many people can the earth sustainably?
3916720	3918720	uh support
3918800	3920080	um
3920080	3923520	The answer that comes up most commonly is like two three billion
3923760	3926560	but uh the numbers vary from
3928960	3933440	500 000 to tens of billions depending upon how people do the analysis
3934000	3935520	um
3935520	3938480	Obviously before the industrial revolution
3939120	3944480	I mean 500 million excuse me before the industrial revolution the population of the planet was 500 million and then
3944960	3946960	It went from 500 million to
3947440	3952080	8 billion almost overnight right to 200 years with the haverbosch and such
3952880	3960000	But as it did that as it's 16 that 16 x would have taken over 200 000 years to get in 200 years
3961040	3966800	It also increased the resource consumption per capita by about 100 x in the developed world
3968400	3973840	So that's obviously a 1600 x increase in um resource consumption
3974800	3976400	How you define it though is
3976400	3982000	What is the most number of people you can possibly fit on the planet without collapsing the biosphere versus what provides
3982080	3984400	the highest quality of life for all life including non-humans
3985680	3987680	um
3988800	3994560	Mediated through what kind of technologies gets into deep cultural questions of what a desirable good life looks like
3995840	3997840	um
3999280	4001280	And the enactment pathway of getting there
4001840	4007920	Is super tricky because the conversations almost always turn into eugenics and war and like pretty pretty difficult stuff
4008640	4010640	um and
4012160	4014160	If you look at the work of like
4017840	4019840	Um
4019840	4021840	I'm forgetting his name right now. It'll come to me in a minute
4023520	4025520	But you know elan has talked about this
4025600	4034000	Uh popularly a lot recently which is that um the topic of demographic collapse that the decreasing birth rates in china in particular
4034000	4036000	but all around the world
4036000	4036800	are
4036800	4044960	Going to destroy civilization as we know it not the biosphere because a smaller percentage of young people entering the workforce military force, etc
4045040	4046800	and a lot of old
4046800	4048160	people
4048160	4050320	Is not how civilization is designed to function
4051120	4053200	um and so
4053200	4058000	And that's obviously because we built a civilizational system that is incommensurable the biosphere
4058000	4064880	So the ongoing needs that it has for maintenance like growing gdp and growing population upon which it was predicated don't work with the biosphere so
4065520	4066720	um
4066960	4072960	Is population a topic that we have to figure out? Yes, it's a it's a it's a very tricky one
4072960	4076160	So I don't like to try to say much definitive about it quickly
4078720	4081200	When china tried to control its population growth
4082480	4085360	To the one child policy or when india tried to control it
4086240	4088560	Some of the unintended side effects were things like
4089200	4091200	over a hundred million too many men
4091680	4096640	Because they emphasize male children and now you have literally over a hundred million
4097280	4102160	more men than women that can't mate that are destabilizing civilization and so like
4103520	4104480	the
4104480	4110000	You always have the what is the ideal in state you have whose ideal which cultural
4110960	4112240	ethical
4112240	4114800	models and then you have the enactment to get there
4115840	4120080	And well, you know, there's a bunch of libertarian thought that is gibberish one of the libertarian
4120880	4124480	Questions that is often useful is, you know, think about your utopia
4125360	4126560	In the future
4126560	4132880	Think about all the people that don't want it right now that would violently resist it because of their different religious ideas or economic interests or whatever
4132880	4137760	And think about how much violence you would have to enact to force your utopia on them and ask if it's still utopia
4139120	4142640	And so the considerations about enactment are very real
4143120	4145120	I
4146880	4150880	Know, um, Stan pretty well. I'm sure Stan's got a lot to say particularly
4151920	4153920	on that topic of
4154480	4159200	There's a there's a qe w pamphlet critiquing. He's a you know, a demographer
4160160	4162160	beginning the which college but
4162720	4169520	Uh, critiquing the the elan analysis. So I'm sure he might want to share at with you afterwards, but I would love I would love to see that analysis
4169520	4171760	I think it desperately needs critiqued
4178240	4179600	Yeah
4179600	4181600	Oh, yeah
4181600	4189360	Great great job on the geopolitical understanding. Um, I'm really impressed with the depth of your knowledge and the realism of your perspective
4190000	4197440	I've been following Peter Zion and many other geopolitical thinkers sure many was the one I was about to mention who has been popularizing the demographic collapse
4197440	4202560	So thanks for mentioning it. That was the name I was forgetting. Yep, and I'm well aware of the mit study of
4203360	4206400	You know, very they tracked I forgot like six major
4207120	4210000	Measures and how they would change over the next century
4210800	4216720	Um, I I was exposed to this at university of colorado boulder while studying geology and economics
4217680	4220480	in geology is kind of a hotbed of
4221200	4226800	The counter perspective on a lot of these things because uh, we know the paleo climate very well. We know
4227600	4231840	My professors have been unerringly accurate about predicting how the climate is going to change
4233440	4239680	Which goes to say, um, the climate is a lot bigger problem. It's going to cause big migrations all over the place
4239760	4241760	It's going to change the rules all over the place
4242720	4248720	Um, the scientific humidity is just not up to the task of conveying news of that magnitude
4249600	4253440	Especially when the rate of change is faster than a peer review process will allow
4254400	4258240	So if you passed over the peer review process about five years ago
4259600	4265120	My question though has to do with the longevity and retirement aspects
4266240	4267680	because
4267680	4269680	We live a lot longer
4269920	4278560	And I remember a discussion at the university of colorado 42 years ago where they talk about how that would fragment our society
4279680	4280960	um
4280960	4282240	and
4282320	4286640	It kind of creates this dynamic to say the emphasis is really going to be on
4287280	4289280	the government to take charge and
4290320	4292320	Clear a path for the future
4292320	4296800	There's kind of limits to what you can do as far as social involvement. Could you speak to that?
4299600	4307600	How we economically support an increasing growth, uh, elderly population. Is that the main question?
4307840	4309840	Well, it's that
4311120	4318080	That there's genetically engineered, uh, pig organs that stands to increase life expectancy another decade or two
4318640	4323520	Um, you know stem cell inserts is all this technology to say we're going to live increasingly into our hundreds
4325200	4332880	Roughly some 80 percent of the federal budget is now devoted to retirement in some way or another saving for retirement or retirement itself
4333520	4340720	And so you're you're you're kind of say if we're going to have a massive social limit to change society
4341760	4348560	You're at some point going to run head-on into the cost of return the fact that we live longer. Yeah
4349760	4351440	um
4351440	4355840	Just having a conversation right before this, um the colleague about the
4356960	4360160	uh collapsing pensions and
4363200	4365200	Again realist analysis
4366080	4368080	everybody
4368080	4370080	who studies this knows that the
4370960	4375120	growing debt to gdp ratio is not there's no path to fix it
4375920	4377920	and the
4378080	4380400	growing not just debt but deficit spending
4381360	4382480	um
4382480	4388480	Also hitting diminishing returns on so many areas of industry because of planetary boundaries coming up climate change and others
4389120	4392400	means, uh, the imminent break of the economic system as we know it
4393440	4394320	um
4394320	4402800	When you mentioned climate and the climate predictions, obviously you look at like the jim Hansen recently said tin celsius is now the most likely scenario
4403760	4404960	um
4404960	4406960	and you look at the
4407280	4408800	uh
4408800	4413760	You know fact that the climate sensitivity numbers and some of the best models have went way up and are
4414480	4416480	like actually being
4416640	4419600	underreported because not wanting to sound alarmist
4420320	4422720	but even the un predictions are
4423760	4425760	billion climate refugees in the next 10 years
4426720	4428720	and when you look at where they come from
4430240	4432480	if you look at the Himalayan watershed and
4433520	4436720	You know India with over a billion people china with over a billion people in pakistan
4436800	4441600	and then the islamic world backing it with over a billion people on a dwindling water supply where a lot of those
4441680	4449120	100 million person plus climate migrations will occur all of which are nuclear equipped with massive geopolitical tensions. It's not just like
4450800	4456000	Some people die from that. It's like disruption of the entire world system. Um
4457040	4459040	so I think
4459920	4464880	I think that we don't continue to see business as usual, uh into the
4465920	4467440	uh
4467440	4469440	decade ahead
4469440	4471680	in retirement as a part of that
4475200	4480800	Yeah, I would just add um north america has a radically different fate than asia
4482000	4488400	and um north america we don't have these existential problems and we've got oceans to protect us
4489520	4492880	I mean there's a limited amount of threat you can convey over an ocean
4494560	4498480	So I want to jump in I just want to make sure that we have um some time
4500000	4505040	for uh, in particular, I noticed we've had an all men audience uh or question
4505760	4512000	Asking for so far. So I know we have uh two men and two women left and I want to give precedence to the
4512560	4514560	To jenny and shelly
4514560	4520400	So jenny if you would like to ask your question now and then um, we can spin back around
4523040	4528880	Is um, I it's not particularly a woman's question, but nevertheless I will
4529520	4531520	I wanted to try to bring us back
4532320	4534320	to the question that
4535760	4539360	I'm actually finding it very difficult to articulate so please forgive me
4540240	4541600	um
4541600	4547200	The the question of love at the root of of our response to this crisis
4548400	4549840	and you
4549840	4555280	So a couple of things one is that I I think that what you were saying earlier daniel
4556000	4557360	about
4557360	4560640	One of the one of the primary things that's gone
4561440	4564720	Gone wrong and I'm a scientist and I've been trying to deal with
4565440	4572720	the integration of science and spirituality and and technology and economics and the whole thing for many many years so
4573520	4579280	trying to see the roots of these things is is is um leads you to a place where
4580080	4586560	You're you're faced with uncertainty and radical humility. So let's start there, but the sense of separation
4587600	4589600	to me is
4589760	4591760	allied to
4591840	4594480	a corresponding faith in our
4595120	4602080	In justifying justifying our actions, which which um, I I don't really explain that at the moment, but
4603920	4612480	We are we have a moral ground for our being that co exists with our egotistical power sense and our
4613200	4614080	um
4614080	4620080	Our ability to justify what we're doing in terms of violence and so on so I wanted to
4620640	4622880	ask you about how you see
4623920	4631360	Love as as a guiding principle for how we can act in this complex world that we're now living in
4631920	4632960	because
4632960	4636080	When we talk about our faith tradition as quakers
4636480	4640400	We're often looking towards our conscience our spirit
4640880	4644960	And that spirit is also the the the ground of love
4645440	4648400	for life truth that the truth of our unity
4648960	4656240	And the and that which guides us into doing action whether or not we really can be certain of the outcome
4656880	4659760	Does that make some sort of sense? Yeah, totally
4661200	4663200	um
4664080	4668240	I don't think we can ever be certain of the outcome right
4672640	4678640	I I don't think that we shouldn't try to engage in
4680320	4684640	Uh, you just went away to look at you while you were talking
4687200	4691760	I guess not so I'm here. There you are. Okay. Um
4693600	4695600	I
4696160	4697760	Think that
4697760	4699760	consequentialist ethics have a role
4700480	4706240	Where you think through what will provide the greatest good for the greatest many and you try to think through the causal dynamics of it
4708800	4713680	But uh consequentialist ethics on their own ends up generally making people evil
4714640	4718960	Because you pretend that you have more certainty about the future state than you possibly can
4719360	4724880	You identify certain bad things that are inevitable which justifies why you have to do some other bad things because they're less bad
4726080	4730160	And so the basis of that is actually the excessive
4730960	4735200	certainty that isn't epistemically warranted, which is why the epistemic humility is so important
4736160	4741040	So there is a there's a kind of virtue ethic, which is I don't know how the future is going to unfold
4741040	4743200	There's unpredictable complexity everywhere
4743600	4749120	But I know that the choices that have the most integrity in the moment put out the kind of ripples that will ripple well
4749600	4752400	Right, so that's kind of a virtue ethic
4753120	4758000	There's kind of a utilitarian ethic that tries to think through what is a viable in-state here
4758080	4762880	What is a viable or at least new homeodynamic state and can I reverse engineer steps? They're both important
4763600	4765600	right
4767200	4772800	And then there's something that is kind of deeper than either of those even deeper than the virtue ethic which is
4773920	4775120	uh
4775120	4781200	Something like the feeling guidance that comes from deep enough prayer
4783520	4786960	And again, that's all the aspects of self being involved
4792000	4794000	As far as love at the basis
4797360	4802000	I think if anyone really explores why they are motivated to do something
4804160	4807280	There's it's not purely a rational thing
4808000	4814000	Because a purely rational thing doesn't actually have motive. It doesn't care, right? Like there are some basis for care
4814640	4818320	Otherwise it'd be like well, if this doesn't happen then this thing will be harmed
4818320	4821760	But if I don't care about that thing being harmed who cares, right? So like
4822800	4824800	in a purely rationalist
4825840	4828240	Ontology then I'm being nihilistic
4829040	4832720	So I want to change this because this is horrifying
4833200	4838480	Because I'm fucking pissed that they're doing this because I'm heartbroken over here. Well, but any of those emotions
4838960	4844960	I'm heartbroken because there is some these kids lives in Gaza these animals in the factory farm
4846480	4849760	Are beautiful they're sacred which is why I care
4849840	4855680	So underneath the heartbreak and underneath the anger and underneath the depression and the devastation underneath all of the sense of
4855680	4859360	Injustice is actually love because if I didn't find some reality
4860160	4861600	beautiful
4861600	4864640	That I loved there would be no basis for the other emotions
4865440	4871280	So that the idea that all of the other emotions are actually responses to love to care
4872240	4877280	Then you recognize the anger the sadness the depression the anxiety are all actually sacred
4877280	4883760	They all have a place but they're not at the source. So you embrace them and then you trace them back to where they come from
4884640	4889520	When you trace them back to where they come from rather than being angry at who the bad guy is what I love becomes clear
4890240	4891920	and then
4891920	4895040	That is actually an even deeper motive and then how
4895840	4900000	Do I be effective in service of what I love is a clearer focus?
4900480	4905680	So it's just the deep reflection on what the motivation is and tracing it back to the source
4906480	4908080	right and I
4908080	4910640	I agree and I think it's also that
4911520	4915280	You know love love is one of the most misunderstood words and most
4915840	4918960	Misunderstood concepts. It's overused and underused all the time
4919680	4926800	But it's also to me the great attractor what I call the great attractor. So it actually applies to science as well
4926960	4931680	It's not it's not a it's not a there's not a place where love doesn't exist
4932160	4938640	In this whole concept, you know, and it can it can be the root of guiding very very practical action
4938720	4945920	It doesn't have to be something that oh, this is just a feeling state or this is just the way quakers talk or something like that
4946400	4952000	It's actually the concept of oh total unity. It's a unified consciousness. If you like
4952880	4954880	Yes
4956560	4963600	Reminds me of the harmony of the spheres and you know, uh, Daniel has a beautiful talk on emergence that um, if you
4964320	4969440	Want to look that up on youtube at some point. Daniel talks about something very similar to what you just said, jenny
4971040	4974560	But um, shelly, I would like to invite you to ask your question
4975680	4980000	Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity
4980720	4982720	Daniel, I really um
4983200	4990000	I learned from I want to take us back to some of the things you said at the beginning your analysis of the different
4990800	4993840	Factors you you mentioned three different factors that
4994560	4996240	motivate
4996240	4998400	individuals and society to and
4999280	5004240	And determine whether we're effective or not and and as I understood it one of them was
5004800	5012960	Understanding how the world works and the other has the second has to do with your ethics or whether you care about
5014240	5016240	The global world or not
5016480	5020240	And and third was an effective strategy to
5021200	5022640	Take action
5022640	5025680	And if I I'm not sure I got that all that right, but if that's
5027040	5028720	Correct, um
5028720	5033600	I find that most of the people if not all of them on this on these screens
5034480	5040560	Are pretty well versed in the first one how to you know, how messed up our world is
5041120	5047360	And the second one all deeply caring and wanting to make the world a better place
5048080	5050720	Um, so going beyond their own personal
5051920	5054880	Satisfaction and needs to wanting to to create a better world
5055280	5060000	But what we mostly almost all of us fail is we don't know what to do about it
5060080	5064000	We don't have an effective strategy and I think you've kind of answered
5064720	5069600	With your answer to jenny, but I wonder if you could reiterate it in another way
5069680	5071680	So like we all understand
5072320	5073840	What are the best?
5073840	5080080	Strategies for us to figure out what is an effective strategy and not just individually
5080160	5084800	But how can we collectively as a quaker community take action?
5092480	5094480	Is this being
5094720	5096720	Posted on the internet
5097440	5101120	That was the intention, but if you want to cut anything
5101840	5105840	I don't know. I don't know where you're gonna go, but I we can totally work out whenever
5106400	5108400	Feels feels good there
5108400	5110400	Okay
5113520	5115520	In a different setting I can say more about this
5119440	5121440	I'll say a couple things
5122080	5124080	The
5126160	5133600	Study of effective strategy is different in kind than studying like environmentalism and the fact that the environment's messed up
5134240	5136240	It because you're studying
5137840	5143520	How power works and you're studying it not just to critique it but to engage in it
5146880	5151200	And so that is a very different kind of study
5151680	5158560	It looks at how is it that corporations are able to lobby governments and put
5159280	5164240	Corporate agents into regulatory positions to regulate the government and their interests and things like that
5165120	5167120	and all those critiques of that the
5167280	5173200	Rotating revolving doors of somebody from big ag or big pharma than running the fda and you know
5173200	5177920	Or the public private partnership where the private side writes the law that the public side implements
5178480	5185840	Or the massive subsidies to fairly toxic things that happen because the big companies that have the patents have the money to pay a lot
5185840	5191040	More lobbyists than the things that are inherently decentralized like regenerative versus conventional agriculture or whatever
5192160	5196160	There's the way the critical theorist studies this which is basically to just say it's really bad
5196720	5198720	Like look at all this bad stuff. It's really bad
5201040	5205120	There there is the way that one studies it from the perspective of
5205840	5207840	How does
5207920	5210400	Influence at scale operate? What are the various
5211360	5216240	Modalities that when the world has changed who changed it and what were the tools they used to change it?
5218000	5220000	And if
5222000	5223680	Someone does not
5223680	5232720	Feel good about using those tools they counter as they have to say do I feel good about letting those who are using the tools currently continue to do it for those goals?
5233280	5235280	so
5240000	5243600	Being able to lobby a government for subsidies that ends up affecting
5244320	5248400	Market dynamics profoundly is something that big corporations are good at and that
5249600	5251600	Non-profit groups are not good at
5252000	5256320	Non-profit groups don't study how finance works and how lobbying works and you know those types of things well
5259040	5262080	Being able to figure out how to write a very complex
5262720	5268320	Operating agreement for a public-private partnership that has all the fine print to do everything you want for many different government
5268560	5274960	Jurisdictional bodies are now doing your will is something that the financial sector and various large corporate sectors are very good at and
5276160	5278160	You know people trying to do good things are not good at
5278560	5279760	um
5279760	5281280	and so
5281280	5285360	If you want effective strategy you have to study effective strategy
5287280	5290880	And so let's say for instance i'll give a historical example
5291840	5294800	And it's it's a fake example, but it'll you'll get a sense
5295680	5298480	Let's say that we had a chance to talk to
5300240	5305280	The Tibetans before Mao and they did let's say we had a chance to talk to them a couple decades before
5309280	5312640	They were not studying effective strategy because that was not their jam
5312800	5316960	That was not what their culture was about right they were doing different things and they were doing lovely things
5318080	5320080	They obviously did not study that
5321840	5324560	And the results are also quite obvious
5326400	5328400	Now
5328560	5332080	If they were to think about geopolitical strategy for a minute
5333520	5335520	It would be pretty easy to say oh
5336240	5342560	There are two billion person populations on either side of a watershed and we are at the source of the watershed
5343760	5345760	I bet we don't get to stay here
5345920	5350640	Like it seems pretty obvious that we don't get to stay here one of these sides is going to take the head
5350960	5355840	Top of the watershed. Also, this is going to be key to the strategic communications and missile defense
5357040	5358880	so
5358880	5362320	Geographically the fate is already written that we don't get to stay here
5364640	5367920	Given that what should we do and either
5369200	5371200	They would have done something like
5371920	5375600	Uh, anticipatorily create a partnership with one of the sides
5377040	5379040	In which they had something unique to offer
5379840	5381600	They would have left
5381600	5386960	Or they would have done something like finlanded between the ussr and eu to be in a
5388800	5390400	Buffer zone
5390400	5395280	relationship where both sides militarily protected them because of that or like switzerland did to say, you know
5395760	5398880	all of the international agreements between the two of you were going to be able to host
5399120	5400480	and
5400480	5402480	So let's say that
5403280	5407600	Tibet had realized that 30 years before the kind of rise of Mao and they had went to
5408480	5411760	The european powers at the time and said look, here's what's going to happen
5412800	5414800	China's going to get this otherwise
5415280	5419680	And it's going to help their rise to power that is going to end up threatening you and blah blah blah
5419760	5424560	And here's why you want to help protect us like offer kind of military legal support protecting us here
5424560	5429760	And then here's how what we're going to tell india here's what we're going to tell china such that in the same way that nobody
5429760	5435600	Invaded switzerland because everybody was invested in being able to store their gold and stuff in switzerland because switzerland was thinking about strategy
5435600	5437360	Then tibet could have done that
5437360	5442320	This would not have been this would have not arisen from the minds of the tibetan people with the culture they had
5443520	5449520	It did arise from the minds of some religions like jews, right? They had a different they had a
5450480	5455760	Different type of spirituality and mind arising that thought about strategy in a different way
5459600	5461600	So
5464080	5470160	It's not that there aren't places like tibet that had the same geographical determination that
5471680	5475120	Did a better job than they did it said it required a different type of mind
5475120	5480000	And that as as i've mentioned the people who are good at strategy
5481040	5486880	Are almost always strategy is a military term it gets then gets applied to business and other things, but it is about
5489120	5495440	Effective achieving of goals which are almost always narrow goals where you externalize costs in the process and against adversaries
5495920	5497200	right like that's
5497200	5498080	so
5498080	5500080	The mind that gets good at strategy
5500960	5508560	Is almost always co-occurring with something that is self-centered either at the level of the individual the nation state the corporation but not
5509280	5511280	The commons in all life and perpetuity
5512160	5516240	When you're thinking about the commons in all life and perpetuity you're not thinking how do I win stuff?
5517360	5518320	and so
5518320	5520320	but it's kind of like
5520400	5521600	let's
5521600	5523600	Let's take star wars
5523680	5525680	Let's say there were no sith
5525680	5526720	right
5526720	5528720	There wouldn't have to be jedi if there were no sith
5529360	5533280	Everybody could just be farmers and poets and parents and teachers would be lovely
5533920	5539760	But if there are sith there must be jedi and the jedi are not trained in farming. They are trained in warfare
5541360	5543360	protective warfare
5543440	5544960	right
5544960	5546960	um not in service of
5548160	5551760	empire and conquest purely like the white blood cells and immune system
5551760	5553760	and
5554720	5556720	So what I would say is if you
5557840	5559840	Want to be effective
5560800	5567440	At serving things that you care about in the presence of other groups that are effective at serving the goals they care about
5568240	5570240	You need to engage in that field of study
5577440	5579440	The jury
5580000	5582000	Yeah, what was that?
5584640	5587360	It's almost as if what you're saying is that
5588240	5590240	In order to be effective
5590880	5594720	We need to let go of our ethics
5595360	5599600	because in order to be effect the way you're most effective is
5600320	5602320	by being um
5602400	5605200	self-serving and you know with a narrow focus
5605840	5608880	So there's a real problem. I'm not saying that
5609520	5611520	Okay
5612560	5618080	I'm saying that it is inethical to do something that you know is for sure ineffective
5620000	5622000	To let
5622080	5624080	uh
5624240	5630480	Horror and tragedy and species extinction continue because you aren't willing to engage in effective strategies unethical
5630560	5633040	we are responsible not just for what we do but what we don't do
5635040	5636720	and
5636720	5640240	So there is an ethical responsibility to effectiveness
5641520	5646880	That doesn't mean you justify any amount of harm in the process. I'm not and that's the tricky thing is that the
5648800	5650800	The cultures
5651440	5653440	That
5654320	5658320	Said okay, we don't want wiped out therefore we have to build a standing military or whatever
5658800	5663120	We're not the same culture anymore because they had to reinvest things that had went into
5663920	5668480	Arts and child education and whatever now into military and and those types of things so
5671440	5675520	The two fail modes that we have to avoid is
5677120	5681760	Uh a culture that is doing something that is more
5684320	5690400	Ethical in its goals that just gets destroyed by a more dominant culture. That's a fail mode
5691360	5695360	Or even if it doesn't get destroyed because no one cares about it because it has no power but it it
5696240	5699040	Fails to prevent harm in the rest of the world happening
5700000	5701600	That's a fail mode
5701600	5705440	and one the other fail mode is that in the aim of
5706240	5709680	Not being destroyed and being effective. It also becomes a dominated culture
5711040	5712400	That's also a fail mode
5712400	5715520	So you can either be destroyed by the machine or become the machine is the answer
5715520	5717520	So you have to do something that is neither of those
5717680	5720880	So in learning how to be effective obviously the long-term
5721600	5726080	Play there is a change of all of the systems that mediate game theory itself
5727120	5733040	The consciousness and the systems which will look like not capitalism not nation states and not minds that see everything as separate things
5735040	5738720	But we don't get there if we don't if right now everybody
5739360	5744960	That is effectively getting lawmakers to write law or doing it in narrow short-term private interests
5744960	5749760	I would rather environmentalists know how to do the corporate thing as well as the corporate guys do
5751280	5753280	Or a different set of purposes
5753680	5758240	Well, of course, I would like to have a government that is not hijackable by anybody's interests
5758320	5763120	And that has a good collective intelligence guiding it. We obviously don't have that so having
5765200	5773520	The more inclusive goals be effective in the current dynamics while seeking to upgrade the underlying systemic dynamics
5773600	5775600	Both have to happen simultaneously
5776720	5778720	It's a tall order
5779920	5782640	Yeah, well, thank you for now being effective
5783360	5788640	At a local level is different because you don't have great power vested interests in the same way
5790080	5790800	And that's awesome
5790800	5796640	And I encourage most people to actually feel really good about that as opposed to hopeless about the scale that it's not operating at
5796640	5798640	And
5799360	5804960	For those who can't not think about the world at scale and can't not
5807040	5809040	Endeavour to become more effective at it
5809760	5811760	It's just a different study
5815120	5817120	Thank you Daniel for sharing that and
5818160	5822800	Yeah, I think that a core tenant of quakerism is about is about peace, right?
5823120	5828400	I'm guessing you might have ran across that, you know, so from the 1650s onward is this sort of
5829520	5831920	testimony on peace and so
5833040	5835040	There's much more to endeavor into there, but
5836800	5839440	And into that so let me give you for instance
5840400	5842400	Yeah
5842400	5844400	So the nuclear clock got
5845360	5847360	Moved closer to midnight
5847440	5849440	Associated with the escalation in ukraine
5849920	5851920	Yeah
5855120	5857120	You have not heard
5857440	5860160	A good thought on a plausible end game
5861120	5863120	When you watch the news because there is not one
5865200	5867200	The there is
5867760	5869920	On one side a bunch of rhetoric
5871040	5873920	Like putin is hitler and if he takes part of ukraine then
5874560	5878800	Bad guys everywhere will start taking other places and he'll take all of Europe and whatever and this is why we have to
5879120	5881120	But there's no thought about
5882400	5884900	What okay, so we're closing
5886000	5890160	Possible de-escalation pathways. What is the end game that we're going towards instead?
5890960	5897280	And engaging with this pretty directly. I can tell you that there's very wacky conversations about our first strike
5897760	5899760	nuclear dominance
5900160	5902160	And stuff like that
5902160	5904160	so
5905120	5906640	If you
5906640	5909520	Are focused on peace. It's not just we don't want to wage war
5909600	5915840	It's that we want to be effective at de-escalating everyone who is waging war and there are increasingly hawkish people on all sides
5916720	5917840	Absolutely
5917840	5923440	So learn how to be effective at influencing what is happening at the level of national security councils
5924560	5931840	Yeah to be able to have the more de-escalatory voices get into more positions of power and the escalatory hawkish voices not be there
5932640	5934320	so it
5934320	5936000	It takes a particular
5936640	5941360	But unless you know how to talk to security councils in language that will move them
5941840	5947120	Then you don't have the ability to help de-escalation in those ways or the other forces that you'd need to work with
5947760	5948880	so
5948880	5950880	the like
5955760	5957760	I think
5958000	5960000	One time when I was like nine years old
5960400	5961360	I
5961360	5967280	Had an experience probably many people here have had where I was horrified at my inability to not cause harm
5968400	5970400	that I
5970480	5972480	I couldn't avoid
5973120	5976960	When I was walking on the grass maybe killing some bugs. I couldn't I
5978000	5980000	at least my nine-year-old mind the
5980560	5983360	mites that were destroyed with my breath and my eyelash flutters
5983360	5988800	You know, it was just like so kind of horrifying. So I was like just stood there frozen didn't want to move
5989120	5991120	Wanted to breathe the little as possible
5991520	5992480	and
5992480	5998880	Okay, I realized I have to breathe and move but really tried to think about how do I not cause any harm and I'm complicit with all these systems that are
5999120	6002080	Fundamentally ecocidal and genocidal to be able to just get my stuff
6002800	6003760	right
6003760	6005760	and even if I'm eating a vegetarian diet
6007120	6009120	but
6009120	6014080	The shipping processes the oil that was involved in shipping at everything, right? There's like there's
6014640	6019920	Blood in all of that stuff and so I'm like, okay, so I have to only have things I make myself from stuff that I find
6020720	6022080	and
6022080	6026720	The idea that then for me to have my hands clean. I'm not causing harm
6027120	6032720	Also means I am totally complicit in allowing all the harm of the system to happen because I'm not willing to interact with any of it
6034080	6037760	There's a kind of humility that says no, I'm going to drive a car with fossil fuels that
6039040	6042080	Not only are destroying the environment but create wars that kill children
6043040	6046080	That I am partly driving the demand for
6049440	6053360	Then there is a place where like you don't I don't get to have my hands clean in this world
6054240	6056240	I do my very best but
6058480	6062240	There's a humility in that that's important. There's a realism in it. That's important
6062720	6066720	There's a not superiority over everybody else just being like we're in this thing together
6067280	6069280	At this time. That's the time that we're in
6070160	6072480	And then say like if I'm a pacifist
6073520	6075520	I'm not the one who controls the nuclear buttons
6076560	6080240	I'm not the one who controls the rapid proliferation of drone weapons
6081200	6083920	If I'm really a pacifist meaning I don't want there to be
6084800	6090640	Killing anywhere. How do I become increasingly influential over the people who are in control of the nuclear buttons and who are building all of the
6090880	6092880	AI empowered drone weapons
6093120	6100160	But that means maybe I have to learn how to engage compellingly with places that I would rather never engage with
6104240	6108240	Well, we've got two more questions and I want to kind of finish out with those
6108240	6112720	I think we'll we'll finish here at uh six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern
6113440	6118720	Um, so David, I want to give you an opportunity and then Eric and then Daniel any closing words?
6119600	6124960	Hi, greetings Daniel and everyone from Wajak Nga Buja in
6125520	6129840	Western Australia, where it's now 8 53 a.m. Saturday morning
6130960	6137200	And it does make me think of Edward Wilson's classic line. You know, we have a paleolithic emotions
6138240	6142240	medieval institutions and godlike technology
6142800	6147760	So I did enjoy your talk very much Daniel and I love that you
6148480	6152400	refer to sort of evolution or at least cultural evolution
6153040	6160240	And I have great respect for the United States of America two years away from your declaration of independence
6160720	6163520	And um, you know, essentially founding a republic
6164000	6169840	So it's pretty amazing for me living in what is a fairly robust democracy here
6170560	6177920	Um, but I do Dothma cap at America's abilities. Uh, so in terms of evolutionary
6179680	6186160	Perspectives, I mean, I I remember in the early 90s after the collapse of the Berlin Wall
6186560	6191520	One of the classic lines was because we went from two superpowers to the one superpower
6192080	6195920	And one of the classic lines was, you know, the new world superpower
6196480	6199040	is global public opinion
6199840	6203760	And uh, now it's a little bit more mixed up, but I'm just wondering
6204320	6205600	overall
6205600	6213360	What you think of the prospects of democracy modern representative democracy, which of course is nothing like
6213840	6215840	ancient greek democracy
6223120	6225120	Not good
6225440	6227440	Um
6230800	6236000	You just went away again, why do people go away right after they talk? I can all go ahead and um
6240640	6243600	I'm here. I'm still here. I'm still all right. So, um
6245360	6248000	It's a long complicated answer, but
6248880	6249920	when
6249920	6251920	The u.s. Democracy was founded
6252000	6255920	We did have an ocean separating us
6257600	6260640	And so the idea that the
6261680	6264720	There were a few things but one the idea that the people could know
6265520	6269440	Everything so they could be democratically, um, you know, participatory
6271120	6277760	Once we started to get the telegraph and then kind of mass telecommunications and then, um
6278720	6282960	Satellite spying sig intel and hypersonic missiles
6283760	6287840	Anything the american public know the russians the chinese the iranians instantly know
6288320	6294400	That means you started having a situation where almost everything became a national security secret and could not be shared with the public or even
6294800	6296560	got congress mostly
6296560	6304080	Because where the fertilizer is stored is a is a weapons knowledge where the aquifers are where the so increasingly
6304080	6309520	The most critical information can never be known by the public because it's national security secrets
6310640	6314000	That's you can't run a democracy where you have to classify everything
6314800	6316160	um
6316160	6321760	And yet you also can't make have a world that is in that kind of warfare where you share all of the things that
6321920	6326240	Are national security secrets with the public, you know, that's one example of a context change
6326800	6330080	In which the ideas that kind of made sense just totally don't make sense
6330240	6333760	The thing that we call the democracy obviously did all of its labor with slavery
6334640	6337840	and which means that all the shit jobs that people had no boat in
6338560	6339680	and
6339680	6341680	Then we kind of got rid of that
6342320	6343440	obviously
6343440	6345840	After the emancipation proclamation, we didn't really get rid of slavery
6345840	6351760	We just got a p and h slavery system where we put people in jail for for false reasons and then you know forced labor out of them
6352160	6356480	We really only got rid of it when we when globalization allowed us to ship the slavery overseas
6357360	6359360	and by the step back and effectively
6359680	6360880	and
6360880	6362880	You know, so if you were to say
6362880	6368880	Can a democracy make the decisions where the totality of the decisions it's of everyone that it's affecting all have a voice
6368960	6370960	All the stakeholders have a voice that's never happened
6371440	6372640	right so
6372640	6378160	A country will look at its genie coefficient and say what the inequality is but it buys its stuff from a country
6378560	6380560	Where almost everybody is poor
6380560	6385520	In which case it depends upon so the only level at which genie coefficient makes sense is global
6385760	6390480	Right, the only there's so many things like that where you really have to think about that
6390480	6394240	Which you depend upon and are driving the supply and demand of so
6394960	6396640	um
6396640	6399600	If if you really look at did we ever have democracy?
6399680	6406320	There was actually a thing where the stakeholders that were being affected really had any say it's not it's not a very good analysis
6406960	6408960	and then when you say
6409360	6413760	Does the thing that we have now even resemble the elements of that totally not
6414960	6416480	Now
6416480	6419120	Uh, how do you deal with that moving forward?
6420080	6424640	There is no system of governance in the history of the world that can deal with the issues that we need to deal with now
6426800	6428800	Because
6430480	6432480	Or instance
6433520	6437360	Uh gene synthesizers are becoming cheaper on an exponential curve
6440480	6447520	And it is already the case that quite inexpensively you can get the ability for gene synthesis and amplification and
6448240	6452960	It's a couple couple years at the current rate away from incredibly cheap like desktop capability for everybody
6453920	6456640	So if you even have open publishing of science
6456960	6462480	Where the science is doing gain and function research to look at incredibly variable empathogens and you publish the genome sequence
6463680	6469200	The information file alone, which is now open published on the internet is enough to make catastrophe weapons
6471280	6477120	And you can't monitor and control that the way you can nukes because nukes obviously are very very hard to make and you can see
6477120	6480160	The facilities the uranium enrichment etc from space
6480720	6484480	But we're talking about devices anybody can have in a tiny basement lab
6485680	6488320	And so that either means you
6490560	6493120	You just stop science mostly
6493840	6495840	Because it's all Pandora's boxes
6496160	6498160	Or you stop open publishing
6498720	6505120	Totally in the proper idea of kind of democracy there because the knowledge itself has weaponizable applications of that scale
6505760	6507760	Or you get increasing
6508080	6511520	Truly global catastrophes or you create a massive surveillance state
6513760	6515760	Those all are bad
6516800	6521600	There are better answers, but they're not obvious. They require innovation and totally new types of governance
6522560	6526560	Governance of lots of things. So, you know, those are things we work on
6527360	6529360	but um, I
6529360	6534960	Don't think that there are any systems of governance known to dates that can deal with these kinds of issues
6536080	6538080	I
6543680	6547680	Yeah, thank you so much here. I'm gonna unspotlight folks real quick. Um
6549280	6554480	And you know, we're coming in right here on the end of our conversation. I know Eric
6555280	6558560	Eric, I know well, uh, has a question raised if it's quick, Eric
6558560	6563280	If you still want to ask it go ahead and ask and then, um, daniel can share some closing thoughts
6563280	6569280	So, um, in fact, shelly asked very similar question to what I was going to ask
6570160	6574400	and I do want to thank you for your answers to the questions afterwards because
6575440	6577920	their monologue seem to have been a
6578880	6580880	um, basically a list
6581280	6589680	And it includes numbers like, you know, the however many people the Mongols killed and how much money is being put into ai
6589920	6590880	which
6590960	6597040	Are are nice to know, but I think you could assume that the people in this audience
6597760	6600640	Have been working on the basic questions for a long time
6601760	6605520	So my hypothetical hypothetical question is suppose we all knew
6606240	6608720	Everything that you had to say except for those little numbers
6609520	6611520	What would you say instead?
6621840	6630320	It's always hard to talk to an audience that you don't know what is shared knowledge
6631040	6635920	Um, what's shared world view? It's always a tricky tricky thing. Um
6638320	6640320	So my
6641920	6644080	Uh ideal situation is
6644960	6650720	To get to understand what a group is working on like what the shared knowledge is and what they're already
6651040	6653040	working on together and what things
6653520	6658000	Would be useful or empowering for them. What are the things that they're working on and then see do I know anything?
6658080	6660080	It would be useful. Maybe you don't
6660320	6661680	um
6661680	6663680	You know, it could be things about
6665280	6667280	Uh
6669920	6674960	Pathways of enacting solutions like specific strategies for enactment could be things about
6675520	6680640	prioritization of amongst all the problematic things which ones make sense to sequence attention on
6681200	6683200	it could be
6683840	6685280	um
6685280	6692160	deepening the understanding of the problem assessment in terms of the causal dynamics more such that
6693360	6697440	Um clear insight about what the effective kinds of strategies would be
6698240	6702800	But it would depend upon what was already known and what wasn't and what was interesting
6703040	6705040	And
6709200	6712080	Well, Daniel, we might need to talk more at some point
6712800	6718400	But uh, I just uh want to give you a chance. Uh, it's uh 904 your time
6718480	6722320	I know, um, but do you want to share some closing thoughts with with the group here?
6724960	6726080	I
6726080	6727760	I was um
6727760	6732640	I didn't know who was in the group uh beforehand, you know, and you invited me here. I was uh
6733120	6735120	uh
6735440	6740560	Happy to see how many people were scientists and where people who've been working on these issues for a long time knew
6741120	6743120	Uh a lot about it. I um
6744480	6748880	That's not the case of faith communities in general. Um, so I think that's awesome
6750000	6752000	if there was a
6753440	6756240	Follow-up of okay, let's kind of share
6757120	6763840	What our state-of-the-world assessment is and what our current thoughts for how to what we care to do and how we
6764400	6768960	Think about how to enact that are and be able to engage there. That would be really interesting
6770080	6771760	um
6771760	6773760	and
6775280	6783040	Uh, if there are people who are like have backgrounds and things and are working on things that feel like there are
6783760	6789680	Interesting follow-ups we might engage in if Keith maybe you send me a list about of that and that would also be really cool
6792640	6800640	Definitely will do. Yeah. Well, maybe we can end with some stillness and getting back in touch with that sacred center and
6801760	6806800	Thank you so much Daniel for sharing your thoughts. I would like to hear the harvest
6807280	6811200	From this so if some of you stay and continue to talk Keith if you would share
6811760	6816800	um harvest and there are interesting follow-ups to the intersection of the
6818320	6820320	um
6820320	6822320	kind of spirituality that
6822560	6824560	is not
6824560	6826560	incommensurable with any other
6826560	6828720	worldview or religion that has uh
6829920	6836400	In sacredness listening conscience at the center that also has environmentally interested people and scientists like this is
6836960	6840720	Really delightful. I'm really happy to have met the people here and so I look forward to hearing more
6841200	6844080	Thanks
6871840	6879920	All right, so um the folks who are staying I um
6880880	6886720	Want to just share with you all um the queries that we have uh, if this is not like I think any time with queries
6886720	6888720	It's really where's spirit drawing us?
6889280	6896240	But the questions I've written ahead of time are how might QEW as an organization respond with deep earnestness
6896720	6898720	to the crisis we face today
6899680	6903760	Given Daniel's talk what new insights or challenges are we seeing?
6904960	6911600	And three how might our Quaker faith inspire us in taking on our civilization all right at that?
6913360	6920000	So I'll drop those in the chat and then I just want to invite folks to start raising their hands and maybe once five hands are up
6920800	6921840	um
6921840	6928480	So I'll drop those in the chat and then uh as folks are led just raise your hands and we can begin this discussion
6929280	6930960	Thank you so much everyone
6930960	6932960	I'll note as someone who really loves
6933360	6935360	Daniel's analysis that i'm like
6935440	6939760	A little nervous because he does get laid something laid on pretty heavy sometimes
6939840	6946960	But I think it's really important for us to actually um as people who are called to spirituality not to avoid those facts
6947040	6950640	But to to really face up to them and ask a couple of us what conscience
6951360	6953360	How conscience would have have us respond?
6954400	6955440	so
6955440	6957440	at that
6958000	6960000	Just waiting for hands. We got four hands
6961840	6963840	and
6963920	6965120	Yeah, five
6965120	6968400	Okay, or four, but anyway story if you want to go ahead and start us off
6969280	6974320	Yeah, I I can only speak to number two because i'm i'm lutheran
6975360	6977760	And I have a very different um
6978720	6980720	Well, let's just say we do things a little differently
6982320	6986800	Um same general idea. Love your neighbor. Love god with all your heart mind and soul
6988160	6990160	The the thought that occurred to me
6991200	6992320	is
6992320	6996080	I as having deep roots in the scientific community
6996800	6998800	Going back over 50 years
7000000	7001520	uh, I'm
7001520	7002720	I'm
7002720	7007120	Feel motivated to say how can we kind of merge these points of use?
7008560	7015440	And for example in the geologic view, there's the oceanographers. There's the astrophysicist. There's the geochemists
7016320	7018320	There's the paleoclimatologist
7019120	7025120	There's all these sub branches all the way going down to high temperature superconductors because that's part of the same physics
7027120	7033120	And so we know we're very good at working with other groups and seeing things from their point of view because they're all valid
7033360	7037680	And together you you kind of get a broader more deeper perspective
7038560	7045440	Because I I heard very solid analysis from daniel on geopolitics and the reality of certain
7046160	7048160	government interactions and you know
7048880	7050640	history
7050640	7052640	but there's a
7052640	7056880	There's a climate aspect that is not well socialized
7058000	7063600	There are our demographic aspects that are not well socialized. My wife is from taiwan
7064320	7066320	And having that kind of personal connection
7067120	7071360	You notice things they don't publish because they're right there in front of you on the ground
7073040	7079680	And i'm just wondering where would it be best to kind of fuse those perspectives into a greater one
7080320	7081520	because
7081520	7084320	I really firmly believe if you're going to make wise
7084800	7087680	powerful decisions, you gotta know what you face
7094080	7096080	Hey
7096160	7100320	Ronnie, I think you know, I think everyone can see this list and
7101840	7103280	if we
7103280	7104160	um
7104160	7109040	Yeah, so um, we'll try to I see your hand raised. Don't worry. Ronnie. You want to respond?
7109840	7111840	for sure I do, um
7112880	7116080	I mean I pushed back at the end because
7118160	7124240	Not everybody here is a scientist and I sure as hell don't want to be in a a group with just scientists
7124320	7130320	There's people like me who are more social scientists and and the strategist for
7130800	7134880	Community organizing and all of that kind of thing and so, you know
7135520	7140480	I one of the things that I find is, you know, we are I don't think we have
7141680	7144640	Some of the answers we truly need and and yet
7145280	7151600	I also bring a strong native american orientation to this and
7152000	7156320	You know, we can do this from a um
7158160	7162080	Whatever this is, I mean native peoples have been, you know, destroyed
7163840	7167280	For centuries and and whatnot. So it's nothing new
7168560	7173760	I think, you know, it just to put that into a perspective and I think it's, you know
7175440	7179520	I was fascinated with the elder discussion because that's an area where I have a
7179840	7187440	High a law, you know, a large expertise and and cooperative structures that we're a bunch of older people in this country
7187520	7192080	And we could start playing and organize around how we're going to take care of ourselves
7192160	7194480	So that burden isn't on the younger generation
7194800	7202240	But we did talk about there being guidance from younger people and some of the younger people are starting to organize for
7204640	7206640	What do we do after things break down?
7207360	7209360	So, you know, I just um
7210080	7212720	I don't think we're going to come to terms with it scientifically
7212800	7217200	I sure don't think we're going to come to terms with it if we do a whole bunch of philosophizing
7217520	7219200	I think we've got to
7219200	7221200	Hit the ground with our boots on
7222080	7224080	Whatever that is
7224800	7226800	I
7231600	7237280	I just want to invite folks who have their hand raised just speak in order that your hands are raised. Um
7238800	7240800	Yeah
7242160	7244320	So that's jenny jenny wrackliffe right now
7246800	7252320	Uh, I I just want to mention a couple of things and and because I spoke earlier. I'll be quick
7252720	7255920	That there are several examples. I can think of
7256640	7260960	Of given given that you're number two and number three
7262080	7264080	keys
7265280	7268000	I look to people like e f shoe marker
7268720	7269840	gandy
7269840	7271600	Martin Luther king
7271600	7280160	And and others that some of us are already familiar with as to how we can actually build a bridge between the spiritual root
7280720	7281920	and our
7281920	7289280	This transformation that we're trying to bring about at the deepest possible level and turn that into practical action
7289760	7290800	and when
7290800	7292000	gandy
7292000	7294960	Made the savo dear movement in in india
7295440	7302560	I think as much as the satyagraha movement where he was is which he's known for about peacemaking and and and
7303280	7306080	An indian liberation from the british and so on
7306720	7307600	um
7307600	7312000	his his practical program of of appropriate technology
7313040	7316240	Deep economy deep deep ecology in effect
7316800	7318800	thomas berry spoke to this and
7319440	7326000	We're we're trying to integrate those things in our own lives. I think I mean daniel sort of
7326560	7330000	Painted a picture where in a sense we're faced with a dilemma
7330080	7335920	Do we do we have to enter the corporate world in order to be able to understand how to fix it?
7336240	7338240	Do we do this
7338400	7343680	Are we are we compromising our purity of our intentions if we understand how
7344400	7350880	You know the the armaments industry works or something like that and if the criteria is to be effective
7351520	7357760	But the criteria it has to be to be effective from in a spiritually guided
7358240	7360240	And transformative way
7360720	7365440	And that's the challenge we're facing and I think that people like shoe marker
7365920	7373520	Gandy and others actually gave us practical examples of how we can do this on the ground real practical stuff
7374000	7378720	And and also what you were saying rain you is it about integrating
7379280	7382640	Indigenous knowledge. We're trying to do that as well to bring
7383280	7388720	Bring out not just the sort of way that we might be able to adapt to the doom that we're already facing but to
7389040	7394480	Make the transformation ahead of time so we minimize the amount of chaos that we're producing
7398880	7406400	And I think yeah that that really resonates with me jenny that the root of it is actually conscience at spirit
7407840	7409840	And conscience leads us to act
7410800	7417040	Um, so I just want to share that and that the power the potency of that cultivating the potency of that
7417360	7419360	Is I think what I'm calling prophetic voice
7420080	7422080	But um, nancy
7426720	7430080	Thank you, I was really really grateful
7430640	7432640	Our keith that you brought daniel here
7433280	7437760	And began a dialogue with him that I think will circle back into
7439920	7442960	I have heard him a number of times before so
7443600	7445600	Much of what he had to say
7445600	7447600	Was not as hard to hear
7448240	7451200	In a way as it was the first time and there's a certain relief
7452080	7455840	In the the speaking of that and then engaging with it
7456960	7460080	In his models emphasizing strategy
7461040	7463040	He omits another way of thinking
7463840	7466320	That can bring together the guidance of spirit
7467280	7472480	Which is particularly a central in clarity being clear about our goals
7473120	7475760	And then being the right kinds of goals
7476720	7478720	Some of which can be put into words
7479200	7483760	Some of which is a response of the moment of the kind jenny is talking about and he spoke of
7484240	7486240	Where spirit takes you over
7486880	7493600	What I'm interested in the complementarity with it is comparable to strategy is the notion of design
7494560	7497040	Of social design where science
7498800	7501920	All the sciences both the physical the biological
7502560	7504560	The social sciences
7504560	7506560	Each have a contribution
7507040	7510160	To naming the givens the art of design
7510880	7512880	Is comprehending the givens
7514320	7516320	In combination
7516560	7519360	With the aspirations of the heart led by spirit
7519920	7522960	And among the givens understanding the realities
7523680	7526960	Of the situation you're in and the path dependencies and so forth
7528160	7534880	And then with a collective effort of mutual creativity gained by really hearing each other
7535760	7541360	To then begin to lay out what are the system requirements and what are
7541920	7545120	The places in the system of leverage points
7545680	7549680	Where the changes of the right kind could shift the outcomes
7550480	7556080	And at those points what are what I would call at that point design specs for solutions
7557120	7559120	And looking at stories
7559680	7566960	It's important to understand the stories of failure. It is equally important to understand the stories of success
7567440	7569440	I would say to him
7569440	7572400	Look at the open government movement in taiwan
7572560	7580640	Talk about an adjacent possible that just suddenly exploded. Nobody could have guessed not only a different way of governing at scale
7581840	7584080	A truly participatory governance at scale
7585040	7589440	But a different strategy for a kind of different kind of revolution that would occur
7590080	7595920	Look at the reamp project in the u.s. And the notion of collective impact and
7596160	7598400	And the notion of collective impact and
7599440	7600800	Stanford's
7600800	7603520	Social design and so forth. Let us look for
7604240	7606240	those places where there are not only
7607120	7610720	The accidents of the right person at the right place at the right time
7611440	7613440	that history yields
7613440	7616560	But those things that are replicable replicable that suggest
7617840	7622000	These are ways of being together ways of meeting our needs
7622880	7627280	That as I have put it to meet the needs of all by healing not harming
7627760	7631040	Planetary people our material needs. Where are their examples?
7631680	7633920	Of that and then where are the examples?
7634720	7638160	Of as in the reamp project bringing all the elements
7639280	7645040	Of a system that was resulting in horrific pollution in the american midwest
7646160	7649440	Each of them as human beings to come together and jointly map
7650320	7656640	The systems that they were in coming to know each other's human beings and the roles of each and then together saying
7657440	7660880	If we change these leverage points in this system
7661680	7666480	We could dramatically change we could reverse instead of being the most polluting part of the country
7666480	7672240	We could become the model of the opposite as you know Keith. They were stunningly successful
7672480	7677120	They stopped the production that going online of 30 power plants
7677680	7681680	So I want us to study closely where those things do come together
7682400	7687840	And the ways in which deep listening and love towards each other opens up creativity
7688080	7694080	That is otherwise again the adjacent possible. We don't even yet know what it could look like and lastly
7695520	7701120	The situation we confront we're all part of the problem and potentially all part of the solution
7701760	7703760	Is radically different
7704480	7711520	Than confrontational one issue even if the issue is colonialism one issue one shot warfare
7711840	7715200	This is a really different opportunity in human history
7718560	7725600	Thank you so much Nancy for sharing that and I couldn't agree more and I just that that um
7726560	7731920	I do think that that first example about taiwan is actually something I've talked directly to daniel about before
7732640	7734640	Um, so it's something on his radar
7735360	7737360	Brad
7737440	7743920	Uh, I apologize zoom is uh decided again that I shouldn't you shouldn't see me except in a uh a picture
7744400	7746400	So i'm gonna leave the picture there. Um
7747600	7752080	A couple of things struck me in terms of what he what he was saying. Um
7753360	7758800	I was struck by when he grabbed me when he said uh one of our alternatives is to die with dignity
7759440	7761440	um and i'm um
7761600	7765520	And working out of that one of the things that that and then he gave he gave a model
7766000	7767280	I mean he gave a lot of examples
7767280	7774000	But one of the examples he gave I thought was by moving was he said about to bet and how to bet could have anticipated
7774080	7777200	But their culturally weren't set to it, but they could have anticipated
7777760	7779760	by their geographic
7779920	7781040	placement
7781040	7787440	That they were between two major powers and that they were vulnerable and done something about it and interestingly
7788000	7789440	what he
7789440	7791440	Said this they could have gone to europe and asked for
7792000	7796400	um, essentially military support it sounded like. Um, or some kind
7797200	7800320	What i've noticed is and and i've and i've um
7802720	7804720	Is is a lack on
7805600	7809920	On on certain of many of us are not wanting to push back
7810560	7813680	Um, and what I was hearing him say was you need to study
7814240	7822000	The you need to study the the opponents so to speak and you need to understand them in order to know how to how to resist them
7822400	7827920	In a way that's going to actually be effective and what he said was if not being effective is immoral
7828880	7831920	And I and I thought that was extraordinary to say
7832560	7833520	um
7833520	7838080	It always struck me that that obama had told us in his books
7838400	7844160	He was a compromiser and when you have him come into a situation where
7844880	7846880	for a while they
7846880	7850160	His his his party controlled all three
7851120	7856240	Parts of government, you know the executive in both houses and they didn't just do what the
7857040	7862800	What the republicans would have done which is roll over everything they could have just put in you know
7862880	7864000	um
7864000	7870160	Changed medicare and had universal health and two years of it before and then try to take it away
7870720	7874400	They they could have when they were doing the so-called bailout
7874880	7877280	They could have bought out everybody's mortgages
7877760	7883840	Taking over the banks. They had the rules to take over the banks and control them and they didn't do that
7884000	7891840	They they chose to just to give the money to the ceo's to be able to retire and what we and we all kind of
7893200	7895200	Okay
7895200	7896640	That's okay
7896640	7901040	And part of what what really has been bothering me, you know, and I and I
7901760	7906720	I grew up in a union house. I grew up, you know, and my died in the bowl
7908400	7910240	Democrats and
7910240	7918720	Is this that the the fear to be called liberal even it's like, oh, you're a liberal. Oh my god, you know and and running away from it
7919280	7925760	And and the pause what I'm hearing here is we need to resist we need to be more active
7926640	7931760	It doesn't necessarily mean for quakers to take up arms, but it does mean to fight
7933040	7935040	And there are ways to fight without
7935040	7941680	Taking up arms and shooting people, but it doesn't mean rolling over it doesn't mean dying with dignity
7941920	7943920	It doesn't mean letting it happen
7943920	7950800	And and and that's what it's what what I feel I'm surrounded with too often in the so-called liberal world
7951280	7958320	Is that kind of well, let's get along. Let's not make waves. Let's compromise. Let's find a way out and you know
7958880	7963200	And not instead of saying no, this is wrong. We're going to stand up and resist
7963840	7964640	um
7964640	7965920	and remember
7965920	7967920	peace teams one time had a
7967920	7973040	A picture of a girl this is before the current situation of a girl standing in front of a tank
7973520	7974400	in
7974400	7980720	Palestine and and protecting a trying to protect a house and and the tank ran over her and the house
7981360	7989120	And and the line was that they had they posted was people are willing to die for war. How many people are willing to die for peace
7990160	7994080	And it's at that level that we're talking about and I just feel um
7995440	7997760	I just feel like that's what he was asking of us
7998240	8004240	And in between the lines is is to have that kind of same level of energy and commitment
8004720	8008800	To really push back and push back effectively. Thanks
8011280	8015920	Brad, I I just want to say you're speaking to my condition. I um really
8017040	8019280	Really appreciate that and um
8020400	8025200	I'm not going to dominate this conversation, but I want to invite Brian. Yeah
8027760	8029760	I
8031440	8033440	Do want to
8033520	8036000	I believe what Brad was just saying there
8036960	8037920	but
8037920	8039920	I do want to um
8041920	8043920	At least point out that
8044800	8046800	There was an underlying fear
8047600	8049600	That really wasn't being talked about
8050480	8052400	Daniel has
8052400	8053440	of
8053440	8055120	Where we are
8055120	8057120	And I think that it's important that we
8058080	8060080	Understand that fear
8060320	8062320	As we move forward
8062400	8065360	That it's not an excuse for not moving forward
8065920	8071040	But that it's an important thing to understand perhaps that the
8071520	8076240	Time frame that is available to make the changes that are required
8077200	8079200	Is no longer with us
8080160	8082320	And how do we respond to that?
8082560	8084560	The
8085120	8087520	Fear of where we are with AI
8088240	8090960	The fear we are with how much
8091920	8097840	Information needs to be controlled cannot be talked about that he was afraid that
8098960	8105600	He would be recorded and that that might be extended to the rest of the world that he might misspeak
8106640	8108640	And he was afraid of that
8109360	8116240	So I think that we need to understand his fears and we need to understand
8117680	8120880	Should we hold on to those same fears or
8121840	8124800	Is that something that we have something special
8125360	8127360	within our approach
8127360	8130400	That can work past those fears
8132400	8134960	He is speaking to the fact that we need to
8135600	8139840	Completely change the institutions the systemic
8142080	8150640	Approaches that are already in place all need to be changed and they all need to be changed simultaneously and that
8151840	8153840	There's nothing to be left behind
8154560	8156560	that's revolution
8156560	8157920	and
8157920	8159920	Are we willing to
8160720	8162240	step out
8162240	8166480	to the levels of what does that mean and what does that mean within a
8167600	8169600	nonviolent approach
8170880	8172880	And what does that mean to
8173600	8175440	our families
8175440	8177200	and our neighbors
8177200	8180640	And the people that are you know that we love
8181280	8185120	That that we hold dear and what will the consequences be
8185920	8190480	Of what we're going to make for the changes that have to happen
8191440	8196080	To be able to prevent the worst of the things that have been outlined in front of us
8198560	8200560	Just an acknowledgement
8202720	8204720	Thank you
8205680	8208160	Thank you rye, um David
8213120	8215120	Um if you can hear me
8217040	8219040	Um
8219760	8226000	I'm reminded of somebody's quote who suggested an effective strategy
8226960	8233440	Is to develop some sort of system which absolutes the existing system
8236720	8238720	Yeah, yeah
8241840	8247680	We're never going to have the time to develop the skills to be able to
8249360	8253920	Change corporate corporate america from the inside
8255440	8258960	I don't see that as something that makes sense for
8260000	8262000	qe w
8268640	8271040	I'm intrigued by the idea of wilderness
8272720	8274720	There isn't any
8275120	8279840	But at least there's little pieces of nature that still exist
8282880	8289680	For us to develop the kind of intuition that he was talking about by exposure to nature
8290960	8293440	It seems like qe w needs to be
8295520	8298160	Looking for and attempting to preserve
8299120	8305360	What little bits of nature there still are in all growth forests in wilderness
8309440	8314960	Those are the kinds of things that we might be able to be effective in our strategy of
8318400	8324400	Probably not at a federal level but more likely at a local level
8328240	8331840	And pointing out to the society around us
8332480	8335840	That those pieces of nature that still exist
8336640	8337520	have
8337520	8339520	things to teach us and
8342000	8344640	Are beautiful and affect our lives
8347280	8349280	If that makes sense
8354000	8356800	Thank you, David, uh, we have another David
8358160	8364080	Good morning friends 9 33 a.m. Now in
8367520	8369520	Yeah, it was uh
8369600	8375920	I think I will have to try and get in contact with daniel if I know he's a busy man, but his responses about
8376800	8378800	governmental processes
8378960	8381920	fascinate me because i'm certainly fascinated in
8382800	8384080	democratic
8384080	8386480	which seems to me like peaceful ways of
8386880	8394080	You know moving the overton window as it were, you know, what's acceptable. What's not acceptable and so on so forth
8395360	8402320	I do think that 17th century britain was a most fascinating time
8403280	8405920	Because of course it not only gave birth to friends
8407120	8412560	But in many ways it gave birth to at least the beginnings of democracy
8413040	8421040	You know, uh, we basically had the parliament taking the power over the monarch and I think it was you keith who mentioned
8422320	8429600	Hobbes and whatnot earlier, you know, and there's you know, there's a whole lot of changes here that are happening. So I
8430960	8432960	personally am still holding the faith
8434400	8438080	Very much that democracy is still evolving
8439200	8440880	and so I
8440880	8442880	sometimes say that
8442960	8445760	Quakers are my spiritual community
8446480	8448480	which I dearly love
8448480	8454400	Golf is my other religion because on the golf course nearer to thee am I and my lord when I'm
8455280	8457280	In that spiritual space
8457360	8461840	But I will say that modern representative democracy is my true
8462560	8467360	Religion in the latin sense of that word religion, which basically means
8468240	8470240	Bonding what bonds us
8470640	8472640	you know, and
8472800	8474800	I know we are very
8475440	8478800	Symbolic we work through symbolism a lot
8479600	8484160	And so I think always I think my my holy of holies
8484880	8490000	is the two red lines down the center of the house of commons, which are
8490880	8492880	mythologically as it were
8493040	8495040	Two broadswords apart
8495840	8499520	Now the symbolism of that is if you are the
8500400	8502400	Speaker in the house of commons
8503040	8504560	to your right
8504560	8506560	sits his majesty's
8506720	8508320	loyal government
8508320	8510000	and to your left
8510000	8512000	sits his majesty's
8512160	8514160	loyal opposition
8514160	8514960	and
8514960	8517040	So, you know, they clash thoughts
8517920	8521200	But that's the essence of having to live in the age of reason
8521680	8524480	Because if we are to live in the age of reason
8525200	8526400	we must
8526400	8528400	live in the age of
8528960	8530960	contention rivalry
8531040	8533040	because
8533200	8535520	Reason can give a valid answer on both sides
8536320	8538320	And I know many friends here
8538800	8541040	have spoken about as it were
8542080	8543280	think
8543280	8545840	locally act globally, you know
8546800	8548800	now I
8548960	8554560	Warning, I may say something which upsets people here. Okay, but I will say first and foremost
8555280	8558160	I am very very very pro
8559040	8560560	choice
8560560	8562560	okay, and
8562880	8564880	I can respect
8565120	8568880	the united states supreme court's decision
8569840	8571840	To make it a state thing
8572480	8574880	Okay, so I hope that doesn't upset anybody too much
8574960	8578560	But on I would absolutely always go for pro-choice
8578960	8580960	But I see the reasoning in it
8581360	8583360	It's up to you folks
8583600	8584320	individually
8584320	8589920	As states or what have the case would be locally to decide what you as a community wish
8590000	8592080	And I think that is all the way through
8592880	8596320	You know, um, but of course how we're lessing that into a
8597280	8602320	Global public opinion as well is another matter. Anyway enough from me. Thank you
8603280	8605280	And Leoma
8610560	8614240	A couple of things one it seems to me that
8615360	8622400	Finding spaces for you know, like the scientific the internal all these different states
8623200	8625200	doesn't seem to me like such a
8625920	8627360	big conundrum
8627360	8631840	We just I think we might be well suited to find a way to
8632720	8634720	honor all the different ones
8635600	8637600	uh our
8637760	8639760	practice with
8640000	8645440	Unity decision-making might help us be a place where we can
8646320	8648320	help model the structure of
8649760	8651760	Honoring all the different ways of knowing
8652960	8654960	Going with the basic
8655600	8657200	fundamental belief
8657200	8660720	That there is something larger and deeper than us holding us
8660720	8666960	And that we also are not wise enough to know more than part
8668160	8673360	I mean, we're wise enough to know the QEW needs more diversity to have more
8674320	8676320	more contention and more
8676960	8678960	points of view, but um
8680880	8685040	And so that was one thing and the other thing is I've been wondering
8685760	8691920	Considering our size. I mean, I'm troubled by this idea that we need experts
8693280	8695280	um
8695280	8696720	Seems like a
8696720	8700720	Very sound idea. We need experts in how to be effective
8701520	8704800	In the places that are controlling resources
8706000	8708960	Which essentially what the big corporations and governments are
8709680	8711280	they're
8711280	8713440	channeling the way resources go
8715040	8717040	and
8718160	8722240	That but that's very daunting to get the amount of expertise to be
8724000	8726000	Effective there
8726160	8728560	So I'm just putting that up as wow
8729760	8732560	Because if we don't maybe we won't get a chance
8733200	8735200	to do where our
8735200	8736480	strengths is
8736480	8738480	Or where our contribution is
8739600	8741600	but um
8742320	8745840	The other last thing I wanted to put forward is this idea that's been
8746480	8748080	playing with me
8748080	8749680	about
8749680	8753200	As a compliment to the gentle warrior
8754240	8757520	Which Keith seems to be your archetype in some
8758640	8760640	Some days at least
8760720	8761840	um
8761840	8764400	The humble holy trickster
8765840	8768000	Which is the one who's
8768880	8774240	Uh, and there are other archetypes that we might well embrace in there or invent but
8774880	8777200	But the humble holy trickster is the one
8777920	8780320	Who is attuned to the emergence?
8781600	8787520	I've been wondering about emergence as a compliment to good design, which is essential
8788640	8790640	How do we
8790880	8793920	How can qe w as a small organization?
8795120	8797120	catalyze
8797680	8799680	emergence
8799920	8803040	By being alert to places where
8804800	8808240	A small group can shift conversations
8809440	8811440	And connect
8811600	8817280	Groups, I mean we're in our silo. We need to get out of it. How can we connect groups?
8818960	8820960	That
8820960	8824080	When put together might come up with something we don't expect
8824720	8827920	I mean, I think there are ways that emergence can be encouraged
8828640	8830640	and there are ways in which
8830640	8832640	it's
8832960	8836080	Being channeled towards emergence of pathways
8836160	8841680	We all know too well from our history in terms of the rival or stuff that daniel talked about etc
8843040	8845040	but
8848560	8850560	Well, I think our next person is suellin
8851760	8853760	Thank you, liana
8854480	8856480	You
8860640	8862240	Um, I
8862240	8866720	I want to in general say that I keep wanting to say that friend speaks my mind
8867760	8870400	And so and what many of you have said so thank you
8871040	8872640	I have heard
8872640	8878160	Maybe one thing but I also may have misheard it that concerns me
8879360	8883200	And um, and I want to respond to the first query
8884880	8886080	Um
8886080	8890000	So let me say that now and then I can because it relates to what concerned me
8890560	8893840	How could qe w respond with deep earnest?
8894960	8901440	I don't have it in front of me, but deep earnestness to what we just heard from daniel. That's the way I'm going to truncate it
8903120	8905120	And I will say
8905200	8910240	By actually honoring because we don't and no progressive groups do
8911040	8912080	I think
8912160	8917200	That's a black statement that I should don't have the right to move but we don't
8918160	8919200	honor
8919200	8922720	the study of effective strategy as much as we honor
8923920	8925920	Having a phd in science
8927840	8934320	We don't honor that and as a person who has been an organizer since I was 13 years old
8934400	8936880	I will tell you the studies are out there
8937600	8943840	And what they tell you is you'd better read them because for example people always bring up the civil rights movement
8944640	8946320	well guys
8946320	8952480	Read I've got the light of freedom that explained that it worked those marches to a large degree
8952960	8959920	Not their only person. There's never one reason something works to a large degree because for 20 years organizations went into
8960320	8965520	The black towns and did door-to-door canvassing and had community meetings
8965760	8969520	For 20 years before you saw any sit-ins and marches
8970080	8973120	Yet when people think they have studied effective strategy
8973760	8975760	They think they're looking at the surface
8977280	8980160	They haven't studied the effective strategy
8980720	8982880	and we do not as
8983760	8984640	I
8984640	8988560	Well, I don't call myself a liberal anymore because I call myself a lefty
8989040	8993440	because working class of economic things are always in front of me
8994320	8996560	uh, and but what I'm going to say is
8997120	8998560	You can't study it
8998560	9004480	But you can't study it just thinking you kind of know what people have said in a few places
9004880	9006880	You got to really find the studies
9007680	9013360	It took me years to find I've got the light of freedom and the Duke university professor who wrote it
9013680	9020720	And that was 20 years of door knocking that your university professor who wrote it said I have looked for this book for years
9020800	9022800	and I finally decided I had to write it
9024400	9029120	And uh, uh, so you it is not easy, but we cannot tell ourselves
9029680	9031200	surface things
9031200	9034080	If we wanted to change so if we wanted to be earnest
9035280	9042320	We would study effective strategy, but we'd really study it the other thing the thing that has concerned me two things
9042720	9045360	One has been the idea that if we
9049680	9053680	Play in the some of the power circles to try to help things be better
9054320	9058720	And we can't be sure it'll save the world but to do our best and play in some of us
9058960	9065200	We will be corrupt like corporations. I think I've heard that in various words more than once
9065600	9067600	No
9067600	9069600	That isn't at all necessary
9069760	9075520	Instead what we need to do is again go to root cause and figure out why corporations
9076480	9078480	Have so much power. Well
9079280	9080720	partly right
9080720	9084720	They have so much power because they've elected people who care so much about
9085680	9086640	I mean
9086640	9091920	It was so different when I worked for congress when all the members of congress or a lot of them had been
9092320	9098000	Planned by the vant and a vietnam war and the civil rights movements. You guys it was a different world
9099120	9101040	And that's people
9101040	9103360	so we need to respect that
9104720	9106720	Power is a really
9107680	9114400	One of the things to do and I will finally say I do not believe conscience leads to action
9116320	9118320	I believe
9118320	9119680	love
9119760	9126240	Of things like as I said in my five-year thing looking in the eyes of a wolf not frankly to be honest
9126400	9132880	I know often people talking about carbon credits, which I think are really important and stuff because people just go
9134080	9136560	Look in the eyes of the wolf and tell me if it's okay with you
9137120	9139120	Vow's eyes go extinct
9140240	9142240	Because you're approaching love
9144240	9146240	And what I want to say is that
9147200	9149760	We need some love to help
9150800	9152480	There be tactics
9152480	9158720	But as he as Daniel said about the 10,000 things put you in touch with the dow
9159200	9161200	The knocking on the doors
9161200	9169920	The canvas is what puts off is as valid at put for putting us up in touch with spirit as sitting in a me for worship
9170880	9172880	And we don't really
9173840	9175840	All that we don't
9176960	9179600	and I think because it is
9180640	9185280	The story of that I tried to find from organizing is people did a little bit
9185680	9189040	They were reinforced and then they did a little bit more
9192400	9198080	So that door knocking or whatever is where god is I believe
9199040	9207920	I'll go ahead and share just a bit. My hand kept dropping. I think it's because my mic's off
9208640	9213840	Um, and then we're back. I'll invite you but I I really did want to share just a bit that um
9221920	9226960	Yeah, I think I mean, I think that Naomi both knows me well
9228240	9232320	And says it well that I think that the the orientation towards this that I'm called to
9232960	9236240	Is something like a peaceful warrior, which is the one that's willing
9236800	9242400	That you know, there's a beautiful some beautiful quotes from some very peaceful warriors, uh in the 19
9244880	9248240	Bear uh, I'm trying to remember his first name right now
9249040	9251120	There's a few but you know, essentially, um
9252000	9253760	admonishing
9253760	9256800	Quite, you know peacemakers people who claim to be peacemakers
9257120	9262400	But who are unwilling to pay any significant price for that and they you know claim. I want peace
9262720	9267280	I want peace but they do it with half a heart and half a will and because of that
9267760	9273760	The war continues because all they really want is the volaties of peace all they really want is
9274480	9276480	peace in my little bubble
9276640	9282320	Right and I think as long as that's what we're going for we're actually completely out of line with conscience
9283120	9288880	That's what I I think gardening is a beautiful thing. I think rooting ourself in that deep
9289520	9294960	Groundedness with the earth is so foundational to transforming ourselves and transforming the world
9295200	9297360	But if we're not stepping outside of our bubble
9298080	9302480	We're not aligned with god. We're not aligned with conscience. We're actually just
9303280	9305760	Faking it. We're we're middle-class white people
9306400	9308400	wanting to feel good
9308400	9310400	And so I think
9310640	9316400	Is I hope doesn't admonish people so much that they don't feel that every small thing you do makes a difference
9317120	9319040	Every little thing even if you didn't step
9319680	9322640	You know, you didn't bat your eyelashes to kill that little
9323920	9328960	Or whatever it is everything even if you die tomorrow the little things you did today
9329920	9335600	Made some difference and so that's that's the ground that we work from is that foundation
9336160	9338160	Everything makes a difference
9338160	9339760	but if I'm going to be
9339760	9344640	Absolutely if I'm going to be true to our bigger ancestry and I'm going to give my life to god
9344800	9346800	I'm going to give my life to conscience
9347120	9348880	There can't be any
9348880	9352960	Cans and butts about that. It's actually everything is on the line
9353600	9357520	And that means I'm willing I'm going to recognize that we do live in a world
9357760	9359760	That's much more complicated than it was
9360240	9363680	100 years ago and if human envy is going to be a good steward of this planet
9364240	9368400	We're probably going to get it need to be a little bit better at sense making what's going on
9369200	9370640	we're also
9370640	9377200	Going to get a lot better at solving our problems interrelationally with one another we're going to have to get better at peacemaking
9377840	9382480	Um, I think that the main thing I would say is you know, we were saying the problem is the institutions
9382560	9385680	The problem isn't the institutions. We don't have a global institution
9385920	9392640	There's its complete rule of power by tooth and claw and in our anarchy and its worst sets
9393120	9395120	At the at the global level
9395280	9398720	That's not that's not entirely true. I want to you know, the un has been amazing
9398880	9403280	There's been things that have progressed us against that trend towards violence
9403920	9407760	um, and and there's really earnest people fighting for that. Um
9408800	9410160	but
9410160	9412160	We need global cooperation
9412320	9417520	If we want to be a wise steward of this planet and to do that we have to do deep peacemaking
9418000	9421680	Not shallow. Oh, why don't you just all get along kind of peacemaking but like
9422320	9427600	Resolving historical trauma kind of peacemaking and creating peace between peoples
9428400	9429040	um
9429040	9435040	And then we have to I think humble ourselves before the living world that we're all apart and realize that there's a wisdom
9435120	9438160	Implicit in all of this that is so much faster
9438720	9445840	Than anything we have to touch with and if we're able to surrender ourselves to that and say that's actually that's the prime objective
9446800	9449200	Is just to be a an instrument
9449840	9451200	of that that's
9451200	9456320	To me what conscience would have me do and I do think I would push back against any one didn't today
9457200	9459200	but I I I see
9459520	9461520	Maybe it's just a mystical sense
9461840	9464800	That uh, the force of non-violence is as of yet
9465120	9467280	Unrealized in its fullness in the world
9467920	9470240	And that's what I want to see qe w leaning into
9470880	9472880	Um not tomorrow but today
9475840	9477840	You
9487280	9492240	And Rebecca I'm realizing sorry I was thank you Rebecca
9494800	9501760	So I want to thank you and I want to thank sue ellen. I think sue ellen you have a lot of wisdom about
9502320	9504320	a strategy for
9504320	9506000	moving forward
9506000	9510240	But I I really want us all to listen to one another by
9511040	9513680	listening in tongues because I'm going to
9515600	9517600	Speak to the first question
9518640	9519920	um
9519920	9525600	I don't usually come to these gatherings, but I I really felt compelled after listening to
9526880	9528880	a
9529040	9531040	Presentation daniel spoke
9532160	9534160	That was sent to me
9535040	9537040	So I came tonight
9538000	9542640	I'm a part of new england yearly meeting on abinackey unceded territory
9543680	9544960	and
9544960	9547760	in their earth care ministry committee
9549680	9551680	And um
9552080	9554000	number one
9554000	9556880	I've got three points one is that
9559120	9561120	The love of god
9561120	9563120	However, you interpret that
9564080	9566080	Calms our fears
9569680	9571680	Calms our fears
9574160	9577680	The second point as a social scientist
9579760	9583040	I really believe in something that he's just shared about
9584080	9586080	We need to create
9586080	9588080	places of trauma
9588560	9590560	informed
9590640	9592640	gatherings
9593360	9596400	That are part of our
9598320	9600320	Specialties
9601200	9603760	Our specialties as scientists
9604800	9607360	Whether that be social or natural
9608800	9611200	Or physical sciences
9613600	9616080	Whether that be as farmers
9616960	9618960	Or as
9618960	9620960	Pastors or as
9620960	9622960	Economists
9623360	9625360	Whatever that is
9627040	9629040	To humbly sit together
9630480	9634800	And listen for spirit to talk to us deeply
9637280	9639840	And then come together and share those truths
9641440	9643440	That we have discerned
9643920	9645920	That will move us forward
9647520	9649520	On a path
9649680	9651680	That maybe
9652960	9655760	able to speak to some of those entities that
9658240	9661840	Know our language and would be able to hear us
9664320	9666320	From the voice that we have that is
9667520	9670880	somewhat unique as a people of faith
9673600	9675600	And lastly
9678240	9681440	Live into those paradigms that we have discerned
9682400	9684400	Through the spirit
9685840	9690320	That we don't have to keep doing what is being done
9692880	9698000	We can move in that new way just like our early early forebears
9699280	9701280	Moved in a different
9701360	9704400	Way than the culture around them
9706560	9708560	We can do the same
9709520	9713600	We can be known as those wacky quakers
9716640	9720480	Don't quite walk the same walk or talk the same talk
9723280	9729840	That was number three so anyway, thank you very much. Thank you for this program
9730800	9742800	I'm noticing that Juniper is on the move but Chamba, Nora and Juniper's hand is raised. Nora, are you wanting to share?
9745520	9751760	Yeah, sorry Juniper was needing constant movement right now and I wasn't going to be able to think in
9753040	9755840	So dad took him for a second
9760560	9762560	I
9766800	9771040	I mean what what was really pulling at me raising my hand um
9772160	9774160	Why was my hand was
9774880	9776400	I think that
9776400	9780880	I actually don't want to frame it that way. I I have a deep felt knowing
9781600	9784800	I'm not even going to say sense. I have a I have a deeply felt knowing
9786240	9788240	um
9789040	9791040	That
9793120	9798960	Quakers are being called and have been just for some time to get really uncomfortable
9801600	9809200	And I think that's been dawning on us slower than it should be slower than it needs to be
9811520	9815200	Um, I mean, I think it there's of course
9815280	9820960	I've heard echoes of that today already, but there's a
9822800	9826560	There's a deep discomfort that we need to step into
9828160	9832080	And I think QEW is a part of that. I think we
9838880	9842240	I think any moment that we feel righteous we should question
9842800	9845440	And I heard that in Daniel's talk around
9846400	9851360	You know, if you think that you if you think you know, you're probably causing harm
9861200	9867440	We are having a conversation in this house. I think it was last night my sense of time is a little weird since having a baby. Um
9867840	9869840	Um
9870240	9872640	But we are having a conversation about different
9874720	9876720	Different cultures in different ways of
9880880	9882880	Of just approaching things and
9884080	9887360	And how what we think is like what's needed
9888240	9894080	Is coming from our own cultural frame and I think those kinds of conversations are really important
9898400	9905200	But I think that we can't get too hung up on trying to be so perfect as to know everyone's cultural frame
9906480	9908080	As to know
9908080	9913360	What's going to be the deep understanding that's underneath all of it. It's okay. We have our cultural frame
9915040	9919280	If someone came into our circle, they were like, well for my political frame, this is what we understand
9919440	9922480	We wouldn't say, oh, well, let's go deeper than that because that's not
9923440	9928960	That's cultural frame. That's not valid. We we'd say, oh, thank you so much for bringing that
9931920	9934560	We need to get uncomfortable enough to say
9935520	9937520	This is my frame
9938480	9942800	This is where I'm coming from and I'm a piece of the puzzle and I'm gonna step in
9943840	9950000	And that's uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable to claim something because when you claim something you can be ostracized for it
9953360	9956080	And actually you're gonna have to change it the moment you claim it
9956160	9960480	You have to change it because the moment you claim it you start learning about it and you start learning about yourself
9960560	9962560	Oh, this is my experience of being human
9966000	9970480	And then it starts to shift and how uncomfortable to be on shifting sand all the time
9972800	9978320	But I think that's where god wants us to go. I think that's where spirit always has lived
9983200	9985200	You
9989520	9995200	You think there's other things that that come to me about the whole question of rite of passage and and
9999360	10003200	And the frame of a rite of passage feels really powerful, but um
10004400	10009120	Honestly, none of that is feeling very led for me to say so I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stop there
10012800	10016560	As your partner, I'm very moved
10018560	10020560	Um, that was really powerful
10021600	10023600	Thor
10024000	10030240	Man so many many good people that talks tonight. I just I'm thoroughly impressed
10031920	10034720	I'm gonna summon up the game of rock paper scissors
10035440	10036880	because
10036880	10041040	A lot of us would like to pick up a sword and battle it out, but that's just not
10041600	10044640	Politically correct anymore, especially in a democracy
10045680	10050080	So that we switch over the paper and it's really a political legislative process
10050400	10056160	Getting out the vote going to door to door getting the right people in congress and we already know what they're gonna vote on
10056240	10062080	They're gonna vote for reforms. They're gonna do the right thing or close enough. That's how represented democracy works
10063760	10068960	And some of us well, let's just say rock is easier to break up than to change your mind
10069120	10071680	We've got brains. We soak up information
10072320	10078080	Um, I mean I I I was faced with a genetic condition my son. I went into a medical library
10078240	10081600	No background in medicine 10 hours later. I had the diagnosis
10082400	10084720	I can do those kind of mental gymnastics
10085440	10087120	Most people can't
10087120	10092000	Most people can't spend a couple hours a day just trying to keep current on what's going on out there in the science world
10093360	10096720	But I find hope in knowing what's going on
10097280	10103280	Even if it's in the early stages, you know, vanadium peroxide soaks up carbon dioxide
10103520	10109280	Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it's not but I'm sure it's going to be either replaced by something better or it will do
10111040	10114400	That that's the realm of people spend two hours a day every day
10114720	10117280	Soaking up information because that's something I'm good at
10117840	10123280	So I'm a rock. I know it. I'm a lousy politician and I certainly don't want to go with a broadsword out there
10124000	10131600	But we got a system of domination. It's a kinder, gentler one. We see it in our housing. We see it in our financial system
10132000	10134000	We see it in our retirement system
10134960	10136960	And I I
10137040	10141840	I love the problems we have in the United States solely because I know they're worse everywhere else. They go in the world
10142880	10144320	so
10144320	10147520	I'm just saying being aware is so powerful
10148320	10152640	And getting out and you know, if you're really going to say you love your neighbor
10153360	10155840	You're willing to get outside. You're a little little bubble
10157440	10161600	And I hear you say you love nature, but I really like meeting people that are really different than me
10163920	10166000	They think differently. They're culturally different
10167040	10173600	That's what's really going to change and I think that is the the singular strength of a group like this is we can get out
10174000	10176000	and meet our neighbors
10176400	10179840	And we can make a persuasive story that you know
10179840	10183440	I think God calls us to be a servant
10184480	10189520	We are called to do the right thing. We're not supposed to be a reactionary. We're not supposed to be afraid to change
10190000	10192000	We don't have such rocks, you know
10192640	10195680	Set rules about the way it should be like it was in 1940
10198160	10201680	And that is I think you're this the signature power of this group
10202960	10204960	I don't know. I got I'm really impressed
10205280	10207280	You
10207600	10213280	Thank you Thor we'll keep in conversation. Um, uh, allen
10216000	10218480	Oh, I was kind of hoping you wouldn't call on me
10220320	10221840	I
10221840	10225360	I've I've been listening to everyone and really
10226160	10230000	appreciating all the deep and moving wisdom and the um
10230960	10238880	And and I feel like what I mostly have to bring is uh confusion and I'm I'm kind of wrestling deeply with a lot of what uh
10240240	10242240	Daniel brought forth, but um
10243520	10245520	there's
10245680	10248240	Part of me that is pushing back
10250080	10255040	Against uh, I found I found a lot of our conversations and but there's been little
10255840	10257840	glimmerings
10258080	10262720	Of something else, but I found a lot of them tonight to be very human bounded
10264000	10266000	um
10266720	10274240	That uh, when I look from my geo and it's really I think more my geological perspective than my quaker perspective
10274640	10279680	this kind of pushing back on that that uh, when I look at nature
10280720	10282720	I don't see
10283280	10285280	um
10285760	10290320	Well competition is certainly the norm, but it's always
10291040	10293040	eventually ultimately bounded
10293920	10295920	and cooperation
10296880	10301040	Is also the norm and um
10303440	10308880	I think this it's not just human bounded but time bounded but that
10309120	10318080	In the rise of western civilization there was this domination mindset that emerged
10318960	10324800	and it's uh, it's a fire and the um
10326080	10328080	lack of fire
10328800	10330800	It's burning
10331120	10334320	Literally, I mean every time we drive a car
10335520	10337520	We're burning the earth
10338240	10340240	and
10341440	10343440	Like all fires
10344480	10345680	It's a
10345680	10352960	Daniel referred to exponential growth a number of times. This is growing exponentially that is growing exponentially and
10353600	10359520	I think uh for years I taught my students that all exponential growth
10360160	10366800	Is ultimately self limiting that nothing can grow exponentially and it's only in the last year
10368080	10370080	That I realized that was wrong
10371920	10373920	That there's another kind of fire
10377840	10381520	That uh, there are things it's only things
10383520	10385520	That consume
10387440	10391200	That can't grow exponentially things that produce
10392800	10394800	Things that are generative love
10395200	10397200	No
10398800	10404400	No wisdom, I won't say know how know how governed by wisdom
10405600	10407600	That can grow exponentially
10408800	10412800	And so the question the confusion the thing I'm wrestling with
10413200	10417200	I have I keep having this image of moses
10420400	10422400	In the uh
10422640	10424640	Meeting the burning bush
10426400	10431200	And it was a burning with a fire that did not consume
10432640	10444160	And my theory of that my thought of that has always been that what was transformational there
10447200	10452320	Was not that that bush was any different than any other bush or any tree
10452400	10455280	Any animal or any being including us
10456240	10458240	Is that moses
10458880	10461360	Saw the life force in it
10462400	10464400	Whether there was some
10465120	10467680	Sometimes I've looked at our redbud trees and
10468480	10473120	In spring and I've thought oh, is that the burning bush? Is that the
10474480	10476480	That life force
10479680	10481680	And he recognized
10483040	10485040	The spirit
10486000	10487200	In that
10487200	10494320	The god and he took off his shoes to make himself more like the bush to grow to find that deep rooting
10496080	10503040	And I there there he was often the wilderness in some ways. I think you're one person
10507360	10509360	Meeting god
10510320	10516240	Yet he transformed the world from that experience
10518720	10527520	And I think that fire and genia alluded to it and other people alluded to it ultimately I think it's love
10530800	10532800	And
10533120	10537680	So my question is what kind of fire burns in us
10539440	10541440	I
10544320	10546320	I'll just leave it with that
10553040	10554480	I'm just gonna
10554480	10559280	share something and I think when you're talking about cooperative and competitive forces
10560400	10565600	But I think in I mean sew on if you feel called, please do share but I'm thinking that that might have been
10566400	10568400	That might have been our moment
10568880	10572880	Just leave it with what I'll say. So if you want to share though, please do great. Well
10574240	10576240	All right, Thor if you're willing
10576640	10578640	Is it a final?
10578960	10580960	Just a final piece
10581120	10584080	Yep final piece and it's kind of a prayer
10585280	10587280	I'm going to just relate
10588160	10590160	That after my first son died
10591040	10593040	I gave thanks to him
10593040	10595040	I gave thanks for his life
10595120	10597280	I gave thanks for the influence it had on me
10598480	10600480	And it felt like the sky burned
10602800	10605280	So when I read that mozo saw the burning bush
10606400	10608400	I know he was in that
10608400	10610000	mindset
10610000	10613520	To be thankful for the things that we all fear
10615680	10618480	The things that scare us the things that challenge us
10620400	10625600	And I've never felt so in awe and so strong in my life as that day
10626320	10630560	And that's what I wish for you and all the challenges we face
10631920	10636400	That you look them in and understand them and give thanks for them
10637040	10642240	Because we are born in a time where there's good great promise and great challenge
10644080	10646080	And if you are so blessed
10646880	10648880	The sky will burn for you
10655600	10658560	You
10685600	10688560	You
10715920	10717920	You
10722080	10724240	I was gonna post this in the chat, but
10725920	10729440	I couldn't find it. I just didn't want to disturb the silence, but
10730720	10734800	There's a prayer from pema children that she shares
10737840	10741920	In her book the places that scare you and she says
10742080	10746480	May the roots of all suffering diminish
10748400	10752400	May hatred violence addiction and neglect also decrease
10754560	10761280	And we see all that separates us as as insubstantial as our dreams
10763760	10767440	May we go to the places that scare us
10767440	10771200	May you be a warrior of light
