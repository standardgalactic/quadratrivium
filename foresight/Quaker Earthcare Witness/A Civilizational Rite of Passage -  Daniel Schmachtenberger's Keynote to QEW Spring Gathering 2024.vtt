00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
It's my great joy to introduce Daniel Schmockenberger to you all.

00:10.600 --> 00:21.160
Daniel is a wonderful polymath, really extraordinary public speaker who is the head of the Civilization

00:21.160 --> 00:29.240
Research Institute and co-founder of the Conciliance Project and is probably, this is kind of the

00:29.240 --> 00:33.360
personal story, there's two people in the last five years of my life that have really

00:33.360 --> 00:41.000
dramatically shifted my world view, my spirituality, etc., and of people living, of living people

00:41.000 --> 00:45.960
I would say that Daniel and Robin Wall Kimmerer, who are brave and sweet grass, have been

00:45.960 --> 00:54.680
the two kind of major ships for me and have greatly not only shifted my view of the world

00:54.680 --> 00:59.600
and what we need to be doing in it, but also have really grounded me spiritually, have

00:59.600 --> 01:03.520
shifted my kind of heart sense of how to relate.

01:03.520 --> 01:08.080
And so obviously Daniel and I have met once before, but anytime I get to see Daniel, it's

01:08.080 --> 01:14.920
just a joy to bring him in and a joy to introduce him to the Quaker Earth Care Witness community,

01:14.920 --> 01:15.920
all others.

01:15.920 --> 01:21.440
So QEW is an organization, a Quaker organization that focuses on Earth Care concerns, we're

01:21.440 --> 01:26.840
a global network, and we're really excited to bring Daniel in here today to talk about

01:26.840 --> 01:31.840
a civilizational rite of passage, and obviously a rite of passage is something you don't know

01:31.840 --> 01:37.080
what the end of it is, you don't know if we're going to make it, if we're not going to make

01:37.080 --> 01:43.400
it, but what you can do is you can be faithful in the process, you can be true in the process.

01:43.400 --> 01:49.080
And I think that this being true is something that Daniel often refers to as deep earnestness.

01:49.080 --> 01:56.560
And so we're going to sort of investigate today some of what Daniel calls the metacrisis.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.720
It's a term that's kind of thrown in a number of sort of sense-making communities that are

02:02.720 --> 02:10.920
working on these large big picture topics, and how seeing that metacrisis coming under

02:10.920 --> 02:16.520
the weight of that, how we can respond to it in a powerful and spiritual way.

02:16.520 --> 02:22.000
So with that, I just want to, those are my opening comments, and I just want to invite

02:22.000 --> 02:30.240
Daniel, do you have anything you want to share before we kind of dive in?

02:30.240 --> 02:34.240
My mom went to a friend's school when she was a kid and always spoke very highly of

02:34.240 --> 02:41.000
her experience and had a mentor for a while when I was a kid named Dr. Everett Slumis.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.360
He was one of the kind of pioneers of natural medicine in the West and got to live on a

02:47.160 --> 02:51.680
health retreat that he had when I was young, and he was a Quaker.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.760
And so I have not got to experience Quaker community very much myself, but I have very

02:56.760 --> 02:58.920
positive associations.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.880
And so it was cool when you told me about this.

03:02.880 --> 03:10.480
And if my schedule is not overful with the timely things we're working on, I would have

03:10.480 --> 03:15.680
joined you for the whole day because I like the tone of what you shared with me that you're

03:15.680 --> 03:25.560
exploring here together, the spirituality that is in service of ecology, life, well,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.120
deep earnestness and deep humility.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.000
So being that you've had a full day and I haven't had all that, I hope that this weaves.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.320
And I'm just happy to be here.

03:36.320 --> 03:41.240
And I also said yes to coming just because of the way that in our limited interaction,

03:41.240 --> 03:47.600
talking once, but also just the way I've seen you post online is clear that you are a very

03:48.080 --> 03:51.000
caring, thoughtful, earnest person.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.760
And I, yeah, I like to support activities and people like that.

03:58.080 --> 04:03.560
Yeah, I think Daniel, some of the people in our community have probably heard me say things

04:03.560 --> 04:09.520
like humanity has reached a point where we've become too powerful to remain in rivalry with

04:09.520 --> 04:10.240
ourselves.

04:11.120 --> 04:18.240
And that, you know, the problem is that we have a profound gap between our capacities as a

04:18.240 --> 04:20.120
species and the wisdom that guides them.

04:20.760 --> 04:25.600
And I would say that of everyone I attribute that sort of framing to, it's you.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.360
And I think that the beauty of the really extraordinary thing is that you bring out that

04:32.280 --> 04:35.600
framing, not just as a way to understand our own times and what needs to be done in them, but

04:35.600 --> 04:37.560
also as a way of understanding of how we got here.

04:37.560 --> 04:43.600
How did a species that clearly does not want to destroy its own climate do that collectively,

04:43.600 --> 04:44.680
nonetheless, right?

04:44.680 --> 04:52.560
How is it that collective decisions that no one would want end up becoming, you know, almost

04:52.560 --> 04:58.320
unavoidable, like the momentum is so extraordinary that nothing can seem to overcome it.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.880
And so if we can kind of talk about that and talk about its relation, this is what Daniel calls

05:03.960 --> 05:10.040
the metacrisis and talk about how that relates to our understanding of history.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.040
I just want to open that, open that to you.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.120
What is the metacrisis and where are we in that?

05:22.080 --> 05:33.400
Yeah, I just share in starting that in general, I don't like talking about this publicly,

05:33.640 --> 05:39.640
because it's mostly not empowering and just kind of despair causing uselessly.

05:40.920 --> 05:47.800
I mostly talk about it to institutions and flancer pests and whatever where there is

05:47.800 --> 05:51.000
something they can do and try to tailor it to what they they can do.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.560
It's not that there isn't any way we can relate to it more effectively.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.680
You come to understand the whole picture more.

06:01.960 --> 06:12.800
We it's devastating before it's empowering, it can be motivating and ennobling, but it also the

06:12.800 --> 06:17.440
analysis shows that most of the things that one could be hopeful about work.

06:19.520 --> 06:26.000
And so there is like a there's a lot of faith actually required to want to engage with that in

06:26.000 --> 06:30.400
a meaningful way because you have to go through a kind of crucible to come out on the other end

06:31.360 --> 06:32.720
in some way empowered.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.920
And I think if it I think it's because there's a spiritual practice and a community holding

06:37.920 --> 06:39.920
each other here that I feel okay talking about it.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.120
You're mentioning climate change and you know this kind of obligate nature.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.720
The first paper on scientific paper on climate change was published in 1938.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.560
The United Nations Environmental Programme recognizing the need for international coordination

07:00.560 --> 07:06.320
on global commons issues was made in 1972 well over 50 years ago.

07:06.320 --> 07:11.760
And climate change has become one of the biggest existential risk topics in the world.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.160
It has over a trillion dollars a year in climate funding.

07:15.040 --> 07:21.840
And every with the exception of global recessions every single year we use more fossil fuels

07:21.920 --> 07:22.560
in the year before.

07:23.680 --> 07:32.000
And during that whole time all of the solar wind renewable energy all the hydro and the damaging

07:32.000 --> 07:37.200
effect of the dams and all of the nuclear and the entire risk of the nuclear energy hasn't even

07:37.200 --> 07:40.480
slowed the increase in fossil fuels use one year.

07:44.240 --> 07:51.360
And so when you look at and yet the most fascinating thing is there is literally no one

07:51.360 --> 07:54.640
who wants climate change as like a strategic objective.

07:57.280 --> 08:02.240
There I mean yes you can say that the Russians are capitalizing on the fact that they get a

08:02.240 --> 08:03.600
new shipping route through the Arctic.

08:04.720 --> 08:10.720
But no one has climate change as an objective and yet nobody can stop it.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.720
Because everybody wants energy because energy is one for one course

08:16.720 --> 08:22.960
related with GDP and this ability to actuate anything and money has to exponentially grow

08:22.960 --> 08:26.960
every year to keep up with the interest which means that the energy demand has to exponentially

08:26.960 --> 08:27.520
grow every year.

08:28.880 --> 08:34.240
And the solar plant is going to take 10 years worth of the energy that it produces out of

08:35.120 --> 08:36.880
fossil fuel energy to make up front.

08:37.920 --> 08:43.440
And then we don't decide to make less fossil fuel energy it's we just make all of the stuff in

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
which there is energy return on energy investment.

08:46.960 --> 08:54.000
While there are plenty of groups that don't care enough about species extinction nobody

08:54.000 --> 08:57.600
really wants species extinction and nobody really wants

09:00.800 --> 09:03.920
PFOS in literally every raindrop in the world which it is now.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.920
As an ubiquitous carcinogen and stuff or

09:10.560 --> 09:15.760
there's 230 million chemicals in the American Chemical Society database almost all of them

09:15.760 --> 09:20.720
are toxic cancels, antigens, endocrine disruptors whatever.

09:21.680 --> 09:26.640
The curve of the increasing autoimmune diseases, the increasing autism, the increasing

09:26.640 --> 09:31.600
Alzheimer's, the increasing psychiatric diseases follows the curve of those chemicals

09:31.600 --> 09:35.920
and nobody wants a toxic planet and also nobody can stop it.

09:38.160 --> 09:43.280
And the total set of all activities that has been done since Silent Spring was written

09:43.280 --> 09:48.160
since the environmental movement started we have put more toxic chemicals each year into

09:48.160 --> 09:51.440
the environment than the year before and innovated more new ones.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.640
And it's not just that the processes have been ineffective it's that many of them have made

09:58.640 --> 10:10.480
things worse right that if we say okay because of climate change and fossil fuel use we really

10:10.480 --> 10:18.080
need to push non-fossil fuel energy so we push more nuclear and so now we get increased risk of

10:18.080 --> 10:23.680
warfare associated with nuclear and toxic waste and etc and it doesn't slow fossil fuels and

10:23.680 --> 10:28.000
then you do more dams and so you destroy more ecosystems and create more geopolitical tensions

10:28.000 --> 10:34.720
between the countries that share the river it's typically the case that the way that we go about

10:34.720 --> 10:41.120
solving the problems doesn't work and makes them worse and I didn't have that analysis when I was

10:41.120 --> 10:45.440
young and started and was kind of like hopeful that we could just put more energy into the things.

10:47.520 --> 10:54.400
So why? Like why is this? I would also say when you were talking you mentioned that

10:56.480 --> 11:03.280
there are certain kind of like principles that come from conscience that were things people

11:03.280 --> 11:08.160
could choose before but they're obligate now because self-termination on this path is the

11:08.160 --> 11:15.680
otherwise impending possibility. I wouldn't even say that they were possible before they were impossible

11:18.320 --> 11:28.240
because if you held a set of views that did not mount effective military forces and Genghis Khan

11:28.240 --> 11:31.920
and his men or Alexander the Great or the Ottomans or whatever were coming you were slaughtered.

11:34.240 --> 11:38.720
And there have been a lot of peaceful beautiful cultures throughout history that listened to their

11:38.720 --> 11:46.160
conscience and got slaughtered. We just did an analysis of this on you know the history of

11:47.840 --> 11:56.640
selection via warfare and you know Genghis Khan and his men alone in his life not the entire

11:56.640 --> 12:04.080
Mongols killed 50 million people on horseback without nuclear weapons without industrial weapons

12:04.080 --> 12:08.240
killed 50 million people. That was 11% of the entire global population

12:11.040 --> 12:15.280
including lots of lovely cultures that because they were lovelier didn't mount huge militaries

12:15.760 --> 12:17.760
and

12:21.200 --> 12:27.760
fascinatingly it's actually a really just weird irony that the current estimate is that 11% of

12:27.760 --> 12:33.760
all Asians today are Genghis Khan's descendants because the amount of rape that he and then the

12:33.760 --> 12:37.600
genetics of that family did so kill the people do all the raving. So

12:37.680 --> 12:43.680
and then when you look at that for

12:45.920 --> 12:54.240
Dutch colonization in the Congo and Attila and blah blah blah you realize that we alive today

12:54.240 --> 12:58.960
are the descendants memetically and genetically of the most successful conkers

13:01.120 --> 13:06.400
and that the Tibetans could keep a relatively nice set of ideas as long as they were remote

13:06.400 --> 13:10.960
enough that nobody cared about their land that much and as soon as it became clear that they

13:10.960 --> 13:17.920
controlled the watershed between two billion person populations uh then a violent culture

13:17.920 --> 13:24.400
slaughtered them and the same with the Native Americans and the colonizers here the the population

13:24.400 --> 13:31.600
of North and South America before colonizers came was 140 million people and colonization

13:31.600 --> 13:39.360
wiped out over 90% of them that's it that's a lot of people and that means those those ways of being

13:39.360 --> 13:45.440
those those non-alphabetic languages those non-written languages those systems of medicine

13:45.440 --> 13:52.160
those poetries those all of that you know wiped out of history so I don't think it was possible

13:52.160 --> 13:55.760
like an individual could try to be lovely and the tribe could try to be lovely but you didn't

13:55.760 --> 13:59.440
actually make it through history that way and you most certainly didn't shape the world very much that

13:59.440 --> 14:08.800
way and so this topic of the you know kind of a multipolar trap somebody does something that provides

14:08.800 --> 14:15.360
so much near-term competitive advantage that everyone else is obligated to do that or lose

14:15.360 --> 14:23.840
and lose means your ideas don't make it through selection that has been an amazingly powerful

14:23.840 --> 14:33.760
part of a very perverse selection process and this is still the case and this is why open AI that

14:33.760 --> 14:42.000
was founded to because of the fear of market-driven AI and the need to make a very well-funded

14:42.000 --> 14:49.360
research institute to focus on slowing down market AI risk became the company like switched

14:49.440 --> 14:54.640
from a non-profit to a for-profit and accelerate AI risk more than any and it's why then

14:55.600 --> 14:59.680
seeing that that was happening and saying it was bad a part of open AI broke off created

14:59.680 --> 15:04.720
anthropic to really do AI risk work and then realized that in order to do that they needed

15:04.720 --> 15:10.160
a lot of money to have big AI systems they took the money became a for-profit and now are also racing

15:10.960 --> 15:17.680
and so again what that happened is pretty much everyone got into the multipolar trap of

15:18.400 --> 15:24.800
the dude with more power wins there is no way out of this and unless you want to just die with

15:24.800 --> 15:31.360
dignity you okay we have to win and we have to do whatever violent etc thing is going to let us

15:31.360 --> 15:37.040
win but then we'll be the good guys and this is basically the state of geopolitics between

15:37.040 --> 15:49.440
us and china right now and many many places so in that way ethics are constraints on strategic

15:49.440 --> 15:55.520
possibilities and those who have less of them have less constraints and those win at strategy

15:56.400 --> 16:05.840
and so one cannot afford to have them right which is why there are so many

16:06.640 --> 16:12.400
real politic theorists to basically say if you have any ethics you're an asshole

16:14.000 --> 16:18.080
because what you're actually saying is that you don't care about anything enough to be effective

16:19.840 --> 16:24.320
yeah and if you really want to be effective you have to win and you got to do what it takes

16:24.320 --> 16:30.480
so if you care you'll be you know you'll you'll do the Machiavellian thing which is such a weird

16:30.480 --> 16:34.720
you know basically it's what happened to Soromon and Lord of the Rings right it's what happens

16:34.720 --> 16:45.200
again and again power winning is inevitable and therefore embracing it is actually ethical

16:45.200 --> 16:49.840
because it's your only way to influence it and so that's the co-opting of the ethics right

16:49.840 --> 16:55.600
but what's the other choice so there's a way in which just choosing to die with dignity well

16:55.600 --> 17:02.560
we'll be ethical our hands will be clean while the world burns yeah um and if you look at the history

17:04.080 --> 17:08.480
the Jane Goodall's of the world have not had the level of influence on the world system the

17:08.480 --> 17:21.120
Kissingers have had not by a billion to one and the minds and heart the the developmental process

17:21.120 --> 17:27.120
that makes a Jane Goodall does not give you Kissinger skills the developmental process

17:27.120 --> 17:31.200
that gives you Kissinger skills does not give you Jane Goodall values they are almost developmentally

17:31.200 --> 17:37.200
mutually exclusive yeah and yet we don't make it if we don't actually get both of those in

17:37.200 --> 17:45.680
the same beings now but where those skills are not in service to power and the perpetuation

17:45.680 --> 17:51.600
of the system but are in service to all sentience now and into perpetuity but that's that hard in

17:51.600 --> 18:04.480
that mind together right in the same beings and yeah so right now we obviously you know

18:04.720 --> 18:10.240
you know the crossed six of the nine planetary boundaries radically rapidly crossing the other

18:10.240 --> 18:18.240
ones all of the curves are accelerating if we tried to turn it around it's not even clear that we

18:18.240 --> 18:29.920
could um nobody really understands and obviously the the post-war order that maintained relative

18:30.560 --> 18:35.920
peace between superpowers meaning we only proxy ward through korean vietnam and whatever other

18:35.920 --> 18:42.880
places and economic warfare and etc that has completely broken down that kind of post-war

18:42.880 --> 18:49.120
order is not uh effective anymore at preventing major power conflict and so we can see that we

18:49.120 --> 18:56.080
have multiple three world war three escalation pathways hot right now which is why the atomic

18:56.080 --> 19:00.400
scientists moved the nuclear clock closer to midnight than it was during the cuba missile crisis

19:02.400 --> 19:08.400
and we see actually an increase in hawkishness everywhere and

19:10.960 --> 19:16.160
if you look at just even the rate of say ai and the reason that ai is so important more than

19:16.800 --> 19:24.080
any other category of tech it's because i can i can't use a nuclear weapon to make a bio weapon

19:24.400 --> 19:29.280
i can't use a nuclear weapons to make a financial system i can't use a bio weapon to make a financial

19:29.280 --> 19:33.600
system i can use ai to make better nukes and better bio weapons and better financial systems and

19:33.600 --> 19:45.040
better manufacturing and better propaganda so the race there the you know more's law was completely

19:46.000 --> 19:50.640
unprecedented in history being doubling the computing power every two years

19:53.120 --> 20:00.640
but every 18 months so you get an exponential curve currently just the hardware alone on gpu's

20:01.440 --> 20:08.400
is 10 xing the compute efficiency every six months not to mention that you also have an

20:08.400 --> 20:16.640
exponential curve on the software on the amount of data on the parameters and so every and this

20:16.640 --> 20:22.000
is why there's you know been about 30 trillion just invested in the last couple years trillion

20:22.960 --> 20:31.680
to win ai supremacy as the ring to rule them all and nobody who thinks they can win has any

20:31.680 --> 20:42.800
interest in multilateral agreements to slow it down so you could say these are times that were

20:42.800 --> 20:53.760
prophesied you could say that the end of kali yuga and the beginning of the possible beginning of

20:53.760 --> 20:59.600
satyuga you could say the time of purgatory or the end of the mayan calendar or whatever we're all

20:59.680 --> 21:06.640
roughly speaking to a similar thing and you could say that once you got the written word

21:07.280 --> 21:11.120
so you got history you know like a more kind of formal version of history

21:13.440 --> 21:19.600
it wasn't that hard for philosophers of the time to recognize that with populations increasing

21:19.600 --> 21:25.440
the wars killed more people because the number of people that gang is conkilled was more than

21:25.440 --> 21:30.160
the entire world population at the beginning of the agricultural revolution like just to have a

21:30.160 --> 21:34.800
sense right so with the increasing population killed more people with the increasing technology

21:34.800 --> 21:39.120
we killed more people from further distance right you get the crossbow you get the cannon you get

21:39.120 --> 21:46.960
the fowlings you get the and it's pretty clear to see that humans were not very good stewards of

21:46.960 --> 21:53.760
their power right every culture had class subjugation torture or whatever once we got into empire not

21:53.760 --> 22:00.960
pre-empire um and so the idea that we have that kind of mixed bag of some really lovely stuff

22:00.960 --> 22:05.040
but really wicked stuff but that the wicked stuff is getting larger populations with more tech

22:06.640 --> 22:12.400
and the wars are killing more people and we're like early civilizations were destroyed because of

22:12.400 --> 22:18.160
environmental overshoot right if you read tainter in the collapse of complex civilizations you can

22:18.160 --> 22:22.240
see that cutting down all the trees eroding the topsoil and the civilization fails has been

22:22.240 --> 22:31.200
happening for thousands of years so um but obviously with the capacity to destroy environments at

22:31.200 --> 22:38.480
larger scale you know the beginning of big belly ships and greater fishing and blah blah blah uh

22:38.480 --> 22:43.920
so you could prophesize hey this time is going to come to an end there's going to be a great

22:43.920 --> 22:47.920
reckoning the wickedness of our ways is going to have to be reconciled there's going to be a hard

22:47.920 --> 22:54.240
fork and either everybody decides we stop this kind of wickedness of our ways we become good

22:54.240 --> 22:59.680
stewards of power and as such as good stewards of power we reinstate the garden or something

22:59.680 --> 23:05.920
like that or we don't and it goes from purgatory to hell some to an end uh because this thing self

23:05.920 --> 23:18.960
terminates i i think those prophecies were pretty straightforward actually like pretty

23:18.960 --> 23:29.360
straightforwardly accurate and i do think we are at a time now where until nuclear weapons that

23:29.360 --> 23:34.000
couldn't have been you couldn't destroy everything that quickly obviously until industrial scale

23:34.080 --> 23:39.680
globalization you couldn't destroy the environment so uh we're really to the first time in the history

23:39.680 --> 23:44.560
of the world at this place where the ongoing viability of the world is up to us we couldn't

23:44.560 --> 23:53.680
have destroyed it before even when we tried and so it is it is true that it is obligate for us to

23:53.680 --> 23:57.520
become good stewards of power because if we continue to steward it the way we have we'll destroy

23:57.520 --> 24:03.920
ourselves it is also true that some people doing that not in the presence of other people doing

24:03.920 --> 24:09.360
it lose the game of influence if not the game of survival in the very short term to be able to make

24:09.360 --> 24:19.040
it through there's a book of romans the path to heaven is narrow and steep the path to hell is

24:19.040 --> 24:25.040
wide and many there is something like that there there is basically a needle that has to be thread

24:25.280 --> 24:34.080
and that is the uh hope for this time is the ability to properly thread the needle of

24:36.400 --> 24:41.760
that which will make us good stewards of power that can also navigate the space of power currently

24:41.760 --> 24:45.440
to influence it enough that it on its current trajectory doesn't mess everything up

24:49.280 --> 24:53.520
well i think that you know i want to talk a bit more about threading that needle

24:53.600 --> 25:00.720
and in particular it's become pretty clear to me in my study of you know when in academia we would

25:00.720 --> 25:06.720
call collective action problems or social traps which is what daniel just called the multi-polar

25:06.720 --> 25:14.160
trap that situation where you know vying geopolitical entities seek power and that the only way to get

25:14.160 --> 25:19.120
around this like i actually came to that realization at some level when i took western political

25:19.200 --> 25:24.000
philosophy too and i was reading thomas hobs and hobs you know has that war at all against all and

25:24.960 --> 25:29.200
i think that there's a lot of people in this room probably thinking well aren't there cooperative

25:29.200 --> 25:34.320
forces not just competitive forces and human history as well as an evolution i think that's a

25:34.320 --> 25:40.240
really valid argument maybe we'll come back to that but i want to talk about you know there's two

25:40.240 --> 25:47.600
kind of ways to get around a collective action problem and one of them is what hobs refer to

25:47.600 --> 25:51.520
as the little viathon which is you get enough power and you impose power and you make it so

25:51.520 --> 25:57.520
anyone who would do something that's not good you know that's competitive and trying to do the power

25:57.520 --> 26:05.040
gain you shut them down that's way one and the other way is through cooperation and that one's

26:05.040 --> 26:09.680
really hard i mean if anyone is you know folks who might have started the eco village or something

26:09.680 --> 26:15.280
like that in this talk and even getting just a few people to get along is hard right so we might

26:15.280 --> 26:22.400
come back to that but i think that what is really insightful here is that um we have to at some level

26:24.160 --> 26:30.480
through conscience through without ever getting you know you know as soon as you start down that road

26:30.480 --> 26:36.400
once you start down the dark path right through conscience we gain influence through conscience

26:36.400 --> 26:41.200
we have to at some level push in the same way that donby or others would have done you had

26:41.280 --> 26:46.720
extraordinary influence but you know he gained that influence not by being a really terrible

26:46.720 --> 26:51.760
player on the world stage but by acting in a conscientious way because we're a social species

26:51.760 --> 27:01.040
and we respond you know we we have a an immediate response to you know a mirror neuron type response

27:01.040 --> 27:09.200
if you're if you are acting a certain way i i feel that in my own self and and so there's a way in

27:09.200 --> 27:17.040
which um i just i guess i guess i wanted to talk to that a bit daniel do you see um that sort of

27:17.040 --> 27:26.320
path of like uniting conscience with um with uh i hate to call it spirit with strategy but i really

27:26.320 --> 27:32.000
you know maybe emphasis on the conscience part and then the strategy part has to be born of that

27:32.720 --> 27:38.880
right has to be born from the conscience piece um and then moving from there do you think that

27:38.880 --> 27:46.080
there's a pathway to thread that needle through the force of conscience through um prophetic voice

27:50.960 --> 27:57.440
now as a kid i was my mom was taking me to a bunch of protests and

27:58.720 --> 28:04.480
um you know various nonprofits pita and greenpeace and like that engage in an activism work

28:04.880 --> 28:15.360
i remember there was a few NGOs that came together to protest a nuclear waste dump being created

28:16.560 --> 28:24.000
and i got to see how the activists were organizing and i got to see how the

28:27.360 --> 28:32.160
nuclear and financial and legal entities on the other side were organizing a little bit just

28:32.160 --> 28:38.240
watching as a kid and there was this insight that came the the first level of the insight was the

28:40.880 --> 28:48.320
the activists are obviously motivated by something that is much less self-interest

28:48.320 --> 28:52.640
they're chaining themselves to things where they get hurt um they're willing to go to jail they're

28:53.360 --> 28:58.240
but their tools of strategy are chaining themselves to things and picket signs and like that

28:58.960 --> 29:06.000
and the tools of strategy on the other side are employing heaps of mathematicians and physicists

29:06.000 --> 29:11.920
and chemists and lobbyists and financiers and etc and it's just it's so obvious who's winning

29:12.560 --> 29:18.000
and you know like who's going to win and why but also who should right that distinction and i saw it as

29:18.000 --> 29:23.440
like a head heart divide at the level of humanity that had to be unified and then i looked a little

29:23.440 --> 29:29.840
bit later and thought of it as like a a head heart will um because i could see people where

29:31.920 --> 29:36.640
there if any two of the three didn't work right if someone had a lot of will and a lot of

29:37.200 --> 29:41.920
heart meaning like there was a lot of care about other beings and the willingness to take a lot of

29:41.920 --> 29:48.640
action but they didn't understand strategy well they were most activists if they could think about

29:48.640 --> 29:52.960
the complexity of the world well and the perverse incentives of financial motivations the lobbying

29:53.040 --> 29:57.200
on the other side etc and they cared a lot but they didn't have a lot of empowerment they were like

29:57.760 --> 30:05.440
kind of broken devastated liberal academics um if the heart was kind of shut down and they were

30:05.440 --> 30:10.480
mostly pursuing self-interest but they understood strategy and they were pretty empowered with

30:10.480 --> 30:15.360
will they were the people who ran the world and ran big oil companies and finance companies and

30:15.440 --> 30:22.960
military industrial companies and things like that and um so it was very clear that those coming

30:22.960 --> 30:32.160
together was necessary kind of requisite right and it is obvious that the strategy does not actually

30:32.160 --> 30:40.960
pick what is valuable it figures out how to do effective work towards what is valuable that

30:40.960 --> 30:50.720
comes from deeper places and so uh intellect and strategy in service of conscience is necessary

30:50.720 --> 30:55.920
right like there's no uh conscience that doesn't know how to be very effective

30:57.840 --> 31:07.360
is kind of a death with dignity strategy um and you know for me seeing that and being like

31:07.360 --> 31:15.680
if I work my ass off and all the animals are still in the factory farm I don't feel okay about that

31:15.680 --> 31:23.840
I don't feel some self-relief I don't feel proud like I I want to be effective at it and so

31:25.920 --> 31:29.600
a lot of people talk about not caring about the result as much but the process because in the

31:29.600 --> 31:34.320
when one over focuses on results they can go out of integrity I care about the relationship between

31:34.320 --> 31:44.800
the results and the process both right um now if you one other thing though is like let's say you

31:44.800 --> 31:48.640
take a look at Gandhi which is you know as good an exemplars you could get of this

31:51.920 --> 31:57.520
if you do a realism analysis right the kind of political school of realism coming out of

31:57.520 --> 32:03.840
real politic analysis of non-violence movements you get a very different perspective than the

32:03.840 --> 32:10.320
story the non-violence movements tell and I think it is a more historically and politically accurate

32:10.320 --> 32:17.360
one and it's important to understand if you want to be effective the realist analysis is

32:19.600 --> 32:24.240
Gandhi said that what happened with the British and India could have worked against Hitler

32:24.320 --> 32:30.720
total gibberish like complete obvious total gibberish um and

32:33.520 --> 32:40.320
in the only reason there were a few but the reason why at that particular time in India

32:40.320 --> 32:48.720
that was able to work is because as he said early in the career in his career there 20,000 British

32:48.720 --> 32:54.800
soldiers cannot rule 400 million Indians if the 400 million Indians don't consent they were already

32:54.800 --> 33:00.560
getting to the place of the willingness to have enough of their people die to violently kill all

33:00.560 --> 33:05.520
of the 20,000 soldiers there was a violence movement that he was holding at bay with the

33:05.520 --> 33:11.040
non-violence which is why they didn't kill him and every non-violence movement that has been

33:11.040 --> 33:16.720
effective against very against powers that are willing to enact violence has only been effective

33:16.720 --> 33:21.680
when it was the better alternative against violence as the alternative and a very similar

33:21.680 --> 33:28.160
thing was that in the assessment that so like if they'd killed Gandhi then the Indians would

33:28.160 --> 33:33.920
have started killing British soldiers at scale right the only reason he didn't get killed and

33:34.560 --> 33:40.640
so it's just important to understand that the reason that the US went ahead and made some

33:40.640 --> 33:44.560
provisions with Martin Luther King was because the power Malcolm X and the Black Panthers were

33:44.560 --> 33:49.280
getting a scaring the shit out of them and the idea of move the attention over here to the

33:49.280 --> 33:58.640
non-violence thing was like positive so the reason I bring this up is because if you want to look at

33:58.640 --> 34:03.920
previous precedents of things that were successful to be able to try to do successful work do your

34:03.920 --> 34:14.080
research well enough to say was it actually successful and how did it work so that's really

34:14.080 --> 34:20.560
powerful Daniel and I still you know sitting here I have a pretty deep conviction about

34:22.720 --> 34:30.480
using moving from a place of conscience to to shift the world in a better way and I think

34:30.480 --> 34:36.480
that conscience calls us to strategy I think that if we're really deeply in touch with conscience

34:37.360 --> 34:41.120
we do the strategy because we actually don't want to live in a world where what's happening in

34:41.120 --> 34:46.160
factory farms is happening in factory farms and we want to live in a world which is beautiful and

34:46.160 --> 34:54.080
hopeful I think a one step beyond the three part will art mine the chakras are a lovely system

34:54.960 --> 35:00.480
right if you I don't know if people here are familiar with it but the you know the yogic

35:00.480 --> 35:04.560
system and the egyptian system the chinese system are pretty similar so whenever there's a bunch of

35:04.560 --> 35:09.520
independent origination it's kind of interesting but each of them are different are thought of as

35:09.520 --> 35:19.280
different types of intelligence and that a full human approach is all of them and so if you

35:21.040 --> 35:24.960
I don't need to go through them here and take the time for it but if you are to think about

35:27.120 --> 35:31.520
to it we want to engage not with a part of the world but all of the world but we want to engage

35:31.520 --> 35:38.640
with all of the world with all of our self right and all of our self means all of our agency and

35:38.720 --> 35:42.800
all of our intellect all of our intuition all of our instinct all of those things in service of

35:42.800 --> 35:51.280
all the world so I think there was a talk that I really liked that Eckhart and the Dalai Lama

35:51.280 --> 35:57.440
did together one time where Eckhart was saying something about like in his language when you

35:57.440 --> 36:02.240
access the power of now you have increased coherence for capabilities at whatever it is that you're

36:02.240 --> 36:07.120
going to do and then somebody in the audience asked something about when you access that is

36:07.120 --> 36:10.480
it like accessing the Akashic records where you can just get anything and do anything

36:11.440 --> 36:16.720
and Eckhart was like I don't have that experience because like a great soccer player

36:18.400 --> 36:21.680
who gets quiet and goes into a place of stillness comes out and does the

36:23.840 --> 36:28.480
the free kick better than he would have otherwise but he's like if I went to do that I still wouldn't

36:28.480 --> 36:33.120
make the goal as Eckhart right he's like I don't I don't do that thing well when Einstein would go

36:33.120 --> 36:38.000
into silence he'd come out with math but Eckhart was like I never get math like I never get

36:38.000 --> 36:41.600
general relativity coming out of there and he asked the Dalai Lama he's like no I don't ever

36:41.600 --> 36:46.960
get general relativity because I didn't take that in and the same reason that when someone goes

36:46.960 --> 36:51.760
deeply into prayer they usually get answers in languages they speak they usually don't get them

36:51.760 --> 36:56.240
in Sanskrit or Mandarin or some language they don't speak so there's a place where listening

36:56.240 --> 37:00.720
to conscience it can only tell you things that you have also cultivated your being to understand

37:00.720 --> 37:08.800
so this is where the the models of what does it take to be effective such that you develop those

37:08.800 --> 37:15.200
in yourself such that as you're going into prayer and going into listening those languages exist

37:15.200 --> 37:23.760
within you to be spoken to is also important yeah well I feel like we've gone really deep

37:23.760 --> 37:29.760
and I think that I can imagine folks in the audience right now being like that is a harsh

37:29.760 --> 37:38.720
view of human history or of what we're what we're up against I suppose and the strategies that might

37:38.720 --> 37:49.280
work or approaches that might work and I mean I feel like I want to sort of finish out by

37:50.080 --> 37:56.720
sort of entering some of that stillness together and wondering if there's in particular a message to

37:56.720 --> 38:02.480
the QEW community to Quakers that you feel you know you were just mentioning you know like

38:03.120 --> 38:08.880
Einstein comes out with this what is the unique role of faith communities in this time

38:09.600 --> 38:17.280
and and what would what is the earnestness I don't know how many people here saw

38:17.360 --> 38:22.400
when this pope got put in place and he wrote the Lodato si encyclical

38:24.080 --> 38:28.800
if you saw it awesome if not it's really worth reading it's actually very beautiful and

38:30.320 --> 38:37.120
basically what he said was and I'm grossly paraphrasing there's been this kind of

38:38.400 --> 38:44.560
forever conversation or debate about is God transcendent beyond the creation or eminent

38:44.560 --> 38:53.360
indwelling within the creation I would say that the error in the direction of an overemphasis on

38:53.360 --> 38:59.840
transcendent over eminent has caused a lot of problems because we can destroy things here in a

38:59.840 --> 39:05.920
holy war for going to heaven or for good reincarnation or for getting off the wheel or whatever it is

39:05.920 --> 39:14.240
that makes that denies some of the sacredness of here and if you hold the creator indwells

39:14.240 --> 39:25.840
within its creation and any harm against creation is sin against the creator uh there's a much safer

39:25.840 --> 39:31.600
ethics that emerges so if you take the direction of eminence and basically what he said in the

39:31.600 --> 39:38.160
Lodato si is the eminence matters and that if you aren't an environmentalist protecting God's creation

39:38.160 --> 39:44.320
you aren't a Catholic now of course that was a fucking big deal to say like a God created all

39:44.320 --> 39:51.280
of this thing this is all sacred if you are harming God's creation you're in sin that doesn't mean

39:51.280 --> 39:56.400
that really changed anything because like so often would happen in something like Catholicism it's

39:56.400 --> 40:00.800
kind of like easy to moralize people while not actually changing the things that dispose their

40:00.800 --> 40:09.600
beliefs and behaviors and so what I would love to see follow is a okay what would it take then

40:10.240 --> 40:18.000
the Vatican to leverage its resources to say how do we help people deepen their understanding

40:18.000 --> 40:22.800
of nature their connection to it and change the perverse incentives that force you know

40:22.800 --> 40:28.320
environmental harm and things like that that'd be amazing I think all the faith communities have

40:28.320 --> 40:35.680
beliefs that could be emphasized you know like there are some Christians who focus on the wrath

40:35.680 --> 40:40.240
of the Leviticus God and the reasons to kill someone for violating the Sabbath or who focus

40:40.240 --> 40:43.760
on the forgiveness of Jesus and let he who has no sins cast the first stone you can kind of

40:43.760 --> 40:51.440
emphasize different aspects of it I think most of the faiths have things that if they were emphasized

40:51.520 --> 41:00.880
would be profoundly relevant to the situation today and when it comes to Quakers

41:04.560 --> 41:08.320
I don't I don't know I would need to ask a lot of questions and spend some time

41:08.320 --> 41:12.720
and to be very interested in but the you know there's like the starting place is

41:18.400 --> 41:18.640
if

41:22.400 --> 41:29.280
total global Quakers is a few hundred thousand right yeah probably yeah and

41:29.680 --> 41:38.400
so if we were to say that well that's a small population in one way it's a lot of people

41:39.120 --> 41:45.200
like a lot of people that have a some shared sense of what is meaningful sacred etc that

41:45.200 --> 41:49.840
they're willing to obviously live their lives differently based on make some sacrifices based on

41:51.040 --> 41:56.240
if they could come to understand the state of the world more rather than just kind of local issues

41:56.800 --> 42:02.960
understand you know the metacrisis the drivers and what addressing that would take and have

42:05.040 --> 42:14.160
their life as a group not just individually be coordinated in service of helping the world move

42:14.720 --> 42:19.040
through this point in history

42:19.760 --> 42:26.560
not to the direction of self-destruction or totalizing dystopias but in the direction of

42:27.280 --> 42:32.960
you know something like reinstatement of a garden what would it mean for that to actually become

42:32.960 --> 42:38.480
the timely imperative of Quakers as a whole that they could coordinate towards that'd be very interesting

42:39.520 --> 42:47.120
yeah well I think it's actually we're almost perfectly on track I want to kind of transition at the 45-minute mark

42:47.840 --> 42:54.000
since our opening worship to bring in some questions from the audience and do you want to ask your question

42:55.840 --> 43:06.080
yeah um yeah so in humanity's phase shift which is what Keith the video that a lot of us watched before

43:08.080 --> 43:14.960
coming to hear you today Daniel um you said that reconditioning our felt sense of

43:15.520 --> 43:22.960
interconnectedness with everything um won't won't be easy and will require a fundamental shift of our consciousness

43:24.400 --> 43:30.800
um and I thought that the ways you the three things that you offered as ways to reconnect were

43:32.000 --> 43:38.720
we're humorous and I wanted to ask how that has changed but the three things you offered were

43:38.960 --> 43:44.960
to be in nature, do psychedelics and have more intimate relationships with more people

43:46.400 --> 43:52.800
and so how have your modes of reconnection changed in the last five years since that conversation in that video?

43:56.640 --> 44:05.760
first I'll say um there's a woman named Vanessa Andreade she wrote a beautiful book called

44:06.080 --> 44:12.880
Hospicing Modernity and I got to speak with recently um indigenous woman who's actually a

44:13.520 --> 44:18.800
leading some amazing educational projects in Canada and we just talked and she told me that the way that her

44:19.600 --> 44:26.720
chief defines colonialism and I thought this was very beautiful uh had nothing to do with taking other people's land or

44:27.760 --> 44:33.760
violence or property ownership or whatever that those were all epiphenomenon that the heart of colonialism

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
is believing there are separable things

44:40.800 --> 44:46.960
and deeper than believing that is perceiving the world as separable things the pattern of perception cultivated

44:48.880 --> 44:50.880
and

44:51.760 --> 44:53.760
that

44:53.840 --> 44:55.840
that conditioning of mind

44:58.320 --> 45:00.560
I don't think can avoid

45:00.880 --> 45:06.400
creating more separation more externalities more rivalry in the process of everything it does

45:07.440 --> 45:12.400
intrinsic to the nature of how it perceives and as a result in how it sense makes and what it does

45:13.200 --> 45:15.200
so

45:15.200 --> 45:19.760
and that's not intrinsic to the nature of mind it's intrinsic to the way that

45:20.880 --> 45:23.280
most modern civilizations have cultivated mind

45:24.880 --> 45:29.360
and so uh cultivating and

45:30.320 --> 45:31.680
you know

45:31.680 --> 45:37.360
David Bohm and Krishna Murthy and so many said something almost identical about what the root of all the problems is

45:38.800 --> 45:40.480
so

45:40.480 --> 45:42.480
at the basis having a

45:43.200 --> 45:45.200
perception

45:45.920 --> 45:50.720
where you don't see things as separate things that you label in words with a

45:51.280 --> 45:53.280
packet of information

45:53.280 --> 45:55.280
that is fairly static about what that thing is

45:56.080 --> 45:58.080
you um

45:58.160 --> 46:02.160
you have unmediated contact with reality not mediated through words and concepts

46:02.960 --> 46:08.400
that increases the depth of your sensing because your sense making can't be better than your sensing is and most of the time

46:08.400 --> 46:15.200
we were perceiving so shallowly so little of the total bandwidth of the thing and then our sense making is almost all based on abstractions

46:16.320 --> 46:22.960
and the abstraction that the the world of our ideas of what a tree is and what everything is is not the world it's a simulation

46:22.960 --> 46:27.920
and so we live in that simulation on the world so the ability to have much

46:28.480 --> 46:32.160
deeper sensing that is not mediated through word and concept

46:34.400 --> 46:40.080
where the interconnectedness of everything is intrinsic and the uniqueness of everything is intrinsic both

46:41.920 --> 46:43.360
uh

46:43.360 --> 46:48.640
I would say it's only from there all you know what you're calling conscience internally

46:49.600 --> 46:51.200
in a

46:51.200 --> 46:52.960
reality

46:52.960 --> 46:54.960
that is

46:55.760 --> 46:57.760
where there's no separation

46:57.760 --> 47:03.360
there's no separability I can say i'm a separate thing but take plants away and I don't exist take the gravitational field away

47:03.360 --> 47:09.040
I don't exist take the sun away I don't exist so the concept of me as a separable thing is nonsense because it depends

47:09.600 --> 47:12.000
I depend on a lot of things that are outside of the definition of me

47:14.480 --> 47:17.360
in that inseparable nature of reality

47:17.920 --> 47:21.280
listening within and listening without are both kind of the same

47:22.400 --> 47:25.920
I mean they're both valuable they're they have different qualities so

47:28.240 --> 47:30.240
meditating and listen and

47:30.960 --> 47:32.960
being still and listening internally

47:33.600 --> 47:36.640
in different ways to the sensations in my body to the emotions

47:37.200 --> 47:38.400
to

47:38.400 --> 47:40.400
subtle intuition

47:40.400 --> 47:42.400
is all very important

47:42.480 --> 47:44.480
really deeply witnessing

47:44.720 --> 47:49.920
nature and really deeply witnessing people and listening is just as important as another kind of prayer

47:55.360 --> 48:02.880
So I I find conscience and spirit distributed everywhere right because there's nothing in which spirit is not indwelling

48:06.080 --> 48:08.080
so

48:08.480 --> 48:10.480
that mode of perception

48:10.480 --> 48:14.640
the interconnectedness the uniqueness of everything and really being with the

48:15.600 --> 48:17.600
instantiated details fully

48:18.160 --> 48:25.040
is the only mode of mind from which strategies about how to make things better are rightly grounded I feel

48:28.400 --> 48:33.840
How do you cultivate that I mean I think we could raise children in a way where that was the default state

48:34.160 --> 48:36.720
We don't but I think that's a possible thing

48:38.160 --> 48:40.160
for

48:40.800 --> 48:42.400
people who

48:42.400 --> 48:46.480
Have already been conditioned to see everything as separate things and are having to recondition that

48:48.560 --> 48:50.560
Yeah, I think

48:50.560 --> 48:54.960
time not just in nature but in wilderness particularly if you can get an old growth

48:56.240 --> 49:03.520
Right where you can because a young forest does not have the complexity that's been clear cut and regrown with a few species of tree

49:04.000 --> 49:07.600
Does not have the complexity of an old growth forest doesn't do the same thing if you can get

49:08.160 --> 49:11.120
deep into wilderness and spend enough time there and enough silence

49:12.240 --> 49:13.440
um

49:13.440 --> 49:18.000
A tremendous amount of transformation in your mind and being starts to happen

49:19.360 --> 49:21.920
And a tremendous amount of understanding about things so I think

49:22.880 --> 49:24.880
That's about as good as anything

49:25.520 --> 49:27.520
um

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I think you know when I said psychedelics

49:30.960 --> 49:36.560
There are lots of experiences that can induce states that change the nature of perception through

49:37.520 --> 49:41.520
fasting through vision quests through sweat lodges through, you know

49:42.960 --> 49:45.360
Medicines are one of them, but uh

49:47.840 --> 49:55.120
Inducing states in which your perception of reality is experientially very different can help people realize more in a more embodied way

49:55.120 --> 49:56.960
How limited their

49:56.960 --> 49:58.960
perceptional space usually it's

49:59.920 --> 50:02.640
And the thing that I had said then about relationships

50:05.520 --> 50:07.520
Yeah, I think really

50:07.520 --> 50:09.520
uh

50:09.520 --> 50:11.520
deeply loving more

50:12.240 --> 50:14.240
beings really helps

50:14.320 --> 50:20.480
And in really deeply loving them seeking to understand them and imagine what it's like to be them and realize that you don't know

50:20.480 --> 50:23.520
But really try to try to feel what it's like to be other beings

50:24.240 --> 50:25.920
um

50:25.920 --> 50:29.760
Your own ego can't actually imagine what it's like to be other beings

50:30.960 --> 50:35.920
Because it's its own set of things like to really take on what it's like to be them

50:38.000 --> 50:43.840
The part of me that the the aspect of me that can do that is not my identity. It's something deeper than identity

50:45.600 --> 50:47.600
and um

50:49.200 --> 50:53.360
And the pattern of putting myself at the center all the time

50:54.320 --> 50:56.720
Is very transcended in that process

50:59.360 --> 51:01.360
There's a bunch of other things for this a few

51:07.920 --> 51:10.880
Um, so the next question we have is from hogan williams

51:13.360 --> 51:18.000
So i'm someone who's deeply concerned about the sense-making crisis aspect of all of this

51:18.560 --> 51:26.640
Addressing sense-making seems to call for humility listening and slow process

51:28.560 --> 51:30.560
Yet addressing existential risk

51:31.280 --> 51:33.280
seems to call for boldness

51:34.160 --> 51:35.680
prophetic speech

51:35.680 --> 51:37.040
and action

51:37.040 --> 51:39.040
over contemplation

51:39.040 --> 51:43.120
At least that would be one way to slice it. You may deconstruct that

51:43.680 --> 51:47.040
It seems that if we have one without the other we are likely lost

51:48.000 --> 51:51.120
Yet they seem so different as to be working at cross purposes

51:52.400 --> 51:56.000
Can you speak to this tension between contemplation and boldness?

51:56.800 --> 52:01.120
These divergent approaches and how might wisely weave them?

52:02.320 --> 52:04.320
Yeah, totally. Um

52:05.760 --> 52:07.760
Everybody's familiar with the dunning kruger curve

52:10.000 --> 52:12.880
Uh this idea and sociology i'll explain it that

52:13.760 --> 52:16.160
When someone doesn't know anything about a field

52:16.640 --> 52:22.560
They can actually have a lot of unearned confidence in their ideas about the space because they're not aware of how much stuff

52:22.560 --> 52:24.000
they don't know

52:24.000 --> 52:25.040
and

52:25.040 --> 52:29.040
Then as they start to study the field they their confidence drops radically because

52:29.920 --> 52:34.320
All the things that were in the unknown unknown for them move into the known unknown. They're like shit. There's so much stuff

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
I don't know and so

52:37.760 --> 52:40.240
It is common that people who have

52:41.120 --> 52:45.120
Much less depth of thought have more confidence on a topic and people have more confidence

52:45.120 --> 52:48.800
Understand how complex the thing is the idea of the dunning kruger curve as you start here

52:49.600 --> 52:53.840
And then as you gain more knowledge you drop and then you slowly kind of come back up as you gain expertise

52:55.040 --> 52:57.040
what I find

52:57.760 --> 52:59.760
is

52:59.760 --> 53:00.720
in

53:00.720 --> 53:07.120
Trying to not study a specialty where I can eventually know most of the field I got my phd and it whatever but

53:07.440 --> 53:12.720
In trying to study the nature of reality and trying to study how to make a big difference in the world

53:14.800 --> 53:16.800
My uh

53:16.880 --> 53:19.600
Sense of how much I know just keeps dropping forever the more I

53:20.800 --> 53:28.720
The more I learn the more things i'm aware really matter that I don't know continuously so um

53:30.800 --> 53:36.480
Uh, I don't I don't think you ever end up getting something like a similar type of confidence

53:37.840 --> 53:40.080
I think what you get is a place where

53:41.360 --> 53:47.360
You understand a topic well enough to know that your best ideas might not only be wrong but even harmful

53:48.640 --> 53:55.040
And yet you're pretty clear that your assessment is factoring more things than the other assessments that are currently running the world

53:56.160 --> 54:02.240
And so there's an obligation to start to act but not with confidence more with like

54:03.120 --> 54:05.120
a

54:07.120 --> 54:09.120
Sacred obligation that

54:11.840 --> 54:13.840
Feels

54:17.040 --> 54:22.560
It doesn't feel like egoic a empowered agency. Fuck I got this. I know what to do. I'm gonna go solve this thing

54:22.560 --> 54:26.800
I'm gonna crusade doesn't feel like that. It feels like really fucking scared to fuck stuff up

54:28.320 --> 54:31.280
And really continuously listening

54:32.720 --> 54:34.720
um and

54:38.880 --> 54:40.720
So

54:40.720 --> 54:44.800
That's my sense is that if you are trying to address nuclear risk

54:46.480 --> 54:51.840
Or ai risk or whatever and you proceed confidently you'll almost certainly make it worse

54:52.880 --> 54:54.880
Which is almost always the case

54:54.880 --> 54:59.280
So you want if you don't have good sense making about the cause of the issues and how

55:00.240 --> 55:02.240
The nature of what you I mean

55:02.800 --> 55:04.160
Classically

55:04.160 --> 55:09.040
It's not just you can optimize for a project and end up externalizing harmels or what happens all the time

55:09.040 --> 55:12.240
It's things like you create a movement the movement becomes very effective

55:12.240 --> 55:15.200
But it appeals to some people and actually anti appeals to other people

55:16.000 --> 55:18.660
So you drive the counter movement. It's called schismogenesis

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
and so

55:22.560 --> 55:23.760
Uh

55:23.760 --> 55:27.760
Has the like racial justice movement enlightened everybody

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
No, the anti woke

55:30.480 --> 55:35.200
culture actually emerged as a counter response to the nature of how kind of

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
woke social justice moved forward

55:38.320 --> 55:39.360
and

55:39.360 --> 55:42.400
Every time the way that reparations were talked about

55:43.120 --> 55:49.520
Uh was expressed that did not do good sense making about how that would appeal to everybody a lot more people joined the far

55:49.520 --> 55:51.520
Are alt right and things like that so

55:52.160 --> 55:53.360
um

55:53.360 --> 55:55.360
if you

55:55.440 --> 55:59.520
Want to actually make things better in the death hing it says uh

56:01.280 --> 56:05.920
The master navigates the world as careful as one walking on black ice

56:09.200 --> 56:12.240
And what I like about that so much is if you're walking on black ice

56:13.600 --> 56:19.520
You don't have to want to split your head open just the the tiniest lapse of awareness and you can split your head open

56:19.760 --> 56:25.920
And so recognizing that navigating the world is like walking on black ice, especially if you try to do things at scale

56:27.280 --> 56:31.280
But it also doesn't say the master stays at home because there's black ice. He's navigating the world

56:34.000 --> 56:39.120
But it is full and it's not full of fearfulness. It's full of carefulness the depth of care

56:44.800 --> 56:46.800
Yes

56:46.960 --> 56:54.160
Yeah, so I think we've got one last one from the folks who wrote any questions and then we've got um

56:54.880 --> 57:00.240
Uh all I think seven six hands raised hands raised so hopefully we can get to everybody. Um

57:01.040 --> 57:06.800
I want to turn finally to Pamela Haynes Pamela. Do you want to unmute and ask your question?

57:08.000 --> 57:13.920
Sure. Yeah, thank you. I think that some of my question got answered by your response to mich and

57:14.640 --> 57:16.160
um

57:16.160 --> 57:21.840
Keith's suggestion that people speak that you speak to hope in response to everything. I'll just leave that part of it out

57:22.320 --> 57:25.520
So my question is really simple and it's what do you love?

57:40.400 --> 57:42.880
And I can't answer that very well

57:44.080 --> 57:46.080
um

57:47.440 --> 57:50.400
Because it because it is definitely beyond words

57:54.480 --> 57:56.480
I I love reality

57:58.080 --> 58:00.880
And all of the unique expressions

58:00.880 --> 58:02.880
Um

58:07.760 --> 58:12.000
If you like if you were to ask what motivates

58:13.840 --> 58:17.920
My work like what I'm working for I'm not working for the end of

58:19.840 --> 58:24.560
AI arms races or nuclear races or to get the chemicals out of the ocean or like

58:25.280 --> 58:28.160
I mean, yes, those are specific things, but um

58:31.120 --> 58:33.120
I

58:38.720 --> 58:40.720
I close my eyes I meditate and I

58:41.760 --> 58:43.440
see

58:43.440 --> 58:44.560
kids

58:44.560 --> 58:46.560
playing in the future

58:46.560 --> 58:51.600
I see them and I see through their eyes and I see them learning to climb a tree for the first time and loving trees

58:51.600 --> 58:55.360
I see them falling in love for the first time. I see them doing aw at sunsets

58:55.440 --> 59:00.160
I see the mom falling in love with them. I see them learning to communicate with animals

59:01.360 --> 59:06.000
And just that that gets to continue is what I love and I'm in service to

59:07.360 --> 59:10.160
All the rest is complicated strategy in service to that

59:12.480 --> 59:14.880
And for the non-human world as much as the human world

59:19.200 --> 59:21.200
Daniel film

59:22.800 --> 59:24.800
Daniel brilliant presentation

59:24.960 --> 59:31.200
I'm a scholar of the relationship between the sciences and the world's religious and spiritual traditions

59:32.000 --> 59:37.280
From that perspective, it struck me. It's really interesting the the pattern or the formal analysis of your presentation

59:37.600 --> 59:40.720
Which is you gave us the facts the situations the background

59:41.280 --> 59:46.320
You gave us the the practices that people engage in psychedelics meditation and so forth

59:46.800 --> 59:49.360
You brought those two right next to each other

59:50.240 --> 59:57.040
Keith and I and many people on this call engage in a kind of reflection right there at that meeting point of the two

59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.280
You engage in almost no reflection at that particular point. You spoke of actions

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.600
and facts

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.600
wishes visions

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.080
But surely there's a kind of reflection

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720
That is right at that intersection

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.680
I have the intuition that you'd be able to help us

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.320
If you sort of open up the doors to that particular room, I'm interested to see how you respond to that invitation

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.800
Yeah, you mean specifically at the intersection of something like

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.920
the sciences and spirituality

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.080
Right, which is a kind of self-involving intersection

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:39.760
You often answer like a religious studies scholar, which is what my tribe does and describes externally

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.160
powerful internal experiences

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.320
But there's a kind of internally driven reflection that stems from the motivation or the psychedelic experiences

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.320
And you're surprisingly silent at that that intersection point

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.760
The um when I when I was growing up I was um homeschooled and I

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.880
studied

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.880
I had a

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.080
Got to make my own curriculum didn't have a fixed curriculum and

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.160
The kind of braid of topics of interest was all the sciences all of the kind of spiritual mystical traditions

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.720
and philosophic traditions

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.800
and um

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.240
And then also the kind of all the domains of uh activism

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.240
And they all felt like the exact same thing to me. I had the same

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.800
And

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.000
And particularly because at that time growing up in the 80s

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:46.080
And what just a fortune of getting exposed to like my exposure to science was first fritchoff capra and david boom and

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.160
Like the whole idea that something at the nature of ecology and complexity science and quantum mechanics would reveal the perennial

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.240
truths of the spiritual traditions and things like that

01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.160
So I didn't get science as kind of reductionist atheism first. I got the critique of that first

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.960
and um

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.320
There's a

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.960
Paper I wrote maybe Keith will share it with people called

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.560
The dance of the dow and the 10,000 things

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.600
and because you know

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.960
The dow that is nameable is not the eternal dow

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.760
Naming is the beginning of the 10,000 things typically we take it that then

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.520
Engagement with the 10,000 things deadens us to the dow

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.720
But it doesn't have to it can do the exact opposite right it can actually

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.160
Deep in the nature of the appreciation of the dow that's what I meant by the dance between them and uh

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.320
so

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.320
one of the areas that I really got into was uh limits of no ability

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.600
and whether it was kind of girdle and mathematics or the incompleteness theorem or

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.040
uh tarski with the limits of formal logic or

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.560
um

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.040
Heisenberg bell, you know on and on there's these kind of

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.000
Pearson semiotics the upper bounds of no ability are ways that logic can transcend itself because it can identify

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.640
its formal upper boundaries and then identify how much of reality is outside of it

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.720
And then there's the question. Well, what is the right epistemology for that then? What is the right way to relate to it?

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.160
Um, so there's like these are some of my favorite topics. There's a lot I could say there

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.160
I'm not sure exactly which part of the inquiry is um,

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.440
Most interesting and live for you, but it would be a fun conversation

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.440
At some point I look forward to that there is a way to speak at precisely that intersection point

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.400
Which is not just silence and many of the hundred people on this call are practiced in that

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.840
I would love to in in explore that openness

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.600
To a form of discourse that was surprisingly silent

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.880
Over the last hour. Thanks again for your talk

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.800
Yeah, well, that's really lovely film. I really love that invitation. Um, and I hope that connection happens

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.720
um

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.560
Stan I got Stan's message and I don't know if Stan's here, but he wrote it to me in the chat

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.520
So I'm going to go ahead and just read it out. Um, we have you mentioned population collapse and tainter's analysis

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.320
Four or five groups of ecologists have estimated that the world can only sustain

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.800
Sustainably support three or four billion people at a reasonable standard living i.e. the european standard

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.880
Given we are at eight billion now. This is not a small problem

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.880
Given this what is your prognosis on collapse or not in the years and decades ahead?

01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:00.080
Um prognosis on collapse includes population as one factor but lots of other factors

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.280
um

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.560
The topic of caring capacity is a very tricky topic

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.840
It's very tricky for like so many reasons

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.080
Caring capacity meaning how many people can the earth sustainably?

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720
uh support

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.080
um

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.520
The answer that comes up most commonly is like two three billion

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.560
but uh the numbers vary from

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.440
500 000 to tens of billions depending upon how people do the analysis

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.520
um

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.480
Obviously before the industrial revolution

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.480
I mean 500 million excuse me before the industrial revolution the population of the planet was 500 million and then

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.960
It went from 500 million to

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.080
8 billion almost overnight right to 200 years with the haverbosch and such

01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:00.000
But as it did that as it's 16 that 16 x would have taken over 200 000 years to get in 200 years

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.800
It also increased the resource consumption per capita by about 100 x in the developed world

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.840
So that's obviously a 1600 x increase in um resource consumption

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.400
How you define it though is

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.000
What is the most number of people you can possibly fit on the planet without collapsing the biosphere versus what provides

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.400
the highest quality of life for all life including non-humans

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.680
um

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.560
Mediated through what kind of technologies gets into deep cultural questions of what a desirable good life looks like

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.840
um

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.280
And the enactment pathway of getting there

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.920
Is super tricky because the conversations almost always turn into eugenics and war and like pretty pretty difficult stuff

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.640
um and

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.160
If you look at the work of like

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.840
Um

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.840
I'm forgetting his name right now. It'll come to me in a minute

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.520
But you know elan has talked about this

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:14.000
Uh popularly a lot recently which is that um the topic of demographic collapse that the decreasing birth rates in china in particular

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but all around the world

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.800
are

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:24.960
Going to destroy civilization as we know it not the biosphere because a smaller percentage of young people entering the workforce military force, etc

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.800
and a lot of old

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.160
people

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.320
Is not how civilization is designed to function

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.200
um and so

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.000
And that's obviously because we built a civilizational system that is incommensurable the biosphere

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.880
So the ongoing needs that it has for maintenance like growing gdp and growing population upon which it was predicated don't work with the biosphere so

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.720
um

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.960
Is population a topic that we have to figure out? Yes, it's a it's a it's a very tricky one

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.160
So I don't like to try to say much definitive about it quickly

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.200
When china tried to control its population growth

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.360
To the one child policy or when india tried to control it

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.560
Some of the unintended side effects were things like

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.200
over a hundred million too many men

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.640
Because they emphasize male children and now you have literally over a hundred million

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.160
more men than women that can't mate that are destabilizing civilization and so like

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.480
the

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:30.000
You always have the what is the ideal in state you have whose ideal which cultural

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.240
ethical

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.800
models and then you have the enactment to get there

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.080
And well, you know, there's a bunch of libertarian thought that is gibberish one of the libertarian

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.480
Questions that is often useful is, you know, think about your utopia

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.560
In the future

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.880
Think about all the people that don't want it right now that would violently resist it because of their different religious ideas or economic interests or whatever

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.760
And think about how much violence you would have to enact to force your utopia on them and ask if it's still utopia

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.640
And so the considerations about enactment are very real

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.120
I

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.880
Know, um, Stan pretty well. I'm sure Stan's got a lot to say particularly

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.920
on that topic of

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.200
There's a there's a qe w pamphlet critiquing. He's a you know, a demographer

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.160
beginning the which college but

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:29.520
Uh, critiquing the the elan analysis. So I'm sure he might want to share at with you afterwards, but I would love I would love to see that analysis

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.760
I think it desperately needs critiqued

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.600
Yeah

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.600
Oh, yeah

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:49.360
Great great job on the geopolitical understanding. Um, I'm really impressed with the depth of your knowledge and the realism of your perspective

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.440
I've been following Peter Zion and many other geopolitical thinkers sure many was the one I was about to mention who has been popularizing the demographic collapse

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.560
So thanks for mentioning it. That was the name I was forgetting. Yep, and I'm well aware of the mit study of

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.400
You know, very they tracked I forgot like six major

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.000
Measures and how they would change over the next century

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.720
Um, I I was exposed to this at university of colorado boulder while studying geology and economics

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.480
in geology is kind of a hotbed of

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.800
The counter perspective on a lot of these things because uh, we know the paleo climate very well. We know

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.840
My professors have been unerringly accurate about predicting how the climate is going to change

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.680
Which goes to say, um, the climate is a lot bigger problem. It's going to cause big migrations all over the place

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.760
It's going to change the rules all over the place

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.720
Um, the scientific humidity is just not up to the task of conveying news of that magnitude

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.440
Especially when the rate of change is faster than a peer review process will allow

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.240
So if you passed over the peer review process about five years ago

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:05.120
My question though has to do with the longevity and retirement aspects

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.680
because

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.680
We live a lot longer

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:18.560
And I remember a discussion at the university of colorado 42 years ago where they talk about how that would fragment our society

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.960
um

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.240
and

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.640
It kind of creates this dynamic to say the emphasis is really going to be on

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.280
the government to take charge and

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320
Clear a path for the future

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.800
There's kind of limits to what you can do as far as social involvement. Could you speak to that?

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:47.600
How we economically support an increasing growth, uh, elderly population. Is that the main question?

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.840
Well, it's that

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:58.080
That there's genetically engineered, uh, pig organs that stands to increase life expectancy another decade or two

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.520
Um, you know stem cell inserts is all this technology to say we're going to live increasingly into our hundreds

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:12.880
Roughly some 80 percent of the federal budget is now devoted to retirement in some way or another saving for retirement or retirement itself

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:20.720
And so you're you're you're kind of say if we're going to have a massive social limit to change society

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:28.560
You're at some point going to run head-on into the cost of return the fact that we live longer. Yeah

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.440
um

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.840
Just having a conversation right before this, um the colleague about the

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.160
uh collapsing pensions and

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.200
Again realist analysis

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080
everybody

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.080
who studies this knows that the

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.120
growing debt to gdp ratio is not there's no path to fix it

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920
and the

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.400
growing not just debt but deficit spending

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.480
um

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.480
Also hitting diminishing returns on so many areas of industry because of planetary boundaries coming up climate change and others

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.400
means, uh, the imminent break of the economic system as we know it

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.320
um

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:22.800
When you mentioned climate and the climate predictions, obviously you look at like the jim Hansen recently said tin celsius is now the most likely scenario

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.960
um

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960
and you look at the

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.800
uh

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.760
You know fact that the climate sensitivity numbers and some of the best models have went way up and are

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.480
like actually being

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.600
underreported because not wanting to sound alarmist

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.720
but even the un predictions are

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.760
billion climate refugees in the next 10 years

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.720
and when you look at where they come from

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.480
if you look at the Himalayan watershed and

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.720
You know India with over a billion people china with over a billion people in pakistan

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.600
and then the islamic world backing it with over a billion people on a dwindling water supply where a lot of those

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:09.120
100 million person plus climate migrations will occur all of which are nuclear equipped with massive geopolitical tensions. It's not just like

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.000
Some people die from that. It's like disruption of the entire world system. Um

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040
so I think

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.880
I think that we don't continue to see business as usual, uh into the

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.440
uh

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440
decade ahead

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.680
in retirement as a part of that

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.800
Yeah, I would just add um north america has a radically different fate than asia

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.400
and um north america we don't have these existential problems and we've got oceans to protect us

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.880
I mean there's a limited amount of threat you can convey over an ocean

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.480
So I want to jump in I just want to make sure that we have um some time

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.040
for uh, in particular, I noticed we've had an all men audience uh or question

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:12.000
Asking for so far. So I know we have uh two men and two women left and I want to give precedence to the

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560
To jenny and shelly

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.400
So jenny if you would like to ask your question now and then um, we can spin back around

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.880
Is um, I it's not particularly a woman's question, but nevertheless I will

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.520
I wanted to try to bring us back

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.320
to the question that

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.360
I'm actually finding it very difficult to articulate so please forgive me

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.600
um

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:47.200
The the question of love at the root of of our response to this crisis

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.840
and you

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.280
So a couple of things one is that I I think that what you were saying earlier daniel

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.360
about

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.640
One of the one of the primary things that's gone

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.720
Gone wrong and I'm a scientist and I've been trying to deal with

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.720
the integration of science and spirituality and and technology and economics and the whole thing for many many years so

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:19.280
trying to see the roots of these things is is is um leads you to a place where

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:26.560
You're you're faced with uncertainty and radical humility. So let's start there, but the sense of separation

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600
to me is

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.760
allied to

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.480
a corresponding faith in our

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:42.080
In justifying justifying our actions, which which um, I I don't really explain that at the moment, but

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:52.480
We are we have a moral ground for our being that co exists with our egotistical power sense and our

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.080
um

01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.080
Our ability to justify what we're doing in terms of violence and so on so I wanted to

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.880
ask you about how you see

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:11.360
Love as as a guiding principle for how we can act in this complex world that we're now living in

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.960
because

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.080
When we talk about our faith tradition as quakers

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.400
We're often looking towards our conscience our spirit

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.960
And that spirit is also the the the ground of love

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.400
for life truth that the truth of our unity

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:36.240
And the and that which guides us into doing action whether or not we really can be certain of the outcome

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.760
Does that make some sort of sense? Yeah, totally

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.200
um

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.240
I don't think we can ever be certain of the outcome right

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.640
I I don't think that we shouldn't try to engage in

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.640
Uh, you just went away to look at you while you were talking

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.760
I guess not so I'm here. There you are. Okay. Um

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600
I

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.760
Think that

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.760
consequentialist ethics have a role

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.240
Where you think through what will provide the greatest good for the greatest many and you try to think through the causal dynamics of it

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.680
But uh consequentialist ethics on their own ends up generally making people evil

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.960
Because you pretend that you have more certainty about the future state than you possibly can

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.880
You identify certain bad things that are inevitable which justifies why you have to do some other bad things because they're less bad

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.160
And so the basis of that is actually the excessive

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.200
certainty that isn't epistemically warranted, which is why the epistemic humility is so important

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:01.040
So there is a there's a kind of virtue ethic, which is I don't know how the future is going to unfold

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.200
There's unpredictable complexity everywhere

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:09.120
But I know that the choices that have the most integrity in the moment put out the kind of ripples that will ripple well

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.400
Right, so that's kind of a virtue ethic

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.000
There's kind of a utilitarian ethic that tries to think through what is a viable in-state here

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.880
What is a viable or at least new homeodynamic state and can I reverse engineer steps? They're both important

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.600
right

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.800
And then there's something that is kind of deeper than either of those even deeper than the virtue ethic which is

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.120
uh

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:41.200
Something like the feeling guidance that comes from deep enough prayer

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.960
And again, that's all the aspects of self being involved

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
As far as love at the basis

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.000
I think if anyone really explores why they are motivated to do something

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.280
There's it's not purely a rational thing

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Because a purely rational thing doesn't actually have motive. It doesn't care, right? Like there are some basis for care

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.320
Otherwise it'd be like well, if this doesn't happen then this thing will be harmed

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.760
But if I don't care about that thing being harmed who cares, right? So like

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800
in a purely rationalist

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.240
Ontology then I'm being nihilistic

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.720
So I want to change this because this is horrifying

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.480
Because I'm fucking pissed that they're doing this because I'm heartbroken over here. Well, but any of those emotions

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:44.960
I'm heartbroken because there is some these kids lives in Gaza these animals in the factory farm

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.760
Are beautiful they're sacred which is why I care

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.680
So underneath the heartbreak and underneath the anger and underneath the depression and the devastation underneath all of the sense of

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.360
Injustice is actually love because if I didn't find some reality

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.600
beautiful

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.640
That I loved there would be no basis for the other emotions

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:11.280
So that the idea that all of the other emotions are actually responses to love to care

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.280
Then you recognize the anger the sadness the depression the anxiety are all actually sacred

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:23.760
They all have a place but they're not at the source. So you embrace them and then you trace them back to where they come from

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.520
When you trace them back to where they come from rather than being angry at who the bad guy is what I love becomes clear

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.920
and then

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.040
That is actually an even deeper motive and then how

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.000
Do I be effective in service of what I love is a clearer focus?

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.680
So it's just the deep reflection on what the motivation is and tracing it back to the source

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.080
right and I

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.640
I agree and I think it's also that

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.280
You know love love is one of the most misunderstood words and most

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.960
Misunderstood concepts. It's overused and underused all the time

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:06.800
But it's also to me the great attractor what I call the great attractor. So it actually applies to science as well

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.680
It's not it's not a it's not a there's not a place where love doesn't exist

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:18.640
In this whole concept, you know, and it can it can be the root of guiding very very practical action

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:25.920
It doesn't have to be something that oh, this is just a feeling state or this is just the way quakers talk or something like that

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.000
It's actually the concept of oh total unity. It's a unified consciousness. If you like

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.880
Yes

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:43.600
Reminds me of the harmony of the spheres and you know, uh, Daniel has a beautiful talk on emergence that um, if you

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:49.440
Want to look that up on youtube at some point. Daniel talks about something very similar to what you just said, jenny

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.560
But um, shelly, I would like to invite you to ask your question

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.000
Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.720
Daniel, I really um

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:10.000
I learned from I want to take us back to some of the things you said at the beginning your analysis of the different

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.840
Factors you you mentioned three different factors that

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.240
motivate

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.400
individuals and society to and

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.240
And determine whether we're effective or not and and as I understood it one of them was

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:32.960
Understanding how the world works and the other has the second has to do with your ethics or whether you care about

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.240
The global world or not

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.240
And and third was an effective strategy to

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.640
Take action

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.680
And if I I'm not sure I got that all that right, but if that's

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.720
Correct, um

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.600
I find that most of the people if not all of them on this on these screens

01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.560
Are pretty well versed in the first one how to you know, how messed up our world is

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:07.360
And the second one all deeply caring and wanting to make the world a better place

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.720
Um, so going beyond their own personal

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.880
Satisfaction and needs to wanting to to create a better world

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.000
But what we mostly almost all of us fail is we don't know what to do about it

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.000
We don't have an effective strategy and I think you've kind of answered

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:29.600
With your answer to jenny, but I wonder if you could reiterate it in another way

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.680
So like we all understand

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.840
What are the best?

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:40.080
Strategies for us to figure out what is an effective strategy and not just individually

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.800
But how can we collectively as a quaker community take action?

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.480
Is this being

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.720
Posted on the internet

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.120
That was the intention, but if you want to cut anything

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.840
I don't know. I don't know where you're gonna go, but I we can totally work out whenever

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.400
Feels feels good there

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.400
Okay

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.520
In a different setting I can say more about this

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.440
I'll say a couple things

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.080
The

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.600
Study of effective strategy is different in kind than studying like environmentalism and the fact that the environment's messed up

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.240
It because you're studying

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:43.520
How power works and you're studying it not just to critique it but to engage in it

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.200
And so that is a very different kind of study

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:58.560
It looks at how is it that corporations are able to lobby governments and put

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.240
Corporate agents into regulatory positions to regulate the government and their interests and things like that

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.120
and all those critiques of that the

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.200
Rotating revolving doors of somebody from big ag or big pharma than running the fda and you know

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.920
Or the public private partnership where the private side writes the law that the public side implements

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:25.840
Or the massive subsidies to fairly toxic things that happen because the big companies that have the patents have the money to pay a lot

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.040
More lobbyists than the things that are inherently decentralized like regenerative versus conventional agriculture or whatever

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.160
There's the way the critical theorist studies this which is basically to just say it's really bad

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.720
Like look at all this bad stuff. It's really bad

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.120
There there is the way that one studies it from the perspective of

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.840
How does

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.400
Influence at scale operate? What are the various

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.240
Modalities that when the world has changed who changed it and what were the tools they used to change it?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And if

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.680
Someone does not

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:12.720
Feel good about using those tools they counter as they have to say do I feel good about letting those who are using the tools currently continue to do it for those goals?

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.280
so

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.600
Being able to lobby a government for subsidies that ends up affecting

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.400
Market dynamics profoundly is something that big corporations are good at and that

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600
Non-profit groups are not good at

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.320
Non-profit groups don't study how finance works and how lobbying works and you know those types of things well

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.080
Being able to figure out how to write a very complex

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.320
Operating agreement for a public-private partnership that has all the fine print to do everything you want for many different government

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.960
Jurisdictional bodies are now doing your will is something that the financial sector and various large corporate sectors are very good at and

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.160
You know people trying to do good things are not good at

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.760
um

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.280
and so

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.360
If you want effective strategy you have to study effective strategy

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.880
And so let's say for instance i'll give a historical example

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.800
And it's it's a fake example, but it'll you'll get a sense

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.480
Let's say that we had a chance to talk to

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.280
The Tibetans before Mao and they did let's say we had a chance to talk to them a couple decades before

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.640
They were not studying effective strategy because that was not their jam

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.960
That was not what their culture was about right they were doing different things and they were doing lovely things

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.080
They obviously did not study that

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.560
And the results are also quite obvious

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.400
Now

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.080
If they were to think about geopolitical strategy for a minute

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.520
It would be pretty easy to say oh

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:02.560
There are two billion person populations on either side of a watershed and we are at the source of the watershed

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.760
I bet we don't get to stay here

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.640
Like it seems pretty obvious that we don't get to stay here one of these sides is going to take the head

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.840
Top of the watershed. Also, this is going to be key to the strategic communications and missile defense

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.880
so

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.320
Geographically the fate is already written that we don't get to stay here

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.920
Given that what should we do and either

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.200
They would have done something like

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.600
Uh, anticipatorily create a partnership with one of the sides

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.040
In which they had something unique to offer

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.600
They would have left

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.960
Or they would have done something like finlanded between the ussr and eu to be in a

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.400
Buffer zone

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.280
relationship where both sides militarily protected them because of that or like switzerland did to say, you know

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.880
all of the international agreements between the two of you were going to be able to host

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.480
and

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.480
So let's say that

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.600
Tibet had realized that 30 years before the kind of rise of Mao and they had went to

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.760
The european powers at the time and said look, here's what's going to happen

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800
China's going to get this otherwise

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:19.680
And it's going to help their rise to power that is going to end up threatening you and blah blah blah

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:24.560
And here's why you want to help protect us like offer kind of military legal support protecting us here

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:29.760
And then here's how what we're going to tell india here's what we're going to tell china such that in the same way that nobody

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:35.600
Invaded switzerland because everybody was invested in being able to store their gold and stuff in switzerland because switzerland was thinking about strategy

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.360
Then tibet could have done that

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.320
This would not have been this would have not arisen from the minds of the tibetan people with the culture they had

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:49.520
It did arise from the minds of some religions like jews, right? They had a different they had a

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:55.760
Different type of spirituality and mind arising that thought about strategy in a different way

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
So

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.160
It's not that there aren't places like tibet that had the same geographical determination that

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.120
Did a better job than they did it said it required a different type of mind

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:20.000
And that as as i've mentioned the people who are good at strategy

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:26.880
Are almost always strategy is a military term it gets then gets applied to business and other things, but it is about

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:35.440
Effective achieving of goals which are almost always narrow goals where you externalize costs in the process and against adversaries

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.200
right like that's

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.080
so

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.080
The mind that gets good at strategy

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:48.560
Is almost always co-occurring with something that is self-centered either at the level of the individual the nation state the corporation but not

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.280
The commons in all life and perpetuity

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.240
When you're thinking about the commons in all life and perpetuity you're not thinking how do I win stuff?

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.320
and so

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.320
but it's kind of like

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.600
let's

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600
Let's take star wars

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.680
Let's say there were no sith

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.720
right

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.720
There wouldn't have to be jedi if there were no sith

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:13.280
Everybody could just be farmers and poets and parents and teachers would be lovely

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.760
But if there are sith there must be jedi and the jedi are not trained in farming. They are trained in warfare

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360
protective warfare

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.960
right

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.960
um not in service of

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.760
empire and conquest purely like the white blood cells and immune system

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.760
and

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.720
So what I would say is if you

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.840
Want to be effective

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.440
At serving things that you care about in the presence of other groups that are effective at serving the goals they care about

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.240
You need to engage in that field of study

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.440
The jury

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Yeah, what was that?

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.360
It's almost as if what you're saying is that

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.240
In order to be effective

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.720
We need to let go of our ethics

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:19.600
because in order to be effect the way you're most effective is

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320
by being um

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.200
self-serving and you know with a narrow focus

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.880
So there's a real problem. I'm not saying that

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.520
Okay

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:38.080
I'm saying that it is inethical to do something that you know is for sure ineffective

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
To let

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.080
uh

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.480
Horror and tragedy and species extinction continue because you aren't willing to engage in effective strategies unethical

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.040
we are responsible not just for what we do but what we don't do

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.720
and

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.240
So there is an ethical responsibility to effectiveness

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.880
That doesn't mean you justify any amount of harm in the process. I'm not and that's the tricky thing is that the

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.800
The cultures

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.440
That

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.320
Said okay, we don't want wiped out therefore we have to build a standing military or whatever

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.120
We're not the same culture anymore because they had to reinvest things that had went into

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:28.480
Arts and child education and whatever now into military and and those types of things so

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:35.520
The two fail modes that we have to avoid is

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.760
Uh a culture that is doing something that is more

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.400
Ethical in its goals that just gets destroyed by a more dominant culture. That's a fail mode

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.360
Or even if it doesn't get destroyed because no one cares about it because it has no power but it it

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.040
Fails to prevent harm in the rest of the world happening

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.600
That's a fail mode

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.440
and one the other fail mode is that in the aim of

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.680
Not being destroyed and being effective. It also becomes a dominated culture

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.400
That's also a fail mode

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.520
So you can either be destroyed by the machine or become the machine is the answer

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.520
So you have to do something that is neither of those

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.880
So in learning how to be effective obviously the long-term

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.080
Play there is a change of all of the systems that mediate game theory itself

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:33.040
The consciousness and the systems which will look like not capitalism not nation states and not minds that see everything as separate things

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.720
But we don't get there if we don't if right now everybody

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.960
That is effectively getting lawmakers to write law or doing it in narrow short-term private interests

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.760
I would rather environmentalists know how to do the corporate thing as well as the corporate guys do

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.280
Or a different set of purposes

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.240
Well, of course, I would like to have a government that is not hijackable by anybody's interests

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.120
And that has a good collective intelligence guiding it. We obviously don't have that so having

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:13.520
The more inclusive goals be effective in the current dynamics while seeking to upgrade the underlying systemic dynamics

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.600
Both have to happen simultaneously

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.720
It's a tall order

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.640
Yeah, well, thank you for now being effective

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.640
At a local level is different because you don't have great power vested interests in the same way

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:30.800
And that's awesome

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.640
And I encourage most people to actually feel really good about that as opposed to hopeless about the scale that it's not operating at

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.640
And

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.960
For those who can't not think about the world at scale and can't not

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040
Endeavour to become more effective at it

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.760
It's just a different study

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.120
Thank you Daniel for sharing that and

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.800
Yeah, I think that a core tenant of quakerism is about is about peace, right?

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.400
I'm guessing you might have ran across that, you know, so from the 1650s onward is this sort of

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.920
testimony on peace and so

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.040
There's much more to endeavor into there, but

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.440
And into that so let me give you for instance

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.400
Yeah

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.400
So the nuclear clock got

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
Moved closer to midnight

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.440
Associated with the escalation in ukraine

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.920
Yeah

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.120
You have not heard

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.160
A good thought on a plausible end game

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.120
When you watch the news because there is not one

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.200
The there is

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.920
On one side a bunch of rhetoric

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.920
Like putin is hitler and if he takes part of ukraine then

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.800
Bad guys everywhere will start taking other places and he'll take all of Europe and whatever and this is why we have to

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.120
But there's no thought about

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.900
What okay, so we're closing

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.160
Possible de-escalation pathways. What is the end game that we're going towards instead?

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:17.280
And engaging with this pretty directly. I can tell you that there's very wacky conversations about our first strike

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.760
nuclear dominance

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.160
And stuff like that

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.160
so

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.640
If you

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.520
Are focused on peace. It's not just we don't want to wage war

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:35.840
It's that we want to be effective at de-escalating everyone who is waging war and there are increasingly hawkish people on all sides

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.840
Absolutely

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.440
So learn how to be effective at influencing what is happening at the level of national security councils

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:51.840
Yeah to be able to have the more de-escalatory voices get into more positions of power and the escalatory hawkish voices not be there

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.320
so it

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.000
It takes a particular

01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.360
But unless you know how to talk to security councils in language that will move them

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:07.120
Then you don't have the ability to help de-escalation in those ways or the other forces that you'd need to work with

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.880
so

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.880
the like

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760
I think

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
One time when I was like nine years old

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.360
I

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.280
Had an experience probably many people here have had where I was horrified at my inability to not cause harm

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400
that I

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.480
I couldn't avoid

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.960
When I was walking on the grass maybe killing some bugs. I couldn't I

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
at least my nine-year-old mind the

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.360
mites that were destroyed with my breath and my eyelash flutters

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:48.800
You know, it was just like so kind of horrifying. So I was like just stood there frozen didn't want to move

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.120
Wanted to breathe the little as possible

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:52.480
and

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:58.880
Okay, I realized I have to breathe and move but really tried to think about how do I not cause any harm and I'm complicit with all these systems that are

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:02.080
Fundamentally ecocidal and genocidal to be able to just get my stuff

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.760
right

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.760
and even if I'm eating a vegetarian diet

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.120
but

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.080
The shipping processes the oil that was involved in shipping at everything, right? There's like there's

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.920
Blood in all of that stuff and so I'm like, okay, so I have to only have things I make myself from stuff that I find

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:22.080
and

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:26.720
The idea that then for me to have my hands clean. I'm not causing harm

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.720
Also means I am totally complicit in allowing all the harm of the system to happen because I'm not willing to interact with any of it

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.760
There's a kind of humility that says no, I'm going to drive a car with fossil fuels that

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.080
Not only are destroying the environment but create wars that kill children

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.080
That I am partly driving the demand for

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.360
Then there is a place where like you don't I don't get to have my hands clean in this world

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.240
I do my very best but

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.240
There's a humility in that that's important. There's a realism in it. That's important

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.720
There's a not superiority over everybody else just being like we're in this thing together

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.280
At this time. That's the time that we're in

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.480
And then say like if I'm a pacifist

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.520
I'm not the one who controls the nuclear buttons

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.240
I'm not the one who controls the rapid proliferation of drone weapons

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.920
If I'm really a pacifist meaning I don't want there to be

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.640
Killing anywhere. How do I become increasingly influential over the people who are in control of the nuclear buttons and who are building all of the

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.880
AI empowered drone weapons

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:40.160
But that means maybe I have to learn how to engage compellingly with places that I would rather never engage with

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.240
Well, we've got two more questions and I want to kind of finish out with those

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:52.720
I think we'll we'll finish here at uh six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.720
Um, so David, I want to give you an opportunity and then Eric and then Daniel any closing words?

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.960
Hi, greetings Daniel and everyone from Wajak Nga Buja in

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.840
Western Australia, where it's now 8 53 a.m. Saturday morning

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:17.200
And it does make me think of Edward Wilson's classic line. You know, we have a paleolithic emotions

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.240
medieval institutions and godlike technology

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.760
So I did enjoy your talk very much Daniel and I love that you

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.400
refer to sort of evolution or at least cultural evolution

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:40.240
And I have great respect for the United States of America two years away from your declaration of independence

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.520
And um, you know, essentially founding a republic

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.840
So it's pretty amazing for me living in what is a fairly robust democracy here

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:57.920
Um, but I do Dothma cap at America's abilities. Uh, so in terms of evolutionary

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:06.160
Perspectives, I mean, I I remember in the early 90s after the collapse of the Berlin Wall

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.520
One of the classic lines was because we went from two superpowers to the one superpower

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.920
And one of the classic lines was, you know, the new world superpower

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.040
is global public opinion

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.760
And uh, now it's a little bit more mixed up, but I'm just wondering

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.600
overall

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:33.360
What you think of the prospects of democracy modern representative democracy, which of course is nothing like

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.840
ancient greek democracy

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.120
Not good

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.440
Um

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.000
You just went away again, why do people go away right after they talk? I can all go ahead and um

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.600
I'm here. I'm still here. I'm still all right. So, um

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.000
It's a long complicated answer, but

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.920
when

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.920
The u.s. Democracy was founded

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.920
We did have an ocean separating us

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.640
And so the idea that the

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:24.720
There were a few things but one the idea that the people could know

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.440
Everything so they could be democratically, um, you know, participatory

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:37.760
Once we started to get the telegraph and then kind of mass telecommunications and then, um

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:42.960
Satellite spying sig intel and hypersonic missiles

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.840
Anything the american public know the russians the chinese the iranians instantly know

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.400
That means you started having a situation where almost everything became a national security secret and could not be shared with the public or even

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.560
got congress mostly

01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:04.080
Because where the fertilizer is stored is a is a weapons knowledge where the aquifers are where the so increasingly

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:09.520
The most critical information can never be known by the public because it's national security secrets

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.000
That's you can't run a democracy where you have to classify everything

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.160
um

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:21.760
And yet you also can't make have a world that is in that kind of warfare where you share all of the things that

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.240
Are national security secrets with the public, you know, that's one example of a context change

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:30.080
In which the ideas that kind of made sense just totally don't make sense

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.760
The thing that we call the democracy obviously did all of its labor with slavery

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.840
and which means that all the shit jobs that people had no boat in

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.680
and

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.680
Then we kind of got rid of that

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.440
obviously

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.840
After the emancipation proclamation, we didn't really get rid of slavery

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:51.760
We just got a p and h slavery system where we put people in jail for for false reasons and then you know forced labor out of them

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.480
We really only got rid of it when we when globalization allowed us to ship the slavery overseas

01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.360
and by the step back and effectively

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:00.880
and

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.880
You know, so if you were to say

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:08.880
Can a democracy make the decisions where the totality of the decisions it's of everyone that it's affecting all have a voice

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.960
All the stakeholders have a voice that's never happened

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.640
right so

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:18.160
A country will look at its genie coefficient and say what the inequality is but it buys its stuff from a country

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.560
Where almost everybody is poor

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.520
In which case it depends upon so the only level at which genie coefficient makes sense is global

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.480
Right, the only there's so many things like that where you really have to think about that

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.240
Which you depend upon and are driving the supply and demand of so

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.640
um

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.600
If if you really look at did we ever have democracy?

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:46.320
There was actually a thing where the stakeholders that were being affected really had any say it's not it's not a very good analysis

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.960
and then when you say

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.760
Does the thing that we have now even resemble the elements of that totally not

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.480
Now

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.120
Uh, how do you deal with that moving forward?

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:04.640
There is no system of governance in the history of the world that can deal with the issues that we need to deal with now

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.800
Because

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.480
Or instance

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.360
Uh gene synthesizers are becoming cheaper on an exponential curve

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:27.520
And it is already the case that quite inexpensively you can get the ability for gene synthesis and amplification and

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.960
It's a couple couple years at the current rate away from incredibly cheap like desktop capability for everybody

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.640
So if you even have open publishing of science

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:42.480
Where the science is doing gain and function research to look at incredibly variable empathogens and you publish the genome sequence

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.200
The information file alone, which is now open published on the internet is enough to make catastrophe weapons

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.120
And you can't monitor and control that the way you can nukes because nukes obviously are very very hard to make and you can see

01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.160
The facilities the uranium enrichment etc from space

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.480
But we're talking about devices anybody can have in a tiny basement lab

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.320
And so that either means you

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.120
You just stop science mostly

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.840
Because it's all Pandora's boxes

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:18.160
Or you stop open publishing

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:25.120
Totally in the proper idea of kind of democracy there because the knowledge itself has weaponizable applications of that scale

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.760
Or you get increasing

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.520
Truly global catastrophes or you create a massive surveillance state

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:35.760
Those all are bad

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.600
There are better answers, but they're not obvious. They require innovation and totally new types of governance

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.560
Governance of lots of things. So, you know, those are things we work on

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.360
but um, I

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:54.960
Don't think that there are any systems of governance known to dates that can deal with these kinds of issues

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.080
I

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.680
Yeah, thank you so much here. I'm gonna unspotlight folks real quick. Um

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.480
And you know, we're coming in right here on the end of our conversation. I know Eric

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.560
Eric, I know well, uh, has a question raised if it's quick, Eric

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.280
If you still want to ask it go ahead and ask and then, um, daniel can share some closing thoughts

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.280
So, um, in fact, shelly asked very similar question to what I was going to ask

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.400
and I do want to thank you for your answers to the questions afterwards because

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.920
their monologue seem to have been a

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.880
um, basically a list

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:49.680
And it includes numbers like, you know, the however many people the Mongols killed and how much money is being put into ai

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.880
which

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:57.040
Are are nice to know, but I think you could assume that the people in this audience

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.640
Have been working on the basic questions for a long time

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:05.520
So my hypothetical hypothetical question is suppose we all knew

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.720
Everything that you had to say except for those little numbers

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.520
What would you say instead?

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:30.320
It's always hard to talk to an audience that you don't know what is shared knowledge

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.920
Um, what's shared world view? It's always a tricky tricky thing. Um

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.320
So my

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.080
Uh ideal situation is

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:50.720
To get to understand what a group is working on like what the shared knowledge is and what they're already

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.040
working on together and what things

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:58.000
Would be useful or empowering for them. What are the things that they're working on and then see do I know anything?

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.080
It would be useful. Maybe you don't

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.680
um

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.680
You know, it could be things about

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.280
Uh

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.960
Pathways of enacting solutions like specific strategies for enactment could be things about

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:20.640
prioritization of amongst all the problematic things which ones make sense to sequence attention on

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.200
it could be

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.280
um

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:32.160
deepening the understanding of the problem assessment in terms of the causal dynamics more such that

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.440
Um clear insight about what the effective kinds of strategies would be

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:42.800
But it would depend upon what was already known and what wasn't and what was interesting

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.040
And

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:52.080
Well, Daniel, we might need to talk more at some point

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:58.400
But uh, I just uh want to give you a chance. Uh, it's uh 904 your time

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:02.320
I know, um, but do you want to share some closing thoughts with with the group here?

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:06.080
I

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.760
I was um

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:12.640
I didn't know who was in the group uh beforehand, you know, and you invited me here. I was uh

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.120
uh

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.560
Happy to see how many people were scientists and where people who've been working on these issues for a long time knew

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.120
Uh a lot about it. I um

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.880
That's not the case of faith communities in general. Um, so I think that's awesome

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
if there was a

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:36.240
Follow-up of okay, let's kind of share

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:43.840
What our state-of-the-world assessment is and what our current thoughts for how to what we care to do and how we

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:48.960
Think about how to enact that are and be able to engage there. That would be really interesting

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.760
um

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.760
and

01:52:55.280 --> 01:53:03.040
Uh, if there are people who are like have backgrounds and things and are working on things that feel like there are

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:09.680
Interesting follow-ups we might engage in if Keith maybe you send me a list about of that and that would also be really cool

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:20.640
Definitely will do. Yeah. Well, maybe we can end with some stillness and getting back in touch with that sacred center and

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:26.800
Thank you so much Daniel for sharing your thoughts. I would like to hear the harvest

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:31.200
From this so if some of you stay and continue to talk Keith if you would share

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.800
um harvest and there are interesting follow-ups to the intersection of the

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.320
um

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.320
kind of spirituality that

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.560
is not

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.560
incommensurable with any other

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:48.720
worldview or religion that has uh

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:56.400
In sacredness listening conscience at the center that also has environmentally interested people and scientists like this is

01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.720
Really delightful. I'm really happy to have met the people here and so I look forward to hearing more

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.080
Thanks

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:39.920
All right, so um the folks who are staying I um

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.720
Want to just share with you all um the queries that we have uh, if this is not like I think any time with queries

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.720
It's really where's spirit drawing us?

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:56.240
But the questions I've written ahead of time are how might QEW as an organization respond with deep earnestness

01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.720
to the crisis we face today

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:03.760
Given Daniel's talk what new insights or challenges are we seeing?

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:11.600
And three how might our Quaker faith inspire us in taking on our civilization all right at that?

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:20.000
So I'll drop those in the chat and then I just want to invite folks to start raising their hands and maybe once five hands are up

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.840
um

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:28.480
So I'll drop those in the chat and then uh as folks are led just raise your hands and we can begin this discussion

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.960
Thank you so much everyone

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:32.960
I'll note as someone who really loves

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:35.360
Daniel's analysis that i'm like

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:39.760
A little nervous because he does get laid something laid on pretty heavy sometimes

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:46.960
But I think it's really important for us to actually um as people who are called to spirituality not to avoid those facts

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:50.640
But to to really face up to them and ask a couple of us what conscience

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:53.360
How conscience would have have us respond?

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:55.440
so

01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.440
at that

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Just waiting for hands. We got four hands

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.840
and

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.120
Yeah, five

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:08.400
Okay, or four, but anyway story if you want to go ahead and start us off

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:14.320
Yeah, I I can only speak to number two because i'm i'm lutheran

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.760
And I have a very different um

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.720
Well, let's just say we do things a little differently

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.800
Um same general idea. Love your neighbor. Love god with all your heart mind and soul

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.160
The the thought that occurred to me

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.320
is

01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:36.080
I as having deep roots in the scientific community

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:38.800
Going back over 50 years

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.520
uh, I'm

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.720
I'm

01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.120
Feel motivated to say how can we kind of merge these points of use?

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:55.440
And for example in the geologic view, there's the oceanographers. There's the astrophysicist. There's the geochemists

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.320
There's the paleoclimatologist

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:05.120
There's all these sub branches all the way going down to high temperature superconductors because that's part of the same physics

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:13.120
And so we know we're very good at working with other groups and seeing things from their point of view because they're all valid

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.680
And together you you kind of get a broader more deeper perspective

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:25.440
Because I I heard very solid analysis from daniel on geopolitics and the reality of certain

01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.160
government interactions and you know

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.640
history

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.640
but there's a

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:36.880
There's a climate aspect that is not well socialized

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.600
There are our demographic aspects that are not well socialized. My wife is from taiwan

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.320
And having that kind of personal connection

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:51.360
You notice things they don't publish because they're right there in front of you on the ground

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:59.680
And i'm just wondering where would it be best to kind of fuse those perspectives into a greater one

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.520
because

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.320
I really firmly believe if you're going to make wise

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:07.680
powerful decisions, you gotta know what you face

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.080
Hey

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.320
Ronnie, I think you know, I think everyone can see this list and

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.280
if we

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:24.160
um

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:29.040
Yeah, so um, we'll try to I see your hand raised. Don't worry. Ronnie. You want to respond?

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.840
for sure I do, um

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.080
I mean I pushed back at the end because

01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:44.240
Not everybody here is a scientist and I sure as hell don't want to be in a a group with just scientists

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:50.320
There's people like me who are more social scientists and and the strategist for

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.880
Community organizing and all of that kind of thing and so, you know

01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:00.480
I one of the things that I find is, you know, we are I don't think we have

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.640
Some of the answers we truly need and and yet

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:11.600
I also bring a strong native american orientation to this and

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.320
You know, we can do this from a um

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.080
Whatever this is, I mean native peoples have been, you know, destroyed

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:27.280
For centuries and and whatnot. So it's nothing new

01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:33.760
I think, you know, it just to put that into a perspective and I think it's, you know

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.520
I was fascinated with the elder discussion because that's an area where I have a

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:47.440
High a law, you know, a large expertise and and cooperative structures that we're a bunch of older people in this country

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.080
And we could start playing and organize around how we're going to take care of ourselves

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:54.480
So that burden isn't on the younger generation

01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:02.240
But we did talk about there being guidance from younger people and some of the younger people are starting to organize for

02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:06.640
What do we do after things break down?

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.360
So, you know, I just um

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:12.720
I don't think we're going to come to terms with it scientifically

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.200
I sure don't think we're going to come to terms with it if we do a whole bunch of philosophizing

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.200
I think we've got to

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.200
Hit the ground with our boots on

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.080
Whatever that is

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.800
I

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:37.280
I just want to invite folks who have their hand raised just speak in order that your hands are raised. Um

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.800
Yeah

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.320
So that's jenny jenny wrackliffe right now

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.320
Uh, I I just want to mention a couple of things and and because I spoke earlier. I'll be quick

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:55.920
That there are several examples. I can think of

02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:00.960
Of given given that you're number two and number three

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.080
keys

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:08.000
I look to people like e f shoe marker

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:09.840
gandy

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.600
Martin Luther king

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:20.160
And and others that some of us are already familiar with as to how we can actually build a bridge between the spiritual root

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:21.920
and our

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:29.280
This transformation that we're trying to bring about at the deepest possible level and turn that into practical action

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:30.800
and when

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.000
gandy

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.960
Made the savo dear movement in in india

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:42.560
I think as much as the satyagraha movement where he was is which he's known for about peacemaking and and and

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.080
An indian liberation from the british and so on

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.600
um

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.000
his his practical program of of appropriate technology

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:56.240
Deep economy deep deep ecology in effect

02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:58.800
thomas berry spoke to this and

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:06.000
We're we're trying to integrate those things in our own lives. I think I mean daniel sort of

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:10.000
Painted a picture where in a sense we're faced with a dilemma

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.920
Do we do we have to enter the corporate world in order to be able to understand how to fix it?

02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:18.240
Do we do this

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.680
Are we are we compromising our purity of our intentions if we understand how

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:30.880
You know the the armaments industry works or something like that and if the criteria is to be effective

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:37.760
But the criteria it has to be to be effective from in a spiritually guided

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:40.240
And transformative way

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:45.440
And that's the challenge we're facing and I think that people like shoe marker

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:53.520
Gandy and others actually gave us practical examples of how we can do this on the ground real practical stuff

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.720
And and also what you were saying rain you is it about integrating

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.640
Indigenous knowledge. We're trying to do that as well to bring

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.720
Bring out not just the sort of way that we might be able to adapt to the doom that we're already facing but to

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:14.480
Make the transformation ahead of time so we minimize the amount of chaos that we're producing

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:26.400
And I think yeah that that really resonates with me jenny that the root of it is actually conscience at spirit

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.840
And conscience leads us to act

02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:37.040
Um, so I just want to share that and that the power the potency of that cultivating the potency of that

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.360
Is I think what I'm calling prophetic voice

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080
But um, nancy

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.080
Thank you, I was really really grateful

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:52.640
Our keith that you brought daniel here

02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:57.760
And began a dialogue with him that I think will circle back into

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.960
I have heard him a number of times before so

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.600
Much of what he had to say

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:07.600
Was not as hard to hear

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.200
In a way as it was the first time and there's a certain relief

02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.840
In the the speaking of that and then engaging with it

02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.080
In his models emphasizing strategy

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.040
He omits another way of thinking

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:26.320
That can bring together the guidance of spirit

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:32.480
Which is particularly a central in clarity being clear about our goals

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.760
And then being the right kinds of goals

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.720
Some of which can be put into words

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:43.760
Some of which is a response of the moment of the kind jenny is talking about and he spoke of

02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:46.240
Where spirit takes you over

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:53.600
What I'm interested in the complementarity with it is comparable to strategy is the notion of design

02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:57.040
Of social design where science

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:01.920
All the sciences both the physical the biological

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.560
The social sciences

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.560
Each have a contribution

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:10.160
To naming the givens the art of design

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.880
Is comprehending the givens

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:16.320
In combination

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.360
With the aspirations of the heart led by spirit

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.960
And among the givens understanding the realities

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:26.960
Of the situation you're in and the path dependencies and so forth

02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:34.880
And then with a collective effort of mutual creativity gained by really hearing each other

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:41.360
To then begin to lay out what are the system requirements and what are

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:45.120
The places in the system of leverage points

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.680
Where the changes of the right kind could shift the outcomes

02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:56.080
And at those points what are what I would call at that point design specs for solutions

02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.120
And looking at stories

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:06.960
It's important to understand the stories of failure. It is equally important to understand the stories of success

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:09.440
I would say to him

02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:12.400
Look at the open government movement in taiwan

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:20.640
Talk about an adjacent possible that just suddenly exploded. Nobody could have guessed not only a different way of governing at scale

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.080
A truly participatory governance at scale

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.440
But a different strategy for a kind of different kind of revolution that would occur

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:35.920
Look at the reamp project in the u.s. And the notion of collective impact and

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:38.400
And the notion of collective impact and

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.800
Stanford's

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.520
Social design and so forth. Let us look for

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:46.240
those places where there are not only

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:50.720
The accidents of the right person at the right place at the right time

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:53.440
that history yields

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:56.560
But those things that are replicable replicable that suggest

02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:02.000
These are ways of being together ways of meeting our needs

02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.280
That as I have put it to meet the needs of all by healing not harming

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:11.040
Planetary people our material needs. Where are their examples?

02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.920
Of that and then where are the examples?

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:18.160
Of as in the reamp project bringing all the elements

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:25.040
Of a system that was resulting in horrific pollution in the american midwest

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.440
Each of them as human beings to come together and jointly map

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:36.640
The systems that they were in coming to know each other's human beings and the roles of each and then together saying

02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:40.880
If we change these leverage points in this system

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:46.480
We could dramatically change we could reverse instead of being the most polluting part of the country

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:52.240
We could become the model of the opposite as you know Keith. They were stunningly successful

02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:57.120
They stopped the production that going online of 30 power plants

02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:01.680
So I want us to study closely where those things do come together

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:07.840
And the ways in which deep listening and love towards each other opens up creativity

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:14.080
That is otherwise again the adjacent possible. We don't even yet know what it could look like and lastly

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:21.120
The situation we confront we're all part of the problem and potentially all part of the solution

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.760
Is radically different

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:31.520
Than confrontational one issue even if the issue is colonialism one issue one shot warfare

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:35.200
This is a really different opportunity in human history

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:45.600
Thank you so much Nancy for sharing that and I couldn't agree more and I just that that um

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.920
I do think that that first example about taiwan is actually something I've talked directly to daniel about before

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:54.640
Um, so it's something on his radar

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.360
Brad

02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:03.920
Uh, I apologize zoom is uh decided again that I shouldn't you shouldn't see me except in a uh a picture

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.400
So i'm gonna leave the picture there. Um

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.080
A couple of things struck me in terms of what he what he was saying. Um

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:18.800
I was struck by when he grabbed me when he said uh one of our alternatives is to die with dignity

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.440
um and i'm um

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:25.520
And working out of that one of the things that that and then he gave he gave a model

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.280
I mean he gave a lot of examples

02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:34.000
But one of the examples he gave I thought was by moving was he said about to bet and how to bet could have anticipated

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.200
But their culturally weren't set to it, but they could have anticipated

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.760
by their geographic

02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.040
placement

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:47.440
That they were between two major powers and that they were vulnerable and done something about it and interestingly

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.440
what he

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.440
Said this they could have gone to europe and asked for

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.400
um, essentially military support it sounded like. Um, or some kind

02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:00.320
What i've noticed is and and i've and i've um

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.720
Is is a lack on

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:09.920
On on certain of many of us are not wanting to push back

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.680
Um, and what I was hearing him say was you need to study

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:22.000
The you need to study the the opponents so to speak and you need to understand them in order to know how to how to resist them

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:27.920
In a way that's going to actually be effective and what he said was if not being effective is immoral

02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:31.920
And I and I thought that was extraordinary to say

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:33.520
um

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:38.080
It always struck me that that obama had told us in his books

02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:44.160
He was a compromiser and when you have him come into a situation where

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:46.880
for a while they

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:50.160
His his his party controlled all three

02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:56.240
Parts of government, you know the executive in both houses and they didn't just do what the

02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:02.800
What the republicans would have done which is roll over everything they could have just put in you know

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.000
um

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:10.160
Changed medicare and had universal health and two years of it before and then try to take it away

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.400
They they could have when they were doing the so-called bailout

02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:17.280
They could have bought out everybody's mortgages

02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:23.840
Taking over the banks. They had the rules to take over the banks and control them and they didn't do that

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:31.840
They they chose to just to give the money to the ceo's to be able to retire and what we and we all kind of

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.200
Okay

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.640
That's okay

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:41.040
And part of what what really has been bothering me, you know, and I and I

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:46.720
I grew up in a union house. I grew up, you know, and my died in the bowl

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.240
Democrats and

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:58.720
Is this that the the fear to be called liberal even it's like, oh, you're a liberal. Oh my god, you know and and running away from it

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:05.760
And and the pause what I'm hearing here is we need to resist we need to be more active

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.760
It doesn't necessarily mean for quakers to take up arms, but it does mean to fight

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.040
And there are ways to fight without

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:21.680
Taking up arms and shooting people, but it doesn't mean rolling over it doesn't mean dying with dignity

02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:23.920
It doesn't mean letting it happen

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:30.800
And and and that's what it's what what I feel I'm surrounded with too often in the so-called liberal world

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:38.320
Is that kind of well, let's get along. Let's not make waves. Let's compromise. Let's find a way out and you know

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:43.200
And not instead of saying no, this is wrong. We're going to stand up and resist

02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:44.640
um

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:45.920
and remember

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.920
peace teams one time had a

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:53.040
A picture of a girl this is before the current situation of a girl standing in front of a tank

02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:54.400
in

02:12:54.400 --> 02:13:00.720
Palestine and and protecting a trying to protect a house and and the tank ran over her and the house

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:09.120
And and the line was that they had they posted was people are willing to die for war. How many people are willing to die for peace

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:14.080
And it's at that level that we're talking about and I just feel um

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.760
I just feel like that's what he was asking of us

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:24.240
And in between the lines is is to have that kind of same level of energy and commitment

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.800
To really push back and push back effectively. Thanks

02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:35.920
Brad, I I just want to say you're speaking to my condition. I um really

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.280
Really appreciate that and um

02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:45.200
I'm not going to dominate this conversation, but I want to invite Brian. Yeah

02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.760
I

02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:53.440
Do want to

02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.000
I believe what Brad was just saying there

02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.920
but

02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:59.920
I do want to um

02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.920
At least point out that

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:06.800
There was an underlying fear

02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.600
That really wasn't being talked about

02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:12.400
Daniel has

02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:13.440
of

02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.120
Where we are

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:17.120
And I think that it's important that we

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.080
Understand that fear

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.320
As we move forward

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.360
That it's not an excuse for not moving forward

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:31.040
But that it's an important thing to understand perhaps that the

02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:36.240
Time frame that is available to make the changes that are required

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.200
Is no longer with us

02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:42.320
And how do we respond to that?

02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.560
The

02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.520
Fear of where we are with AI

02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:50.960
The fear we are with how much

02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:57.840
Information needs to be controlled cannot be talked about that he was afraid that

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:05.600
He would be recorded and that that might be extended to the rest of the world that he might misspeak

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.640
And he was afraid of that

02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:16.240
So I think that we need to understand his fears and we need to understand

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:20.880
Should we hold on to those same fears or

02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:24.800
Is that something that we have something special

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:27.360
within our approach

02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:30.400
That can work past those fears

02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:34.960
He is speaking to the fact that we need to

02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:39.840
Completely change the institutions the systemic

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:50.640
Approaches that are already in place all need to be changed and they all need to be changed simultaneously and that

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:53.840
There's nothing to be left behind

02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:56.560
that's revolution

02:15:56.560 --> 02:15:57.920
and

02:15:57.920 --> 02:15:59.920
Are we willing to

02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:02.240
step out

02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.480
to the levels of what does that mean and what does that mean within a

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.600
nonviolent approach

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.880
And what does that mean to

02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.440
our families

02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.200
and our neighbors

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:20.640
And the people that are you know that we love

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.120
That that we hold dear and what will the consequences be

02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.480
Of what we're going to make for the changes that have to happen

02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.080
To be able to prevent the worst of the things that have been outlined in front of us

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:40.560
Just an acknowledgement

02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:44.720
Thank you

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:48.160
Thank you rye, um David

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:55.120
Um if you can hear me

02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.040
Um

02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:06.000
I'm reminded of somebody's quote who suggested an effective strategy

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:13.440
Is to develop some sort of system which absolutes the existing system

02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:18.720
Yeah, yeah

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:27.680
We're never going to have the time to develop the skills to be able to

02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:33.920
Change corporate corporate america from the inside

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:38.960
I don't see that as something that makes sense for

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
qe w

02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:51.040
I'm intrigued by the idea of wilderness

02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:54.720
There isn't any

02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:59.840
But at least there's little pieces of nature that still exist

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:09.680
For us to develop the kind of intuition that he was talking about by exposure to nature

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.440
It seems like qe w needs to be

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.160
Looking for and attempting to preserve

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:25.360
What little bits of nature there still are in all growth forests in wilderness

02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:34.960
Those are the kinds of things that we might be able to be effective in our strategy of

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:44.400
Probably not at a federal level but more likely at a local level

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:51.840
And pointing out to the society around us

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:55.840
That those pieces of nature that still exist

02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:57.520
have

02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:59.520
things to teach us and

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.640
Are beautiful and affect our lives

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:09.280
If that makes sense

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.800
Thank you, David, uh, we have another David

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:24.080
Good morning friends 9 33 a.m. Now in

02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:29.520
Yeah, it was uh

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:35.920
I think I will have to try and get in contact with daniel if I know he's a busy man, but his responses about

02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:38.800
governmental processes

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:41.920
fascinate me because i'm certainly fascinated in

02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:44.080
democratic

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.480
which seems to me like peaceful ways of

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:54.080
You know moving the overton window as it were, you know, what's acceptable. What's not acceptable and so on so forth

02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:02.320
I do think that 17th century britain was a most fascinating time

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:05.920
Because of course it not only gave birth to friends

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:12.560
But in many ways it gave birth to at least the beginnings of democracy

02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:21.040
You know, uh, we basically had the parliament taking the power over the monarch and I think it was you keith who mentioned

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:29.600
Hobbes and whatnot earlier, you know, and there's you know, there's a whole lot of changes here that are happening. So I

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:32.960
personally am still holding the faith

02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:38.080
Very much that democracy is still evolving

02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.880
and so I

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.880
sometimes say that

02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:45.760
Quakers are my spiritual community

02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:48.480
which I dearly love

02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:54.400
Golf is my other religion because on the golf course nearer to thee am I and my lord when I'm

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.280
In that spiritual space

02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:01.840
But I will say that modern representative democracy is my true

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:07.360
Religion in the latin sense of that word religion, which basically means

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.240
Bonding what bonds us

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.640
you know, and

02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:14.800
I know we are very

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.800
Symbolic we work through symbolism a lot

02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:24.160
And so I think always I think my my holy of holies

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:30.000
is the two red lines down the center of the house of commons, which are

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:32.880
mythologically as it were

02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.040
Two broadswords apart

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:39.520
Now the symbolism of that is if you are the

02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:42.400
Speaker in the house of commons

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.560
to your right

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:46.560
sits his majesty's

02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:48.320
loyal government

02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:50.000
and to your left

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
sits his majesty's

02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:54.160
loyal opposition

02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:54.960
and

02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.040
So, you know, they clash thoughts

02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:01.200
But that's the essence of having to live in the age of reason

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:04.480
Because if we are to live in the age of reason

02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:06.400
we must

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:08.400
live in the age of

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:10.960
contention rivalry

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.040
because

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:15.520
Reason can give a valid answer on both sides

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:18.320
And I know many friends here

02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:21.040
have spoken about as it were

02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.280
think

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:25.840
locally act globally, you know

02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:28.800
now I

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:34.560
Warning, I may say something which upsets people here. Okay, but I will say first and foremost

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.160
I am very very very pro

02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:40.560
choice

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:42.560
okay, and

02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:44.880
I can respect

02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:48.880
the united states supreme court's decision

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:51.840
To make it a state thing

02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.880
Okay, so I hope that doesn't upset anybody too much

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.560
But on I would absolutely always go for pro-choice

02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:00.960
But I see the reasoning in it

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:03.360
It's up to you folks

02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:04.320
individually

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:09.920
As states or what have the case would be locally to decide what you as a community wish

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.080
And I think that is all the way through

02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:16.320
You know, um, but of course how we're lessing that into a

02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:22.320
Global public opinion as well is another matter. Anyway enough from me. Thank you

02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.280
And Leoma

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:34.240
A couple of things one it seems to me that

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:42.400
Finding spaces for you know, like the scientific the internal all these different states

02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.200
doesn't seem to me like such a

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:47.360
big conundrum

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:51.840
We just I think we might be well suited to find a way to

02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:54.720
honor all the different ones

02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:57.600
uh our

02:23:57.760 --> 02:23:59.760
practice with

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:05.440
Unity decision-making might help us be a place where we can

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:08.320
help model the structure of

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:11.760
Honoring all the different ways of knowing

02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.960
Going with the basic

02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:17.200
fundamental belief

02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:20.720
That there is something larger and deeper than us holding us

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:26.960
And that we also are not wise enough to know more than part

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:33.360
I mean, we're wise enough to know the QEW needs more diversity to have more

02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:36.320
more contention and more

02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:38.960
points of view, but um

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.040
And so that was one thing and the other thing is I've been wondering

02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:51.920
Considering our size. I mean, I'm troubled by this idea that we need experts

02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:55.280
um

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:56.720
Seems like a

02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.720
Very sound idea. We need experts in how to be effective

02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:04.800
In the places that are controlling resources

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.960
Which essentially what the big corporations and governments are

02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:11.280
they're

02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.440
channeling the way resources go

02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:17.040
and

02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:22.240
That but that's very daunting to get the amount of expertise to be

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Effective there

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:28.560
So I'm just putting that up as wow

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:32.560
Because if we don't maybe we won't get a chance

02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:35.200
to do where our

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.480
strengths is

02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:38.480
Or where our contribution is

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:41.600
but um

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:45.840
The other last thing I wanted to put forward is this idea that's been

02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:48.080
playing with me

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:49.680
about

02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:53.200
As a compliment to the gentle warrior

02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:57.520
Which Keith seems to be your archetype in some

02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:00.640
Some days at least

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:01.840
um

02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.400
The humble holy trickster

02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:08.000
Which is the one who's

02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:14.240
Uh, and there are other archetypes that we might well embrace in there or invent but

02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:17.200
But the humble holy trickster is the one

02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:20.320
Who is attuned to the emergence?

02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.520
I've been wondering about emergence as a compliment to good design, which is essential

02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:30.640
How do we

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.920
How can qe w as a small organization?

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:37.120
catalyze

02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:39.680
emergence

02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:43.040
By being alert to places where

02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:48.240
A small group can shift conversations

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.440
And connect

02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:57.280
Groups, I mean we're in our silo. We need to get out of it. How can we connect groups?

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.960
That

02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:04.080
When put together might come up with something we don't expect

02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:07.920
I mean, I think there are ways that emergence can be encouraged

02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:10.640
and there are ways in which

02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:12.640
it's

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:16.080
Being channeled towards emergence of pathways

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:21.680
We all know too well from our history in terms of the rival or stuff that daniel talked about etc

02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.040
but

02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:30.560
Well, I think our next person is suellin

02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:33.760
Thank you, liana

02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:36.480
You

02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:42.240
Um, I

02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.720
I want to in general say that I keep wanting to say that friend speaks my mind

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:50.400
And so and what many of you have said so thank you

02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:52.640
I have heard

02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:58.160
Maybe one thing but I also may have misheard it that concerns me

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:03.200
And um, and I want to respond to the first query

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:06.080
Um

02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:10.000
So let me say that now and then I can because it relates to what concerned me

02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:13.840
How could qe w respond with deep earnest?

02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:21.440
I don't have it in front of me, but deep earnestness to what we just heard from daniel. That's the way I'm going to truncate it

02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:25.120
And I will say

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:30.240
By actually honoring because we don't and no progressive groups do

02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:32.080
I think

02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:37.200
That's a black statement that I should don't have the right to move but we don't

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.200
honor

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:42.720
the study of effective strategy as much as we honor

02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:45.920
Having a phd in science

02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:54.320
We don't honor that and as a person who has been an organizer since I was 13 years old

02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:56.880
I will tell you the studies are out there

02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:03.840
And what they tell you is you'd better read them because for example people always bring up the civil rights movement

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.320
well guys

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:12.480
Read I've got the light of freedom that explained that it worked those marches to a large degree

02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:19.920
Not their only person. There's never one reason something works to a large degree because for 20 years organizations went into

02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:25.520
The black towns and did door-to-door canvassing and had community meetings

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.520
For 20 years before you saw any sit-ins and marches

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:33.120
Yet when people think they have studied effective strategy

02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:35.760
They think they're looking at the surface

02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:40.160
They haven't studied the effective strategy

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.880
and we do not as

02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:44.640
I

02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:48.560
Well, I don't call myself a liberal anymore because I call myself a lefty

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:53.440
because working class of economic things are always in front of me

02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:56.560
uh, and but what I'm going to say is

02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:58.560
You can't study it

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:04.480
But you can't study it just thinking you kind of know what people have said in a few places

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.880
You got to really find the studies

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:13.360
It took me years to find I've got the light of freedom and the Duke university professor who wrote it

02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:20.720
And that was 20 years of door knocking that your university professor who wrote it said I have looked for this book for years

02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.800
and I finally decided I had to write it

02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:29.120
And uh, uh, so you it is not easy, but we cannot tell ourselves

02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.200
surface things

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:34.080
If we wanted to change so if we wanted to be earnest

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:42.320
We would study effective strategy, but we'd really study it the other thing the thing that has concerned me two things

02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:45.360
One has been the idea that if we

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:53.680
Play in the some of the power circles to try to help things be better

02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:58.720
And we can't be sure it'll save the world but to do our best and play in some of us

02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:05.200
We will be corrupt like corporations. I think I've heard that in various words more than once

02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:07.600
No

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:09.600
That isn't at all necessary

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:15.520
Instead what we need to do is again go to root cause and figure out why corporations

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:18.480
Have so much power. Well

02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:20.720
partly right

02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:24.720
They have so much power because they've elected people who care so much about

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.640
I mean

02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:31.920
It was so different when I worked for congress when all the members of congress or a lot of them had been

02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:38.000
Planned by the vant and a vietnam war and the civil rights movements. You guys it was a different world

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.040
And that's people

02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:43.360
so we need to respect that

02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:46.720
Power is a really

02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:54.400
One of the things to do and I will finally say I do not believe conscience leads to action

02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:58.320
I believe

02:31:58.320 --> 02:31:59.680
love

02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:06.240
Of things like as I said in my five-year thing looking in the eyes of a wolf not frankly to be honest

02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:12.880
I know often people talking about carbon credits, which I think are really important and stuff because people just go

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:16.560
Look in the eyes of the wolf and tell me if it's okay with you

02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:19.120
Vow's eyes go extinct

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:22.240
Because you're approaching love

02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:26.240
And what I want to say is that

02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:29.760
We need some love to help

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:32.480
There be tactics

02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:38.720
But as he as Daniel said about the 10,000 things put you in touch with the dow

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:41.200
The knocking on the doors

02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:49.920
The canvas is what puts off is as valid at put for putting us up in touch with spirit as sitting in a me for worship

02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.880
And we don't really

02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:55.840
All that we don't

02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:59.600
and I think because it is

02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:05.280
The story of that I tried to find from organizing is people did a little bit

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:09.040
They were reinforced and then they did a little bit more

02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:18.080
So that door knocking or whatever is where god is I believe

02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:27.920
I'll go ahead and share just a bit. My hand kept dropping. I think it's because my mic's off

02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:33.840
Um, and then we're back. I'll invite you but I I really did want to share just a bit that um

02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:46.960
Yeah, I think I mean, I think that Naomi both knows me well

02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:52.320
And says it well that I think that the the orientation towards this that I'm called to

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:56.240
Is something like a peaceful warrior, which is the one that's willing

02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:02.400
That you know, there's a beautiful some beautiful quotes from some very peaceful warriors, uh in the 19

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.240
Bear uh, I'm trying to remember his first name right now

02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:11.120
There's a few but you know, essentially, um

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.760
admonishing

02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:16.800
Quite, you know peacemakers people who claim to be peacemakers

02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:22.400
But who are unwilling to pay any significant price for that and they you know claim. I want peace

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:27.280
I want peace but they do it with half a heart and half a will and because of that

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:33.760
The war continues because all they really want is the volaties of peace all they really want is

02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:36.480
peace in my little bubble

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:42.320
Right and I think as long as that's what we're going for we're actually completely out of line with conscience

02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:48.880
That's what I I think gardening is a beautiful thing. I think rooting ourself in that deep

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:54.960
Groundedness with the earth is so foundational to transforming ourselves and transforming the world

02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:57.360
But if we're not stepping outside of our bubble

02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.480
We're not aligned with god. We're not aligned with conscience. We're actually just

02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.760
Faking it. We're we're middle-class white people

02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:08.400
wanting to feel good

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:10.400
And so I think

02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:16.400
Is I hope doesn't admonish people so much that they don't feel that every small thing you do makes a difference

02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:19.040
Every little thing even if you didn't step

02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:22.640
You know, you didn't bat your eyelashes to kill that little

02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:28.960
Or whatever it is everything even if you die tomorrow the little things you did today

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:35.600
Made some difference and so that's that's the ground that we work from is that foundation

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.160
Everything makes a difference

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:39.760
but if I'm going to be

02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:44.640
Absolutely if I'm going to be true to our bigger ancestry and I'm going to give my life to god

02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:46.800
I'm going to give my life to conscience

02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:48.880
There can't be any

02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:52.960
Cans and butts about that. It's actually everything is on the line

02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:57.520
And that means I'm willing I'm going to recognize that we do live in a world

02:35:57.760 --> 02:35:59.760
That's much more complicated than it was

02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:03.680
100 years ago and if human envy is going to be a good steward of this planet

02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:08.400
We're probably going to get it need to be a little bit better at sense making what's going on

02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:10.640
we're also

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:17.200
Going to get a lot better at solving our problems interrelationally with one another we're going to have to get better at peacemaking

02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.480
Um, I think that the main thing I would say is you know, we were saying the problem is the institutions

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:25.680
The problem isn't the institutions. We don't have a global institution

02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:32.640
There's its complete rule of power by tooth and claw and in our anarchy and its worst sets

02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:35.120
At the at the global level

02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:38.720
That's not that's not entirely true. I want to you know, the un has been amazing

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.280
There's been things that have progressed us against that trend towards violence

02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:47.760
um, and and there's really earnest people fighting for that. Um

02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:50.160
but

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:52.160
We need global cooperation

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:57.520
If we want to be a wise steward of this planet and to do that we have to do deep peacemaking

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.680
Not shallow. Oh, why don't you just all get along kind of peacemaking but like

02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:07.600
Resolving historical trauma kind of peacemaking and creating peace between peoples

02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:09.040
um

02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:15.040
And then we have to I think humble ourselves before the living world that we're all apart and realize that there's a wisdom

02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:18.160
Implicit in all of this that is so much faster

02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:25.840
Than anything we have to touch with and if we're able to surrender ourselves to that and say that's actually that's the prime objective

02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:29.200
Is just to be a an instrument

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:31.200
of that that's

02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:36.320
To me what conscience would have me do and I do think I would push back against any one didn't today

02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.200
but I I I see

02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:41.520
Maybe it's just a mystical sense

02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:44.800
That uh, the force of non-violence is as of yet

02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:47.280
Unrealized in its fullness in the world

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:50.240
And that's what I want to see qe w leaning into

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:52.880
Um not tomorrow but today

02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.840
You

02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:12.240
And Rebecca I'm realizing sorry I was thank you Rebecca

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:21.760
So I want to thank you and I want to thank sue ellen. I think sue ellen you have a lot of wisdom about

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:24.320
a strategy for

02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:26.000
moving forward

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.240
But I I really want us all to listen to one another by

02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:33.680
listening in tongues because I'm going to

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:37.600
Speak to the first question

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.920
um

02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:45.600
I don't usually come to these gatherings, but I I really felt compelled after listening to

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:48.880
a

02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:51.040
Presentation daniel spoke

02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:54.160
That was sent to me

02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:57.040
So I came tonight

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.640
I'm a part of new england yearly meeting on abinackey unceded territory

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:04.960
and

02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:07.760
in their earth care ministry committee

02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:11.680
And um

02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:14.000
number one

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.880
I've got three points one is that

02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:21.120
The love of god

02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:23.120
However, you interpret that

02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.080
Calms our fears

02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:31.680
Calms our fears

02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:37.680
The second point as a social scientist

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:43.040
I really believe in something that he's just shared about

02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:46.080
We need to create

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:48.080
places of trauma

02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:50.560
informed

02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:52.640
gatherings

02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:56.400
That are part of our

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.320
Specialties

02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:03.760
Our specialties as scientists

02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:07.360
Whether that be social or natural

02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:11.200
Or physical sciences

02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:16.080
Whether that be as farmers

02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:18.960
Or as

02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:20.960
Pastors or as

02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:22.960
Economists

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:25.360
Whatever that is

02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.040
To humbly sit together

02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:34.800
And listen for spirit to talk to us deeply

02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:39.840
And then come together and share those truths

02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:43.440
That we have discerned

02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:45.920
That will move us forward

02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:49.520
On a path

02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:51.680
That maybe

02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:55.760
able to speak to some of those entities that

02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:01.840
Know our language and would be able to hear us

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:06.320
From the voice that we have that is

02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:10.880
somewhat unique as a people of faith

02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.600
And lastly

02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:21.440
Live into those paradigms that we have discerned

02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:24.400
Through the spirit

02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.320
That we don't have to keep doing what is being done

02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:38.000
We can move in that new way just like our early early forebears

02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:41.280
Moved in a different

02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:44.400
Way than the culture around them

02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:48.560
We can do the same

02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:53.600
We can be known as those wacky quakers

02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.480
Don't quite walk the same walk or talk the same talk

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:09.840
That was number three so anyway, thank you very much. Thank you for this program

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:22.800
I'm noticing that Juniper is on the move but Chamba, Nora and Juniper's hand is raised. Nora, are you wanting to share?

02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:31.760
Yeah, sorry Juniper was needing constant movement right now and I wasn't going to be able to think in

02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:35.840
So dad took him for a second

02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:42.560
I

02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:51.040
I mean what what was really pulling at me raising my hand um

02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:54.160
Why was my hand was

02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:56.400
I think that

02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:00.880
I actually don't want to frame it that way. I I have a deep felt knowing

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:04.800
I'm not even going to say sense. I have a I have a deeply felt knowing

02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:08.240
um

02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:11.040
That

02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:18.960
Quakers are being called and have been just for some time to get really uncomfortable

02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:29.200
And I think that's been dawning on us slower than it should be slower than it needs to be

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:35.200
Um, I mean, I think it there's of course

02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:40.960
I've heard echoes of that today already, but there's a

02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:46.560
There's a deep discomfort that we need to step into

02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:52.080
And I think QEW is a part of that. I think we

02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:02.240
I think any moment that we feel righteous we should question

02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:05.440
And I heard that in Daniel's talk around

02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:11.360
You know, if you think that you if you think you know, you're probably causing harm

02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:27.440
We are having a conversation in this house. I think it was last night my sense of time is a little weird since having a baby. Um

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:29.840
Um

02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:32.640
But we are having a conversation about different

02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:36.720
Different cultures in different ways of

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:42.880
Of just approaching things and

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:47.360
And how what we think is like what's needed

02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:54.080
Is coming from our own cultural frame and I think those kinds of conversations are really important

02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:05.200
But I think that we can't get too hung up on trying to be so perfect as to know everyone's cultural frame

02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:08.080
As to know

02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:13.360
What's going to be the deep understanding that's underneath all of it. It's okay. We have our cultural frame

02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:19.280
If someone came into our circle, they were like, well for my political frame, this is what we understand

02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:22.480
We wouldn't say, oh, well, let's go deeper than that because that's not

02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:28.960
That's cultural frame. That's not valid. We we'd say, oh, thank you so much for bringing that

02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:34.560
We need to get uncomfortable enough to say

02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:37.520
This is my frame

02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:42.800
This is where I'm coming from and I'm a piece of the puzzle and I'm gonna step in

02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:50.000
And that's uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable to claim something because when you claim something you can be ostracized for it

02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:56.080
And actually you're gonna have to change it the moment you claim it

02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:00.480
You have to change it because the moment you claim it you start learning about it and you start learning about yourself

02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:02.560
Oh, this is my experience of being human

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.480
And then it starts to shift and how uncomfortable to be on shifting sand all the time

02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:18.320
But I think that's where god wants us to go. I think that's where spirit always has lived

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:25.200
You

02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:35.200
You think there's other things that that come to me about the whole question of rite of passage and and

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:43.200
And the frame of a rite of passage feels really powerful, but um

02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:49.120
Honestly, none of that is feeling very led for me to say so I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stop there

02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:56.560
As your partner, I'm very moved

02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:00.560
Um, that was really powerful

02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:03.600
Thor

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:10.240
Man so many many good people that talks tonight. I just I'm thoroughly impressed

02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:14.720
I'm gonna summon up the game of rock paper scissors

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.880
because

02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.040
A lot of us would like to pick up a sword and battle it out, but that's just not

02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:24.640
Politically correct anymore, especially in a democracy

02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:30.080
So that we switch over the paper and it's really a political legislative process

02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:36.160
Getting out the vote going to door to door getting the right people in congress and we already know what they're gonna vote on

02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:42.080
They're gonna vote for reforms. They're gonna do the right thing or close enough. That's how represented democracy works

02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:48.960
And some of us well, let's just say rock is easier to break up than to change your mind

02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:51.680
We've got brains. We soak up information

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:58.080
Um, I mean I I I was faced with a genetic condition my son. I went into a medical library

02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:01.600
No background in medicine 10 hours later. I had the diagnosis

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:04.720
I can do those kind of mental gymnastics

02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:07.120
Most people can't

02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:12.000
Most people can't spend a couple hours a day just trying to keep current on what's going on out there in the science world

02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.720
But I find hope in knowing what's going on

02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:23.280
Even if it's in the early stages, you know, vanadium peroxide soaks up carbon dioxide

02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:29.280
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it's not but I'm sure it's going to be either replaced by something better or it will do

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:34.400
That that's the realm of people spend two hours a day every day

02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:37.280
Soaking up information because that's something I'm good at

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:43.280
So I'm a rock. I know it. I'm a lousy politician and I certainly don't want to go with a broadsword out there

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:51.600
But we got a system of domination. It's a kinder, gentler one. We see it in our housing. We see it in our financial system

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
We see it in our retirement system

02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:56.960
And I I

02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:01.840
I love the problems we have in the United States solely because I know they're worse everywhere else. They go in the world

02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:04.320
so

02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:07.520
I'm just saying being aware is so powerful

02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:12.640
And getting out and you know, if you're really going to say you love your neighbor

02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:15.840
You're willing to get outside. You're a little little bubble

02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.600
And I hear you say you love nature, but I really like meeting people that are really different than me

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:26.000
They think differently. They're culturally different

02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:33.600
That's what's really going to change and I think that is the the singular strength of a group like this is we can get out

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
and meet our neighbors

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:39.840
And we can make a persuasive story that you know

02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:43.440
I think God calls us to be a servant

02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:49.520
We are called to do the right thing. We're not supposed to be a reactionary. We're not supposed to be afraid to change

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
We don't have such rocks, you know

02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:55.680
Set rules about the way it should be like it was in 1940

02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:01.680
And that is I think you're this the signature power of this group

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:04.960
I don't know. I got I'm really impressed

02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:07.280
You

02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:13.280
Thank you Thor we'll keep in conversation. Um, uh, allen

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.480
Oh, I was kind of hoping you wouldn't call on me

02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:21.840
I

02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:25.360
I've I've been listening to everyone and really

02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:30.000
appreciating all the deep and moving wisdom and the um

02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:38.880
And and I feel like what I mostly have to bring is uh confusion and I'm I'm kind of wrestling deeply with a lot of what uh

02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:42.240
Daniel brought forth, but um

02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:45.520
there's

02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:48.240
Part of me that is pushing back

02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:55.040
Against uh, I found I found a lot of our conversations and but there's been little

02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:57.840
glimmerings

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:02.720
Of something else, but I found a lot of them tonight to be very human bounded

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
um

02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:14.240
That uh, when I look from my geo and it's really I think more my geological perspective than my quaker perspective

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:19.680
this kind of pushing back on that that uh, when I look at nature

02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:22.720
I don't see

02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:25.280
um

02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:30.320
Well competition is certainly the norm, but it's always

02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:33.040
eventually ultimately bounded

02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:35.920
and cooperation

02:51:36.880 --> 02:51:41.040
Is also the norm and um

02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:48.880
I think this it's not just human bounded but time bounded but that

02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:58.080
In the rise of western civilization there was this domination mindset that emerged

02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:04.800
and it's uh, it's a fire and the um

02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:08.080
lack of fire

02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:10.800
It's burning

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:14.320
Literally, I mean every time we drive a car

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:17.520
We're burning the earth

02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:20.240
and

02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:23.440
Like all fires

02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:25.680
It's a

02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:32.960
Daniel referred to exponential growth a number of times. This is growing exponentially that is growing exponentially and

02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:39.520
I think uh for years I taught my students that all exponential growth

02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:46.800
Is ultimately self limiting that nothing can grow exponentially and it's only in the last year

02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:50.080
That I realized that was wrong

02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:53.920
That there's another kind of fire

02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:01.520
That uh, there are things it's only things

02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.520
That consume

02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:11.200
That can't grow exponentially things that produce

02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:14.800
Things that are generative love

02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:17.200
No

02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:24.400
No wisdom, I won't say know how know how governed by wisdom

02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:27.600
That can grow exponentially

02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:32.800
And so the question the confusion the thing I'm wrestling with

02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:37.200
I have I keep having this image of moses

02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:42.400
In the uh

02:53:42.640 --> 02:53:44.640
Meeting the burning bush

02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:51.200
And it was a burning with a fire that did not consume

02:53:52.640 --> 02:54:04.160
And my theory of that my thought of that has always been that what was transformational there

02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:12.320
Was not that that bush was any different than any other bush or any tree

02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:15.280
Any animal or any being including us

02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:18.240
Is that moses

02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:21.360
Saw the life force in it

02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.400
Whether there was some

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:27.680
Sometimes I've looked at our redbud trees and

02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:33.120
In spring and I've thought oh, is that the burning bush? Is that the

02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:36.480
That life force

02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:41.680
And he recognized

02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:45.040
The spirit

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:47.200
In that

02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:54.320
The god and he took off his shoes to make himself more like the bush to grow to find that deep rooting

02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:03.040
And I there there he was often the wilderness in some ways. I think you're one person

02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:09.360
Meeting god

02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:16.240
Yet he transformed the world from that experience

02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:27.520
And I think that fire and genia alluded to it and other people alluded to it ultimately I think it's love

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:32.800
And

02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:37.680
So my question is what kind of fire burns in us

02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:41.440
I

02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:46.320
I'll just leave it with that

02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:54.480
I'm just gonna

02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:59.280
share something and I think when you're talking about cooperative and competitive forces

02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:05.600
But I think in I mean sew on if you feel called, please do share but I'm thinking that that might have been

02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.400
That might have been our moment

02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:12.880
Just leave it with what I'll say. So if you want to share though, please do great. Well

02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:16.240
All right, Thor if you're willing

02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:18.640
Is it a final?

02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:20.960
Just a final piece

02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:24.080
Yep final piece and it's kind of a prayer

02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:27.280
I'm going to just relate

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:30.160
That after my first son died

02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:33.040
I gave thanks to him

02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:35.040
I gave thanks for his life

02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:37.280
I gave thanks for the influence it had on me

02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:40.480
And it felt like the sky burned

02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:45.280
So when I read that mozo saw the burning bush

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400
I know he was in that

02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.000
mindset

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.520
To be thankful for the things that we all fear

02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:58.480
The things that scare us the things that challenge us

02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:05.600
And I've never felt so in awe and so strong in my life as that day

02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:10.560
And that's what I wish for you and all the challenges we face

02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:16.400
That you look them in and understand them and give thanks for them

02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:22.240
Because we are born in a time where there's good great promise and great challenge

02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:26.080
And if you are so blessed

02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:28.880
The sky will burn for you

02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:38.560
You

02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:08.560
You

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:37.920
You

02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:44.240
I was gonna post this in the chat, but

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:49.440
I couldn't find it. I just didn't want to disturb the silence, but

02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:54.800
There's a prayer from pema children that she shares

02:58:57.840 --> 02:59:01.920
In her book the places that scare you and she says

02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:06.480
May the roots of all suffering diminish

02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:12.400
May hatred violence addiction and neglect also decrease

02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:21.280
And we see all that separates us as as insubstantial as our dreams

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:27.440
May we go to the places that scare us

02:59:27.440 --> 02:59:31.200
May you be a warrior of light
