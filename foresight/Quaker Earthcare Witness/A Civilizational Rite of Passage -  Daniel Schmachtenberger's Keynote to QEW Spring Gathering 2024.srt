1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
It's my great joy to introduce Daniel Schmockenberger to you all.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:21,160
Daniel is a wonderful polymath, really extraordinary public speaker who is the head of the Civilization

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:29,240
Research Institute and co-founder of the Conciliance Project and is probably, this is kind of the

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,360
personal story, there's two people in the last five years of my life that have really

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,000
dramatically shifted my world view, my spirituality, etc., and of people living, of living people

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,960
I would say that Daniel and Robin Wall Kimmerer, who are brave and sweet grass, have been

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:54,680
the two kind of major ships for me and have greatly not only shifted my view of the world

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,600
and what we need to be doing in it, but also have really grounded me spiritually, have

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
shifted my kind of heart sense of how to relate.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
And so obviously Daniel and I have met once before, but anytime I get to see Daniel, it's

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,920
just a joy to bring him in and a joy to introduce him to the Quaker Earth Care Witness community,

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
all others.

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,440
So QEW is an organization, a Quaker organization that focuses on Earth Care concerns, we're

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,840
a global network, and we're really excited to bring Daniel in here today to talk about

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,840
a civilizational rite of passage, and obviously a rite of passage is something you don't know

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,080
what the end of it is, you don't know if we're going to make it, if we're not going to make

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,400
it, but what you can do is you can be faithful in the process, you can be true in the process.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,080
And I think that this being true is something that Daniel often refers to as deep earnestness.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,560
And so we're going to sort of investigate today some of what Daniel calls the metacrisis.

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,720
It's a term that's kind of thrown in a number of sort of sense-making communities that are

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:10,920
working on these large big picture topics, and how seeing that metacrisis coming under

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,520
the weight of that, how we can respond to it in a powerful and spiritual way.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,000
So with that, I just want to, those are my opening comments, and I just want to invite

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,240
Daniel, do you have anything you want to share before we kind of dive in?

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,240
My mom went to a friend's school when she was a kid and always spoke very highly of

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:41,000
her experience and had a mentor for a while when I was a kid named Dr. Everett Slumis.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,360
He was one of the kind of pioneers of natural medicine in the West and got to live on a

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,680
health retreat that he had when I was young, and he was a Quaker.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,760
And so I have not got to experience Quaker community very much myself, but I have very

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,920
positive associations.

31
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,880
And so it was cool when you told me about this.

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,480
And if my schedule is not overful with the timely things we're working on, I would have

33
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
joined you for the whole day because I like the tone of what you shared with me that you're

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:25,560
exploring here together, the spirituality that is in service of ecology, life, well,

35
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
deep earnestness and deep humility.

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
So being that you've had a full day and I haven't had all that, I hope that this weaves.

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
And I'm just happy to be here.

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,240
And I also said yes to coming just because of the way that in our limited interaction,

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,600
talking once, but also just the way I've seen you post online is clear that you are a very

40
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,000
caring, thoughtful, earnest person.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,760
And I, yeah, I like to support activities and people like that.

42
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,560
Yeah, I think Daniel, some of the people in our community have probably heard me say things

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,520
like humanity has reached a point where we've become too powerful to remain in rivalry with

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,240
ourselves.

45
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,240
And that, you know, the problem is that we have a profound gap between our capacities as a

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
species and the wisdom that guides them.

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,600
And I would say that of everyone I attribute that sort of framing to, it's you.

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,360
And I think that the beauty of the really extraordinary thing is that you bring out that

49
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,600
framing, not just as a way to understand our own times and what needs to be done in them, but

50
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,560
also as a way of understanding of how we got here.

51
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,600
How did a species that clearly does not want to destroy its own climate do that collectively,

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,680
nonetheless, right?

53
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,560
How is it that collective decisions that no one would want end up becoming, you know, almost

54
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,320
unavoidable, like the momentum is so extraordinary that nothing can seem to overcome it.

55
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,880
And so if we can kind of talk about that and talk about its relation, this is what Daniel calls

56
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,040
the metacrisis and talk about how that relates to our understanding of history.

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,040
I just want to open that, open that to you.

58
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,120
What is the metacrisis and where are we in that?

59
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah, I just share in starting that in general, I don't like talking about this publicly,

60
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,640
because it's mostly not empowering and just kind of despair causing uselessly.

61
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,800
I mostly talk about it to institutions and flancer pests and whatever where there is

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,000
something they can do and try to tailor it to what they they can do.

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
It's not that there isn't any way we can relate to it more effectively.

64
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,680
You come to understand the whole picture more.

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:12,800
We it's devastating before it's empowering, it can be motivating and ennobling, but it also the

66
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,440
analysis shows that most of the things that one could be hopeful about work.

67
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,000
And so there is like a there's a lot of faith actually required to want to engage with that in

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
a meaningful way because you have to go through a kind of crucible to come out on the other end

69
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
in some way empowered.

70
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,920
And I think if it I think it's because there's a spiritual practice and a community holding

71
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
each other here that I feel okay talking about it.

72
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,120
You're mentioning climate change and you know this kind of obligate nature.

73
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,720
The first paper on scientific paper on climate change was published in 1938.

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
The United Nations Environmental Programme recognizing the need for international coordination

75
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,320
on global commons issues was made in 1972 well over 50 years ago.

76
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,760
And climate change has become one of the biggest existential risk topics in the world.

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,160
It has over a trillion dollars a year in climate funding.

78
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,840
And every with the exception of global recessions every single year we use more fossil fuels

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,560
in the year before.

80
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:32,000
And during that whole time all of the solar wind renewable energy all the hydro and the damaging

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,200
effect of the dams and all of the nuclear and the entire risk of the nuclear energy hasn't even

82
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,480
slowed the increase in fossil fuels use one year.

83
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,360
And so when you look at and yet the most fascinating thing is there is literally no one

84
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,640
who wants climate change as like a strategic objective.

85
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,240
There I mean yes you can say that the Russians are capitalizing on the fact that they get a

86
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,600
new shipping route through the Arctic.

87
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,720
But no one has climate change as an objective and yet nobody can stop it.

88
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
Because everybody wants energy because energy is one for one course

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,960
related with GDP and this ability to actuate anything and money has to exponentially grow

90
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,960
every year to keep up with the interest which means that the energy demand has to exponentially

91
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,520
grow every year.

92
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,240
And the solar plant is going to take 10 years worth of the energy that it produces out of

93
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
fossil fuel energy to make up front.

94
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,440
And then we don't decide to make less fossil fuel energy it's we just make all of the stuff in

95
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
which there is energy return on energy investment.

96
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:54,000
While there are plenty of groups that don't care enough about species extinction nobody

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
really wants species extinction and nobody really wants

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,920
PFOS in literally every raindrop in the world which it is now.

99
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,920
As an ubiquitous carcinogen and stuff or

100
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
there's 230 million chemicals in the American Chemical Society database almost all of them

101
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,720
are toxic cancels, antigens, endocrine disruptors whatever.

102
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,640
The curve of the increasing autoimmune diseases, the increasing autism, the increasing

103
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,600
Alzheimer's, the increasing psychiatric diseases follows the curve of those chemicals

104
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
and nobody wants a toxic planet and also nobody can stop it.

105
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,280
And the total set of all activities that has been done since Silent Spring was written

106
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,160
since the environmental movement started we have put more toxic chemicals each year into

107
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
the environment than the year before and innovated more new ones.

108
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,640
And it's not just that the processes have been ineffective it's that many of them have made

109
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:10,480
things worse right that if we say okay because of climate change and fossil fuel use we really

110
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,080
need to push non-fossil fuel energy so we push more nuclear and so now we get increased risk of

111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,680
warfare associated with nuclear and toxic waste and etc and it doesn't slow fossil fuels and

112
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,000
then you do more dams and so you destroy more ecosystems and create more geopolitical tensions

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,720
between the countries that share the river it's typically the case that the way that we go about

114
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,120
solving the problems doesn't work and makes them worse and I didn't have that analysis when I was

115
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,440
young and started and was kind of like hopeful that we could just put more energy into the things.

116
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,400
So why? Like why is this? I would also say when you were talking you mentioned that

117
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,280
there are certain kind of like principles that come from conscience that were things people

118
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,160
could choose before but they're obligate now because self-termination on this path is the

119
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,680
otherwise impending possibility. I wouldn't even say that they were possible before they were impossible

120
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:28,240
because if you held a set of views that did not mount effective military forces and Genghis Khan

121
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
and his men or Alexander the Great or the Ottomans or whatever were coming you were slaughtered.

122
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
And there have been a lot of peaceful beautiful cultures throughout history that listened to their

123
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,160
conscience and got slaughtered. We just did an analysis of this on you know the history of

124
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:56,640
selection via warfare and you know Genghis Khan and his men alone in his life not the entire

125
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:04,080
Mongols killed 50 million people on horseback without nuclear weapons without industrial weapons

126
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,240
killed 50 million people. That was 11% of the entire global population

127
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,280
including lots of lovely cultures that because they were lovelier didn't mount huge militaries

128
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
and

129
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,760
fascinatingly it's actually a really just weird irony that the current estimate is that 11% of

130
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,760
all Asians today are Genghis Khan's descendants because the amount of rape that he and then the

131
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
genetics of that family did so kill the people do all the raving. So

132
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,680
and then when you look at that for

133
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:54,240
Dutch colonization in the Congo and Attila and blah blah blah you realize that we alive today

134
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,960
are the descendants memetically and genetically of the most successful conkers

135
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,400
and that the Tibetans could keep a relatively nice set of ideas as long as they were remote

136
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,960
enough that nobody cared about their land that much and as soon as it became clear that they

137
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,920
controlled the watershed between two billion person populations uh then a violent culture

138
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,400
slaughtered them and the same with the Native Americans and the colonizers here the the population

139
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,600
of North and South America before colonizers came was 140 million people and colonization

140
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,360
wiped out over 90% of them that's it that's a lot of people and that means those those ways of being

141
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,440
those those non-alphabetic languages those non-written languages those systems of medicine

142
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,160
those poetries those all of that you know wiped out of history so I don't think it was possible

143
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
like an individual could try to be lovely and the tribe could try to be lovely but you didn't

144
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,440
actually make it through history that way and you most certainly didn't shape the world very much that

145
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:08,800
way and so this topic of the you know kind of a multipolar trap somebody does something that provides

146
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,360
so much near-term competitive advantage that everyone else is obligated to do that or lose

147
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,840
and lose means your ideas don't make it through selection that has been an amazingly powerful

148
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:33,760
part of a very perverse selection process and this is still the case and this is why open AI that

149
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:42,000
was founded to because of the fear of market-driven AI and the need to make a very well-funded

150
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,360
research institute to focus on slowing down market AI risk became the company like switched

151
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,640
from a non-profit to a for-profit and accelerate AI risk more than any and it's why then

152
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,680
seeing that that was happening and saying it was bad a part of open AI broke off created

153
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,720
anthropic to really do AI risk work and then realized that in order to do that they needed

154
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,160
a lot of money to have big AI systems they took the money became a for-profit and now are also racing

155
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,680
and so again what that happened is pretty much everyone got into the multipolar trap of

156
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,800
the dude with more power wins there is no way out of this and unless you want to just die with

157
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,360
dignity you okay we have to win and we have to do whatever violent etc thing is going to let us

158
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,040
win but then we'll be the good guys and this is basically the state of geopolitics between

159
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:49,440
us and china right now and many many places so in that way ethics are constraints on strategic

160
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,520
possibilities and those who have less of them have less constraints and those win at strategy

161
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:05,840
and so one cannot afford to have them right which is why there are so many

162
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,400
real politic theorists to basically say if you have any ethics you're an asshole

163
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,080
because what you're actually saying is that you don't care about anything enough to be effective

164
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,320
yeah and if you really want to be effective you have to win and you got to do what it takes

165
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,480
so if you care you'll be you know you'll you'll do the Machiavellian thing which is such a weird

166
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,720
you know basically it's what happened to Soromon and Lord of the Rings right it's what happens

167
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:45,200
again and again power winning is inevitable and therefore embracing it is actually ethical

168
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,840
because it's your only way to influence it and so that's the co-opting of the ethics right

169
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,600
but what's the other choice so there's a way in which just choosing to die with dignity well

170
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,560
we'll be ethical our hands will be clean while the world burns yeah um and if you look at the history

171
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,480
the Jane Goodall's of the world have not had the level of influence on the world system the

172
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:21,120
Kissingers have had not by a billion to one and the minds and heart the the developmental process

173
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,120
that makes a Jane Goodall does not give you Kissinger skills the developmental process

174
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,200
that gives you Kissinger skills does not give you Jane Goodall values they are almost developmentally

175
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,200
mutually exclusive yeah and yet we don't make it if we don't actually get both of those in

176
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:45,680
the same beings now but where those skills are not in service to power and the perpetuation

177
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,600
of the system but are in service to all sentience now and into perpetuity but that's that hard in

178
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:04,480
that mind together right in the same beings and yeah so right now we obviously you know

179
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,240
you know the crossed six of the nine planetary boundaries radically rapidly crossing the other

180
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,240
ones all of the curves are accelerating if we tried to turn it around it's not even clear that we

181
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:29,920
could um nobody really understands and obviously the the post-war order that maintained relative

182
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,920
peace between superpowers meaning we only proxy ward through korean vietnam and whatever other

183
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,880
places and economic warfare and etc that has completely broken down that kind of post-war

184
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,120
order is not uh effective anymore at preventing major power conflict and so we can see that we

185
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,080
have multiple three world war three escalation pathways hot right now which is why the atomic

186
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,400
scientists moved the nuclear clock closer to midnight than it was during the cuba missile crisis

187
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,400
and we see actually an increase in hawkishness everywhere and

188
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
if you look at just even the rate of say ai and the reason that ai is so important more than

189
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,080
any other category of tech it's because i can i can't use a nuclear weapon to make a bio weapon

190
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,280
i can't use a nuclear weapons to make a financial system i can't use a bio weapon to make a financial

191
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,600
system i can use ai to make better nukes and better bio weapons and better financial systems and

192
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:45,040
better manufacturing and better propaganda so the race there the you know more's law was completely

193
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
unprecedented in history being doubling the computing power every two years

194
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,640
but every 18 months so you get an exponential curve currently just the hardware alone on gpu's

195
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,400
is 10 xing the compute efficiency every six months not to mention that you also have an

196
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,640
exponential curve on the software on the amount of data on the parameters and so every and this

197
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,000
is why there's you know been about 30 trillion just invested in the last couple years trillion

198
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:31,680
to win ai supremacy as the ring to rule them all and nobody who thinks they can win has any

199
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:42,800
interest in multilateral agreements to slow it down so you could say these are times that were

200
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:53,760
prophesied you could say that the end of kali yuga and the beginning of the possible beginning of

201
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,600
satyuga you could say the time of purgatory or the end of the mayan calendar or whatever we're all

202
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,640
roughly speaking to a similar thing and you could say that once you got the written word

203
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
so you got history you know like a more kind of formal version of history

204
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,600
it wasn't that hard for philosophers of the time to recognize that with populations increasing

205
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,440
the wars killed more people because the number of people that gang is conkilled was more than

206
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,160
the entire world population at the beginning of the agricultural revolution like just to have a

207
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,800
sense right so with the increasing population killed more people with the increasing technology

208
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,120
we killed more people from further distance right you get the crossbow you get the cannon you get

209
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,960
the fowlings you get the and it's pretty clear to see that humans were not very good stewards of

210
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,760
their power right every culture had class subjugation torture or whatever once we got into empire not

211
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,960
pre-empire um and so the idea that we have that kind of mixed bag of some really lovely stuff

212
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,040
but really wicked stuff but that the wicked stuff is getting larger populations with more tech

213
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,400
and the wars are killing more people and we're like early civilizations were destroyed because of

214
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,160
environmental overshoot right if you read tainter in the collapse of complex civilizations you can

215
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,240
see that cutting down all the trees eroding the topsoil and the civilization fails has been

216
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:31,200
happening for thousands of years so um but obviously with the capacity to destroy environments at

217
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,480
larger scale you know the beginning of big belly ships and greater fishing and blah blah blah uh

218
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,920
so you could prophesize hey this time is going to come to an end there's going to be a great

219
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,920
reckoning the wickedness of our ways is going to have to be reconciled there's going to be a hard

220
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,240
fork and either everybody decides we stop this kind of wickedness of our ways we become good

221
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,680
stewards of power and as such as good stewards of power we reinstate the garden or something

222
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,920
like that or we don't and it goes from purgatory to hell some to an end uh because this thing self

223
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:18,960
terminates i i think those prophecies were pretty straightforward actually like pretty

224
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:29,360
straightforwardly accurate and i do think we are at a time now where until nuclear weapons that

225
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,000
couldn't have been you couldn't destroy everything that quickly obviously until industrial scale

226
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,680
globalization you couldn't destroy the environment so uh we're really to the first time in the history

227
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,560
of the world at this place where the ongoing viability of the world is up to us we couldn't

228
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:53,680
have destroyed it before even when we tried and so it is it is true that it is obligate for us to

229
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,520
become good stewards of power because if we continue to steward it the way we have we'll destroy

230
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,920
ourselves it is also true that some people doing that not in the presence of other people doing

231
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,360
it lose the game of influence if not the game of survival in the very short term to be able to make

232
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:19,040
it through there's a book of romans the path to heaven is narrow and steep the path to hell is

233
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:25,040
wide and many there is something like that there there is basically a needle that has to be thread

234
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:34,080
and that is the uh hope for this time is the ability to properly thread the needle of

235
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,760
that which will make us good stewards of power that can also navigate the space of power currently

236
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,440
to influence it enough that it on its current trajectory doesn't mess everything up

237
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,520
well i think that you know i want to talk a bit more about threading that needle

238
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,720
and in particular it's become pretty clear to me in my study of you know when in academia we would

239
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,720
call collective action problems or social traps which is what daniel just called the multi-polar

240
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:14,160
trap that situation where you know vying geopolitical entities seek power and that the only way to get

241
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,120
around this like i actually came to that realization at some level when i took western political

242
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
philosophy too and i was reading thomas hobs and hobs you know has that war at all against all and

243
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,200
i think that there's a lot of people in this room probably thinking well aren't there cooperative

244
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,320
forces not just competitive forces and human history as well as an evolution i think that's a

245
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,240
really valid argument maybe we'll come back to that but i want to talk about you know there's two

246
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,600
kind of ways to get around a collective action problem and one of them is what hobs refer to

247
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,520
as the little viathon which is you get enough power and you impose power and you make it so

248
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,520
anyone who would do something that's not good you know that's competitive and trying to do the power

249
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:05,040
gain you shut them down that's way one and the other way is through cooperation and that one's

250
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,680
really hard i mean if anyone is you know folks who might have started the eco village or something

251
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,280
like that in this talk and even getting just a few people to get along is hard right so we might

252
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,400
come back to that but i think that what is really insightful here is that um we have to at some level

253
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,480
through conscience through without ever getting you know you know as soon as you start down that road

254
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,400
once you start down the dark path right through conscience we gain influence through conscience

255
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,200
we have to at some level push in the same way that donby or others would have done you had

256
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,720
extraordinary influence but you know he gained that influence not by being a really terrible

257
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,760
player on the world stage but by acting in a conscientious way because we're a social species

258
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:01,040
and we respond you know we we have a an immediate response to you know a mirror neuron type response

259
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:09,200
if you're if you are acting a certain way i i feel that in my own self and and so there's a way in

260
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:17,040
which um i just i guess i guess i wanted to talk to that a bit daniel do you see um that sort of

261
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:26,320
path of like uniting conscience with um with uh i hate to call it spirit with strategy but i really

262
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,000
you know maybe emphasis on the conscience part and then the strategy part has to be born of that

263
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,880
right has to be born from the conscience piece um and then moving from there do you think that

264
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,080
there's a pathway to thread that needle through the force of conscience through um prophetic voice

265
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,440
now as a kid i was my mom was taking me to a bunch of protests and

266
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,480
um you know various nonprofits pita and greenpeace and like that engage in an activism work

267
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:15,360
i remember there was a few NGOs that came together to protest a nuclear waste dump being created

268
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:24,000
and i got to see how the activists were organizing and i got to see how the

269
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,160
nuclear and financial and legal entities on the other side were organizing a little bit just

270
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,240
watching as a kid and there was this insight that came the the first level of the insight was the

271
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:48,320
the activists are obviously motivated by something that is much less self-interest

272
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,640
they're chaining themselves to things where they get hurt um they're willing to go to jail they're

273
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,240
but their tools of strategy are chaining themselves to things and picket signs and like that

274
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:06,000
and the tools of strategy on the other side are employing heaps of mathematicians and physicists

275
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,920
and chemists and lobbyists and financiers and etc and it's just it's so obvious who's winning

276
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,000
and you know like who's going to win and why but also who should right that distinction and i saw it as

277
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,440
like a head heart divide at the level of humanity that had to be unified and then i looked a little

278
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,840
bit later and thought of it as like a a head heart will um because i could see people where

279
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,640
there if any two of the three didn't work right if someone had a lot of will and a lot of

280
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,920
heart meaning like there was a lot of care about other beings and the willingness to take a lot of

281
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,640
action but they didn't understand strategy well they were most activists if they could think about

282
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,960
the complexity of the world well and the perverse incentives of financial motivations the lobbying

283
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,200
on the other side etc and they cared a lot but they didn't have a lot of empowerment they were like

284
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,440
kind of broken devastated liberal academics um if the heart was kind of shut down and they were

285
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,480
mostly pursuing self-interest but they understood strategy and they were pretty empowered with

286
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,360
will they were the people who ran the world and ran big oil companies and finance companies and

287
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,960
military industrial companies and things like that and um so it was very clear that those coming

288
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:32,160
together was necessary kind of requisite right and it is obvious that the strategy does not actually

289
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:40,960
pick what is valuable it figures out how to do effective work towards what is valuable that

290
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:50,720
comes from deeper places and so uh intellect and strategy in service of conscience is necessary

291
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,920
right like there's no uh conscience that doesn't know how to be very effective

292
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:07,360
is kind of a death with dignity strategy um and you know for me seeing that and being like

293
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:15,680
if I work my ass off and all the animals are still in the factory farm I don't feel okay about that

294
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:23,840
I don't feel some self-relief I don't feel proud like I I want to be effective at it and so

295
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,600
a lot of people talk about not caring about the result as much but the process because in the

296
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,320
when one over focuses on results they can go out of integrity I care about the relationship between

297
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:44,800
the results and the process both right um now if you one other thing though is like let's say you

298
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,640
take a look at Gandhi which is you know as good an exemplars you could get of this

299
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,520
if you do a realism analysis right the kind of political school of realism coming out of

300
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,840
real politic analysis of non-violence movements you get a very different perspective than the

301
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,320
story the non-violence movements tell and I think it is a more historically and politically accurate

302
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,360
one and it's important to understand if you want to be effective the realist analysis is

303
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,240
Gandhi said that what happened with the British and India could have worked against Hitler

304
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,720
total gibberish like complete obvious total gibberish um and

305
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:40,320
in the only reason there were a few but the reason why at that particular time in India

306
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:48,720
that was able to work is because as he said early in the career in his career there 20,000 British

307
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,800
soldiers cannot rule 400 million Indians if the 400 million Indians don't consent they were already

308
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,560
getting to the place of the willingness to have enough of their people die to violently kill all

309
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,520
of the 20,000 soldiers there was a violence movement that he was holding at bay with the

310
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,040
non-violence which is why they didn't kill him and every non-violence movement that has been

311
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,720
effective against very against powers that are willing to enact violence has only been effective

312
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,680
when it was the better alternative against violence as the alternative and a very similar

313
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:28,160
thing was that in the assessment that so like if they'd killed Gandhi then the Indians would

314
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,920
have started killing British soldiers at scale right the only reason he didn't get killed and

315
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,640
so it's just important to understand that the reason that the US went ahead and made some

316
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,560
provisions with Martin Luther King was because the power Malcolm X and the Black Panthers were

317
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,280
getting a scaring the shit out of them and the idea of move the attention over here to the

318
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:58,640
non-violence thing was like positive so the reason I bring this up is because if you want to look at

319
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,920
previous precedents of things that were successful to be able to try to do successful work do your

320
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:14,080
research well enough to say was it actually successful and how did it work so that's really

321
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:20,560
powerful Daniel and I still you know sitting here I have a pretty deep conviction about

322
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:30,480
using moving from a place of conscience to to shift the world in a better way and I think

323
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,480
that conscience calls us to strategy I think that if we're really deeply in touch with conscience

324
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,120
we do the strategy because we actually don't want to live in a world where what's happening in

325
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,160
factory farms is happening in factory farms and we want to live in a world which is beautiful and

326
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:54,080
hopeful I think a one step beyond the three part will art mine the chakras are a lovely system

327
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,480
right if you I don't know if people here are familiar with it but the you know the yogic

328
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,560
system and the egyptian system the chinese system are pretty similar so whenever there's a bunch of

329
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,520
independent origination it's kind of interesting but each of them are different are thought of as

330
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:19,280
different types of intelligence and that a full human approach is all of them and so if you

331
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,960
I don't need to go through them here and take the time for it but if you are to think about

332
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,520
to it we want to engage not with a part of the world but all of the world but we want to engage

333
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,640
with all of the world with all of our self right and all of our self means all of our agency and

334
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,800
all of our intellect all of our intuition all of our instinct all of those things in service of

335
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:51,280
all the world so I think there was a talk that I really liked that Eckhart and the Dalai Lama

336
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,440
did together one time where Eckhart was saying something about like in his language when you

337
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,240
access the power of now you have increased coherence for capabilities at whatever it is that you're

338
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,120
going to do and then somebody in the audience asked something about when you access that is

339
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,480
it like accessing the Akashic records where you can just get anything and do anything

340
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,720
and Eckhart was like I don't have that experience because like a great soccer player

341
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,680
who gets quiet and goes into a place of stillness comes out and does the

342
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,480
the free kick better than he would have otherwise but he's like if I went to do that I still wouldn't

343
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,120
make the goal as Eckhart right he's like I don't I don't do that thing well when Einstein would go

344
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,000
into silence he'd come out with math but Eckhart was like I never get math like I never get

345
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,600
general relativity coming out of there and he asked the Dalai Lama he's like no I don't ever

346
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,960
get general relativity because I didn't take that in and the same reason that when someone goes

347
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,760
deeply into prayer they usually get answers in languages they speak they usually don't get them

348
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,240
in Sanskrit or Mandarin or some language they don't speak so there's a place where listening

349
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,720
to conscience it can only tell you things that you have also cultivated your being to understand

350
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,800
so this is where the the models of what does it take to be effective such that you develop those

351
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,200
in yourself such that as you're going into prayer and going into listening those languages exist

352
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:23,760
within you to be spoken to is also important yeah well I feel like we've gone really deep

353
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,760
and I think that I can imagine folks in the audience right now being like that is a harsh

354
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:38,720
view of human history or of what we're what we're up against I suppose and the strategies that might

355
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:49,280
work or approaches that might work and I mean I feel like I want to sort of finish out by

356
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,720
sort of entering some of that stillness together and wondering if there's in particular a message to

357
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,480
the QEW community to Quakers that you feel you know you were just mentioning you know like

358
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,880
Einstein comes out with this what is the unique role of faith communities in this time

359
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:17,280
and and what would what is the earnestness I don't know how many people here saw

360
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,400
when this pope got put in place and he wrote the Lodato si encyclical

361
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,800
if you saw it awesome if not it's really worth reading it's actually very beautiful and

362
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,120
basically what he said was and I'm grossly paraphrasing there's been this kind of

363
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,560
forever conversation or debate about is God transcendent beyond the creation or eminent

364
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:53,360
indwelling within the creation I would say that the error in the direction of an overemphasis on

365
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,840
transcendent over eminent has caused a lot of problems because we can destroy things here in a

366
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,920
holy war for going to heaven or for good reincarnation or for getting off the wheel or whatever it is

367
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:14,240
that makes that denies some of the sacredness of here and if you hold the creator indwells

368
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:25,840
within its creation and any harm against creation is sin against the creator uh there's a much safer

369
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:31,600
ethics that emerges so if you take the direction of eminence and basically what he said in the

370
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,160
Lodato si is the eminence matters and that if you aren't an environmentalist protecting God's creation

371
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,320
you aren't a Catholic now of course that was a fucking big deal to say like a God created all

372
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,280
of this thing this is all sacred if you are harming God's creation you're in sin that doesn't mean

373
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,400
that really changed anything because like so often would happen in something like Catholicism it's

374
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,800
kind of like easy to moralize people while not actually changing the things that dispose their

375
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:09,600
beliefs and behaviors and so what I would love to see follow is a okay what would it take then

376
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:18,000
the Vatican to leverage its resources to say how do we help people deepen their understanding

377
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,800
of nature their connection to it and change the perverse incentives that force you know

378
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,320
environmental harm and things like that that'd be amazing I think all the faith communities have

379
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:35,680
beliefs that could be emphasized you know like there are some Christians who focus on the wrath

380
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,240
of the Leviticus God and the reasons to kill someone for violating the Sabbath or who focus

381
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,760
on the forgiveness of Jesus and let he who has no sins cast the first stone you can kind of

382
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:51,440
emphasize different aspects of it I think most of the faiths have things that if they were emphasized

383
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:00,880
would be profoundly relevant to the situation today and when it comes to Quakers

384
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,320
I don't I don't know I would need to ask a lot of questions and spend some time

385
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,720
and to be very interested in but the you know there's like the starting place is

386
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,640
if

387
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,280
total global Quakers is a few hundred thousand right yeah probably yeah and

388
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:38,400
so if we were to say that well that's a small population in one way it's a lot of people

389
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:45,200
like a lot of people that have a some shared sense of what is meaningful sacred etc that

390
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,840
they're willing to obviously live their lives differently based on make some sacrifices based on

391
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,240
if they could come to understand the state of the world more rather than just kind of local issues

392
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,960
understand you know the metacrisis the drivers and what addressing that would take and have

393
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:14,160
their life as a group not just individually be coordinated in service of helping the world move

394
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,040
through this point in history

395
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,560
not to the direction of self-destruction or totalizing dystopias but in the direction of

396
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,960
you know something like reinstatement of a garden what would it mean for that to actually become

397
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,480
the timely imperative of Quakers as a whole that they could coordinate towards that'd be very interesting

398
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:47,120
yeah well I think it's actually we're almost perfectly on track I want to kind of transition at the 45-minute mark

399
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,000
since our opening worship to bring in some questions from the audience and do you want to ask your question

400
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:06,080
yeah um yeah so in humanity's phase shift which is what Keith the video that a lot of us watched before

401
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,960
coming to hear you today Daniel um you said that reconditioning our felt sense of

402
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,960
interconnectedness with everything um won't won't be easy and will require a fundamental shift of our consciousness

403
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,800
um and I thought that the ways you the three things that you offered as ways to reconnect were

404
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,720
we're humorous and I wanted to ask how that has changed but the three things you offered were

405
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,960
to be in nature, do psychedelics and have more intimate relationships with more people

406
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,800
and so how have your modes of reconnection changed in the last five years since that conversation in that video?

407
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:05,760
first I'll say um there's a woman named Vanessa Andreade she wrote a beautiful book called

408
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,880
Hospicing Modernity and I got to speak with recently um indigenous woman who's actually a

409
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,800
leading some amazing educational projects in Canada and we just talked and she told me that the way that her

410
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:26,720
chief defines colonialism and I thought this was very beautiful uh had nothing to do with taking other people's land or

411
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,760
violence or property ownership or whatever that those were all epiphenomenon that the heart of colonialism

412
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
is believing there are separable things

413
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,960
and deeper than believing that is perceiving the world as separable things the pattern of perception cultivated

414
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
and

415
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
that

416
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
that conditioning of mind

417
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,560
I don't think can avoid

418
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,400
creating more separation more externalities more rivalry in the process of everything it does

419
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,400
intrinsic to the nature of how it perceives and as a result in how it sense makes and what it does

420
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
so

421
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,760
and that's not intrinsic to the nature of mind it's intrinsic to the way that

422
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,280
most modern civilizations have cultivated mind

423
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,360
and so uh cultivating and

424
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,680
you know

425
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,360
David Bohm and Krishna Murthy and so many said something almost identical about what the root of all the problems is

426
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,480
so

427
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
at the basis having a

428
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
perception

429
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,720
where you don't see things as separate things that you label in words with a

430
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
packet of information

431
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
that is fairly static about what that thing is

432
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
you um

433
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,160
you have unmediated contact with reality not mediated through words and concepts

434
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,400
that increases the depth of your sensing because your sense making can't be better than your sensing is and most of the time

435
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:15,200
we were perceiving so shallowly so little of the total bandwidth of the thing and then our sense making is almost all based on abstractions

436
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,960
and the abstraction that the the world of our ideas of what a tree is and what everything is is not the world it's a simulation

437
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,920
and so we live in that simulation on the world so the ability to have much

438
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,160
deeper sensing that is not mediated through word and concept

439
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,080
where the interconnectedness of everything is intrinsic and the uniqueness of everything is intrinsic both

440
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,360
uh

441
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,640
I would say it's only from there all you know what you're calling conscience internally

442
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,200
in a

443
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,960
reality

444
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
that is

445
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
where there's no separation

446
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,360
there's no separability I can say i'm a separate thing but take plants away and I don't exist take the gravitational field away

447
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:09,040
I don't exist take the sun away I don't exist so the concept of me as a separable thing is nonsense because it depends

448
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,000
I depend on a lot of things that are outside of the definition of me

449
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,360
in that inseparable nature of reality

450
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,280
listening within and listening without are both kind of the same

451
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,920
I mean they're both valuable they're they have different qualities so

452
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
meditating and listen and

453
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
being still and listening internally

454
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,640
in different ways to the sensations in my body to the emotions

455
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,400
to

456
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
subtle intuition

457
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
is all very important

458
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,480
really deeply witnessing

459
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,920
nature and really deeply witnessing people and listening is just as important as another kind of prayer

460
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:02,880
So I I find conscience and spirit distributed everywhere right because there's nothing in which spirit is not indwelling

461
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,080
so

462
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
that mode of perception

463
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,640
the interconnectedness the uniqueness of everything and really being with the

464
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
instantiated details fully

465
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,040
is the only mode of mind from which strategies about how to make things better are rightly grounded I feel

466
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,840
How do you cultivate that I mean I think we could raise children in a way where that was the default state

467
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,720
We don't but I think that's a possible thing

468
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
for

469
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
people who

470
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,480
Have already been conditioned to see everything as separate things and are having to recondition that

471
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Yeah, I think

472
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,960
time not just in nature but in wilderness particularly if you can get an old growth

473
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,520
Right where you can because a young forest does not have the complexity that's been clear cut and regrown with a few species of tree

474
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,600
Does not have the complexity of an old growth forest doesn't do the same thing if you can get

475
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,120
deep into wilderness and spend enough time there and enough silence

476
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,440
um

477
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,000
A tremendous amount of transformation in your mind and being starts to happen

478
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,920
And a tremendous amount of understanding about things so I think

479
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
That's about as good as anything

480
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
um

481
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think you know when I said psychedelics

482
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,560
There are lots of experiences that can induce states that change the nature of perception through

483
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,520
fasting through vision quests through sweat lodges through, you know

484
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,360
Medicines are one of them, but uh

485
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:55,120
Inducing states in which your perception of reality is experientially very different can help people realize more in a more embodied way

486
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,960
How limited their

487
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
perceptional space usually it's

488
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,640
And the thing that I had said then about relationships

489
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
Yeah, I think really

490
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
uh

491
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
deeply loving more

492
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
beings really helps

493
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,480
And in really deeply loving them seeking to understand them and imagine what it's like to be them and realize that you don't know

494
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,520
But really try to try to feel what it's like to be other beings

495
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,920
um

496
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,760
Your own ego can't actually imagine what it's like to be other beings

497
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,920
Because it's its own set of things like to really take on what it's like to be them

498
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,840
The part of me that the the aspect of me that can do that is not my identity. It's something deeper than identity

499
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
and um

500
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,360
And the pattern of putting myself at the center all the time

501
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,720
Is very transcended in that process

502
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,360
There's a bunch of other things for this a few

503
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,880
Um, so the next question we have is from hogan williams

504
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,000
So i'm someone who's deeply concerned about the sense-making crisis aspect of all of this

505
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:26,640
Addressing sense-making seems to call for humility listening and slow process

506
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,560
Yet addressing existential risk

507
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,280
seems to call for boldness

508
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,680
prophetic speech

509
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,040
and action

510
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
over contemplation

511
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,120
At least that would be one way to slice it. You may deconstruct that

512
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,040
It seems that if we have one without the other we are likely lost

513
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,120
Yet they seem so different as to be working at cross purposes

514
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,000
Can you speak to this tension between contemplation and boldness?

515
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,120
These divergent approaches and how might wisely weave them?

516
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Yeah, totally. Um

517
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
Everybody's familiar with the dunning kruger curve

518
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,880
Uh this idea and sociology i'll explain it that

519
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,160
When someone doesn't know anything about a field

520
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,560
They can actually have a lot of unearned confidence in their ideas about the space because they're not aware of how much stuff

521
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,000
they don't know

522
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,040
and

523
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,040
Then as they start to study the field they their confidence drops radically because

524
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,320
All the things that were in the unknown unknown for them move into the known unknown. They're like shit. There's so much stuff

525
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
I don't know and so

526
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,240
It is common that people who have

527
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Much less depth of thought have more confidence on a topic and people have more confidence

528
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,800
Understand how complex the thing is the idea of the dunning kruger curve as you start here

529
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,840
And then as you gain more knowledge you drop and then you slowly kind of come back up as you gain expertise

530
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
what I find

531
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,760
is

532
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,720
in

533
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,120
Trying to not study a specialty where I can eventually know most of the field I got my phd and it whatever but

534
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,720
In trying to study the nature of reality and trying to study how to make a big difference in the world

535
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
My uh

536
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,600
Sense of how much I know just keeps dropping forever the more I

537
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:28,720
The more I learn the more things i'm aware really matter that I don't know continuously so um

538
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,480
Uh, I don't I don't think you ever end up getting something like a similar type of confidence

539
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,080
I think what you get is a place where

540
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,360
You understand a topic well enough to know that your best ideas might not only be wrong but even harmful

541
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:55,040
And yet you're pretty clear that your assessment is factoring more things than the other assessments that are currently running the world

542
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:02,240
And so there's an obligation to start to act but not with confidence more with like

543
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,120
a

544
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Sacred obligation that

545
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
Feels

546
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,560
It doesn't feel like egoic a empowered agency. Fuck I got this. I know what to do. I'm gonna go solve this thing

547
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,800
I'm gonna crusade doesn't feel like that. It feels like really fucking scared to fuck stuff up

548
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,280
And really continuously listening

549
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,720
um and

550
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,720
So

551
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,800
That's my sense is that if you are trying to address nuclear risk

552
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,840
Or ai risk or whatever and you proceed confidently you'll almost certainly make it worse

553
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Which is almost always the case

554
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,280
So you want if you don't have good sense making about the cause of the issues and how

555
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
The nature of what you I mean

556
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,160
Classically

557
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,040
It's not just you can optimize for a project and end up externalizing harmels or what happens all the time

558
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,240
It's things like you create a movement the movement becomes very effective

559
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,200
But it appeals to some people and actually anti appeals to other people

560
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,660
So you drive the counter movement. It's called schismogenesis

561
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and so

562
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,760
Uh

563
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,760
Has the like racial justice movement enlightened everybody

564
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
No, the anti woke

565
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,200
culture actually emerged as a counter response to the nature of how kind of

566
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
woke social justice moved forward

567
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,360
and

568
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,400
Every time the way that reparations were talked about

569
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:49,520
Uh was expressed that did not do good sense making about how that would appeal to everybody a lot more people joined the far

570
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
Are alt right and things like that so

571
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,360
um

572
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,360
if you

573
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,520
Want to actually make things better in the death hing it says uh

574
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,920
The master navigates the world as careful as one walking on black ice

575
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,240
And what I like about that so much is if you're walking on black ice

576
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:19,520
You don't have to want to split your head open just the the tiniest lapse of awareness and you can split your head open

577
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,920
And so recognizing that navigating the world is like walking on black ice, especially if you try to do things at scale

578
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,280
But it also doesn't say the master stays at home because there's black ice. He's navigating the world

579
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,120
But it is full and it's not full of fearfulness. It's full of carefulness the depth of care

580
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Yes

581
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:54,160
Yeah, so I think we've got one last one from the folks who wrote any questions and then we've got um

582
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,240
Uh all I think seven six hands raised hands raised so hopefully we can get to everybody. Um

583
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:06,800
I want to turn finally to Pamela Haynes Pamela. Do you want to unmute and ask your question?

584
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,920
Sure. Yeah, thank you. I think that some of my question got answered by your response to mich and

585
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,160
um

586
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,840
Keith's suggestion that people speak that you speak to hope in response to everything. I'll just leave that part of it out

587
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,520
So my question is really simple and it's what do you love?

588
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,880
And I can't answer that very well

589
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,080
um

590
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,400
Because it because it is definitely beyond words

591
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,480
I I love reality

592
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,880
And all of the unique expressions

593
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
Um

594
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,000
If you like if you were to ask what motivates

595
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,920
My work like what I'm working for I'm not working for the end of

596
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,560
AI arms races or nuclear races or to get the chemicals out of the ocean or like

597
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,160
I mean, yes, those are specific things, but um

598
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,120
I

599
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,720
I close my eyes I meditate and I

600
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,440
see

601
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,560
kids

602
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,560
playing in the future

603
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,600
I see them and I see through their eyes and I see them learning to climb a tree for the first time and loving trees

604
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,360
I see them falling in love for the first time. I see them doing aw at sunsets

605
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,160
I see the mom falling in love with them. I see them learning to communicate with animals

606
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,000
And just that that gets to continue is what I love and I'm in service to

607
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,160
All the rest is complicated strategy in service to that

608
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,880
And for the non-human world as much as the human world

609
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Daniel film

610
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Daniel brilliant presentation

611
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,200
I'm a scholar of the relationship between the sciences and the world's religious and spiritual traditions

612
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,280
From that perspective, it struck me. It's really interesting the the pattern or the formal analysis of your presentation

613
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,720
Which is you gave us the facts the situations the background

614
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,320
You gave us the the practices that people engage in psychedelics meditation and so forth

615
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,360
You brought those two right next to each other

616
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:57,040
Keith and I and many people on this call engage in a kind of reflection right there at that meeting point of the two

617
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,280
You engage in almost no reflection at that particular point. You spoke of actions

618
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,600
and facts

619
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
wishes visions

620
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,080
But surely there's a kind of reflection

621
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,720
That is right at that intersection

622
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,680
I have the intuition that you'd be able to help us

623
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:22,320
If you sort of open up the doors to that particular room, I'm interested to see how you respond to that invitation

624
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,800
Yeah, you mean specifically at the intersection of something like

625
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,920
the sciences and spirituality

626
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,080
Right, which is a kind of self-involving intersection

627
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,760
You often answer like a religious studies scholar, which is what my tribe does and describes externally

628
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,160
powerful internal experiences

629
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:48,320
But there's a kind of internally driven reflection that stems from the motivation or the psychedelic experiences

630
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,320
And you're surprisingly silent at that that intersection point

631
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,760
The um when I when I was growing up I was um homeschooled and I

632
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,880
studied

633
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
I had a

634
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,080
Got to make my own curriculum didn't have a fixed curriculum and

635
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:20,160
The kind of braid of topics of interest was all the sciences all of the kind of spiritual mystical traditions

636
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
and philosophic traditions

637
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,800
and um

638
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,240
And then also the kind of all the domains of uh activism

639
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,240
And they all felt like the exact same thing to me. I had the same

640
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,800
And

641
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,000
And particularly because at that time growing up in the 80s

642
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:46,080
And what just a fortune of getting exposed to like my exposure to science was first fritchoff capra and david boom and

643
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,160
Like the whole idea that something at the nature of ecology and complexity science and quantum mechanics would reveal the perennial

644
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,240
truths of the spiritual traditions and things like that

645
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:00,160
So I didn't get science as kind of reductionist atheism first. I got the critique of that first

646
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,960
and um

647
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,320
There's a

648
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,960
Paper I wrote maybe Keith will share it with people called

649
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,560
The dance of the dow and the 10,000 things

650
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,600
and because you know

651
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,960
The dow that is nameable is not the eternal dow

652
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,760
Naming is the beginning of the 10,000 things typically we take it that then

653
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,520
Engagement with the 10,000 things deadens us to the dow

654
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,720
But it doesn't have to it can do the exact opposite right it can actually

655
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:44,160
Deep in the nature of the appreciation of the dow that's what I meant by the dance between them and uh

656
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,320
so

657
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,320
one of the areas that I really got into was uh limits of no ability

658
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,600
and whether it was kind of girdle and mathematics or the incompleteness theorem or

659
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,040
uh tarski with the limits of formal logic or

660
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,560
um

661
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,040
Heisenberg bell, you know on and on there's these kind of

662
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:10,000
Pearson semiotics the upper bounds of no ability are ways that logic can transcend itself because it can identify

663
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,640
its formal upper boundaries and then identify how much of reality is outside of it

664
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,720
And then there's the question. Well, what is the right epistemology for that then? What is the right way to relate to it?

665
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,160
Um, so there's like these are some of my favorite topics. There's a lot I could say there

666
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,160
I'm not sure exactly which part of the inquiry is um,

667
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,440
Most interesting and live for you, but it would be a fun conversation

668
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,440
At some point I look forward to that there is a way to speak at precisely that intersection point

669
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,400
Which is not just silence and many of the hundred people on this call are practiced in that

670
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,840
I would love to in in explore that openness

671
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,600
To a form of discourse that was surprisingly silent

672
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,880
Over the last hour. Thanks again for your talk

673
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:08,800
Yeah, well, that's really lovely film. I really love that invitation. Um, and I hope that connection happens

674
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,720
um

675
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,560
Stan I got Stan's message and I don't know if Stan's here, but he wrote it to me in the chat

676
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,520
So I'm going to go ahead and just read it out. Um, we have you mentioned population collapse and tainter's analysis

677
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,320
Four or five groups of ecologists have estimated that the world can only sustain

678
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,800
Sustainably support three or four billion people at a reasonable standard living i.e. the european standard

679
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,880
Given we are at eight billion now. This is not a small problem

680
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:44,880
Given this what is your prognosis on collapse or not in the years and decades ahead?

681
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,080
Um prognosis on collapse includes population as one factor but lots of other factors

682
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
um

683
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,560
The topic of caring capacity is a very tricky topic

684
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,840
It's very tricky for like so many reasons

685
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,080
Caring capacity meaning how many people can the earth sustainably?

686
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,720
uh support

687
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,080
um

688
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,520
The answer that comes up most commonly is like two three billion

689
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,560
but uh the numbers vary from

690
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,440
500 000 to tens of billions depending upon how people do the analysis

691
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,520
um

692
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,480
Obviously before the industrial revolution

693
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:44,480
I mean 500 million excuse me before the industrial revolution the population of the planet was 500 million and then

694
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,960
It went from 500 million to

695
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,080
8 billion almost overnight right to 200 years with the haverbosch and such

696
01:05:52,880 --> 01:06:00,000
But as it did that as it's 16 that 16 x would have taken over 200 000 years to get in 200 years

697
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:06,800
It also increased the resource consumption per capita by about 100 x in the developed world

698
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,840
So that's obviously a 1600 x increase in um resource consumption

699
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,400
How you define it though is

700
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,000
What is the most number of people you can possibly fit on the planet without collapsing the biosphere versus what provides

701
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,400
the highest quality of life for all life including non-humans

702
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,680
um

703
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:34,560
Mediated through what kind of technologies gets into deep cultural questions of what a desirable good life looks like

704
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,840
um

705
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,280
And the enactment pathway of getting there

706
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:47,920
Is super tricky because the conversations almost always turn into eugenics and war and like pretty pretty difficult stuff

707
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,640
um and

708
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
If you look at the work of like

709
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
Um

710
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
I'm forgetting his name right now. It'll come to me in a minute

711
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,520
But you know elan has talked about this

712
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:14,000
Uh popularly a lot recently which is that um the topic of demographic collapse that the decreasing birth rates in china in particular

713
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
but all around the world

714
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,800
are

715
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:24,960
Going to destroy civilization as we know it not the biosphere because a smaller percentage of young people entering the workforce military force, etc

716
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,800
and a lot of old

717
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,160
people

718
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,320
Is not how civilization is designed to function

719
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,200
um and so

720
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,000
And that's obviously because we built a civilizational system that is incommensurable the biosphere

721
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,880
So the ongoing needs that it has for maintenance like growing gdp and growing population upon which it was predicated don't work with the biosphere so

722
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,720
um

723
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,960
Is population a topic that we have to figure out? Yes, it's a it's a it's a very tricky one

724
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,160
So I don't like to try to say much definitive about it quickly

725
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,200
When china tried to control its population growth

726
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,360
To the one child policy or when india tried to control it

727
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,560
Some of the unintended side effects were things like

728
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
over a hundred million too many men

729
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,640
Because they emphasize male children and now you have literally over a hundred million

730
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:22,160
more men than women that can't mate that are destabilizing civilization and so like

731
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,480
the

732
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:30,000
You always have the what is the ideal in state you have whose ideal which cultural

733
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,240
ethical

734
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,800
models and then you have the enactment to get there

735
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,080
And well, you know, there's a bunch of libertarian thought that is gibberish one of the libertarian

736
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,480
Questions that is often useful is, you know, think about your utopia

737
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,560
In the future

738
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,880
Think about all the people that don't want it right now that would violently resist it because of their different religious ideas or economic interests or whatever

739
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,760
And think about how much violence you would have to enact to force your utopia on them and ask if it's still utopia

740
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,640
And so the considerations about enactment are very real

741
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,120
I

742
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Know, um, Stan pretty well. I'm sure Stan's got a lot to say particularly

743
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
on that topic of

744
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,200
There's a there's a qe w pamphlet critiquing. He's a you know, a demographer

745
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,160
beginning the which college but

746
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:29,520
Uh, critiquing the the elan analysis. So I'm sure he might want to share at with you afterwards, but I would love I would love to see that analysis

747
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,760
I think it desperately needs critiqued

748
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,600
Yeah

749
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,600
Oh, yeah

750
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:49,360
Great great job on the geopolitical understanding. Um, I'm really impressed with the depth of your knowledge and the realism of your perspective

751
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,440
I've been following Peter Zion and many other geopolitical thinkers sure many was the one I was about to mention who has been popularizing the demographic collapse

752
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,560
So thanks for mentioning it. That was the name I was forgetting. Yep, and I'm well aware of the mit study of

753
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,400
You know, very they tracked I forgot like six major

754
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,000
Measures and how they would change over the next century

755
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,720
Um, I I was exposed to this at university of colorado boulder while studying geology and economics

756
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,480
in geology is kind of a hotbed of

757
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:26,800
The counter perspective on a lot of these things because uh, we know the paleo climate very well. We know

758
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,840
My professors have been unerringly accurate about predicting how the climate is going to change

759
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,680
Which goes to say, um, the climate is a lot bigger problem. It's going to cause big migrations all over the place

760
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,760
It's going to change the rules all over the place

761
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:48,720
Um, the scientific humidity is just not up to the task of conveying news of that magnitude

762
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,440
Especially when the rate of change is faster than a peer review process will allow

763
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,240
So if you passed over the peer review process about five years ago

764
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:05,120
My question though has to do with the longevity and retirement aspects

765
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,680
because

766
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,680
We live a lot longer

767
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:18,560
And I remember a discussion at the university of colorado 42 years ago where they talk about how that would fragment our society

768
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,960
um

769
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,240
and

770
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,640
It kind of creates this dynamic to say the emphasis is really going to be on

771
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,280
the government to take charge and

772
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
Clear a path for the future

773
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,800
There's kind of limits to what you can do as far as social involvement. Could you speak to that?

774
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:47,600
How we economically support an increasing growth, uh, elderly population. Is that the main question?

775
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
Well, it's that

776
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:58,080
That there's genetically engineered, uh, pig organs that stands to increase life expectancy another decade or two

777
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,520
Um, you know stem cell inserts is all this technology to say we're going to live increasingly into our hundreds

778
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:12,880
Roughly some 80 percent of the federal budget is now devoted to retirement in some way or another saving for retirement or retirement itself

779
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:20,720
And so you're you're you're kind of say if we're going to have a massive social limit to change society

780
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:28,560
You're at some point going to run head-on into the cost of return the fact that we live longer. Yeah

781
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,440
um

782
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,840
Just having a conversation right before this, um the colleague about the

783
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,160
uh collapsing pensions and

784
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,200
Again realist analysis

785
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,080
everybody

786
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,080
who studies this knows that the

787
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,120
growing debt to gdp ratio is not there's no path to fix it

788
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,920
and the

789
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,400
growing not just debt but deficit spending

790
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,480
um

791
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:08,480
Also hitting diminishing returns on so many areas of industry because of planetary boundaries coming up climate change and others

792
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,400
means, uh, the imminent break of the economic system as we know it

793
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,320
um

794
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:22,800
When you mentioned climate and the climate predictions, obviously you look at like the jim Hansen recently said tin celsius is now the most likely scenario

795
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,960
um

796
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
and you look at the

797
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,800
uh

798
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,760
You know fact that the climate sensitivity numbers and some of the best models have went way up and are

799
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,480
like actually being

800
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,600
underreported because not wanting to sound alarmist

801
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,720
but even the un predictions are

802
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,760
billion climate refugees in the next 10 years

803
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,720
and when you look at where they come from

804
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,480
if you look at the Himalayan watershed and

805
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,720
You know India with over a billion people china with over a billion people in pakistan

806
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,600
and then the islamic world backing it with over a billion people on a dwindling water supply where a lot of those

807
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:09,120
100 million person plus climate migrations will occur all of which are nuclear equipped with massive geopolitical tensions. It's not just like

808
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,000
Some people die from that. It's like disruption of the entire world system. Um

809
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,040
so I think

810
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,880
I think that we don't continue to see business as usual, uh into the

811
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,440
uh

812
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,440
decade ahead

813
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,680
in retirement as a part of that

814
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:40,800
Yeah, I would just add um north america has a radically different fate than asia

815
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,400
and um north america we don't have these existential problems and we've got oceans to protect us

816
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,880
I mean there's a limited amount of threat you can convey over an ocean

817
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,480
So I want to jump in I just want to make sure that we have um some time

818
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,040
for uh, in particular, I noticed we've had an all men audience uh or question

819
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,000
Asking for so far. So I know we have uh two men and two women left and I want to give precedence to the

820
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
To jenny and shelly

821
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,400
So jenny if you would like to ask your question now and then um, we can spin back around

822
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:28,880
Is um, I it's not particularly a woman's question, but nevertheless I will

823
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,520
I wanted to try to bring us back

824
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
to the question that

825
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,360
I'm actually finding it very difficult to articulate so please forgive me

826
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,600
um

827
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:47,200
The the question of love at the root of of our response to this crisis

828
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,840
and you

829
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,280
So a couple of things one is that I I think that what you were saying earlier daniel

830
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,360
about

831
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,640
One of the one of the primary things that's gone

832
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,720
Gone wrong and I'm a scientist and I've been trying to deal with

833
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:12,720
the integration of science and spirituality and and technology and economics and the whole thing for many many years so

834
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,280
trying to see the roots of these things is is is um leads you to a place where

835
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,560
You're you're faced with uncertainty and radical humility. So let's start there, but the sense of separation

836
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,600
to me is

837
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,760
allied to

838
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,480
a corresponding faith in our

839
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:42,080
In justifying justifying our actions, which which um, I I don't really explain that at the moment, but

840
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:52,480
We are we have a moral ground for our being that co exists with our egotistical power sense and our

841
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,080
um

842
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,080
Our ability to justify what we're doing in terms of violence and so on so I wanted to

843
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,880
ask you about how you see

844
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:11,360
Love as as a guiding principle for how we can act in this complex world that we're now living in

845
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,960
because

846
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,080
When we talk about our faith tradition as quakers

847
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,400
We're often looking towards our conscience our spirit

848
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,960
And that spirit is also the the the ground of love

849
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,400
for life truth that the truth of our unity

850
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:36,240
And the and that which guides us into doing action whether or not we really can be certain of the outcome

851
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,760
Does that make some sort of sense? Yeah, totally

852
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,200
um

853
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,240
I don't think we can ever be certain of the outcome right

854
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:58,640
I I don't think that we shouldn't try to engage in

855
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,640
Uh, you just went away to look at you while you were talking

856
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,760
I guess not so I'm here. There you are. Okay. Um

857
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,600
I

858
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,760
Think that

859
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,760
consequentialist ethics have a role

860
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:26,240
Where you think through what will provide the greatest good for the greatest many and you try to think through the causal dynamics of it

861
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,680
But uh consequentialist ethics on their own ends up generally making people evil

862
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,960
Because you pretend that you have more certainty about the future state than you possibly can

863
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,880
You identify certain bad things that are inevitable which justifies why you have to do some other bad things because they're less bad

864
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,160
And so the basis of that is actually the excessive

865
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,200
certainty that isn't epistemically warranted, which is why the epistemic humility is so important

866
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:01,040
So there is a there's a kind of virtue ethic, which is I don't know how the future is going to unfold

867
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,200
There's unpredictable complexity everywhere

868
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:09,120
But I know that the choices that have the most integrity in the moment put out the kind of ripples that will ripple well

869
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,400
Right, so that's kind of a virtue ethic

870
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:18,000
There's kind of a utilitarian ethic that tries to think through what is a viable in-state here

871
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:22,880
What is a viable or at least new homeodynamic state and can I reverse engineer steps? They're both important

872
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,600
right

873
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:32,800
And then there's something that is kind of deeper than either of those even deeper than the virtue ethic which is

874
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,120
uh

875
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:41,200
Something like the feeling guidance that comes from deep enough prayer

876
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,960
And again, that's all the aspects of self being involved

877
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
As far as love at the basis

878
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:02,000
I think if anyone really explores why they are motivated to do something

879
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,280
There's it's not purely a rational thing

880
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Because a purely rational thing doesn't actually have motive. It doesn't care, right? Like there are some basis for care

881
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,320
Otherwise it'd be like well, if this doesn't happen then this thing will be harmed

882
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,760
But if I don't care about that thing being harmed who cares, right? So like

883
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
in a purely rationalist

884
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,240
Ontology then I'm being nihilistic

885
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,720
So I want to change this because this is horrifying

886
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:38,480
Because I'm fucking pissed that they're doing this because I'm heartbroken over here. Well, but any of those emotions

887
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,960
I'm heartbroken because there is some these kids lives in Gaza these animals in the factory farm

888
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,760
Are beautiful they're sacred which is why I care

889
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,680
So underneath the heartbreak and underneath the anger and underneath the depression and the devastation underneath all of the sense of

890
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,360
Injustice is actually love because if I didn't find some reality

891
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,600
beautiful

892
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,640
That I loved there would be no basis for the other emotions

893
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:11,280
So that the idea that all of the other emotions are actually responses to love to care

894
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:17,280
Then you recognize the anger the sadness the depression the anxiety are all actually sacred

895
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:23,760
They all have a place but they're not at the source. So you embrace them and then you trace them back to where they come from

896
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,520
When you trace them back to where they come from rather than being angry at who the bad guy is what I love becomes clear

897
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,920
and then

898
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,040
That is actually an even deeper motive and then how

899
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,000
Do I be effective in service of what I love is a clearer focus?

900
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,680
So it's just the deep reflection on what the motivation is and tracing it back to the source

901
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,080
right and I

902
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,640
I agree and I think it's also that

903
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,280
You know love love is one of the most misunderstood words and most

904
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,960
Misunderstood concepts. It's overused and underused all the time

905
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:06,800
But it's also to me the great attractor what I call the great attractor. So it actually applies to science as well

906
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,680
It's not it's not a it's not a there's not a place where love doesn't exist

907
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:18,640
In this whole concept, you know, and it can it can be the root of guiding very very practical action

908
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:25,920
It doesn't have to be something that oh, this is just a feeling state or this is just the way quakers talk or something like that

909
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:32,000
It's actually the concept of oh total unity. It's a unified consciousness. If you like

910
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,880
Yes

911
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:43,600
Reminds me of the harmony of the spheres and you know, uh, Daniel has a beautiful talk on emergence that um, if you

912
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,440
Want to look that up on youtube at some point. Daniel talks about something very similar to what you just said, jenny

913
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,560
But um, shelly, I would like to invite you to ask your question

914
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,000
Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity

915
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,720
Daniel, I really um

916
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:10,000
I learned from I want to take us back to some of the things you said at the beginning your analysis of the different

917
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,840
Factors you you mentioned three different factors that

918
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,240
motivate

919
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,400
individuals and society to and

920
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:24,240
And determine whether we're effective or not and and as I understood it one of them was

921
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:32,960
Understanding how the world works and the other has the second has to do with your ethics or whether you care about

922
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,240
The global world or not

923
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,240
And and third was an effective strategy to

924
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,640
Take action

925
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,680
And if I I'm not sure I got that all that right, but if that's

926
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,720
Correct, um

927
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:53,600
I find that most of the people if not all of them on this on these screens

928
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:00,560
Are pretty well versed in the first one how to you know, how messed up our world is

929
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:07,360
And the second one all deeply caring and wanting to make the world a better place

930
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,720
Um, so going beyond their own personal

931
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,880
Satisfaction and needs to wanting to to create a better world

932
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:20,000
But what we mostly almost all of us fail is we don't know what to do about it

933
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,000
We don't have an effective strategy and I think you've kind of answered

934
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:29,600
With your answer to jenny, but I wonder if you could reiterate it in another way

935
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,680
So like we all understand

936
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,840
What are the best?

937
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:40,080
Strategies for us to figure out what is an effective strategy and not just individually

938
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:44,800
But how can we collectively as a quaker community take action?

939
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,480
Is this being

940
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,720
Posted on the internet

941
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,120
That was the intention, but if you want to cut anything

942
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,840
I don't know. I don't know where you're gonna go, but I we can totally work out whenever

943
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,400
Feels feels good there

944
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,400
Okay

945
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,520
In a different setting I can say more about this

946
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,440
I'll say a couple things

947
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,080
The

948
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:33,600
Study of effective strategy is different in kind than studying like environmentalism and the fact that the environment's messed up

949
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,240
It because you're studying

950
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:43,520
How power works and you're studying it not just to critique it but to engage in it

951
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,200
And so that is a very different kind of study

952
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:58,560
It looks at how is it that corporations are able to lobby governments and put

953
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,240
Corporate agents into regulatory positions to regulate the government and their interests and things like that

954
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,120
and all those critiques of that the

955
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:13,200
Rotating revolving doors of somebody from big ag or big pharma than running the fda and you know

956
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,920
Or the public private partnership where the private side writes the law that the public side implements

957
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:25,840
Or the massive subsidies to fairly toxic things that happen because the big companies that have the patents have the money to pay a lot

958
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:31,040
More lobbyists than the things that are inherently decentralized like regenerative versus conventional agriculture or whatever

959
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:36,160
There's the way the critical theorist studies this which is basically to just say it's really bad

960
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,720
Like look at all this bad stuff. It's really bad

961
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,120
There there is the way that one studies it from the perspective of

962
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
How does

963
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,400
Influence at scale operate? What are the various

964
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:56,240
Modalities that when the world has changed who changed it and what were the tools they used to change it?

965
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And if

966
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,680
Someone does not

967
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:12,720
Feel good about using those tools they counter as they have to say do I feel good about letting those who are using the tools currently continue to do it for those goals?

968
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,280
so

969
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,600
Being able to lobby a government for subsidies that ends up affecting

970
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,400
Market dynamics profoundly is something that big corporations are good at and that

971
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,600
Non-profit groups are not good at

972
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,320
Non-profit groups don't study how finance works and how lobbying works and you know those types of things well

973
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,080
Being able to figure out how to write a very complex

974
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:48,320
Operating agreement for a public-private partnership that has all the fine print to do everything you want for many different government

975
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:54,960
Jurisdictional bodies are now doing your will is something that the financial sector and various large corporate sectors are very good at and

976
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,160
You know people trying to do good things are not good at

977
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,760
um

978
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,280
and so

979
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,360
If you want effective strategy you have to study effective strategy

980
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,880
And so let's say for instance i'll give a historical example

981
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,800
And it's it's a fake example, but it'll you'll get a sense

982
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,480
Let's say that we had a chance to talk to

983
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:25,280
The Tibetans before Mao and they did let's say we had a chance to talk to them a couple decades before

984
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,640
They were not studying effective strategy because that was not their jam

985
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,960
That was not what their culture was about right they were doing different things and they were doing lovely things

986
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,080
They obviously did not study that

987
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,560
And the results are also quite obvious

988
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,400
Now

989
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,080
If they were to think about geopolitical strategy for a minute

990
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,520
It would be pretty easy to say oh

991
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:02,560
There are two billion person populations on either side of a watershed and we are at the source of the watershed

992
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,760
I bet we don't get to stay here

993
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,640
Like it seems pretty obvious that we don't get to stay here one of these sides is going to take the head

994
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,840
Top of the watershed. Also, this is going to be key to the strategic communications and missile defense

995
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,880
so

996
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,320
Geographically the fate is already written that we don't get to stay here

997
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,920
Given that what should we do and either

998
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
They would have done something like

999
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,600
Uh, anticipatorily create a partnership with one of the sides

1000
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,040
In which they had something unique to offer

1001
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,600
They would have left

1002
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,960
Or they would have done something like finlanded between the ussr and eu to be in a

1003
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,400
Buffer zone

1004
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,280
relationship where both sides militarily protected them because of that or like switzerland did to say, you know

1005
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,880
all of the international agreements between the two of you were going to be able to host

1006
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,480
and

1007
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,480
So let's say that

1008
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:07,600
Tibet had realized that 30 years before the kind of rise of Mao and they had went to

1009
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,760
The european powers at the time and said look, here's what's going to happen

1010
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
China's going to get this otherwise

1011
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:19,680
And it's going to help their rise to power that is going to end up threatening you and blah blah blah

1012
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,560
And here's why you want to help protect us like offer kind of military legal support protecting us here

1013
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,760
And then here's how what we're going to tell india here's what we're going to tell china such that in the same way that nobody

1014
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,600
Invaded switzerland because everybody was invested in being able to store their gold and stuff in switzerland because switzerland was thinking about strategy

1015
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,360
Then tibet could have done that

1016
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:42,320
This would not have been this would have not arisen from the minds of the tibetan people with the culture they had

1017
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:49,520
It did arise from the minds of some religions like jews, right? They had a different they had a

1018
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:55,760
Different type of spirituality and mind arising that thought about strategy in a different way

1019
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,600
So

1020
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:10,160
It's not that there aren't places like tibet that had the same geographical determination that

1021
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:15,120
Did a better job than they did it said it required a different type of mind

1022
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:20,000
And that as as i've mentioned the people who are good at strategy

1023
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:26,880
Are almost always strategy is a military term it gets then gets applied to business and other things, but it is about

1024
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:35,440
Effective achieving of goals which are almost always narrow goals where you externalize costs in the process and against adversaries

1025
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,200
right like that's

1026
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,080
so

1027
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,080
The mind that gets good at strategy

1028
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:48,560
Is almost always co-occurring with something that is self-centered either at the level of the individual the nation state the corporation but not

1029
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,280
The commons in all life and perpetuity

1030
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:56,240
When you're thinking about the commons in all life and perpetuity you're not thinking how do I win stuff?

1031
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,320
and so

1032
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
but it's kind of like

1033
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,600
let's

1034
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,600
Let's take star wars

1035
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,680
Let's say there were no sith

1036
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,720
right

1037
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,720
There wouldn't have to be jedi if there were no sith

1038
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,280
Everybody could just be farmers and poets and parents and teachers would be lovely

1039
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,760
But if there are sith there must be jedi and the jedi are not trained in farming. They are trained in warfare

1040
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,360
protective warfare

1041
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,960
right

1042
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,960
um not in service of

1043
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,760
empire and conquest purely like the white blood cells and immune system

1044
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,760
and

1045
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,720
So what I would say is if you

1046
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,840
Want to be effective

1047
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:47,440
At serving things that you care about in the presence of other groups that are effective at serving the goals they care about

1048
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,240
You need to engage in that field of study

1049
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,440
The jury

1050
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah, what was that?

1051
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,360
It's almost as if what you're saying is that

1052
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,240
In order to be effective

1053
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,720
We need to let go of our ethics

1054
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:19,600
because in order to be effect the way you're most effective is

1055
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,320
by being um

1056
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,200
self-serving and you know with a narrow focus

1057
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,880
So there's a real problem. I'm not saying that

1058
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,520
Okay

1059
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:38,080
I'm saying that it is inethical to do something that you know is for sure ineffective

1060
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
To let

1061
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,080
uh

1062
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:50,480
Horror and tragedy and species extinction continue because you aren't willing to engage in effective strategies unethical

1063
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,040
we are responsible not just for what we do but what we don't do

1064
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,720
and

1065
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,240
So there is an ethical responsibility to effectiveness

1066
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,880
That doesn't mean you justify any amount of harm in the process. I'm not and that's the tricky thing is that the

1067
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,800
The cultures

1068
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,440
That

1069
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,320
Said okay, we don't want wiped out therefore we have to build a standing military or whatever

1070
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,120
We're not the same culture anymore because they had to reinvest things that had went into

1071
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,480
Arts and child education and whatever now into military and and those types of things so

1072
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,520
The two fail modes that we have to avoid is

1073
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:41,760
Uh a culture that is doing something that is more

1074
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:50,400
Ethical in its goals that just gets destroyed by a more dominant culture. That's a fail mode

1075
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:55,360
Or even if it doesn't get destroyed because no one cares about it because it has no power but it it

1076
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,040
Fails to prevent harm in the rest of the world happening

1077
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,600
That's a fail mode

1078
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,440
and one the other fail mode is that in the aim of

1079
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,680
Not being destroyed and being effective. It also becomes a dominated culture

1080
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,400
That's also a fail mode

1081
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,520
So you can either be destroyed by the machine or become the machine is the answer

1082
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,520
So you have to do something that is neither of those

1083
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:20,880
So in learning how to be effective obviously the long-term

1084
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,080
Play there is a change of all of the systems that mediate game theory itself

1085
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:33,040
The consciousness and the systems which will look like not capitalism not nation states and not minds that see everything as separate things

1086
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,720
But we don't get there if we don't if right now everybody

1087
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:44,960
That is effectively getting lawmakers to write law or doing it in narrow short-term private interests

1088
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,760
I would rather environmentalists know how to do the corporate thing as well as the corporate guys do

1089
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,280
Or a different set of purposes

1090
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:58,240
Well, of course, I would like to have a government that is not hijackable by anybody's interests

1091
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:03,120
And that has a good collective intelligence guiding it. We obviously don't have that so having

1092
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:13,520
The more inclusive goals be effective in the current dynamics while seeking to upgrade the underlying systemic dynamics

1093
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,600
Both have to happen simultaneously

1094
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,720
It's a tall order

1095
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,640
Yeah, well, thank you for now being effective

1096
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,640
At a local level is different because you don't have great power vested interests in the same way

1097
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:30,800
And that's awesome

1098
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:36,640
And I encourage most people to actually feel really good about that as opposed to hopeless about the scale that it's not operating at

1099
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,640
And

1100
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:44,960
For those who can't not think about the world at scale and can't not

1101
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,040
Endeavour to become more effective at it

1102
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,760
It's just a different study

1103
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,120
Thank you Daniel for sharing that and

1104
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,800
Yeah, I think that a core tenant of quakerism is about is about peace, right?

1105
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:08,400
I'm guessing you might have ran across that, you know, so from the 1650s onward is this sort of

1106
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,920
testimony on peace and so

1107
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,040
There's much more to endeavor into there, but

1108
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,440
And into that so let me give you for instance

1109
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,400
Yeah

1110
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,400
So the nuclear clock got

1111
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,360
Moved closer to midnight

1112
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,440
Associated with the escalation in ukraine

1113
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,920
Yeah

1114
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,120
You have not heard

1115
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,160
A good thought on a plausible end game

1116
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,120
When you watch the news because there is not one

1117
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,200
The there is

1118
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,920
On one side a bunch of rhetoric

1119
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,920
Like putin is hitler and if he takes part of ukraine then

1120
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,800
Bad guys everywhere will start taking other places and he'll take all of Europe and whatever and this is why we have to

1121
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,120
But there's no thought about

1122
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,900
What okay, so we're closing

1123
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,160
Possible de-escalation pathways. What is the end game that we're going towards instead?

1124
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:17,280
And engaging with this pretty directly. I can tell you that there's very wacky conversations about our first strike

1125
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,760
nuclear dominance

1126
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,160
And stuff like that

1127
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,160
so

1128
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,640
If you

1129
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,520
Are focused on peace. It's not just we don't want to wage war

1130
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:35,840
It's that we want to be effective at de-escalating everyone who is waging war and there are increasingly hawkish people on all sides

1131
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,840
Absolutely

1132
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:43,440
So learn how to be effective at influencing what is happening at the level of national security councils

1133
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:51,840
Yeah to be able to have the more de-escalatory voices get into more positions of power and the escalatory hawkish voices not be there

1134
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,320
so it

1135
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,000
It takes a particular

1136
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,360
But unless you know how to talk to security councils in language that will move them

1137
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:07,120
Then you don't have the ability to help de-escalation in those ways or the other forces that you'd need to work with

1138
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,880
so

1139
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,880
the like

1140
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,760
I think

1141
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
One time when I was like nine years old

1142
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,360
I

1143
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:27,280
Had an experience probably many people here have had where I was horrified at my inability to not cause harm

1144
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,400
that I

1145
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,480
I couldn't avoid

1146
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,960
When I was walking on the grass maybe killing some bugs. I couldn't I

1147
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
at least my nine-year-old mind the

1148
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,360
mites that were destroyed with my breath and my eyelash flutters

1149
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:48,800
You know, it was just like so kind of horrifying. So I was like just stood there frozen didn't want to move

1150
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,120
Wanted to breathe the little as possible

1151
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,480
and

1152
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:58,880
Okay, I realized I have to breathe and move but really tried to think about how do I not cause any harm and I'm complicit with all these systems that are

1153
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,080
Fundamentally ecocidal and genocidal to be able to just get my stuff

1154
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:03,760
right

1155
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,760
and even if I'm eating a vegetarian diet

1156
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,120
but

1157
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:14,080
The shipping processes the oil that was involved in shipping at everything, right? There's like there's

1158
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:19,920
Blood in all of that stuff and so I'm like, okay, so I have to only have things I make myself from stuff that I find

1159
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,080
and

1160
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:26,720
The idea that then for me to have my hands clean. I'm not causing harm

1161
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:32,720
Also means I am totally complicit in allowing all the harm of the system to happen because I'm not willing to interact with any of it

1162
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,760
There's a kind of humility that says no, I'm going to drive a car with fossil fuels that

1163
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,080
Not only are destroying the environment but create wars that kill children

1164
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,080
That I am partly driving the demand for

1165
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:53,360
Then there is a place where like you don't I don't get to have my hands clean in this world

1166
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,240
I do my very best but

1167
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:02,240
There's a humility in that that's important. There's a realism in it. That's important

1168
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:06,720
There's a not superiority over everybody else just being like we're in this thing together

1169
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,280
At this time. That's the time that we're in

1170
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,480
And then say like if I'm a pacifist

1171
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,520
I'm not the one who controls the nuclear buttons

1172
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,240
I'm not the one who controls the rapid proliferation of drone weapons

1173
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,920
If I'm really a pacifist meaning I don't want there to be

1174
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:30,640
Killing anywhere. How do I become increasingly influential over the people who are in control of the nuclear buttons and who are building all of the

1175
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,880
AI empowered drone weapons

1176
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:40,160
But that means maybe I have to learn how to engage compellingly with places that I would rather never engage with

1177
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:48,240
Well, we've got two more questions and I want to kind of finish out with those

1178
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:52,720
I think we'll we'll finish here at uh six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

1179
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:58,720
Um, so David, I want to give you an opportunity and then Eric and then Daniel any closing words?

1180
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,960
Hi, greetings Daniel and everyone from Wajak Nga Buja in

1181
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,840
Western Australia, where it's now 8 53 a.m. Saturday morning

1182
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:17,200
And it does make me think of Edward Wilson's classic line. You know, we have a paleolithic emotions

1183
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:22,240
medieval institutions and godlike technology

1184
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,760
So I did enjoy your talk very much Daniel and I love that you

1185
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:32,400
refer to sort of evolution or at least cultural evolution

1186
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:40,240
And I have great respect for the United States of America two years away from your declaration of independence

1187
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,520
And um, you know, essentially founding a republic

1188
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,840
So it's pretty amazing for me living in what is a fairly robust democracy here

1189
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:57,920
Um, but I do Dothma cap at America's abilities. Uh, so in terms of evolutionary

1190
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:06,160
Perspectives, I mean, I I remember in the early 90s after the collapse of the Berlin Wall

1191
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,520
One of the classic lines was because we went from two superpowers to the one superpower

1192
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,920
And one of the classic lines was, you know, the new world superpower

1193
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,040
is global public opinion

1194
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,760
And uh, now it's a little bit more mixed up, but I'm just wondering

1195
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,600
overall

1196
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:33,360
What you think of the prospects of democracy modern representative democracy, which of course is nothing like

1197
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
ancient greek democracy

1198
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,120
Not good

1199
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,440
Um

1200
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,000
You just went away again, why do people go away right after they talk? I can all go ahead and um

1201
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,600
I'm here. I'm still here. I'm still all right. So, um

1202
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,000
It's a long complicated answer, but

1203
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:09,920
when

1204
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,920
The u.s. Democracy was founded

1205
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,920
We did have an ocean separating us

1206
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,640
And so the idea that the

1207
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:24,720
There were a few things but one the idea that the people could know

1208
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:29,440
Everything so they could be democratically, um, you know, participatory

1209
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:37,760
Once we started to get the telegraph and then kind of mass telecommunications and then, um

1210
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:42,960
Satellite spying sig intel and hypersonic missiles

1211
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,840
Anything the american public know the russians the chinese the iranians instantly know

1212
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:54,400
That means you started having a situation where almost everything became a national security secret and could not be shared with the public or even

1213
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,560
got congress mostly

1214
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:04,080
Because where the fertilizer is stored is a is a weapons knowledge where the aquifers are where the so increasingly

1215
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,520
The most critical information can never be known by the public because it's national security secrets

1216
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:14,000
That's you can't run a democracy where you have to classify everything

1217
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,160
um

1218
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:21,760
And yet you also can't make have a world that is in that kind of warfare where you share all of the things that

1219
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,240
Are national security secrets with the public, you know, that's one example of a context change

1220
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,080
In which the ideas that kind of made sense just totally don't make sense

1221
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:33,760
The thing that we call the democracy obviously did all of its labor with slavery

1222
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,840
and which means that all the shit jobs that people had no boat in

1223
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,680
and

1224
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,680
Then we kind of got rid of that

1225
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,440
obviously

1226
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,840
After the emancipation proclamation, we didn't really get rid of slavery

1227
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,760
We just got a p and h slavery system where we put people in jail for for false reasons and then you know forced labor out of them

1228
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:56,480
We really only got rid of it when we when globalization allowed us to ship the slavery overseas

1229
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,360
and by the step back and effectively

1230
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,880
and

1231
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,880
You know, so if you were to say

1232
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:08,880
Can a democracy make the decisions where the totality of the decisions it's of everyone that it's affecting all have a voice

1233
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,960
All the stakeholders have a voice that's never happened

1234
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,640
right so

1235
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:18,160
A country will look at its genie coefficient and say what the inequality is but it buys its stuff from a country

1236
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,560
Where almost everybody is poor

1237
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:25,520
In which case it depends upon so the only level at which genie coefficient makes sense is global

1238
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,480
Right, the only there's so many things like that where you really have to think about that

1239
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:34,240
Which you depend upon and are driving the supply and demand of so

1240
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,640
um

1241
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:39,600
If if you really look at did we ever have democracy?

1242
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:46,320
There was actually a thing where the stakeholders that were being affected really had any say it's not it's not a very good analysis

1243
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,960
and then when you say

1244
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,760
Does the thing that we have now even resemble the elements of that totally not

1245
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,480
Now

1246
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,120
Uh, how do you deal with that moving forward?

1247
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:04,640
There is no system of governance in the history of the world that can deal with the issues that we need to deal with now

1248
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
Because

1249
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,480
Or instance

1250
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,360
Uh gene synthesizers are becoming cheaper on an exponential curve

1251
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:27,520
And it is already the case that quite inexpensively you can get the ability for gene synthesis and amplification and

1252
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:32,960
It's a couple couple years at the current rate away from incredibly cheap like desktop capability for everybody

1253
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,640
So if you even have open publishing of science

1254
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:42,480
Where the science is doing gain and function research to look at incredibly variable empathogens and you publish the genome sequence

1255
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:49,200
The information file alone, which is now open published on the internet is enough to make catastrophe weapons

1256
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:57,120
And you can't monitor and control that the way you can nukes because nukes obviously are very very hard to make and you can see

1257
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:00,160
The facilities the uranium enrichment etc from space

1258
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,480
But we're talking about devices anybody can have in a tiny basement lab

1259
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,320
And so that either means you

1260
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,120
You just stop science mostly

1261
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
Because it's all Pandora's boxes

1262
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,160
Or you stop open publishing

1263
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:25,120
Totally in the proper idea of kind of democracy there because the knowledge itself has weaponizable applications of that scale

1264
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,760
Or you get increasing

1265
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,520
Truly global catastrophes or you create a massive surveillance state

1266
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,760
Those all are bad

1267
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,600
There are better answers, but they're not obvious. They require innovation and totally new types of governance

1268
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,560
Governance of lots of things. So, you know, those are things we work on

1269
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,360
but um, I

1270
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:54,960
Don't think that there are any systems of governance known to dates that can deal with these kinds of issues

1271
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,080
I

1272
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,680
Yeah, thank you so much here. I'm gonna unspotlight folks real quick. Um

1273
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:14,480
And you know, we're coming in right here on the end of our conversation. I know Eric

1274
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,560
Eric, I know well, uh, has a question raised if it's quick, Eric

1275
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,280
If you still want to ask it go ahead and ask and then, um, daniel can share some closing thoughts

1276
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:29,280
So, um, in fact, shelly asked very similar question to what I was going to ask

1277
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:34,400
and I do want to thank you for your answers to the questions afterwards because

1278
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,920
their monologue seem to have been a

1279
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,880
um, basically a list

1280
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:49,680
And it includes numbers like, you know, the however many people the Mongols killed and how much money is being put into ai

1281
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,880
which

1282
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:57,040
Are are nice to know, but I think you could assume that the people in this audience

1283
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,640
Have been working on the basic questions for a long time

1284
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,520
So my hypothetical hypothetical question is suppose we all knew

1285
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,720
Everything that you had to say except for those little numbers

1286
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,520
What would you say instead?

1287
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:30,320
It's always hard to talk to an audience that you don't know what is shared knowledge

1288
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:35,920
Um, what's shared world view? It's always a tricky tricky thing. Um

1289
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,320
So my

1290
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,080
Uh ideal situation is

1291
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,720
To get to understand what a group is working on like what the shared knowledge is and what they're already

1292
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,040
working on together and what things

1293
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:58,000
Would be useful or empowering for them. What are the things that they're working on and then see do I know anything?

1294
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,080
It would be useful. Maybe you don't

1295
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,680
um

1296
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,680
You know, it could be things about

1297
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,280
Uh

1298
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,960
Pathways of enacting solutions like specific strategies for enactment could be things about

1299
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,640
prioritization of amongst all the problematic things which ones make sense to sequence attention on

1300
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:23,200
it could be

1301
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,280
um

1302
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:32,160
deepening the understanding of the problem assessment in terms of the causal dynamics more such that

1303
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:37,440
Um clear insight about what the effective kinds of strategies would be

1304
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,800
But it would depend upon what was already known and what wasn't and what was interesting

1305
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,040
And

1306
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,080
Well, Daniel, we might need to talk more at some point

1307
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:58,400
But uh, I just uh want to give you a chance. Uh, it's uh 904 your time

1308
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:02,320
I know, um, but do you want to share some closing thoughts with with the group here?

1309
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,080
I

1310
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,760
I was um

1311
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,640
I didn't know who was in the group uh beforehand, you know, and you invited me here. I was uh

1312
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,120
uh

1313
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:20,560
Happy to see how many people were scientists and where people who've been working on these issues for a long time knew

1314
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:23,120
Uh a lot about it. I um

1315
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,880
That's not the case of faith communities in general. Um, so I think that's awesome

1316
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
if there was a

1317
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:36,240
Follow-up of okay, let's kind of share

1318
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:43,840
What our state-of-the-world assessment is and what our current thoughts for how to what we care to do and how we

1319
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:48,960
Think about how to enact that are and be able to engage there. That would be really interesting

1320
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:51,760
um

1321
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,760
and

1322
01:52:55,280 --> 01:53:03,040
Uh, if there are people who are like have backgrounds and things and are working on things that feel like there are

1323
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:09,680
Interesting follow-ups we might engage in if Keith maybe you send me a list about of that and that would also be really cool

1324
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:20,640
Definitely will do. Yeah. Well, maybe we can end with some stillness and getting back in touch with that sacred center and

1325
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:26,800
Thank you so much Daniel for sharing your thoughts. I would like to hear the harvest

1326
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:31,200
From this so if some of you stay and continue to talk Keith if you would share

1327
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,800
um harvest and there are interesting follow-ups to the intersection of the

1328
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,320
um

1329
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,320
kind of spirituality that

1330
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,560
is not

1331
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,560
incommensurable with any other

1332
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,720
worldview or religion that has uh

1333
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:56,400
In sacredness listening conscience at the center that also has environmentally interested people and scientists like this is

1334
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,720
Really delightful. I'm really happy to have met the people here and so I look forward to hearing more

1335
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:04,080
Thanks

1336
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:39,920
All right, so um the folks who are staying I um

1337
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:46,720
Want to just share with you all um the queries that we have uh, if this is not like I think any time with queries

1338
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,720
It's really where's spirit drawing us?

1339
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:56,240
But the questions I've written ahead of time are how might QEW as an organization respond with deep earnestness

1340
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,720
to the crisis we face today

1341
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:03,760
Given Daniel's talk what new insights or challenges are we seeing?

1342
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:11,600
And three how might our Quaker faith inspire us in taking on our civilization all right at that?

1343
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:20,000
So I'll drop those in the chat and then I just want to invite folks to start raising their hands and maybe once five hands are up

1344
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,840
um

1345
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:28,480
So I'll drop those in the chat and then uh as folks are led just raise your hands and we can begin this discussion

1346
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:30,960
Thank you so much everyone

1347
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,960
I'll note as someone who really loves

1348
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,360
Daniel's analysis that i'm like

1349
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:39,760
A little nervous because he does get laid something laid on pretty heavy sometimes

1350
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:46,960
But I think it's really important for us to actually um as people who are called to spirituality not to avoid those facts

1351
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,640
But to to really face up to them and ask a couple of us what conscience

1352
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,360
How conscience would have have us respond?

1353
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,440
so

1354
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,440
at that

1355
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Just waiting for hands. We got four hands

1356
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,840
and

1357
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,120
Yeah, five

1358
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:08,400
Okay, or four, but anyway story if you want to go ahead and start us off

1359
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:14,320
Yeah, I I can only speak to number two because i'm i'm lutheran

1360
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,760
And I have a very different um

1361
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,720
Well, let's just say we do things a little differently

1362
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:26,800
Um same general idea. Love your neighbor. Love god with all your heart mind and soul

1363
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,160
The the thought that occurred to me

1364
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,320
is

1365
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:36,080
I as having deep roots in the scientific community

1366
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,800
Going back over 50 years

1367
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,520
uh, I'm

1368
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:42,720
I'm

1369
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:47,120
Feel motivated to say how can we kind of merge these points of use?

1370
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:55,440
And for example in the geologic view, there's the oceanographers. There's the astrophysicist. There's the geochemists

1371
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,320
There's the paleoclimatologist

1372
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:05,120
There's all these sub branches all the way going down to high temperature superconductors because that's part of the same physics

1373
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:13,120
And so we know we're very good at working with other groups and seeing things from their point of view because they're all valid

1374
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,680
And together you you kind of get a broader more deeper perspective

1375
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:25,440
Because I I heard very solid analysis from daniel on geopolitics and the reality of certain

1376
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,160
government interactions and you know

1377
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,640
history

1378
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:32,640
but there's a

1379
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:36,880
There's a climate aspect that is not well socialized

1380
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,600
There are our demographic aspects that are not well socialized. My wife is from taiwan

1381
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,320
And having that kind of personal connection

1382
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:51,360
You notice things they don't publish because they're right there in front of you on the ground

1383
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:59,680
And i'm just wondering where would it be best to kind of fuse those perspectives into a greater one

1384
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,520
because

1385
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,320
I really firmly believe if you're going to make wise

1386
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,680
powerful decisions, you gotta know what you face

1387
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,080
Hey

1388
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:20,320
Ronnie, I think you know, I think everyone can see this list and

1389
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,280
if we

1390
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:24,160
um

1391
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:29,040
Yeah, so um, we'll try to I see your hand raised. Don't worry. Ronnie. You want to respond?

1392
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,840
for sure I do, um

1393
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:36,080
I mean I pushed back at the end because

1394
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:44,240
Not everybody here is a scientist and I sure as hell don't want to be in a a group with just scientists

1395
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:50,320
There's people like me who are more social scientists and and the strategist for

1396
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,880
Community organizing and all of that kind of thing and so, you know

1397
01:58:55,520 --> 01:59:00,480
I one of the things that I find is, you know, we are I don't think we have

1398
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:04,640
Some of the answers we truly need and and yet

1399
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:11,600
I also bring a strong native american orientation to this and

1400
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,320
You know, we can do this from a um

1401
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:22,080
Whatever this is, I mean native peoples have been, you know, destroyed

1402
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:27,280
For centuries and and whatnot. So it's nothing new

1403
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:33,760
I think, you know, it just to put that into a perspective and I think it's, you know

1404
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:39,520
I was fascinated with the elder discussion because that's an area where I have a

1405
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:47,440
High a law, you know, a large expertise and and cooperative structures that we're a bunch of older people in this country

1406
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:52,080
And we could start playing and organize around how we're going to take care of ourselves

1407
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,480
So that burden isn't on the younger generation

1408
01:59:54,800 --> 02:00:02,240
But we did talk about there being guidance from younger people and some of the younger people are starting to organize for

1409
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,640
What do we do after things break down?

1410
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:09,360
So, you know, I just um

1411
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,720
I don't think we're going to come to terms with it scientifically

1412
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:17,200
I sure don't think we're going to come to terms with it if we do a whole bunch of philosophizing

1413
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,200
I think we've got to

1414
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,200
Hit the ground with our boots on

1415
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,080
Whatever that is

1416
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,800
I

1417
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:37,280
I just want to invite folks who have their hand raised just speak in order that your hands are raised. Um

1418
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,800
Yeah

1419
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:44,320
So that's jenny jenny wrackliffe right now

1420
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:52,320
Uh, I I just want to mention a couple of things and and because I spoke earlier. I'll be quick

1421
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:55,920
That there are several examples. I can think of

1422
02:00:56,640 --> 02:01:00,960
Of given given that you're number two and number three

1423
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,080
keys

1424
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:08,000
I look to people like e f shoe marker

1425
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:09,840
gandy

1426
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,600
Martin Luther king

1427
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:20,160
And and others that some of us are already familiar with as to how we can actually build a bridge between the spiritual root

1428
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:21,920
and our

1429
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:29,280
This transformation that we're trying to bring about at the deepest possible level and turn that into practical action

1430
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:30,800
and when

1431
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,000
gandy

1432
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,960
Made the savo dear movement in in india

1433
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:42,560
I think as much as the satyagraha movement where he was is which he's known for about peacemaking and and and

1434
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,080
An indian liberation from the british and so on

1435
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:47,600
um

1436
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:52,000
his his practical program of of appropriate technology

1437
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:56,240
Deep economy deep deep ecology in effect

1438
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,800
thomas berry spoke to this and

1439
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:06,000
We're we're trying to integrate those things in our own lives. I think I mean daniel sort of

1440
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:10,000
Painted a picture where in a sense we're faced with a dilemma

1441
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:15,920
Do we do we have to enter the corporate world in order to be able to understand how to fix it?

1442
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:18,240
Do we do this

1443
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:23,680
Are we are we compromising our purity of our intentions if we understand how

1444
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:30,880
You know the the armaments industry works or something like that and if the criteria is to be effective

1445
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:37,760
But the criteria it has to be to be effective from in a spiritually guided

1446
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:40,240
And transformative way

1447
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:45,440
And that's the challenge we're facing and I think that people like shoe marker

1448
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:53,520
Gandy and others actually gave us practical examples of how we can do this on the ground real practical stuff

1449
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,720
And and also what you were saying rain you is it about integrating

1450
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:02,640
Indigenous knowledge. We're trying to do that as well to bring

1451
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:08,720
Bring out not just the sort of way that we might be able to adapt to the doom that we're already facing but to

1452
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:14,480
Make the transformation ahead of time so we minimize the amount of chaos that we're producing

1453
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:26,400
And I think yeah that that really resonates with me jenny that the root of it is actually conscience at spirit

1454
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,840
And conscience leads us to act

1455
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:37,040
Um, so I just want to share that and that the power the potency of that cultivating the potency of that

1456
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,360
Is I think what I'm calling prophetic voice

1457
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:42,080
But um, nancy

1458
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,080
Thank you, I was really really grateful

1459
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,640
Our keith that you brought daniel here

1460
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:57,760
And began a dialogue with him that I think will circle back into

1461
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,960
I have heard him a number of times before so

1462
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,600
Much of what he had to say

1463
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,600
Was not as hard to hear

1464
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:11,200
In a way as it was the first time and there's a certain relief

1465
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:15,840
In the the speaking of that and then engaging with it

1466
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,080
In his models emphasizing strategy

1467
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,040
He omits another way of thinking

1468
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:26,320
That can bring together the guidance of spirit

1469
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:32,480
Which is particularly a central in clarity being clear about our goals

1470
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:35,760
And then being the right kinds of goals

1471
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,720
Some of which can be put into words

1472
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:43,760
Some of which is a response of the moment of the kind jenny is talking about and he spoke of

1473
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,240
Where spirit takes you over

1474
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:53,600
What I'm interested in the complementarity with it is comparable to strategy is the notion of design

1475
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,040
Of social design where science

1476
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,920
All the sciences both the physical the biological

1477
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,560
The social sciences

1478
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,560
Each have a contribution

1479
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:10,160
To naming the givens the art of design

1480
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,880
Is comprehending the givens

1481
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,320
In combination

1482
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,360
With the aspirations of the heart led by spirit

1483
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:22,960
And among the givens understanding the realities

1484
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:26,960
Of the situation you're in and the path dependencies and so forth

1485
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:34,880
And then with a collective effort of mutual creativity gained by really hearing each other

1486
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:41,360
To then begin to lay out what are the system requirements and what are

1487
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:45,120
The places in the system of leverage points

1488
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:49,680
Where the changes of the right kind could shift the outcomes

1489
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:56,080
And at those points what are what I would call at that point design specs for solutions

1490
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,120
And looking at stories

1491
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:06,960
It's important to understand the stories of failure. It is equally important to understand the stories of success

1492
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,440
I would say to him

1493
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:12,400
Look at the open government movement in taiwan

1494
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:20,640
Talk about an adjacent possible that just suddenly exploded. Nobody could have guessed not only a different way of governing at scale

1495
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:24,080
A truly participatory governance at scale

1496
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:29,440
But a different strategy for a kind of different kind of revolution that would occur

1497
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:35,920
Look at the reamp project in the u.s. And the notion of collective impact and

1498
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:38,400
And the notion of collective impact and

1499
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:40,800
Stanford's

1500
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,520
Social design and so forth. Let us look for

1501
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:46,240
those places where there are not only

1502
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:50,720
The accidents of the right person at the right place at the right time

1503
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,440
that history yields

1504
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:56,560
But those things that are replicable replicable that suggest

1505
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:02,000
These are ways of being together ways of meeting our needs

1506
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,280
That as I have put it to meet the needs of all by healing not harming

1507
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:11,040
Planetary people our material needs. Where are their examples?

1508
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:13,920
Of that and then where are the examples?

1509
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:18,160
Of as in the reamp project bringing all the elements

1510
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:25,040
Of a system that was resulting in horrific pollution in the american midwest

1511
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:29,440
Each of them as human beings to come together and jointly map

1512
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:36,640
The systems that they were in coming to know each other's human beings and the roles of each and then together saying

1513
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:40,880
If we change these leverage points in this system

1514
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:46,480
We could dramatically change we could reverse instead of being the most polluting part of the country

1515
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:52,240
We could become the model of the opposite as you know Keith. They were stunningly successful

1516
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:57,120
They stopped the production that going online of 30 power plants

1517
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:01,680
So I want us to study closely where those things do come together

1518
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:07,840
And the ways in which deep listening and love towards each other opens up creativity

1519
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:14,080
That is otherwise again the adjacent possible. We don't even yet know what it could look like and lastly

1520
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:21,120
The situation we confront we're all part of the problem and potentially all part of the solution

1521
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,760
Is radically different

1522
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:31,520
Than confrontational one issue even if the issue is colonialism one issue one shot warfare

1523
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:35,200
This is a really different opportunity in human history

1524
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:45,600
Thank you so much Nancy for sharing that and I couldn't agree more and I just that that um

1525
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:51,920
I do think that that first example about taiwan is actually something I've talked directly to daniel about before

1526
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:54,640
Um, so it's something on his radar

1527
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:57,360
Brad

1528
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:03,920
Uh, I apologize zoom is uh decided again that I shouldn't you shouldn't see me except in a uh a picture

1529
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,400
So i'm gonna leave the picture there. Um

1530
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:12,080
A couple of things struck me in terms of what he what he was saying. Um

1531
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:18,800
I was struck by when he grabbed me when he said uh one of our alternatives is to die with dignity

1532
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,440
um and i'm um

1533
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:25,520
And working out of that one of the things that that and then he gave he gave a model

1534
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,280
I mean he gave a lot of examples

1535
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:34,000
But one of the examples he gave I thought was by moving was he said about to bet and how to bet could have anticipated

1536
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:37,200
But their culturally weren't set to it, but they could have anticipated

1537
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,760
by their geographic

1538
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:41,040
placement

1539
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:47,440
That they were between two major powers and that they were vulnerable and done something about it and interestingly

1540
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,440
what he

1541
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,440
Said this they could have gone to europe and asked for

1542
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,400
um, essentially military support it sounded like. Um, or some kind

1543
02:09:57,200 --> 02:10:00,320
What i've noticed is and and i've and i've um

1544
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,720
Is is a lack on

1545
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:09,920
On on certain of many of us are not wanting to push back

1546
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,680
Um, and what I was hearing him say was you need to study

1547
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:22,000
The you need to study the the opponents so to speak and you need to understand them in order to know how to how to resist them

1548
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:27,920
In a way that's going to actually be effective and what he said was if not being effective is immoral

1549
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,920
And I and I thought that was extraordinary to say

1550
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:33,520
um

1551
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:38,080
It always struck me that that obama had told us in his books

1552
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:44,160
He was a compromiser and when you have him come into a situation where

1553
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,880
for a while they

1554
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,160
His his his party controlled all three

1555
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:56,240
Parts of government, you know the executive in both houses and they didn't just do what the

1556
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:02,800
What the republicans would have done which is roll over everything they could have just put in you know

1557
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:04,000
um

1558
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:10,160
Changed medicare and had universal health and two years of it before and then try to take it away

1559
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:14,400
They they could have when they were doing the so-called bailout

1560
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,280
They could have bought out everybody's mortgages

1561
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:23,840
Taking over the banks. They had the rules to take over the banks and control them and they didn't do that

1562
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:31,840
They they chose to just to give the money to the ceo's to be able to retire and what we and we all kind of

1563
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,200
Okay

1564
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:36,640
That's okay

1565
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:41,040
And part of what what really has been bothering me, you know, and I and I

1566
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,720
I grew up in a union house. I grew up, you know, and my died in the bowl

1567
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,240
Democrats and

1568
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:58,720
Is this that the the fear to be called liberal even it's like, oh, you're a liberal. Oh my god, you know and and running away from it

1569
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:05,760
And and the pause what I'm hearing here is we need to resist we need to be more active

1570
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:11,760
It doesn't necessarily mean for quakers to take up arms, but it does mean to fight

1571
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:15,040
And there are ways to fight without

1572
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:21,680
Taking up arms and shooting people, but it doesn't mean rolling over it doesn't mean dying with dignity

1573
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,920
It doesn't mean letting it happen

1574
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:30,800
And and and that's what it's what what I feel I'm surrounded with too often in the so-called liberal world

1575
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:38,320
Is that kind of well, let's get along. Let's not make waves. Let's compromise. Let's find a way out and you know

1576
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:43,200
And not instead of saying no, this is wrong. We're going to stand up and resist

1577
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:44,640
um

1578
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:45,920
and remember

1579
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,920
peace teams one time had a

1580
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:53,040
A picture of a girl this is before the current situation of a girl standing in front of a tank

1581
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:54,400
in

1582
02:12:54,400 --> 02:13:00,720
Palestine and and protecting a trying to protect a house and and the tank ran over her and the house

1583
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:09,120
And and the line was that they had they posted was people are willing to die for war. How many people are willing to die for peace

1584
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:14,080
And it's at that level that we're talking about and I just feel um

1585
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:17,760
I just feel like that's what he was asking of us

1586
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:24,240
And in between the lines is is to have that kind of same level of energy and commitment

1587
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:28,800
To really push back and push back effectively. Thanks

1588
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:35,920
Brad, I I just want to say you're speaking to my condition. I um really

1589
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,280
Really appreciate that and um

1590
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:45,200
I'm not going to dominate this conversation, but I want to invite Brian. Yeah

1591
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,760
I

1592
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,440
Do want to

1593
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:56,000
I believe what Brad was just saying there

1594
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:57,920
but

1595
02:13:57,920 --> 02:13:59,920
I do want to um

1596
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,920
At least point out that

1597
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,800
There was an underlying fear

1598
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:09,600
That really wasn't being talked about

1599
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,400
Daniel has

1600
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:13,440
of

1601
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,120
Where we are

1602
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:17,120
And I think that it's important that we

1603
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:20,080
Understand that fear

1604
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,320
As we move forward

1605
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:25,360
That it's not an excuse for not moving forward

1606
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:31,040
But that it's an important thing to understand perhaps that the

1607
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:36,240
Time frame that is available to make the changes that are required

1608
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:39,200
Is no longer with us

1609
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:42,320
And how do we respond to that?

1610
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:44,560
The

1611
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:47,520
Fear of where we are with AI

1612
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:50,960
The fear we are with how much

1613
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:57,840
Information needs to be controlled cannot be talked about that he was afraid that

1614
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:05,600
He would be recorded and that that might be extended to the rest of the world that he might misspeak

1615
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:08,640
And he was afraid of that

1616
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:16,240
So I think that we need to understand his fears and we need to understand

1617
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:20,880
Should we hold on to those same fears or

1618
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,800
Is that something that we have something special

1619
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:27,360
within our approach

1620
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:30,400
That can work past those fears

1621
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,960
He is speaking to the fact that we need to

1622
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:39,840
Completely change the institutions the systemic

1623
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:50,640
Approaches that are already in place all need to be changed and they all need to be changed simultaneously and that

1624
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,840
There's nothing to be left behind

1625
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:56,560
that's revolution

1626
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:57,920
and

1627
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:59,920
Are we willing to

1628
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,240
step out

1629
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:06,480
to the levels of what does that mean and what does that mean within a

1630
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,600
nonviolent approach

1631
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:12,880
And what does that mean to

1632
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:15,440
our families

1633
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:17,200
and our neighbors

1634
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:20,640
And the people that are you know that we love

1635
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:25,120
That that we hold dear and what will the consequences be

1636
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:30,480
Of what we're going to make for the changes that have to happen

1637
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:36,080
To be able to prevent the worst of the things that have been outlined in front of us

1638
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:40,560
Just an acknowledgement

1639
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:44,720
Thank you

1640
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:48,160
Thank you rye, um David

1641
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,120
Um if you can hear me

1642
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,040
Um

1643
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:06,000
I'm reminded of somebody's quote who suggested an effective strategy

1644
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:13,440
Is to develop some sort of system which absolutes the existing system

1645
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:18,720
Yeah, yeah

1646
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:27,680
We're never going to have the time to develop the skills to be able to

1647
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:33,920
Change corporate corporate america from the inside

1648
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:38,960
I don't see that as something that makes sense for

1649
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
qe w

1650
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:51,040
I'm intrigued by the idea of wilderness

1651
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:54,720
There isn't any

1652
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:59,840
But at least there's little pieces of nature that still exist

1653
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:09,680
For us to develop the kind of intuition that he was talking about by exposure to nature

1654
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:13,440
It seems like qe w needs to be

1655
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:18,160
Looking for and attempting to preserve

1656
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:25,360
What little bits of nature there still are in all growth forests in wilderness

1657
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:34,960
Those are the kinds of things that we might be able to be effective in our strategy of

1658
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:44,400
Probably not at a federal level but more likely at a local level

1659
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:51,840
And pointing out to the society around us

1660
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:55,840
That those pieces of nature that still exist

1661
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,520
have

1662
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:59,520
things to teach us and

1663
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,640
Are beautiful and affect our lives

1664
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,280
If that makes sense

1665
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,800
Thank you, David, uh, we have another David

1666
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:24,080
Good morning friends 9 33 a.m. Now in

1667
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:29,520
Yeah, it was uh

1668
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:35,920
I think I will have to try and get in contact with daniel if I know he's a busy man, but his responses about

1669
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,800
governmental processes

1670
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:41,920
fascinate me because i'm certainly fascinated in

1671
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:44,080
democratic

1672
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,480
which seems to me like peaceful ways of

1673
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:54,080
You know moving the overton window as it were, you know, what's acceptable. What's not acceptable and so on so forth

1674
02:19:55,360 --> 02:20:02,320
I do think that 17th century britain was a most fascinating time

1675
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:05,920
Because of course it not only gave birth to friends

1676
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:12,560
But in many ways it gave birth to at least the beginnings of democracy

1677
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:21,040
You know, uh, we basically had the parliament taking the power over the monarch and I think it was you keith who mentioned

1678
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:29,600
Hobbes and whatnot earlier, you know, and there's you know, there's a whole lot of changes here that are happening. So I

1679
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:32,960
personally am still holding the faith

1680
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:38,080
Very much that democracy is still evolving

1681
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,880
and so I

1682
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,880
sometimes say that

1683
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:45,760
Quakers are my spiritual community

1684
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:48,480
which I dearly love

1685
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:54,400
Golf is my other religion because on the golf course nearer to thee am I and my lord when I'm

1686
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:57,280
In that spiritual space

1687
02:20:57,360 --> 02:21:01,840
But I will say that modern representative democracy is my true

1688
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:07,360
Religion in the latin sense of that word religion, which basically means

1689
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,240
Bonding what bonds us

1690
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,640
you know, and

1691
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,800
I know we are very

1692
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,800
Symbolic we work through symbolism a lot

1693
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:24,160
And so I think always I think my my holy of holies

1694
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:30,000
is the two red lines down the center of the house of commons, which are

1695
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:32,880
mythologically as it were

1696
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,040
Two broadswords apart

1697
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:39,520
Now the symbolism of that is if you are the

1698
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:42,400
Speaker in the house of commons

1699
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,560
to your right

1700
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,560
sits his majesty's

1701
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,320
loyal government

1702
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:50,000
and to your left

1703
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
sits his majesty's

1704
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:54,160
loyal opposition

1705
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:54,960
and

1706
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:57,040
So, you know, they clash thoughts

1707
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:01,200
But that's the essence of having to live in the age of reason

1708
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:04,480
Because if we are to live in the age of reason

1709
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,400
we must

1710
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,400
live in the age of

1711
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:10,960
contention rivalry

1712
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,040
because

1713
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,520
Reason can give a valid answer on both sides

1714
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,320
And I know many friends here

1715
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:21,040
have spoken about as it were

1716
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:23,280
think

1717
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:25,840
locally act globally, you know

1718
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,800
now I

1719
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:34,560
Warning, I may say something which upsets people here. Okay, but I will say first and foremost

1720
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:38,160
I am very very very pro

1721
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:40,560
choice

1722
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,560
okay, and

1723
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:44,880
I can respect

1724
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,880
the united states supreme court's decision

1725
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:51,840
To make it a state thing

1726
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,880
Okay, so I hope that doesn't upset anybody too much

1727
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:58,560
But on I would absolutely always go for pro-choice

1728
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:00,960
But I see the reasoning in it

1729
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:03,360
It's up to you folks

1730
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:04,320
individually

1731
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:09,920
As states or what have the case would be locally to decide what you as a community wish

1732
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,080
And I think that is all the way through

1733
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:16,320
You know, um, but of course how we're lessing that into a

1734
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:22,320
Global public opinion as well is another matter. Anyway enough from me. Thank you

1735
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:25,280
And Leoma

1736
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:34,240
A couple of things one it seems to me that

1737
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:42,400
Finding spaces for you know, like the scientific the internal all these different states

1738
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:45,200
doesn't seem to me like such a

1739
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,360
big conundrum

1740
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:51,840
We just I think we might be well suited to find a way to

1741
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:54,720
honor all the different ones

1742
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:57,600
uh our

1743
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,760
practice with

1744
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,440
Unity decision-making might help us be a place where we can

1745
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:08,320
help model the structure of

1746
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:11,760
Honoring all the different ways of knowing

1747
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:14,960
Going with the basic

1748
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,200
fundamental belief

1749
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:20,720
That there is something larger and deeper than us holding us

1750
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:26,960
And that we also are not wise enough to know more than part

1751
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:33,360
I mean, we're wise enough to know the QEW needs more diversity to have more

1752
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,320
more contention and more

1753
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:38,960
points of view, but um

1754
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:45,040
And so that was one thing and the other thing is I've been wondering

1755
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:51,920
Considering our size. I mean, I'm troubled by this idea that we need experts

1756
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,280
um

1757
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:56,720
Seems like a

1758
02:24:56,720 --> 02:25:00,720
Very sound idea. We need experts in how to be effective

1759
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:04,800
In the places that are controlling resources

1760
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,960
Which essentially what the big corporations and governments are

1761
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:11,280
they're

1762
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:13,440
channeling the way resources go

1763
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,040
and

1764
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:22,240
That but that's very daunting to get the amount of expertise to be

1765
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Effective there

1766
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,560
So I'm just putting that up as wow

1767
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:32,560
Because if we don't maybe we won't get a chance

1768
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:35,200
to do where our

1769
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,480
strengths is

1770
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:38,480
Or where our contribution is

1771
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:41,600
but um

1772
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:45,840
The other last thing I wanted to put forward is this idea that's been

1773
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:48,080
playing with me

1774
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:49,680
about

1775
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,200
As a compliment to the gentle warrior

1776
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:57,520
Which Keith seems to be your archetype in some

1777
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,640
Some days at least

1778
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:01,840
um

1779
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:04,400
The humble holy trickster

1780
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,000
Which is the one who's

1781
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:14,240
Uh, and there are other archetypes that we might well embrace in there or invent but

1782
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:17,200
But the humble holy trickster is the one

1783
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:20,320
Who is attuned to the emergence?

1784
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:27,520
I've been wondering about emergence as a compliment to good design, which is essential

1785
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:30,640
How do we

1786
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:33,920
How can qe w as a small organization?

1787
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:37,120
catalyze

1788
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:39,680
emergence

1789
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:43,040
By being alert to places where

1790
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:48,240
A small group can shift conversations

1791
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,440
And connect

1792
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:57,280
Groups, I mean we're in our silo. We need to get out of it. How can we connect groups?

1793
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:00,960
That

1794
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:04,080
When put together might come up with something we don't expect

1795
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:07,920
I mean, I think there are ways that emergence can be encouraged

1796
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,640
and there are ways in which

1797
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,640
it's

1798
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:16,080
Being channeled towards emergence of pathways

1799
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:21,680
We all know too well from our history in terms of the rival or stuff that daniel talked about etc

1800
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:25,040
but

1801
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:30,560
Well, I think our next person is suellin

1802
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:33,760
Thank you, liana

1803
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:36,480
You

1804
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,240
Um, I

1805
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:46,720
I want to in general say that I keep wanting to say that friend speaks my mind

1806
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:50,400
And so and what many of you have said so thank you

1807
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:52,640
I have heard

1808
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:58,160
Maybe one thing but I also may have misheard it that concerns me

1809
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:03,200
And um, and I want to respond to the first query

1810
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:06,080
Um

1811
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:10,000
So let me say that now and then I can because it relates to what concerned me

1812
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:13,840
How could qe w respond with deep earnest?

1813
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:21,440
I don't have it in front of me, but deep earnestness to what we just heard from daniel. That's the way I'm going to truncate it

1814
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:25,120
And I will say

1815
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:30,240
By actually honoring because we don't and no progressive groups do

1816
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:32,080
I think

1817
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:37,200
That's a black statement that I should don't have the right to move but we don't

1818
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:39,200
honor

1819
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:42,720
the study of effective strategy as much as we honor

1820
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:45,920
Having a phd in science

1821
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:54,320
We don't honor that and as a person who has been an organizer since I was 13 years old

1822
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,880
I will tell you the studies are out there

1823
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:03,840
And what they tell you is you'd better read them because for example people always bring up the civil rights movement

1824
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,320
well guys

1825
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:12,480
Read I've got the light of freedom that explained that it worked those marches to a large degree

1826
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:19,920
Not their only person. There's never one reason something works to a large degree because for 20 years organizations went into

1827
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:25,520
The black towns and did door-to-door canvassing and had community meetings

1828
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:29,520
For 20 years before you saw any sit-ins and marches

1829
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:33,120
Yet when people think they have studied effective strategy

1830
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,760
They think they're looking at the surface

1831
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:40,160
They haven't studied the effective strategy

1832
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,880
and we do not as

1833
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:44,640
I

1834
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:48,560
Well, I don't call myself a liberal anymore because I call myself a lefty

1835
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:53,440
because working class of economic things are always in front of me

1836
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:56,560
uh, and but what I'm going to say is

1837
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,560
You can't study it

1838
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:04,480
But you can't study it just thinking you kind of know what people have said in a few places

1839
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,880
You got to really find the studies

1840
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:13,360
It took me years to find I've got the light of freedom and the Duke university professor who wrote it

1841
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:20,720
And that was 20 years of door knocking that your university professor who wrote it said I have looked for this book for years

1842
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,800
and I finally decided I had to write it

1843
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:29,120
And uh, uh, so you it is not easy, but we cannot tell ourselves

1844
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:31,200
surface things

1845
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:34,080
If we wanted to change so if we wanted to be earnest

1846
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:42,320
We would study effective strategy, but we'd really study it the other thing the thing that has concerned me two things

1847
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:45,360
One has been the idea that if we

1848
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:53,680
Play in the some of the power circles to try to help things be better

1849
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:58,720
And we can't be sure it'll save the world but to do our best and play in some of us

1850
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:05,200
We will be corrupt like corporations. I think I've heard that in various words more than once

1851
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:07,600
No

1852
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:09,600
That isn't at all necessary

1853
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:15,520
Instead what we need to do is again go to root cause and figure out why corporations

1854
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:18,480
Have so much power. Well

1855
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:20,720
partly right

1856
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:24,720
They have so much power because they've elected people who care so much about

1857
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:26,640
I mean

1858
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:31,920
It was so different when I worked for congress when all the members of congress or a lot of them had been

1859
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:38,000
Planned by the vant and a vietnam war and the civil rights movements. You guys it was a different world

1860
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,040
And that's people

1861
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:43,360
so we need to respect that

1862
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:46,720
Power is a really

1863
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:54,400
One of the things to do and I will finally say I do not believe conscience leads to action

1864
02:31:56,320 --> 02:31:58,320
I believe

1865
02:31:58,320 --> 02:31:59,680
love

1866
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:06,240
Of things like as I said in my five-year thing looking in the eyes of a wolf not frankly to be honest

1867
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:12,880
I know often people talking about carbon credits, which I think are really important and stuff because people just go

1868
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,560
Look in the eyes of the wolf and tell me if it's okay with you

1869
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:19,120
Vow's eyes go extinct

1870
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:22,240
Because you're approaching love

1871
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,240
And what I want to say is that

1872
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,760
We need some love to help

1873
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:32,480
There be tactics

1874
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:38,720
But as he as Daniel said about the 10,000 things put you in touch with the dow

1875
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:41,200
The knocking on the doors

1876
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:49,920
The canvas is what puts off is as valid at put for putting us up in touch with spirit as sitting in a me for worship

1877
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,880
And we don't really

1878
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,840
All that we don't

1879
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:59,600
and I think because it is

1880
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:05,280
The story of that I tried to find from organizing is people did a little bit

1881
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:09,040
They were reinforced and then they did a little bit more

1882
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:18,080
So that door knocking or whatever is where god is I believe

1883
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:27,920
I'll go ahead and share just a bit. My hand kept dropping. I think it's because my mic's off

1884
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:33,840
Um, and then we're back. I'll invite you but I I really did want to share just a bit that um

1885
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:46,960
Yeah, I think I mean, I think that Naomi both knows me well

1886
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:52,320
And says it well that I think that the the orientation towards this that I'm called to

1887
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:56,240
Is something like a peaceful warrior, which is the one that's willing

1888
02:33:56,800 --> 02:34:02,400
That you know, there's a beautiful some beautiful quotes from some very peaceful warriors, uh in the 19

1889
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:08,240
Bear uh, I'm trying to remember his first name right now

1890
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:11,120
There's a few but you know, essentially, um

1891
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,760
admonishing

1892
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:16,800
Quite, you know peacemakers people who claim to be peacemakers

1893
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:22,400
But who are unwilling to pay any significant price for that and they you know claim. I want peace

1894
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:27,280
I want peace but they do it with half a heart and half a will and because of that

1895
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:33,760
The war continues because all they really want is the volaties of peace all they really want is

1896
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:36,480
peace in my little bubble

1897
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:42,320
Right and I think as long as that's what we're going for we're actually completely out of line with conscience

1898
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:48,880
That's what I I think gardening is a beautiful thing. I think rooting ourself in that deep

1899
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:54,960
Groundedness with the earth is so foundational to transforming ourselves and transforming the world

1900
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:57,360
But if we're not stepping outside of our bubble

1901
02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:02,480
We're not aligned with god. We're not aligned with conscience. We're actually just

1902
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:05,760
Faking it. We're we're middle-class white people

1903
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,400
wanting to feel good

1904
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:10,400
And so I think

1905
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:16,400
Is I hope doesn't admonish people so much that they don't feel that every small thing you do makes a difference

1906
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,040
Every little thing even if you didn't step

1907
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,640
You know, you didn't bat your eyelashes to kill that little

1908
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:28,960
Or whatever it is everything even if you die tomorrow the little things you did today

1909
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:35,600
Made some difference and so that's that's the ground that we work from is that foundation

1910
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,160
Everything makes a difference

1911
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:39,760
but if I'm going to be

1912
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:44,640
Absolutely if I'm going to be true to our bigger ancestry and I'm going to give my life to god

1913
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,800
I'm going to give my life to conscience

1914
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:48,880
There can't be any

1915
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:52,960
Cans and butts about that. It's actually everything is on the line

1916
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:57,520
And that means I'm willing I'm going to recognize that we do live in a world

1917
02:35:57,760 --> 02:35:59,760
That's much more complicated than it was

1918
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:03,680
100 years ago and if human envy is going to be a good steward of this planet

1919
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:08,400
We're probably going to get it need to be a little bit better at sense making what's going on

1920
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:10,640
we're also

1921
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:17,200
Going to get a lot better at solving our problems interrelationally with one another we're going to have to get better at peacemaking

1922
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:22,480
Um, I think that the main thing I would say is you know, we were saying the problem is the institutions

1923
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:25,680
The problem isn't the institutions. We don't have a global institution

1924
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:32,640
There's its complete rule of power by tooth and claw and in our anarchy and its worst sets

1925
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:35,120
At the at the global level

1926
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:38,720
That's not that's not entirely true. I want to you know, the un has been amazing

1927
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:43,280
There's been things that have progressed us against that trend towards violence

1928
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:47,760
um, and and there's really earnest people fighting for that. Um

1929
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:50,160
but

1930
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:52,160
We need global cooperation

1931
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:57,520
If we want to be a wise steward of this planet and to do that we have to do deep peacemaking

1932
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,680
Not shallow. Oh, why don't you just all get along kind of peacemaking but like

1933
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:07,600
Resolving historical trauma kind of peacemaking and creating peace between peoples

1934
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:09,040
um

1935
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:15,040
And then we have to I think humble ourselves before the living world that we're all apart and realize that there's a wisdom

1936
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:18,160
Implicit in all of this that is so much faster

1937
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:25,840
Than anything we have to touch with and if we're able to surrender ourselves to that and say that's actually that's the prime objective

1938
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:29,200
Is just to be a an instrument

1939
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,200
of that that's

1940
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:36,320
To me what conscience would have me do and I do think I would push back against any one didn't today

1941
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:39,200
but I I I see

1942
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:41,520
Maybe it's just a mystical sense

1943
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:44,800
That uh, the force of non-violence is as of yet

1944
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:47,280
Unrealized in its fullness in the world

1945
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:50,240
And that's what I want to see qe w leaning into

1946
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:52,880
Um not tomorrow but today

1947
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:57,840
You

1948
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:12,240
And Rebecca I'm realizing sorry I was thank you Rebecca

1949
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:21,760
So I want to thank you and I want to thank sue ellen. I think sue ellen you have a lot of wisdom about

1950
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:24,320
a strategy for

1951
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:26,000
moving forward

1952
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,240
But I I really want us all to listen to one another by

1953
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:33,680
listening in tongues because I'm going to

1954
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,600
Speak to the first question

1955
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:39,920
um

1956
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:45,600
I don't usually come to these gatherings, but I I really felt compelled after listening to

1957
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:48,880
a

1958
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:51,040
Presentation daniel spoke

1959
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,160
That was sent to me

1960
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,040
So I came tonight

1961
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,640
I'm a part of new england yearly meeting on abinackey unceded territory

1962
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,960
and

1963
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,760
in their earth care ministry committee

1964
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:11,680
And um

1965
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:14,000
number one

1966
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,880
I've got three points one is that

1967
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:21,120
The love of god

1968
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:23,120
However, you interpret that

1969
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:26,080
Calms our fears

1970
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:31,680
Calms our fears

1971
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:37,680
The second point as a social scientist

1972
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:43,040
I really believe in something that he's just shared about

1973
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:46,080
We need to create

1974
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:48,080
places of trauma

1975
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:50,560
informed

1976
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,640
gatherings

1977
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:56,400
That are part of our

1978
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:00,320
Specialties

1979
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,760
Our specialties as scientists

1980
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:07,360
Whether that be social or natural

1981
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:11,200
Or physical sciences

1982
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:16,080
Whether that be as farmers

1983
02:40:16,960 --> 02:40:18,960
Or as

1984
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:20,960
Pastors or as

1985
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:22,960
Economists

1986
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:25,360
Whatever that is

1987
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:29,040
To humbly sit together

1988
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:34,800
And listen for spirit to talk to us deeply

1989
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,840
And then come together and share those truths

1990
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:43,440
That we have discerned

1991
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:45,920
That will move us forward

1992
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:49,520
On a path

1993
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:51,680
That maybe

1994
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:55,760
able to speak to some of those entities that

1995
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:01,840
Know our language and would be able to hear us

1996
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,320
From the voice that we have that is

1997
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:10,880
somewhat unique as a people of faith

1998
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,600
And lastly

1999
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:21,440
Live into those paradigms that we have discerned

2000
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:24,400
Through the spirit

2001
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:30,320
That we don't have to keep doing what is being done

2002
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:38,000
We can move in that new way just like our early early forebears

2003
02:41:39,280 --> 02:41:41,280
Moved in a different

2004
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:44,400
Way than the culture around them

2005
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:48,560
We can do the same

2006
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:53,600
We can be known as those wacky quakers

2007
02:41:56,640 --> 02:42:00,480
Don't quite walk the same walk or talk the same talk

2008
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:09,840
That was number three so anyway, thank you very much. Thank you for this program

2009
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:22,800
I'm noticing that Juniper is on the move but Chamba, Nora and Juniper's hand is raised. Nora, are you wanting to share?

2010
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:31,760
Yeah, sorry Juniper was needing constant movement right now and I wasn't going to be able to think in

2011
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:35,840
So dad took him for a second

2012
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:42,560
I

2013
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:51,040
I mean what what was really pulling at me raising my hand um

2014
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:54,160
Why was my hand was

2015
02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:56,400
I think that

2016
02:42:56,400 --> 02:43:00,880
I actually don't want to frame it that way. I I have a deep felt knowing

2017
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,800
I'm not even going to say sense. I have a I have a deeply felt knowing

2018
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:08,240
um

2019
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:11,040
That

2020
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:18,960
Quakers are being called and have been just for some time to get really uncomfortable

2021
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:29,200
And I think that's been dawning on us slower than it should be slower than it needs to be

2022
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:35,200
Um, I mean, I think it there's of course

2023
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:40,960
I've heard echoes of that today already, but there's a

2024
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:46,560
There's a deep discomfort that we need to step into

2025
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:52,080
And I think QEW is a part of that. I think we

2026
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:02,240
I think any moment that we feel righteous we should question

2027
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:05,440
And I heard that in Daniel's talk around

2028
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:11,360
You know, if you think that you if you think you know, you're probably causing harm

2029
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:27,440
We are having a conversation in this house. I think it was last night my sense of time is a little weird since having a baby. Um

2030
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,840
Um

2031
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:32,640
But we are having a conversation about different

2032
02:44:34,720 --> 02:44:36,720
Different cultures in different ways of

2033
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:42,880
Of just approaching things and

2034
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:47,360
And how what we think is like what's needed

2035
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:54,080
Is coming from our own cultural frame and I think those kinds of conversations are really important

2036
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:05,200
But I think that we can't get too hung up on trying to be so perfect as to know everyone's cultural frame

2037
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:08,080
As to know

2038
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:13,360
What's going to be the deep understanding that's underneath all of it. It's okay. We have our cultural frame

2039
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:19,280
If someone came into our circle, they were like, well for my political frame, this is what we understand

2040
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:22,480
We wouldn't say, oh, well, let's go deeper than that because that's not

2041
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:28,960
That's cultural frame. That's not valid. We we'd say, oh, thank you so much for bringing that

2042
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:34,560
We need to get uncomfortable enough to say

2043
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:37,520
This is my frame

2044
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:42,800
This is where I'm coming from and I'm a piece of the puzzle and I'm gonna step in

2045
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:50,000
And that's uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable to claim something because when you claim something you can be ostracized for it

2046
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:56,080
And actually you're gonna have to change it the moment you claim it

2047
02:45:56,160 --> 02:46:00,480
You have to change it because the moment you claim it you start learning about it and you start learning about yourself

2048
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:02,560
Oh, this is my experience of being human

2049
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:10,480
And then it starts to shift and how uncomfortable to be on shifting sand all the time

2050
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:18,320
But I think that's where god wants us to go. I think that's where spirit always has lived

2051
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:25,200
You

2052
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:35,200
You think there's other things that that come to me about the whole question of rite of passage and and

2053
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:43,200
And the frame of a rite of passage feels really powerful, but um

2054
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:49,120
Honestly, none of that is feeling very led for me to say so I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stop there

2055
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:56,560
As your partner, I'm very moved

2056
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:00,560
Um, that was really powerful

2057
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:03,600
Thor

2058
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:10,240
Man so many many good people that talks tonight. I just I'm thoroughly impressed

2059
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:14,720
I'm gonna summon up the game of rock paper scissors

2060
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:16,880
because

2061
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:21,040
A lot of us would like to pick up a sword and battle it out, but that's just not

2062
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:24,640
Politically correct anymore, especially in a democracy

2063
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:30,080
So that we switch over the paper and it's really a political legislative process

2064
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:36,160
Getting out the vote going to door to door getting the right people in congress and we already know what they're gonna vote on

2065
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:42,080
They're gonna vote for reforms. They're gonna do the right thing or close enough. That's how represented democracy works

2066
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:48,960
And some of us well, let's just say rock is easier to break up than to change your mind

2067
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:51,680
We've got brains. We soak up information

2068
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:58,080
Um, I mean I I I was faced with a genetic condition my son. I went into a medical library

2069
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:01,600
No background in medicine 10 hours later. I had the diagnosis

2070
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,720
I can do those kind of mental gymnastics

2071
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:07,120
Most people can't

2072
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:12,000
Most people can't spend a couple hours a day just trying to keep current on what's going on out there in the science world

2073
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:16,720
But I find hope in knowing what's going on

2074
02:48:17,280 --> 02:48:23,280
Even if it's in the early stages, you know, vanadium peroxide soaks up carbon dioxide

2075
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:29,280
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it's not but I'm sure it's going to be either replaced by something better or it will do

2076
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:34,400
That that's the realm of people spend two hours a day every day

2077
02:48:34,720 --> 02:48:37,280
Soaking up information because that's something I'm good at

2078
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:43,280
So I'm a rock. I know it. I'm a lousy politician and I certainly don't want to go with a broadsword out there

2079
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:51,600
But we got a system of domination. It's a kinder, gentler one. We see it in our housing. We see it in our financial system

2080
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
We see it in our retirement system

2081
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,960
And I I

2082
02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:01,840
I love the problems we have in the United States solely because I know they're worse everywhere else. They go in the world

2083
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:04,320
so

2084
02:49:04,320 --> 02:49:07,520
I'm just saying being aware is so powerful

2085
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:12,640
And getting out and you know, if you're really going to say you love your neighbor

2086
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:15,840
You're willing to get outside. You're a little little bubble

2087
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:21,600
And I hear you say you love nature, but I really like meeting people that are really different than me

2088
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:26,000
They think differently. They're culturally different

2089
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:33,600
That's what's really going to change and I think that is the the singular strength of a group like this is we can get out

2090
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
and meet our neighbors

2091
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:39,840
And we can make a persuasive story that you know

2092
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:43,440
I think God calls us to be a servant

2093
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:49,520
We are called to do the right thing. We're not supposed to be a reactionary. We're not supposed to be afraid to change

2094
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
We don't have such rocks, you know

2095
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:55,680
Set rules about the way it should be like it was in 1940

2096
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:01,680
And that is I think you're this the signature power of this group

2097
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:04,960
I don't know. I got I'm really impressed

2098
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:07,280
You

2099
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:13,280
Thank you Thor we'll keep in conversation. Um, uh, allen

2100
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,480
Oh, I was kind of hoping you wouldn't call on me

2101
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:21,840
I

2102
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:25,360
I've I've been listening to everyone and really

2103
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:30,000
appreciating all the deep and moving wisdom and the um

2104
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:38,880
And and I feel like what I mostly have to bring is uh confusion and I'm I'm kind of wrestling deeply with a lot of what uh

2105
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,240
Daniel brought forth, but um

2106
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,520
there's

2107
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:48,240
Part of me that is pushing back

2108
02:50:50,080 --> 02:50:55,040
Against uh, I found I found a lot of our conversations and but there's been little

2109
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,840
glimmerings

2110
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:02,720
Of something else, but I found a lot of them tonight to be very human bounded

2111
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
um

2112
02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:14,240
That uh, when I look from my geo and it's really I think more my geological perspective than my quaker perspective

2113
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:19,680
this kind of pushing back on that that uh, when I look at nature

2114
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:22,720
I don't see

2115
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:25,280
um

2116
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:30,320
Well competition is certainly the norm, but it's always

2117
02:51:31,040 --> 02:51:33,040
eventually ultimately bounded

2118
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:35,920
and cooperation

2119
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:41,040
Is also the norm and um

2120
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:48,880
I think this it's not just human bounded but time bounded but that

2121
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:58,080
In the rise of western civilization there was this domination mindset that emerged

2122
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:04,800
and it's uh, it's a fire and the um

2123
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:08,080
lack of fire

2124
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:10,800
It's burning

2125
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:14,320
Literally, I mean every time we drive a car

2126
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:17,520
We're burning the earth

2127
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:20,240
and

2128
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:23,440
Like all fires

2129
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:25,680
It's a

2130
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:32,960
Daniel referred to exponential growth a number of times. This is growing exponentially that is growing exponentially and

2131
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:39,520
I think uh for years I taught my students that all exponential growth

2132
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:46,800
Is ultimately self limiting that nothing can grow exponentially and it's only in the last year

2133
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:50,080
That I realized that was wrong

2134
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:53,920
That there's another kind of fire

2135
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:01,520
That uh, there are things it's only things

2136
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:05,520
That consume

2137
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:11,200
That can't grow exponentially things that produce

2138
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:14,800
Things that are generative love

2139
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:17,200
No

2140
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:24,400
No wisdom, I won't say know how know how governed by wisdom

2141
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:27,600
That can grow exponentially

2142
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:32,800
And so the question the confusion the thing I'm wrestling with

2143
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:37,200
I have I keep having this image of moses

2144
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:42,400
In the uh

2145
02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:44,640
Meeting the burning bush

2146
02:53:46,400 --> 02:53:51,200
And it was a burning with a fire that did not consume

2147
02:53:52,640 --> 02:54:04,160
And my theory of that my thought of that has always been that what was transformational there

2148
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:12,320
Was not that that bush was any different than any other bush or any tree

2149
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:15,280
Any animal or any being including us

2150
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:18,240
Is that moses

2151
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:21,360
Saw the life force in it

2152
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:24,400
Whether there was some

2153
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:27,680
Sometimes I've looked at our redbud trees and

2154
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:33,120
In spring and I've thought oh, is that the burning bush? Is that the

2155
02:54:34,480 --> 02:54:36,480
That life force

2156
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:41,680
And he recognized

2157
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:45,040
The spirit

2158
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,200
In that

2159
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:54,320
The god and he took off his shoes to make himself more like the bush to grow to find that deep rooting

2160
02:54:56,080 --> 02:55:03,040
And I there there he was often the wilderness in some ways. I think you're one person

2161
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:09,360
Meeting god

2162
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:16,240
Yet he transformed the world from that experience

2163
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:27,520
And I think that fire and genia alluded to it and other people alluded to it ultimately I think it's love

2164
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:32,800
And

2165
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:37,680
So my question is what kind of fire burns in us

2166
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:41,440
I

2167
02:55:44,320 --> 02:55:46,320
I'll just leave it with that

2168
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:54,480
I'm just gonna

2169
02:55:54,480 --> 02:55:59,280
share something and I think when you're talking about cooperative and competitive forces

2170
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:05,600
But I think in I mean sew on if you feel called, please do share but I'm thinking that that might have been

2171
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:08,400
That might have been our moment

2172
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:12,880
Just leave it with what I'll say. So if you want to share though, please do great. Well

2173
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:16,240
All right, Thor if you're willing

2174
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:18,640
Is it a final?

2175
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:20,960
Just a final piece

2176
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:24,080
Yep final piece and it's kind of a prayer

2177
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:27,280
I'm going to just relate

2178
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,160
That after my first son died

2179
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,040
I gave thanks to him

2180
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:35,040
I gave thanks for his life

2181
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:37,280
I gave thanks for the influence it had on me

2182
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:40,480
And it felt like the sky burned

2183
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:45,280
So when I read that mozo saw the burning bush

2184
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:48,400
I know he was in that

2185
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:50,000
mindset

2186
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,520
To be thankful for the things that we all fear

2187
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:58,480
The things that scare us the things that challenge us

2188
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:05,600
And I've never felt so in awe and so strong in my life as that day

2189
02:57:06,320 --> 02:57:10,560
And that's what I wish for you and all the challenges we face

2190
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:16,400
That you look them in and understand them and give thanks for them

2191
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:22,240
Because we are born in a time where there's good great promise and great challenge

2192
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:26,080
And if you are so blessed

2193
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,880
The sky will burn for you

2194
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:38,560
You

2195
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:08,560
You

2196
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:37,920
You

2197
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:44,240
I was gonna post this in the chat, but

2198
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:49,440
I couldn't find it. I just didn't want to disturb the silence, but

2199
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:54,800
There's a prayer from pema children that she shares

2200
02:58:57,840 --> 02:59:01,920
In her book the places that scare you and she says

2201
02:59:02,080 --> 02:59:06,480
May the roots of all suffering diminish

2202
02:59:08,400 --> 02:59:12,400
May hatred violence addiction and neglect also decrease

2203
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:21,280
And we see all that separates us as as insubstantial as our dreams

2204
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:27,440
May we go to the places that scare us

2205
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:31,200
May you be a warrior of light
