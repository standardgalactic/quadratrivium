Checking Académie des sciences/[Conférence] JL. IMLER - The insect reservoir of diversity for viruses and antiviral mechanisms.txt
1. Jean-Luc presented research on the diversity of antiviral genes in insects, particularly focusing on mosquitoes and tsetse flies. He highlighted that there is a vast array of insect viruses with common origins to human diseases like the plague, yet the variety of genes in insects for immune defense has not been fully explored.

2. He emphasized the importance of the gene naso, which is present in less than 1% of insect genes and possesses strong antiviral effects. The talk outlined the presence of naso in some mosquito species but not all, suggesting that the ecology of these insects might influence their immune gene repertoire.

3. The research involved studying the sensitivity of different pecanavar mosquitoes to Josephila sea virus (JSeV), which revealed variations in their susceptibility despite their close genetic relationships. This indicates that ecological factors may have shaped the immune responses of these insects.

4. Jean-Luc mentioned that a naso counterpart has been found in mosquitoes, although it lacks the sting gene found in other species. The presentation raised questions about the potential antiviral role of the sting gene and the regulation of genes that might mediate its antiviral effect.

5. He also clarified that while HTV (Hop Stunt Virus) is a member of the Luteoviridae family, which typically infects plants and does not replicate in mammalian cells, it is indeed a mosquito virus that persistently infects field populations. The small RNA sequencing approach used in the study allows for the detection of viruses that are actively replicating within the insects.

6. Jean-Luc concluded by suggesting that there is a significant diversity of antiviral and potentially antibacterial genes in insects, which remains largely unexplored and could be an important area for future research.

7. The discussion following the presentation included questions about the potential cross-infection of HTV with other hosts and the ecological interactions between mosquitoes and plants due to their roles as nectar feeders. Jean-Luc's responses highlighted the challenges of metagenomics in identifying virus origins from sequence homology alone and the importance of immune system readouts for confirming active viral replication.
