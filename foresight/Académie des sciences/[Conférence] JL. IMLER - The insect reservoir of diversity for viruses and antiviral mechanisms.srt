1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
So good afternoon everybody. If I can have the first slide. Thank you. So this

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,480
session is entitled Insects and Other Organisms and I will be telling

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,660
you about viruses. So we've seen this slide before so we know there's an

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:34,980
extraordinary diversity of insects and with all sorts of shapes they

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,700
evolved in a long periods of time and we are particularly interested in the

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,940
laboratory in the study of the interaction of these insects with

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,340
infectious agents and having colonized all terrestrial biotopes of course

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,540
insects are exposed to a lot of microbes often the same as we so parasites,

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:05,420
viruses, bacteria and fungi. And the reasons to study their the defense of

10
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,360
insects again infections is mainly free fall so the first reason is that they

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:21,420
are they produce anti bacterial or anti fungal molecules and by studying them we

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,180
can maybe use them as a therapeutic agents or at least by studying their

13
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,940
mode of action we can have ideas about new strategies to counter microbial

14
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,900
infections. Of course we share common ancestors and so we've heard this in the

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,140
the talks yesterday on the use of insects and Josephila as a model so a

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,940
number of genes are conserved and by identifying important genes in Josephila

17
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,340
we can learn things about human genes and the last reason is that a number of

18
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,020
hematophagus insects are vectors for infectious diseases and these insects

19
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,300
are not passive carrier they are themselves infected and so they fight

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,460
these infections with their immune system. So in the laboratory we are mainly

21
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,380
interested in viruses and this is another extremely interesting things about

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,620
insects is that they are host of a large number of viruses and this is a study

23
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,220
that was published a few years ago by the group of young Zeng Zeng at the

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:31,180
Institute of Disease Control in Beijing where they have sequenced 220 animal

25
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,100
species belonging to nine phila and they have identified 1400 viruses and what

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,340
you can see on the slide here is that a lot of these viruses are found in the

27
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,580
atropods and in particular in insects you have a very large number of insects

28
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,540
and if we look at another study that is this time focused on a particular

29
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,820
family of viruses the negative strand are only viruses what you can see is

30
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:07,780
that you have here it was 70 atropod species that were sequenced and they

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,060
identified 112 viruses and you have these viruses here and what you can see

32
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,100
is that insects are actually a reservoir for an extraordinary diversity of

33
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,380
viruses because you see that these viruses are extremely diverse and what

34
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,500
is interesting is that these viruses are at the root of many of the viruses that

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,980
infect other organisms including humans so you can see for example here the flu

36
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,100
virus and you can see that it shares a root with insect viruses you have philo

37
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,740
virus here the same or RNA viruses here as well so it is very relevant to

38
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,180
investigate the interaction of insects with these these viruses and now of

39
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,620
course some of these viruses can be transmitted to mammalian hosts and this

40
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,820
is an old slide that from an article that's related the history of the

41
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,060
identification of new viruses and you can see that a number of these viruses

42
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,380
are atropod born viruses transmitted by by insects and as we have seen since

43
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,100
2013 this was pre Zika for example there are certainly a number of other

44
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:28,900
viruses to to come hence the importance to understand why mosquitoes

45
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,140
transmit viruses and why there are these epidemics some years and then the year

46
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,060
after it's gone and we don't really understand why and so what happens is

47
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,060
that we have the urban cycle here where people get infected and these viruses

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,220
sometimes may spill over from a silvetic circle where they are transmitted to

49
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,460
wild animals and so one of the parameters you we've all heard about the

50
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,420
importance of the microbiome in a number of biological functions and one

51
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,180
component of the microbiome is also that the varum the viruses and a lot of

52
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,700
insects actually are both viruses that we've seen in the previous slides so

53
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,540
hence the question could viruses present persistent viruses present in

54
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,500
mosquitoes be involved in the rate of transmission of insects and so with my

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,380
colleague and friend Joe Marx we started to look into that a few years ago and so

56
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,980
briefly to isolate viruses so the traditional technique is to filtrate

57
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:42,100
sample tissue to grow viruses on tissue culture to use electron microscopy and

58
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,260
each of these techniques are not very sensitive prone to bias you may contaminate

59
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,140
the sample when you you work it and so there is a direct method now which is

60
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,300
just to use high throughput sequencing to identify new sequences and this is what

61
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,580
our Chinese colleagues have done in the papers I mentioned in my introduction

62
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,660
and in this case you isolate RNA you make cDNA synthesis and you do high

63
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,220
throughput sequences and then you compare the sequences you have to data

64
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,020
basis to find if you have a vowel sequences so now I just want to make one

65
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,900
introduction to the immune system of insects again vowel infections and this

66
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,780
is a slide that summarizes the defining that we have made in our lab in

67
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,940
Strasbourg but also a lot of other lab in Europe and the US and elsewhere and so

68
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,620
basically there is a major response to our infections is RNA interference in

69
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,780
insect and basically whatever the virus you can find that they can be targeted

70
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,100
by RNA interference and then there are other genes encoding either restriction

71
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,260
factors or signaling pathways receptors that trigger inducible responses and so

72
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,500
first I will tell you about in connection to this viral analysis about

73
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,460
this first response which is an anti-vial RNA so the principle here is that

74
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,540
when you have so here it's the case of a positive strand RNA virus that answers

75
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,140
the cells the genome of the virus is like a messenger RNA it will be

76
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,420
translated and this will produce the vowel polymerase which is an RNA

77
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,060
polymerase RNA dependent and this enzyme will copy will use the plus strand as a

78
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,020
template to make the anti genome the minus strand and then in turn the minus

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,740
strand will become the template for the polymerase to make the plus trend and in

80
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,820
this intermediate step of replication you have double-stranded RNA that is

81
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,700
generated and this is recognized by the enzyme Dysotoo which is an RNAs free

82
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,660
enzyme and so Dysotoo will bind to the vowel double-stranded RNA and this RNAs

83
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,620
free will cut it and it will generate 21 nucleotide long small interfering

84
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,940
RNAs or SI RNAs and this duplex will then be loaded on another enzyme named

85
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:14,100
agotoo with the help of this RNA binding protein called R2D2 and in agotoo one of

86
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,940
the two strands will be cleaved and discarded and the remaining strand will

87
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,740
remain and act as a guide so it will provide the information that will allow

88
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,980
agotoo to recognize the vowel sequences by base pairing so it's an extremely

89
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,820
adaptive system the recognition of foreign double-stranded RNA will generate a

90
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,140
small RNA that will program the nucleus to degrade the vowel RNAs so and to show

91
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,900
you how robust this is you have here the small RNAs that are generated in two

92
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,300
insects so this is a virus that is called vesicular stomatitis virus it's an

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,420
arbovirus transmitted to vertebrates mainly cattle by insects and here this

94
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,060
is what we obtained in laboratory in the fly this was work that was done a while

95
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,620
ago in collaboration with Carla Salé at the Pasteur Institute and basically what

96
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,460
you have on the first graph here on the top it's the size of the small RNAs so

97
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,140
basically we sequence the small RNAs and you will see that we have a sharp peak

98
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,100
precisely at 21 which is the size produced by the isotope and the second

99
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,620
graph here you have the abscise here is the vowel genome and in blue and red you

100
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,740
have the number of small RNAs that were sequenced in blue when they matched the

101
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,420
plus strand and in red when they matched the minus strand and so basically what

102
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,540
you can see is that the whole genome is covered and you have the same density on

103
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,700
the plus strand and on the minus strand which is exactly what you expect if this

104
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,580
small RNAs were produced from double-stranded RNA and last year we published

105
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,060
with Joe we repeated the same analysis but this time in one of the vectors the

106
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:04,420
natural vectors of VSV which is Lutsomia longipalpis and what you can see is

107
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,020
that the picture is very similar with the sharp peak at 21 and then the

108
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,140
homogenous coverage on the two strands of the genome and so the connection

109
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,060
of this to the varum analysis is that this leaves us with a choice if we want

110
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,340
to identify viruses by RNA sequencing we have the choice between looking at

111
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,860
traditional RNA sequencing where you just take long RNAs and you sequence them

112
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,820
or we can make the choose choice to just sequence these small RNAs in other words

113
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,340
what is produced by the immune system at the advantage of doing this is that then

114
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,260
we look really at viruses that are replicating and that were recognized

115
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,740
as replicating and potentially dangerous by the immune system and so with

116
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:57,620
Joe Marcus we compared with this group in Belo Horizonte in Brazil we compared for

117
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,500
the same samples long RNA sequencing to small RNA sequencing and for most RNAs

118
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,740
as we might expect we get more information by long RNA sequencing than

119
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,780
small RNA sequencing but when it comes to viruses the picture is different and

120
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,300
here you have the size of the vowel contigs that we could assemble from this

121
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,220
sequencing and what you can see is that in these three samples the contigs are

122
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,700
much longer when we do short RNA sequencing compared to long RNA sequencing

123
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,940
and as a result when we try to identify the virus we have a much better

124
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,100
results with the short RNA sequencing so here we have three viruses that were

125
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,940
identified in these samples and here you have the coverage with the long RNA

126
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,860
sec and you can see there are lots of holes it's very incomplete but with the

127
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,900
short RNA sec we basically reconstituted the whole genome showing the promise of

128
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,500
this technique and now I'll show you briefly one application of that and this

129
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:08,380
is again work conducted against under the directorship of Joe so where we

130
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,780
investigated a small city in Minas Gerais Kachinga and where mosquitoes were

131
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:22,180
collected and so a total of more than 700 mosquitoes were collected and

132
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:31,260
32 or 31 of them were sequenced and so basically we identified viruses in these

133
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:39,260
samples so one of them is a physico and physico and like virus a Bunya virus

134
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,900
that was identified some years ago in Southeast Asia so it is present in

135
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,020
Brazil as well the other one had been identified discovered by Joe and his

136
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,620
team a few years before in the neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro and the

137
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,140
third one was a new virus mosquito Kachinga virus and using this technique

138
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:07,060
of small RNA sec now this city of Kachinga was not taken by just by chance

139
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,900
it's in a region that is endemic for for dengue and so now we can ask the

140
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,740
question whether the presence of these virus might have an effect on the

141
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:24,300
transmission of dengue and so far the data that we have is that when you look

142
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,500
at the present the first that the blood of patients that are available so you

143
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:37,100
find dengue in percentage of the of the patients but we don't find the other

144
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,020
viruses indicating that they are present in the mosquitoes but they are not

145
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,700
transmitted or they do not replicate in humans which fits with the fact that we

146
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,220
cannot replicate them and grow them on mammalian cell lines and when you look

147
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,940
at IDES Egypti so you can see first that the prevalence of these viruses is

148
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,500
quite high and by contrast the presence of dengue is quite low it's the

149
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,260
expected what people report in a few percent of the mosquitoes are infected

150
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,860
by by dengue but what is interesting is that if we look at the association of

151
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:15,500
dengue with HTV or PCLV we see a correlation and we see a higher

152
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,900
prevalence of dengue in the mosquitoes that contain HTV this is highly

153
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,060
significant or PCLV even though in this case it's less significant suggesting

154
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,860
of course this is only correlation so now we have to prove this in the

155
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,660
laboratory but suggesting that the presence of these virus persistent

156
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,660
viruses is not neutral and can have an impact on the transmission of dengue

157
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:45,940
and maybe other viruses to humans and so in summary for this first part the

158
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,980
information that we can get about biodiversity through these high

159
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,100
throughput sequencing techniques can help us to understand the dynamics of

160
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,340
vector competence possibly it can help to prevent the outbreaks of novel

161
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,540
viruses because maybe some of the viruses that we identify can become new

162
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,300
threats infecting humans and also when you look at the prevalence of these two

163
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,380
viruses PCLV and HTV this could be one day turned into great vectors for

164
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:20,220
manipulation of mosquitoes so I will now switch to the second part of the the

165
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,340
talk so I've talked to you now mainly on viruses and how they may affect the

166
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,100
immune system of the host and I want now to say a few words about the

167
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:36,060
immune defense of mosquitoes against and of insect against viruses and again I

168
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:42,540
go back to this same slide and so there is the RNA interference and then there

169
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,620
are a number of genes that are induced by infection this is something that we

170
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,460
observed and others observed and a few years ago we decided to investigate one

171
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,620
gene that we call the DDL it doesn't look like anything known and the reason

172
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,700
we were interested in this gene is that as you can see here what you have here is

173
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,780
the expression of this gene in flies infected by different viruses and that

174
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,740
belong to different families and you can see that this gene is induced by four

175
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,940
of the five viruses that are tested here and in particular it's very strongly

176
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,420
induced by SymbiS and VSV here so this is now Josephina and so this was one

177
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,460
reason to be interested in this gene and the other reason was that when we looked

178
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:33,820
at it it's sequence it didn't look like anything that was clearly not

179
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,780
conserved in humans so for a lot of our grant agencies it's not something that

180
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,180
would be dubbed interesting but when we looked at the sequence we first we were

181
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,100
able to crystallize it and get the structure in collaboration with Anna

182
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,500
Houssel in Marseille so it's a new fall it's a secreted protein circulating

183
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,540
protein and but when we looked in the database so here's the

184
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,100
Drosophila protein we found that it was conserved in the genome of several

185
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,500
viruses and not only that it was conserved in granular viruses so like

186
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,740
Bacutovirus in Ascoviruses and even an entomopox virus so this means that this

187
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,900
did not occur once it's known that gene cell genes can be hijacked by viruses

188
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,100
and here this gene was hijacked but only once at multiple times and not only

189
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:31,100
that we also identified a related protein in the venoms of some parasitic

190
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:38,340
wasps which instillate venom together with immunosuppressive substances

191
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:45,300
substances in the larvae in which they inject their eggs so this told us that

192
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,260
this gene there was probably something interesting induced by virus hijacked by

193
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,460
other viruses and so we decided to study infarction in Drosophila and to cut a

194
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,940
long story short I'll just show you the phenotype of the mutant flies so we

195
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,500
generated null mutant flies for a needle and what we found is that these flies

196
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,900
are short-lived and especially when we infect them by one virus in this they

197
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,620
they die rapidly compared to the to the well type interestingly the next thing

198
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,260
we do in these cases is that we look at the valve titer to be usually we expect

199
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,540
that the flies die because they cannot control the virus and there's a lot of

200
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,580
virus replicating and there was not more virus replicating here than here so

201
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,700
the reason the flies die it's not because they do not control the virus and so

202
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,980
then we looked at the transcriptome of these flies we looked at the genes they

203
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,420
expressed and here we had a very striking picture we had a very strong I will

204
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,180
call it here for sake of simplicity inflammatory response so we had a very

205
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,500
strong induction of antimicrobial genes as if these flies were infected by

206
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,220
bacteria and it's known that these antimicrobial peptides many of them are

207
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,300
cationic at high doses they can be they can have toxic effect and all the more

208
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,820
so here because it's persistent it's not a transient response as you would

209
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,220
have in a normal antimicrobial response but these flies mutants for diddle they

210
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,940
make all the time a huge amount of antimicrobial peptides and so we suspected

211
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,420
that this was the reason why they died and so it was easy to prove it because

212
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,980
there are two signaling pathways that regulate expression of these antimicrobial

213
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,500
peptides and one of them the the signature of the genes that we have was

214
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,780
really coming from one of the pathway which is a pathway discovered by Jules

215
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,900
Hoffmann and Bruno LeMette when it was in the lab that is called the immune

216
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:46,620
deficiency pathway and so we combined the the mutation of diddle with IKK gamma

217
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,340
which is a one gene of the pathway but we had the same results with IMD and what

218
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,980
you can see is that when we combine the the little mutation with a mutation of

219
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,340
the IMD pathway we have a spectacular recovery of the flies confirming that

220
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,660
indeed there's nothing wrong with diddle not being there diddle is just there to

221
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,740
control the IMD pathway and if you block the IMD pathway the flies recover so the

222
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,060
bottom line is that this told us that diddle was a suppressor of the IMD

223
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,380
pathway and you can learn a lot of things about immunology by looking at

224
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,620
viruses because viruses when a pathway is bothering them very often they find

225
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,620
a way to neutralize it and in particular by acquiring some genes and so

226
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,740
for example it's known that a lot of gene viruses have suppressors of RNAi others

227
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,460
have suppressors of apoptosis, baculovirus in particular inhibition of

228
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,780
translation and so now we describe that several insect viruses have suppressors

229
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,980
of the IMD pathway so the corollary of this is that the IMD pathway must do

230
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:59,460
something to to viruses and Akira Goto a scientist from the lab looked into that

231
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,540
in detail and he identified a function not for the whole IMD pathway but for

232
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,540
two important genes of the pathway the kinase IKK beta and the NFK-PA-B

233
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,580
transcription factor relish so you can see that when you silence these two

234
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,180
genes there is a strong increase of replication of these speak-on-alike

235
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,460
virus here and so to cut a long story short we identified one gene regulated

236
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:31,060
by IKK beta which is a molecule called sting and that we could prove that sting

237
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,500
acts upstream of IKK beta in this pathway and this is very interesting because

238
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
sting is a very important gene in innate immunity in mammals sting means

239
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,020
stimulator of interferon genes and there are no interference in insects but

240
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:53,260
yet sting is present and we show that it regulates an induced response and so if

241
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,780
there are no interference what are the antiviral genes that are controlled by

242
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:04,940
by distinct pathway and Akira and Kyoshi Yogedo who was a postdoc just looked

243
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:11,860
the undertook a small functional screen for genes regulated by IKK beta and to

244
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,860
find genes that are antiviral and here you have a loss of function screen and

245
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,100
what you can see that we have two genes here at the end when you silence them

246
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,820
there is an increase of our replication just as when you silence the kinase

247
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,780
IKK beta and here it's the opposite it's a gain of function screen so they

248
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,620
overexpress this gene alone and they look if it does something to the virus and

249
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,820
you can see that these two genes also they reduce the virus so one of these two

250
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,980
genes is the factor sting and now I'll finish by mentioning the other genes

251
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,180
this was an unknown gene and so we call it naso which in the Japanese means

252
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,540
enigma and so what is naso this is a protein with a single transmorbent

253
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,540
domain and I call it a Josephila innovation what is the reason this gene

254
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,860
is present in all animals in humans it's called C19 of 12 it has no known

255
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,700
function for the for the moment and the innovation is that in Josephila the gene

256
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,780
has been duplicated and so there are two copies and so one of them we call naso

257
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,940
and the other one that is more closely related to the gene in the other animals

258
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,780
so it's probably the ancestral copy we call father of naso and what is

259
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,500
interesting is that there are a number of species of Josephila for which the

260
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,540
genome has been sequenced and so we can exactly tell when the duplication occurred

261
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,420
and you can see that for example the subgenus Josephila doesn't have the

262
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,780
naso they have the father of naso but they don't have naso whereas the so for

263
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,860
us subgenus have both naso and the father of naso and what is interesting is

264
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,060
that when we over express naso so here it's in stable cell lines so we induce

265
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,100
expression of naso here and here you have the effect on the virus and you can see

266
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,660
that in each of these cell lines each time we induce naso we have a very strong

267
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,460
effect on the the virus we completely nearly completely block the virus but

268
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,940
if we do the same experiments with the father of naso so here we induce the

269
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,420
expression and you can see that we have absolutely no effect so it was a

270
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:19,700
duplication and a newly acquired function and so I believe that this is

271
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,820
something that the insect field can bring it's a very fundamental question

272
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,300
how do you build an immune system and with this gene now naso now we have a

273
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:36,620
very good system to ask how a gene became an immune gene using these

274
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,180
fantastic tools of all the Josephila species for which the genome has been

275
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,740
sequenced and what is really interesting so you have here in bold the ones that

276
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,380
we have now in the laboratory and you can see what is interesting so they all

277
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,220
have sting and the father of naso but then some of them have naso but not

278
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,820
others and what is really interesting is that they here you have their

279
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,220
sensitivity to Josephila sea virus these pecanavars that this pass with targets

280
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,300
you can see that the sensitivity varies and you can see that even though some of

281
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,580
them are very closely related but they differ in their sensitivity and what's

282
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,380
also very interesting is that they differ in their ecology and so we can see

283
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:22,420
how the environment maybe helped to shape the repertoire of immune gene in

284
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,700
these functions and so I will start by this last slide so we have on one hand

285
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:36,180
this tremendous variety of insect viruses with common roots to the

286
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,340
plague humans and then we have on the other hand this fantastic variety of

287
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,860
insects that is not exploited to the moment and genes like naso which is in

288
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,420
the one two percent of gene that are specific to one insect they can have as

289
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,620
I demonstrated some very strong antiviral effect and so basically the

290
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,980
message is that there is a very important diversity of antiviral genes and

291
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,660
maybe also antiviral probably antibacterial antifinal genes in all these

292
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,180
insects and this would could be a very interesting challenge for future study

293
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:15,380
to pinpoint what these genes are and how they work and with this I'll stop and I

294
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,020
thank my co-workers who are listed here and as I mentioned this is collaboration

295
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,900
with the group of Joe who now also has a team in Strasbourg thank you for your

296
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:34,380
attention. Thank you Jean-Luc so we have a couple of minutes for

297
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:44,980
questions. Hi Jean-Luc very nice talk I wonder if you only found the counterpart

298
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:54,100
of naso in mosquitoes. So there is a there is a counterpart of naso in mosquito

299
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:01,700
there is no but there's no sting which is intriguing and so this is one thing

300
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,340
that we would like to know so first in the Jocophila we will focus on the

301
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,460
Jocophila is for that so there are species which have sting but don't have

302
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,340
naso so then the question is is sting antiviral my suspicion is that sting

303
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,140
will be antiviral and then we want to look at what other genes are regulated by

304
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,780
sting and mediate the antiviral effect but in the case of mosquitoes it will be

305
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:31,100
also interesting to see if naso is regulated by infection or not but this

306
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:41,420
we don't know. Please use your microphone. Yes I have a question on the

307
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,540
first part of the talk on the HTV it belongs to little virility it does not

308
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,300
replicate in mammalian cells and it has been well it's not infected in human but

309
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:01,180
it's a group of plant viruses also so I don't know I'm not virologist if they

310
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,620
infect other hosts the the the HTV or the little if there are other little

311
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:14,180
heredity that do not infect non-plant hosts and my question relates to the

312
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,460
ecology of mosquitoes that are linked to plants because they are nectar feeders

313
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:31,060
and and eventually they can also feed on other plants etc so they are dealing

314
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:39,060
with plants. So this is a very good question so what the what the slide was

315
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,460
showing is the the heats you have in the gene bank so one big limitation when

316
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,540
you do metagenomics like that is that in the end you have your sequences and you

317
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:53,020
blast them against the database and it comes back with homology with the

318
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,140
polymerase and so the fact that the polymers comes from or the envelope or

319
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,580
the capsic protein comes from one virus does not mean that the virus is from

320
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:07,620
this this family so this is the the first element. The second element is that

321
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,860
you're perfectly right and this is a big limitation also of metagenomics is that

322
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,020
when you find a sequence does it come from maybe some integrated sequence in

323
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:23,380
the genome does it come from indeed the food that was taken and and so this is

324
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,140
what's interesting with this small RNA sequencing is that we focus on the 21

325
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,860
nucleotide reads which is produced by the immune system so if we detect it it

326
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,980
means that the virus replicates and so indeed there's no doubt that HTV is a

327
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,340
mosquito virus and is replicating and persistent in the mosquito populations

328
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,380
even when they are taken to the lab. Thank you very much Jean-Luc and we have to

329
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,500
move to the next talk and thank you Jean-Luc again.
