0	7440	So good afternoon everybody. If I can have the first slide. Thank you. So this
7440	18480	session is entitled Insects and Other Organisms and I will be telling
18480	26660	you about viruses. So we've seen this slide before so we know there's an
26660	34980	extraordinary diversity of insects and with all sorts of shapes they
34980	42700	evolved in a long periods of time and we are particularly interested in the
42700	45940	laboratory in the study of the interaction of these insects with
45940	52340	infectious agents and having colonized all terrestrial biotopes of course
52340	58540	insects are exposed to a lot of microbes often the same as we so parasites,
58540	65420	viruses, bacteria and fungi. And the reasons to study their the defense of
65420	71360	insects again infections is mainly free fall so the first reason is that they
71360	81420	are they produce anti bacterial or anti fungal molecules and by studying them we
81420	85180	can maybe use them as a therapeutic agents or at least by studying their
85180	91940	mode of action we can have ideas about new strategies to counter microbial
91940	96900	infections. Of course we share common ancestors and so we've heard this in the
96900	101140	the talks yesterday on the use of insects and Josephila as a model so a
101140	105940	number of genes are conserved and by identifying important genes in Josephila
105940	111340	we can learn things about human genes and the last reason is that a number of
111340	117020	hematophagus insects are vectors for infectious diseases and these insects
117020	121300	are not passive carrier they are themselves infected and so they fight
121300	125460	these infections with their immune system. So in the laboratory we are mainly
125460	131380	interested in viruses and this is another extremely interesting things about
131380	136620	insects is that they are host of a large number of viruses and this is a study
136620	143220	that was published a few years ago by the group of young Zeng Zeng at the
143220	151180	Institute of Disease Control in Beijing where they have sequenced 220 animal
151180	158100	species belonging to nine phila and they have identified 1400 viruses and what
158100	162340	you can see on the slide here is that a lot of these viruses are found in the
162340	167580	atropods and in particular in insects you have a very large number of insects
167580	173540	and if we look at another study that is this time focused on a particular
173540	179820	family of viruses the negative strand are only viruses what you can see is
179820	187780	that you have here it was 70 atropod species that were sequenced and they
187780	193060	identified 112 viruses and you have these viruses here and what you can see
193060	198100	is that insects are actually a reservoir for an extraordinary diversity of
198100	202380	viruses because you see that these viruses are extremely diverse and what
202380	207500	is interesting is that these viruses are at the root of many of the viruses that
207500	212980	infect other organisms including humans so you can see for example here the flu
212980	219100	virus and you can see that it shares a root with insect viruses you have philo
219100	225740	virus here the same or RNA viruses here as well so it is very relevant to
225740	231180	investigate the interaction of insects with these these viruses and now of
231180	238620	course some of these viruses can be transmitted to mammalian hosts and this
238740	244820	is an old slide that from an article that's related the history of the
244820	249060	identification of new viruses and you can see that a number of these viruses
249060	256380	are atropod born viruses transmitted by by insects and as we have seen since
256380	262100	2013 this was pre Zika for example there are certainly a number of other
262140	268900	viruses to to come hence the importance to understand why mosquitoes
268900	274140	transmit viruses and why there are these epidemics some years and then the year
274140	280060	after it's gone and we don't really understand why and so what happens is
280060	286060	that we have the urban cycle here where people get infected and these viruses
286500	292220	sometimes may spill over from a silvetic circle where they are transmitted to
292220	298460	wild animals and so one of the parameters you we've all heard about the
298460	303420	importance of the microbiome in a number of biological functions and one
303420	308180	component of the microbiome is also that the varum the viruses and a lot of
308180	312700	insects actually are both viruses that we've seen in the previous slides so
312740	317540	hence the question could viruses present persistent viruses present in
317540	322500	mosquitoes be involved in the rate of transmission of insects and so with my
322500	329380	colleague and friend Joe Marx we started to look into that a few years ago and so
329380	335980	briefly to isolate viruses so the traditional technique is to filtrate
335980	342100	sample tissue to grow viruses on tissue culture to use electron microscopy and
342500	347260	each of these techniques are not very sensitive prone to bias you may contaminate
347260	354140	the sample when you you work it and so there is a direct method now which is
354140	358300	just to use high throughput sequencing to identify new sequences and this is what
358300	363580	our Chinese colleagues have done in the papers I mentioned in my introduction
363580	369660	and in this case you isolate RNA you make cDNA synthesis and you do high
369700	373220	throughput sequences and then you compare the sequences you have to data
373220	378020	basis to find if you have a vowel sequences so now I just want to make one
378020	382900	introduction to the immune system of insects again vowel infections and this
382900	387780	is a slide that summarizes the defining that we have made in our lab in
387780	393940	Strasbourg but also a lot of other lab in Europe and the US and elsewhere and so
393940	399620	basically there is a major response to our infections is RNA interference in
399820	404780	insect and basically whatever the virus you can find that they can be targeted
404780	411100	by RNA interference and then there are other genes encoding either restriction
411100	417260	factors or signaling pathways receptors that trigger inducible responses and so
417260	421500	first I will tell you about in connection to this viral analysis about
421500	428460	this first response which is an anti-vial RNA so the principle here is that
428460	433540	when you have so here it's the case of a positive strand RNA virus that answers
433540	438140	the cells the genome of the virus is like a messenger RNA it will be
438140	442420	translated and this will produce the vowel polymerase which is an RNA
442420	448060	polymerase RNA dependent and this enzyme will copy will use the plus strand as a
448060	454020	template to make the anti genome the minus strand and then in turn the minus
454020	458740	strand will become the template for the polymerase to make the plus trend and in
458740	462820	this intermediate step of replication you have double-stranded RNA that is
462820	468700	generated and this is recognized by the enzyme Dysotoo which is an RNAs free
468700	474660	enzyme and so Dysotoo will bind to the vowel double-stranded RNA and this RNAs
474660	480620	free will cut it and it will generate 21 nucleotide long small interfering
480620	486940	RNAs or SI RNAs and this duplex will then be loaded on another enzyme named
486940	494100	agotoo with the help of this RNA binding protein called R2D2 and in agotoo one of
494100	498940	the two strands will be cleaved and discarded and the remaining strand will
498940	504740	remain and act as a guide so it will provide the information that will allow
504740	508980	agotoo to recognize the vowel sequences by base pairing so it's an extremely
509020	513820	adaptive system the recognition of foreign double-stranded RNA will generate a
513820	520140	small RNA that will program the nucleus to degrade the vowel RNAs so and to show
520140	528900	you how robust this is you have here the small RNAs that are generated in two
528900	533300	insects so this is a virus that is called vesicular stomatitis virus it's an
533300	540420	arbovirus transmitted to vertebrates mainly cattle by insects and here this
540420	544060	is what we obtained in laboratory in the fly this was work that was done a while
544060	548620	ago in collaboration with Carla Sal√© at the Pasteur Institute and basically what
548620	552460	you have on the first graph here on the top it's the size of the small RNAs so
552460	557140	basically we sequence the small RNAs and you will see that we have a sharp peak
557300	563100	precisely at 21 which is the size produced by the isotope and the second
563100	570620	graph here you have the abscise here is the vowel genome and in blue and red you
570620	574740	have the number of small RNAs that were sequenced in blue when they matched the
574740	578420	plus strand and in red when they matched the minus strand and so basically what
578420	582540	you can see is that the whole genome is covered and you have the same density on
582540	586700	the plus strand and on the minus strand which is exactly what you expect if this
586700	592580	small RNAs were produced from double-stranded RNA and last year we published
592580	597060	with Joe we repeated the same analysis but this time in one of the vectors the
597060	604420	natural vectors of VSV which is Lutsomia longipalpis and what you can see is
604420	609020	that the picture is very similar with the sharp peak at 21 and then the
609020	615140	homogenous coverage on the two strands of the genome and so the connection
615140	620060	of this to the varum analysis is that this leaves us with a choice if we want
620060	625340	to identify viruses by RNA sequencing we have the choice between looking at
625340	629860	traditional RNA sequencing where you just take long RNAs and you sequence them
629860	635820	or we can make the choose choice to just sequence these small RNAs in other words
635820	640340	what is produced by the immune system at the advantage of doing this is that then
640340	644260	we look really at viruses that are replicating and that were recognized
644260	649740	as replicating and potentially dangerous by the immune system and so with
649740	657620	Joe Marcus we compared with this group in Belo Horizonte in Brazil we compared for
657620	663500	the same samples long RNA sequencing to small RNA sequencing and for most RNAs
663500	668740	as we might expect we get more information by long RNA sequencing than
668740	672780	small RNA sequencing but when it comes to viruses the picture is different and
672820	677300	here you have the size of the vowel contigs that we could assemble from this
677300	682220	sequencing and what you can see is that in these three samples the contigs are
682220	686700	much longer when we do short RNA sequencing compared to long RNA sequencing
686700	691940	and as a result when we try to identify the virus we have a much better
691940	698100	results with the short RNA sequencing so here we have three viruses that were
698140	702940	identified in these samples and here you have the coverage with the long RNA
702940	706860	sec and you can see there are lots of holes it's very incomplete but with the
706860	713900	short RNA sec we basically reconstituted the whole genome showing the promise of
713900	719500	this technique and now I'll show you briefly one application of that and this
719540	728380	is again work conducted against under the directorship of Joe so where we
728380	735780	investigated a small city in Minas Gerais Kachinga and where mosquitoes were
735780	742180	collected and so a total of more than 700 mosquitoes were collected and
742540	751260	32 or 31 of them were sequenced and so basically we identified viruses in these
751260	759260	samples so one of them is a physico and physico and like virus a Bunya virus
759260	764900	that was identified some years ago in Southeast Asia so it is present in
764900	770020	Brazil as well the other one had been identified discovered by Joe and his
770060	774620	team a few years before in the neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro and the
774620	781140	third one was a new virus mosquito Kachinga virus and using this technique
781140	787060	of small RNA sec now this city of Kachinga was not taken by just by chance
787060	792900	it's in a region that is endemic for for dengue and so now we can ask the
792900	795740	question whether the presence of these virus might have an effect on the
795740	804300	transmission of dengue and so far the data that we have is that when you look
804300	810500	at the present the first that the blood of patients that are available so you
810500	817100	find dengue in percentage of the of the patients but we don't find the other
817100	820020	viruses indicating that they are present in the mosquitoes but they are not
820020	824700	transmitted or they do not replicate in humans which fits with the fact that we
824740	830220	cannot replicate them and grow them on mammalian cell lines and when you look
830220	834940	at IDES Egypti so you can see first that the prevalence of these viruses is
834940	839500	quite high and by contrast the presence of dengue is quite low it's the
839500	843260	expected what people report in a few percent of the mosquitoes are infected
843260	847860	by by dengue but what is interesting is that if we look at the association of
848020	855500	dengue with HTV or PCLV we see a correlation and we see a higher
855500	861900	prevalence of dengue in the mosquitoes that contain HTV this is highly
861900	867060	significant or PCLV even though in this case it's less significant suggesting
867060	869860	of course this is only correlation so now we have to prove this in the
869860	873660	laboratory but suggesting that the presence of these virus persistent
873660	878660	viruses is not neutral and can have an impact on the transmission of dengue
878660	885940	and maybe other viruses to humans and so in summary for this first part the
885940	888980	information that we can get about biodiversity through these high
888980	894100	throughput sequencing techniques can help us to understand the dynamics of
894100	899340	vector competence possibly it can help to prevent the outbreaks of novel
899340	903540	viruses because maybe some of the viruses that we identify can become new
903540	908300	threats infecting humans and also when you look at the prevalence of these two
908300	913380	viruses PCLV and HTV this could be one day turned into great vectors for
913380	920220	manipulation of mosquitoes so I will now switch to the second part of the the
920220	924340	talk so I've talked to you now mainly on viruses and how they may affect the
924340	929100	immune system of the host and I want now to say a few words about the
929100	936060	immune defense of mosquitoes against and of insect against viruses and again I
936060	942540	go back to this same slide and so there is the RNA interference and then there
942540	946620	are a number of genes that are induced by infection this is something that we
946620	951460	observed and others observed and a few years ago we decided to investigate one
951460	958620	gene that we call the DDL it doesn't look like anything known and the reason
958620	962700	we were interested in this gene is that as you can see here what you have here is
962700	967780	the expression of this gene in flies infected by different viruses and that
967780	971740	belong to different families and you can see that this gene is induced by four
971740	975940	of the five viruses that are tested here and in particular it's very strongly
975940	982420	induced by SymbiS and VSV here so this is now Josephina and so this was one
982420	987460	reason to be interested in this gene and the other reason was that when we looked
987460	993820	at it it's sequence it didn't look like anything that was clearly not
993820	997780	conserved in humans so for a lot of our grant agencies it's not something that
997780	1003180	would be dubbed interesting but when we looked at the sequence we first we were
1003180	1008100	able to crystallize it and get the structure in collaboration with Anna
1008100	1012500	Houssel in Marseille so it's a new fall it's a secreted protein circulating
1012500	1017540	protein and but when we looked in the database so here's the
1017540	1022100	Drosophila protein we found that it was conserved in the genome of several
1022100	1027500	viruses and not only that it was conserved in granular viruses so like
1027500	1032740	Bacutovirus in Ascoviruses and even an entomopox virus so this means that this
1032740	1038900	did not occur once it's known that gene cell genes can be hijacked by viruses
1039500	1045100	and here this gene was hijacked but only once at multiple times and not only
1045100	1051100	that we also identified a related protein in the venoms of some parasitic
1051100	1058340	wasps which instillate venom together with immunosuppressive substances
1058340	1065300	substances in the larvae in which they inject their eggs so this told us that
1065300	1069260	this gene there was probably something interesting induced by virus hijacked by
1069260	1075460	other viruses and so we decided to study infarction in Drosophila and to cut a
1075460	1078940	long story short I'll just show you the phenotype of the mutant flies so we
1078940	1084500	generated null mutant flies for a needle and what we found is that these flies
1084500	1088900	are short-lived and especially when we infect them by one virus in this they
1088900	1095620	they die rapidly compared to the to the well type interestingly the next thing
1095620	1100260	we do in these cases is that we look at the valve titer to be usually we expect
1100260	1103540	that the flies die because they cannot control the virus and there's a lot of
1103540	1108580	virus replicating and there was not more virus replicating here than here so
1108580	1112700	the reason the flies die it's not because they do not control the virus and so
1112700	1115980	then we looked at the transcriptome of these flies we looked at the genes they
1116020	1121420	expressed and here we had a very striking picture we had a very strong I will
1121420	1126180	call it here for sake of simplicity inflammatory response so we had a very
1126180	1131500	strong induction of antimicrobial genes as if these flies were infected by
1131500	1136220	bacteria and it's known that these antimicrobial peptides many of them are
1136220	1141300	cationic at high doses they can be they can have toxic effect and all the more
1141300	1145820	so here because it's persistent it's not a transient response as you would
1145860	1150220	have in a normal antimicrobial response but these flies mutants for diddle they
1150220	1155940	make all the time a huge amount of antimicrobial peptides and so we suspected
1155940	1160420	that this was the reason why they died and so it was easy to prove it because
1160420	1165980	there are two signaling pathways that regulate expression of these antimicrobial
1165980	1170500	peptides and one of them the the signature of the genes that we have was
1170500	1175780	really coming from one of the pathway which is a pathway discovered by Jules
1175780	1178900	Hoffmann and Bruno LeMette when it was in the lab that is called the immune
1178900	1186620	deficiency pathway and so we combined the the mutation of diddle with IKK gamma
1186620	1191340	which is a one gene of the pathway but we had the same results with IMD and what
1191340	1195980	you can see is that when we combine the the little mutation with a mutation of
1195980	1200340	the IMD pathway we have a spectacular recovery of the flies confirming that
1200340	1204660	indeed there's nothing wrong with diddle not being there diddle is just there to
1204660	1210740	control the IMD pathway and if you block the IMD pathway the flies recover so the
1210740	1216060	bottom line is that this told us that diddle was a suppressor of the IMD
1216060	1220380	pathway and you can learn a lot of things about immunology by looking at
1220380	1225620	viruses because viruses when a pathway is bothering them very often they find
1225620	1231620	a way to neutralize it and in particular by acquiring some genes and so
1231620	1235740	for example it's known that a lot of gene viruses have suppressors of RNAi others
1235740	1240460	have suppressors of apoptosis, baculovirus in particular inhibition of
1240460	1245780	translation and so now we describe that several insect viruses have suppressors
1245780	1250980	of the IMD pathway so the corollary of this is that the IMD pathway must do
1250980	1259460	something to to viruses and Akira Goto a scientist from the lab looked into that
1259460	1265540	in detail and he identified a function not for the whole IMD pathway but for
1265540	1270540	two important genes of the pathway the kinase IKK beta and the NFK-PA-B
1270540	1273580	transcription factor relish so you can see that when you silence these two
1273580	1277180	genes there is a strong increase of replication of these speak-on-alike
1277180	1284460	virus here and so to cut a long story short we identified one gene regulated
1284460	1291060	by IKK beta which is a molecule called sting and that we could prove that sting
1291060	1295500	acts upstream of IKK beta in this pathway and this is very interesting because
1295500	1300500	sting is a very important gene in innate immunity in mammals sting means
1300500	1307020	stimulator of interferon genes and there are no interference in insects but
1307020	1313260	yet sting is present and we show that it regulates an induced response and so if
1313260	1316780	there are no interference what are the antiviral genes that are controlled by
1316780	1324940	by distinct pathway and Akira and Kyoshi Yogedo who was a postdoc just looked
1324940	1331860	the undertook a small functional screen for genes regulated by IKK beta and to
1331860	1335860	find genes that are antiviral and here you have a loss of function screen and
1335860	1339100	what you can see that we have two genes here at the end when you silence them
1339100	1342820	there is an increase of our replication just as when you silence the kinase
1342820	1346780	IKK beta and here it's the opposite it's a gain of function screen so they
1346780	1350620	overexpress this gene alone and they look if it does something to the virus and
1350620	1354820	you can see that these two genes also they reduce the virus so one of these two
1354820	1359980	genes is the factor sting and now I'll finish by mentioning the other genes
1359980	1366180	this was an unknown gene and so we call it naso which in the Japanese means
1366180	1370540	enigma and so what is naso this is a protein with a single transmorbent
1370540	1376540	domain and I call it a Josephila innovation what is the reason this gene
1376540	1380860	is present in all animals in humans it's called C19 of 12 it has no known
1380860	1385700	function for the for the moment and the innovation is that in Josephila the gene
1385700	1390780	has been duplicated and so there are two copies and so one of them we call naso
1390780	1396940	and the other one that is more closely related to the gene in the other animals
1396940	1402780	so it's probably the ancestral copy we call father of naso and what is
1402780	1406500	interesting is that there are a number of species of Josephila for which the
1406500	1410540	genome has been sequenced and so we can exactly tell when the duplication occurred
1410540	1416420	and you can see that for example the subgenus Josephila doesn't have the
1416420	1420780	naso they have the father of naso but they don't have naso whereas the so for
1420780	1425860	us subgenus have both naso and the father of naso and what is interesting is
1425860	1431060	that when we over express naso so here it's in stable cell lines so we induce
1431060	1435100	expression of naso here and here you have the effect on the virus and you can see
1435100	1438660	that in each of these cell lines each time we induce naso we have a very strong
1438660	1443460	effect on the the virus we completely nearly completely block the virus but
1443460	1448940	if we do the same experiments with the father of naso so here we induce the
1448940	1452420	expression and you can see that we have absolutely no effect so it was a
1452460	1459700	duplication and a newly acquired function and so I believe that this is
1459700	1463820	something that the insect field can bring it's a very fundamental question
1463820	1468300	how do you build an immune system and with this gene now naso now we have a
1468300	1476620	very good system to ask how a gene became an immune gene using these
1476620	1481180	fantastic tools of all the Josephila species for which the genome has been
1481300	1484740	sequenced and what is really interesting so you have here in bold the ones that
1484740	1488380	we have now in the laboratory and you can see what is interesting so they all
1488380	1493220	have sting and the father of naso but then some of them have naso but not
1493220	1498820	others and what is really interesting is that they here you have their
1498820	1503220	sensitivity to Josephila sea virus these pecanavars that this pass with targets
1503220	1508300	you can see that the sensitivity varies and you can see that even though some of
1508300	1512580	them are very closely related but they differ in their sensitivity and what's
1512580	1516380	also very interesting is that they differ in their ecology and so we can see
1516380	1522420	how the environment maybe helped to shape the repertoire of immune gene in
1522420	1527700	these functions and so I will start by this last slide so we have on one hand
1527700	1536180	this tremendous variety of insect viruses with common roots to the
1536740	1541340	plague humans and then we have on the other hand this fantastic variety of
1541340	1546860	insects that is not exploited to the moment and genes like naso which is in
1546860	1552420	the one two percent of gene that are specific to one insect they can have as
1552420	1555620	I demonstrated some very strong antiviral effect and so basically the
1555620	1560980	message is that there is a very important diversity of antiviral genes and
1560980	1564660	maybe also antiviral probably antibacterial antifinal genes in all these
1564700	1569180	insects and this would could be a very interesting challenge for future study
1569180	1575380	to pinpoint what these genes are and how they work and with this I'll stop and I
1575380	1580020	thank my co-workers who are listed here and as I mentioned this is collaboration
1580020	1584900	with the group of Joe who now also has a team in Strasbourg thank you for your
1584900	1594380	attention. Thank you Jean-Luc so we have a couple of minutes for
1594380	1604980	questions. Hi Jean-Luc very nice talk I wonder if you only found the counterpart
1604980	1614100	of naso in mosquitoes. So there is a there is a counterpart of naso in mosquito
1614300	1621700	there is no but there's no sting which is intriguing and so this is one thing
1621700	1627340	that we would like to know so first in the Jocophila we will focus on the
1627340	1631460	Jocophila is for that so there are species which have sting but don't have
1631460	1635340	naso so then the question is is sting antiviral my suspicion is that sting
1635340	1641140	will be antiviral and then we want to look at what other genes are regulated by
1641180	1644780	sting and mediate the antiviral effect but in the case of mosquitoes it will be
1644780	1651100	also interesting to see if naso is regulated by infection or not but this
1651100	1661420	we don't know. Please use your microphone. Yes I have a question on the
1661420	1667540	first part of the talk on the HTV it belongs to little virility it does not
1667700	1674300	replicate in mammalian cells and it has been well it's not infected in human but
1674300	1681180	it's a group of plant viruses also so I don't know I'm not virologist if they
1681180	1687620	infect other hosts the the the HTV or the little if there are other little
1687620	1694180	heredity that do not infect non-plant hosts and my question relates to the
1694940	1699460	ecology of mosquitoes that are linked to plants because they are nectar feeders
1699460	1711060	and and eventually they can also feed on other plants etc so they are dealing
1711060	1719060	with plants. So this is a very good question so what the what the slide was
1719060	1723460	showing is the the heats you have in the gene bank so one big limitation when
1723460	1726540	you do metagenomics like that is that in the end you have your sequences and you
1726540	1733020	blast them against the database and it comes back with homology with the
1733020	1737140	polymerase and so the fact that the polymers comes from or the envelope or
1737140	1740580	the capsic protein comes from one virus does not mean that the virus is from
1740580	1747620	this this family so this is the the first element. The second element is that
1747620	1752860	you're perfectly right and this is a big limitation also of metagenomics is that
1752860	1757020	when you find a sequence does it come from maybe some integrated sequence in
1757020	1763380	the genome does it come from indeed the food that was taken and and so this is
1763380	1767140	what's interesting with this small RNA sequencing is that we focus on the 21
1767140	1770860	nucleotide reads which is produced by the immune system so if we detect it it
1770860	1774980	means that the virus replicates and so indeed there's no doubt that HTV is a
1774980	1780340	mosquito virus and is replicating and persistent in the mosquito populations
1780340	1785380	even when they are taken to the lab. Thank you very much Jean-Luc and we have to
1785380	1789500	move to the next talk and thank you Jean-Luc again.
