00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm talking this evening about Morphic Resonance, which is one of my favourite themes, but I haven't talked about it here at Holyhock for at least 10 years, because I've talked about other things.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But some of you are familiar with the idea, some of you are not. So first I'm going to give a very brief summary of the idea of Morphic Resonance, then I'm going to talk about some of its implications.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Particularly implications that affect us, you know, as in our lives and our normal lives.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Morphic resonance is the idea that there's a kind of memory in nature. The so-called laws of nature are more like habits. Each species has a collective memory, and in the human realm that collective memory is more or less what Jung called the collective unconscious.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And this process of memory works through resonance from the past to the present on the basis of similarity, like on like, across space and time.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This theory has many, many implications. Perhaps one of the most startling is that our own memories are not stored inside our brains, as commonly assumed, but rather we tune into them.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Our brains are more like tuning systems, more like TVs than like video recorders. I'll come back to that in a moment, but this is just to give the brief overview.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, the idea of Morphic resonance memory in nature is rather shocking in Western science. Indeed, it's been proclaimed a heresy by some scientific authorities because it goes against the usual assumptions of Western science, which are that nature is governed by fixed eternal laws.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And this idea of fixed eternal laws goes back a very long way. Pythagoras in ancient Greece had the idea that there was an eternal reality which this reality reflects.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In fact, all the ancient Greek philosophers thought that there was an eternal reality that this changing world was a reflection of.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They had different theories about what the eternal reality was, and Pythagoras thought it was mathematics, numbers, ratios, proportions, harmonies, and he thought that the mathematical realm was the truly real realm, and everything in this world was a reflection of it.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Plato generalised Pythagoras' idea to say it's not just mathematics that's eternal, it's the whole realm of forms and ideas, the shapes of everything, red cedars, horses, cats, hedgehogs, everything in nature has an eternal form or archetype in a transcendent realm beyond space and time, the realm of platonic forms or ideas.

13
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And in the beginning of the 17th century, when the scientific revolution got going, the founding fathers of modern science were all believers in this kind of platonic Pythagorean cosmology.

14
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They thought that the laws of nature were mathematical, that they were discovering the mathematical principles of nature which were ideas in the mind of God, that for them God was a mathematician.

15
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mathematicians very much like the idea that God's a mathematician because it means that they're the closest of all humans to the divine, and also automatically a kind of priesthood because most of us don't understand much maths, and that means that mathematicians have this privileged role in our society.

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So they all like that idea, right up to the present. Your most hard-nosed atheistic physicist is usually a secret Platonist. So the idea that all the laws of nature are eternal, that nature is governed by fixed laws, is really built into the foundations of western thought.

17
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's not built into the foundations of eastern thought. In Hinduism and Buddhism it's taken for granted there's a kind of memory in nature.

18
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And when I came up with the idea of morphic resonance, I was working at Cambridge doing research on plant development, and I came up with this idea in terms of understanding the inheritance of form in plants and animals.

19
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I didn't come up with it by studying eastern philosophy. I hadn't studied eastern philosophy. But when I then later went to work in India, I spent seven years in India, when I explained morphic resonance to my Hindu friends, most of them were deeply unimpressed.

20
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They said, oh, this is an ancient idea. Rishis said this thousands of years ago and stuff. And they just thought, what's new? We've heard all this before. Whereas in Cambridge, when I talked about the idea, there was shock and horror in the scientific realm.

21
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, I think that actually, although western science has been based on this eternal law principle, it's in a state of crisis. Until 1966, most scientists thought the universe was eternal, and having an eternal universe governed by eternal laws made sense.

22
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Since 1966, we've had the big bang cosmology. The whole universe started very small, less than the size of a head of a pin. It's been expanding and cooling ever since. And as it grows and cools, new forms and structures appear within it.

23
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's much more like a developing organism than like an eternal machine.

24
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So in this evolving universe that we live in, according to modern cosmology, everything evolves. But they've still gone on with the idea that the laws of nature are fixed.

25
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So they assume that all the laws of nature were all there in place like a kind of Napoleonic code at the very moment of the big bang.

26
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They don't explain how they got there. Many scientists are atheists, so they just assume that there were these free-floating laws that were somehow there, or which came into being with the universe itself, together with all the matter and energy in the universe.

27
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And as my friend Terence McKenna would like to say, modern science is based on the principle, give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest.

28
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And one free miracle is the appearance of all the laws of nature and all the matter and energy in the universe from nothing in a single instant, for no reason.

29
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Anyway, we now have this radically evolving cosmos.

30
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And most scientists assume that all the laws were there at the beginning and then they have endless debates about why were the laws exactly as they were and not otherwise.

31
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then there's a huge debate in modern cosmology.

32
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
One lot of people say, well, if they're exactly right for the universe that's just right for us and there could have been billions of alternative universes, then there must have been an intelligent designer,

33
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
a kind of external engineering god who fine-tuned all the laws and constants so it was just right for us before pressing the start button.

34
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And that's one view, a kind of external mechanistic god.

35
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The other view to avoid an external mechanistic god is to say there are billions of actrillions or quadrillions of actual universes.

36
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We just happen to live in the one that's right for us and all the others actually exist.

37
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And when I asked one of the opponents of this, this very extravagant hypothesis, contravening Occam's razor, the principle you should have the minimum number of entities in an explanation.

38
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I said this is the ultimate violation of Occam's razor, quadrillions of universes for which there's not a shred of evidence.

39
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I said, why on earth can you believe in that?

40
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He said, well, this way we can get rid of God.

41
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But as theologians have pointed out, it doesn't even get rid of God because an infinite God would be the God of an infinite number of universes, or could be.

42
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So anyway, they locked into this debate, the universe versus the multiverse and seminars and conferences and learned discussions go on in universities about this.

43
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All based on the assumption the laws were fixed at the beginning.

44
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But if we're in a radically evolutionary universe, why should the laws be fixed at the beginning?

45
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If they're laws at all, why shouldn't they be more like common law in the English and American system depending on precedents?

46
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And in fact, why shouldn't they be more like habits?

47
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The minute you think about the idea of laws of nature, you realise that is deeply anthropomorphic concept.

48
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Only humans have laws and only civilised humans have laws. In fact, tribes have customs.

49
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So the idea of laws of nature is a very peculiar idea the more you think about it. Habits makes much more sense.

50
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And that's what I've been saying since I put forward the idea of morphic resonance in 1981 for the first time.

51
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Since then cosmologists, including Lee Smolin, who's a theoretical physicist, have indeed started talking about the habits of nature and they are coming round to this idea.

52
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But I mean they'll have to come round to it because it just doesn't make sense to have this hangover from the old platonic cosmology sort of tacked on to and evolve a radically evolutionary world view.

53
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, this way of looking at nature provides a very different interpretation of many physical phenomena.

54
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, when you crystallise a new chemical for the very first time, according to the standard view, the way it forms is already predetermined by the laws of electromagnetism, quantum physics, thermodynamics, etc.

55
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And in principle you should be able to predict the form of the crystal in practice you can't, it's too complicated.

56
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But in principle you should and the first time it forms and the millionth time and the billionth time it should be exactly the same because the laws are the same at all times and in all places.

57
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
According to morphic resonance, the first time you make the crystal it may take a long time for the new crystal form to come into being.

58
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And when you make it repeatedly over and over again in labs all around the world, a new habit builds up and the crystal should form, crystallise more easily.

59
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And that's exactly what chemists find, crystals get easier and easier to crystallise.

60
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But of course they don't explain it in terms of morphic resonance, they explain it in terms of firstly anecdotes about chemists carrying seeds or nuclei, little bits of previous crystals around the world on their beards or clothing.

61
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And or secondly in terms of dust particles from previous crystals being wafted around the world in the atmosphere.

62
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What I'm saying is that this should happen even when bearded chemists are excluded and when the dust is filtered from the atmosphere.

63
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And also this theory predicts the melting points of crystals which are called physical constants should go up as time goes on because the crystals get more stable through morphic resonance.

64
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The form becomes more habitual and therefore it should be harder to break the form down. You'd need a higher temperature to do it.

65
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And actually the melting points of new compounds do go up sometimes by 10, 20 degrees. I've studied this with hundreds of chemicals.

66
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And most chemists simply they have to acknowledge the fact that this is happening even though these are supposed to be physical constants.

67
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But they say oh it's just because we get better at making the crystals and their pure samples and pure samples have higher melting points.

68
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But it's incredibly difficult to get them to test this hypothesis. It's already been tested through everyday practice of chemistry but the facts fit very well with morphic resonance.

69
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In the realm of animal behaviour there's a well-known example of rats. A long series of experiments at Harvard, Edinburgh and Melbourne University in Australia showed that when you train rats to learn a new trick escaping from a water maze the more rats that learned it the easier it got for other rats to learn it even in other parts of the world.

70
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And this wasn't just rats that were descended from trained rats who might have inherited this epigenetically but it was all rats of that breed even ones whose parents had never been in a water maze before.

71
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Now I think the same is happening in the human realm. I think it's getting easier to learn things other people have already learned. There's already lots of evidence for this.

72
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:30,000
IQ tests for example have got at least 30% the scores on average scores on intelligence tests have got at least 30% higher over the last decade so over throughout the 20th century ever since they were invented in 1918.

73
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's no independent evidence that people are getting smarter. If anything they're not doing as well on other exams you know because of dumbing down effects of TV etc low attention spans.

74
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think they're getting the IQ scores are going up because so many people have done the same tests they get easier to do.

75
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And I would predict that wordle should be getting easier to do throughout the day from the moment it's published in the morning throughout the day as it goes on and every single day there's a new wordle puzzle.

76
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I would predict if you could get access to the data that there would be an increasing rate of score throughout the day.

77
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I first got onto this through people writing and telling me in the 1980s that they find the times crossword puzzle easier to do if they did it in the evening or the next day.

78
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And some people had noticed this anyway. They left it till the evening to do it. It was more satisfying to be able to succeed with more clues.

79
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And so I think Morphic Residence is working in these very practical things.

80
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:49,000
When I thought of testing using wordle as a test the very day I thought of it I wrote to the inventor of wordle but that very day it was bought by the New York Times.

81
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And so I tried to get the New York Times to let me see the data and I thought cold calling New York Times wasn't going to work.

82
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So one of Merlin's friends is an editor at the New York Times. So through Merlin's friend I got access to the head of games at the New York Times and asked her if we could look at the data from the point of view of seeing if this was really happening.

83
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And she was terrible spoilsport. She just wrote back saying the games department are not interested in this project at this time.

84
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So unfortunately they've got all this data and it's can't get hands on it but there's something called chordle and octordle and what are the other ones children.

85
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There's all these other versions of wordle which may be more accessible for looking at the data.

86
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm going to try and get in touch with them when I get back to England.

87
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So I think that there have already been quite a number of experiments on learning. Morphic resonance facilitated learning.

88
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And it should affect learning. It should be easier to learn things lots of people have learned and the more that learn it the easier it should get.

89
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And this should apply to skateboarding, snowboarding, windsurfing, you know all these new physical skills as well as mental skills.

90
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And when I talk to people in those areas of activity many of them say yes indeed people are getting easier to teach.

91
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But the trouble is you can't disentangle better equipment designs, training videos etc from Morphic resonance.

92
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So it's hard to use that as evidence. One needs more special situations and wordle would be really good for this.

93
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So this hypothesis is still controversial and many scientists are scared of it really because it would overthrow so much of established science.

94
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Actually business as usual could still go on because if a habit is strongly enough established it behaves almost as if it's governed by an eternal law.

95
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The habits of hydrogen atoms which have been going on for 13 billion years probably you hardly tell the difference from an eternal law.

96
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But when something is new that's when you notice the difference and that's why to test Morphic resonance you have to look at new patterns of behaviour, new forms of animals, new chemicals, new crystals etc.

97
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Now this has many implications in different realms of science and one is for inheritance in biology.

98
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Living organisms inherit a great deal from their ancestors and the usual assumption is that this is genetic.

99
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Many people use the words hereditary and genetic as synonyms.

100
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If it's inherited it must be in the DNA. DNA is a chemical molecule and we know what DNA does.

101
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It enables cells to make proteins by spelling out the sequence of amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins which are strings of amino acids which then fold up.

102
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But DNA spells out the sequence of amino acids in the primary string within a protein.

103
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well that's what it does and some DNA controls the activity of other DNA switches on and off genes.

104
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But making the right proteins doesn't equate to the shape of your face or your arms or your legs it just enables you to have the right proteins.

105
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's rather like saying having the right building materials would explain a house or a cabin.

106
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It doesn't. You have to have them to build the house or cabin but the architectural plan is not in the genes or in the building materials or in the DNA.

107
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And I think that it's inherited through morphic resonance through the forms of previous organisms.

108
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:15,000
When the human genome project was completed in 2000 the assumption was that they'd soon be able to predict all details of human beings based on the genome and that you could patent genes and that you'd be able to predict exactly which diseases people would get with great accuracy and so on.

109
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It turned out not to work out that way at all. Soon after the human genome was sequenced there was the share price of these genome sequencing companies collapsed.

110
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Celera genomics, the private genome company headed by Craig Venter, collapsed from $64 a share to about $0.15 and shortly afterwards when interviewed Craig Venter said I'm a guy who's made a million the hard way by working my way down from a billion and it turned out to be almost useless.

111
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:13,000
By 2008 it had become clear in biology that there was a major problem called the missing heritability problem that if you knew all the genes of a person you could predict the likelihood of breast cancer or schizophrenia or something like that

112
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:28,000
with an accuracy of less than 10% with schizophrenia is about 3% even for height which is a fairly obvious physical characteristic you can only explain about 10% in terms of genes.

113
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So where's all the rest of the inheritance coming from and this is called within biology the missing heritability problem. Part of it I think is due to epigenetics which is the inheritance of acquired characters.

114
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Those of you who were at school or university in the 20th century will know that this was the biggest taboo in biology, the inheritance of acquired characters, the marking inheritance.

115
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It was really bad if anyone believed in that and there was sort of hissing noises and stuff and it was just the worst heresy in biology. It's now mainstream, it definitely happens, it's been rebranded epigenetic inheritance and it's one of the hottest areas of biological research.

116
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I think quite a bit of it depends on morphic resonance. So the whole subject of heredity and evolution is now up for grabs in a way that didn't seem very likely in the 20th century when neo Darwinism based on selfish genes was the dominant theory.

117
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There's now extended evolutionary synthesis which is a much broader theory of evolution that's not just based on genes but on epigenetics, on cultural inheritance, on the ability of organisms to modify their environment, much broader and more inclusive theory than this narrow and rather shrill neo Darwinism that many of us grew up with.

118
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is now mainstream, the extended evolutionary synthesis, there's papers in nature on it, there's papers in science and all the main journals and it's basically what most people who are active in this field believe nowadays.

119
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Neo Darwinism was a passing phase and a very narrow phase in the history of biology. One aspect of this is the study of identical twins. As all of you know, there used to be a lot of studies, and there still are, of identical twins separated soon after birth in order to find out how to do that.

120
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:55,000
How much of human nature depends on genetics and on the environment. It turns out that identical twins separated soon after birth have a huge number of features in common, not just their physical appearance but in the Minnesota twin studies involving thousands of pairs of twins.

121
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Ridiculously detailed things like painting their houses the same colour, calling their kids by the same names, not the kinds of things even the most ardent neo Darwinian would expect to be encoded in the genes.

122
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That was one reason why people thought genetics accounted for so much of inheritance from these identical twin studies and the usual alternatives were environment or genes or a mixture of both.

123
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So when it turns out there's all these enormous similarities people said well it's primarily genes and that was really the foundation of the whole edifice of selfish gene theory.

124
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Well if morphic resonance is taking place the very fact that they're identical or at least very similar means they'd specifically resonate with each other across space and time even if they're living in separate places and in separate families and there'd be a great deal of connection between them and similarity.

125
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So what this evidence may suggest is that morphic resonance is going on rather than it's all due to the genes.

126
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And when you think about similarity if you ask yourself the question who in the past is most similar to me now the answer is you.

127
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You're most similar to yourself in the past, I'm most similar to myself in the past, the most specific resonance acting on me is from my past, the most specific resonance acting on you is from your past.

128
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And I think that's why we retain our form because we resonate with our past forms even though the proteins and the cells are continually changing, turning over and I think it's how memories work.

129
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Now the materialist conventional theory of memory is of course that all memories are stored inside the brain, everything you remember somewhere stored inside your head either in a DNA molecule, a phosphorylated protein or the favourite theory, modified nerve endings, synapses.

130
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But despite a hundred years of trying to find memory traces they've proved elusive over and over and over again.

131
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But instead of scientists think well maybe they don't exist, they'll say well we need billions more dollars to look even further and to have even more detailed studies.

132
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And I think the reason they haven't found them is very simple, they're not there. Just as if I came to analyse your TV set to see what you'd watched last night and analyse the wires and transistors, I wouldn't find out what programme you'd watched last night, it's not how it works.

133
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So I think that the memories I don't think are stored in the brain, if you damage the brain you can certainly affect memories, if you damage a TV set you can affect the pictures or the sounds, but it doesn't prove they're all produced inside the TV set, it proves it's necessary for their processing, reception etc.

134
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Now, memories, morphic resonance also applies to social groups, flocks of birds, schools of fish, termite colonies. A termite colony, the members of it can remember from previous genera, previous termite colonies, how to do that architecture.

135
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Each individual termite is blind and they move little bits of mud, put them in exactly the right place to produce these prodigious structures. Millions of termites can live in a single colony, they can build mountains that are 10 feet high, with complex tunnels and passageways and ventilation shafts and so on.

136
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:50,000
How and asked does a tiny termite know where to put a little ball of mud? I think they're within a field, the morphic field of the termite colony and the individuals are responding to this field which has an inherent memory.

137
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:03,000
There's no way this can be programmed in proteins that they make in so just switching on or off genes that make the right proteins. So I think social groups have morphic resonance as well.

138
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And where this affects us is that families are social groups and families have a kind of memory in the family field. And when we start new families, when people get married or live together and have children and start a new family, both the parents have family fields, they bring with them a field from their family of origin.

139
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And the families are kind of hybrid between these two family fields. And some families are more complicated of course with step parents and so on. But to take the simplest case, you'd have two family fields, both with a kind of history, a pattern formed in previous generations.

140
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And the kind of work that happens in family constellation therapy depends very much on these family fields. And I know more about this than some because Jill has been practicing this for many years.

141
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:26,000
My wife, Jill Perse, who's here, and has, through her work and through the work of others, it becomes clear that the people's behavior is shaped by the family field, often by unconscious habitual patterns from previous generations, of which people are often completely unaware.

142
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And individuals within those families may behave in ways that individual psychotherapy can't really deal with because, for example, if in previous generations someone's been excluded from the family because they've committed suicide, committed a crime, done something shameful, or for whatever reason they've been excluded,

143
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:58,000
then in a later generation, one member of the family may unconsciously identify with the excluded person and exclude themselves by behaving in a dysfunctional way or becoming suicidal.

144
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And individual psychotherapy just can't get to the bottom of this because it's not an individual problem. It's to do with something that's within the habitual field of the family.

145
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And family constellation therapy is extraordinarily effective in bringing to light these patterns. And I can't describe it all now, there isn't time, but there are representatives for different members of the family selected from the group.

146
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And those representatives, someone who's standing in for the mother, the father, the brother, the sister, and so on, often speak, when they're asked how they feel, often speak in a very appropriate way about their situation in that family field, even though they don't know very much about the family at all,

147
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and they somehow come through as if they channel it from the field.

148
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:02,000
There are now many people doing this work, but Joel has been doing it for years and has now developed an extraordinarily effective way of doing it online, perforce through Covid.

149
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Her first actual in-person mum for three years was here at Holly Hawk last month, but she does them online, there's one coming up quite soon, when Joel, is it?

150
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
9 September, so it's amazing that these fields work on Zoom, even when the participants and the representatives can be hundreds of miles apart.

151
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I mean, I'm amazed it works, but it does.

152
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That again, I think, is an example of morphic fields and morphic resonance working through them.

153
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Now, I want to deal with two or three more examples here where morphic resonance touches are in lives.

154
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:53,000
One is through rituals. All cultures and societies have rituals, and rituals involve reenacting a story of origins, not all rituals.

155
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Some myths of origins and rituals of remembrance are about reenacting a story of the group's origin, and by reenacting it, people participate in it and affirm their identity.

156
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
For example, for Jewish people, the festival of Passover is extremely important, and it reenacts the story of the original Passover.

157
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Jewish people were slaves in Egypt. There were a series of curses or plagues visited on the Egyptians to let them go, and the tenth one involved killing all the firstborn of the Egyptians and their cattle.

158
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The Jewish people escaped this by smearing the blood of a lamb on the doorways of their houses. They were passed over.

159
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,000
For Jewish people, reenacting this story through the Passover feast or dinner is a key part of being Jewish and telling the story.

160
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Present-day Jewish people and children are brought within this field of being Jewish through reenacting a ritual meal, which recreates that original meal.

161
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Rituals are highly conservative. They involve the right food, the right gestures, the right words. They have to be done in a very similar way to the way they've been done before.

162
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:27,000
The Christian Holy Communion itself, a Passover dinner with Jesus and his disciples, is reenacted in the Eucharist or the Mass in churches all over the world every Sunday, in fact every day, in many churches and cathedrals.

163
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It is, again, a reenacting of that original act, and it has to be done in the right way, the right gestures, the right ceremony, the right procedure.

164
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The American Thanksgiving dinner is an example of a secular or national ritual commemorating the survival of the first colonizers of the New World from England and from Europe,

165
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:10,000
giving thanks for their surviving in the New World, and reenacting that Thanksgiving dinner every year makes Americans and Canadians in the Canadian Thanksgiving affirm their identity and their connection with all those who've done it before, right back to the first time.

166
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Now, there are countless rituals all religions and societies have them, and they generally have this very conservative quality. It has to be done the same way, and I think the reason that that works is that by doing it in the similar way as possible, the right chance, the right words, the gestures, etc.

167
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:42,000
In the right liturgical language, Sanskrit is the language of Hindu rituals, Old Slavic of Russian Orthodox rituals, Ancient Egyptian of Coptic rituals in the Coptic Church in Egypt.

168
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:53,000
These highly conservative use of ancient languages is because by doing it in the way it's been done before, you connect with those who've done it before you. That's the whole point of doing it.

169
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And if Morphic resonance is happening, you see this provides a very natural explanation for why rituals really do connect participants with the ancestors with those who've gone before, why there really is a presence of the past through these rituals.

170
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The same principles apply on the smaller scale to mantras, which are sacred phrases or words which are used in meditation and in rituals and in prayers, and mantras are not meaningful statements usually, they're not necessarily words that tell you some information.

171
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The whole point of the mantra is that by chanting the mantra, your body physically resonates. If you're doing it with other people, you resonate with other people by chanting together because you're doing it at the same time and you're in resonance with others, and you resonate with all those who've done that mantra before.

172
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And again, this is something I've learned a lot about from Jill, who in her sound workshops, sound and voice workshops, teaches the very principles of mantra and you get to experience them directly.

173
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So again, this fits very well with the idea of Morphic resonance. It would be hard to understand the power of mantras without something like Morphic resonance.

174
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Similar principles also apply to holy places, and one of the things that I do in England is that I help with the work of something called the British Pilgrimage Trust, which I helped found, which is opening footpath pilgrimages to the holy places of England, including cathedrals, churches, holy wells, ancient trees, stone circles and other holy places.

175
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And these are footpath pilgrimages you walk on foot. There's a big revival of pilgrimage going on all over Europe at the moment, the iconic pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

176
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:09,000
In 1987, when the first of the sort of modern version of the pilgrimage got going, a thousand people walked it. In 2019, 330,000 people walked it.

177
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There's been a huge increase in pilgrimage in Europe, and not only from people who are devout Catholics or religious people. In the British Pilgrimage Trust, when we have organised pilgrimages that people can join in, groups can go together, one of the slogans for these pilgrimages, B-Y-O-B, bring your own beliefs.

178
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:45,000
When people go to holy places, say you go to one of our great Gothic medieval cathedrals, whatever your belief system, these have an enormously powerful effect on most people.

179
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:55,000
They were built to change consciousness. Their vast structures designed to expand your mind. The stained glass windows have a kind of psychedelic quality.

180
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,000
In the Middle Ages, when people lived in drab grey huts and things, this must have been even more powerful than it is today.

181
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:12,000
One reason that sacred places have this power, I think, is that when you enter them, you come into resonance with other people who've been in that place before.

182
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:30,000
If they've had visionary or inspiring experiences there, or many have prayed there, or given thanks there, then that's part of your experience. You tune into that, and these places have a particular power, which I think depends on morphic resonance from those who've been there before.

183
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Of course, you can have places where bad things have happened, like battlefields, where there can be a negative feeling, and that, again, would be a morphic resonance with the negative emotions of those who've been there before.

184
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:59,000
In the form of seasonal festivals, we have another collective form of celebration, which is found all over the world in all cultures, where people celebrate together.

185
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's one of the ways in which societies and families acquire cohesion through celebrating together. That collective celebration is essential, really, for building positive communities.

186
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Seasonal festivals have always done this in all cultures, and we still have them, even in very secular countries like modern Britain. Christmas is still a hugely important seasonal festival, even for people who are not religious believers at Easter.

187
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:53,000
All cultures have their seasonal festivals, and, again, you have the same morphic resonance properties. Christmas has Christmas carols, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, Snowman's song, Jingle bells, all that kind of thing, which all sound hopelessly out of place if you hear them in bright summer's day.

188
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But because they're appropriate to that season, and it falls in that season, there's this resonance with those who've taken part before. So I think all of us come within that field of resonance, and as spiritual practices, what they do is connect us.

189
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Spiritual practices are about connection. Meditation is about connection to a deeper source of consciousness. The spiritual practices of rituals connect you with others who are doing the ritual and connect you with the ancestors and those who've done them before.

190
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And with the primal transcendent event, which is some special event, a divinely inspired event, which they're commemorating. So they're all about connection, and seasonal festivals have this quality too.

191
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:58,000
One of the great periods of seasonal festivals in Britain and all over Europe was Midsummer's Day, which is June the 24th, just after the solstice, just as Christmas is just after the winter solstice, Midsummer's Day is just after the summer solstice.

192
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And it's interesting that the Glastonbury Festival, the biggest music festival in England, the most iconic of all our summer festivals, happens over Midsummer's Day.

193
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Midsummer's Day is the Feast of St John the Baptist, and Pilton, the village where the Glastonbury Festival happens, is the patron saint of Pilton happens to be St John the Baptist.

194
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And I once went to a service on a Sunday in the Glastonbury Festival. I was staying, I was at the festival, but I make a practice of going to church on Sundays wherever I am.

195
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And so I went to the ancient parish church at Pilton, and there was the festival in the background. And I said to the vicar, the priest, I said, you've got the biggest patronal festival of any village in England.

196
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And he just looked a bit puzzled, and then he realised what I was saying, and he sort of chuckled. And yes indeed, this is a very ancient tradition.

197
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And here on Cortes we've had a new revival of that kind of tradition in the Love Fest or Summer of Love, which those of you who live on the island may have been to recently, is again a revival of this kind of principle of seasonal festival.

198
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And joint and collective celebration with music and dancing and happy celebration.

199
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So these are some of the ways in which I think Morphic Resonance touches our own lives. It underlies our growth, our development, our memories, our collective life, our festivals, rituals, celebrations.

200
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And I think Morphic Resonance is, as I was saying before, inherent in all of nature. We experience its human forms and its cultural forms.

201
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But I think it applies to all self-organising systems in nature. Not everything in nature is self-organising.

202
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It may be worth spelling out what it is. Atoms are self-organising. They make themselves molecules, and the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, oxygen molecules, nitrogen molecules, they're not made in factories.

203
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:28,000
They're self-organising. Planets are self-organising. Stars are self-organising. Galaxies are self-organising. Animals and plants are self-organising. Crystals are self-organising.

204
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Termite societies are self-organising. But chairs are not self-organising. They're made in factories. Tables aren't self-organising. Rocks are not self-organising.

205
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Because although the crystals within them are, if a big rock falls down a mountain and splinters into lots of little bits, those little bits were risen because of external forces, not because that's how the rock grows.

206
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And computers are not self-organising. They're made in factories. Computer programmes are not self-organising. They're programmed by computer programmers.

207
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So none of these systems would have morphic resonance, chairs, tables, computers and so on.

208
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And that's one reason I think that artificial intelligence is very unlikely to be truly intelligent, because it's programmed into computers which are mechanistic machine-like systems, which are deterministic, which don't have that capacity to self-organise and therefore to have a kind of memory.

209
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You have to build in a solid state memory into disks or magnetic tapes or whatever in computers. If we had a truly living technology, it would never be a digital computer, I think, but possibly analog computers, possibly quantum computers, if they get to a state where they have a holistic property which really is self-organising, then they may have their own memory by morphic resonance and they may connect up with other similar computers all around the world in a kind of collective memory.

210
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:11,000
A new technology could possibly emerge in the artificial intelligence computer world, but not with digital computers, possibly with analog or quantum computers.

211
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So by recognising what's self-organising and what isn't, it makes it easier to understand what things may have their own memory.

212
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And in the modern philosophy of panpsychism, the idea of mind in all things in atoms, molecules, crystals, stars, galaxies, this is becoming surprisingly fashionable in the academic world at the moment.

213
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Again, this would apply only to self-organising systems, not to tables, chairs, computers and socks.

214
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I mean, this is a common repost of skeptics when people say they're panpsychists.

215
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So you mean my socks are conscious? No, that's not what they're saying and I'm not saying they have morphic resonance.

216
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So I think self-organising things throughout nature, things which are basically alive, animate or self-organising, have this kind of memory.

217
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And the entire universe is self-organising, so the whole universe would have a kind of cosmic memory.

218
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Now finally, a though morphic resonance helps to explain many aspects of nature, what it explains is repetition and the maintenance of things.

219
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:36,000
If you're familiar with the Hindu pantheon of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, Brahma is the sort of creator.

220
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Vishnu is the preserver who keeps the order of the universe and Shiva is the creator who creates and destroys and is the creative principle.

221
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, morphic resonance is more the Vishnu principle, it's the principle of preservation of form and order.

222
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It's a conservative principle because it enables patterns to be repeated, orders to be sustained.

223
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But it doesn't explain creativity, doesn't explain where new forms come from and new order appears.

224
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So within the universe within evolution has to be a creative principle as well and that's another story.

225
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm not going to talk about that now because there isn't time and it's a huge topic.

226
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But evolution has to involve an interplay of habit and creativity.

227
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If there were any habit there would be repetition and only repetition.

228
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If there were only creativity there would be a constant display of novelty but nothing would ever stabilise, there would be a kind of chaos.

229
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
What we have is an interplay between these two, both in the entire cosmos and in our own lives.

230
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So those are a few words about morphic resonance and how it affects our lives and I'll leave it at that for now.

231
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Thank you, there's at some time for Q&A and I've asked Aiton to pick the questioners so I don't, because I can't see everyone very well, especially people at the back.

232
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And he's got a raving microphone.

233
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And I'm passing the hat now. Martha, get that started for me. Thank you.

234
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Erika, but before Erika I wanted to ask a question.

235
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm first in line.

236
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,000
There are many people who postulate that the trance state is a fundamental need of humans.

237
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And I was just wondering if you could talk about the relationship between trance states and morphic resonance.

238
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You mean as in sort of dance-induced trances and drug-induced trances and so on.

239
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, I think those, as states of consciousness, they'd have their own field and organising principles.

240
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And I think that those would also have a kind of morphic field.

241
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:24,000
For example, I think that psychedelic experiences, when you take a particular psychedelic, then the pattern of change in your own brain and mind would resonate with that of other people who've taken the same psychedelic in the past.

242
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So if you have a psychedelic like ayahuasca, which has been taken in tribal societies in the Amazon with mythologies about jaguars and serpents and so on.

243
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:45,000
If people who know nothing about Amazon mythologies take ayahuasca in modern urban settings, then some of them may see jaguars and serpents, and indeed some do.

244
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I think that this is not because the molecules of ayahuasca trigger jaguar molecules in the brain, but because they tune you in to those who've done it before.

245
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Now, it doesn't explain how trans states originate in the first place, because morphic resonance doesn't explain creativity.

246
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But it does explain how, when you're in a particular kind of trans state, you'd resonate with others who've been in a similar state.

247
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So there'd be a trans personal aspect to them.

248
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Hello.

249
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm curious, and this question isn't fully formed, but I'm curious about relations who've passed, and if you can, in the present, resonate with them,

250
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
not in the past, but in the present.

251
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Resonate with what?

252
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:59,000
With relations who have passed, and so not resonating to what they were, but what they are.

253
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Well, I mean morphic resonance is usually from the past to the present, but you could say that if something's a millisecond in the past, it would be almost the same as in the present.

254
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think that something like that underlies telepathy, which is a kind of resonance between people in the present.

255
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's different from memory, because it is more or less in the present, and the whole point of telepathy tells you what's going on for other people now.

256
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So it's not exactly the same as morphic resonance, but it's closely related.

257
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
What do you mean by ancestors?

258
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Well, ancestors, as I mentioned in the ancestral field, the ancestors influence us continually, both directly through resonance with us personally.

259
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Individual ancestors may, our parents and our grandparents and other ancestors may influence us directly by resonance.

260
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But then the ancestral families, although not just the individuals, but the way they related to each other within our parents' family, our grandparents' family, our great-grandparents' family,

261
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
those then would resonate with our families in the present, but individuals would resonate with us as individuals.

262
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So you have both the individual and the family resonances working on us in the present.

263
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So I think we're greatly influenced by ancestors and the past, and sometimes people have skills or abilities or interests which are very similar to those of grandparents or something,

264
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
even if they never knew their grandparents had these interests.

265
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So I think this is very much part of our nature.

266
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Part of our heredity is this resonance with the past and our ancestors.

267
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Genes are part of it, but as I said, there's much more to it than just genes.

268
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm curious, though I see that sort of past connection, but I'm curious if you can resonate with, you know, or what you're saying, sort of telepathy with an ancestor who has passed sort of currently rather than what they were.

269
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Oh, you mean if they're in the afterlife and you're resonating with them? No.

270
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, that's a much more complicated question because it depends on what form we survive in.

271
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And one thing that is relevant to this that I should have pointed out or could have pointed out is that if memories are not stored in our brains, then they're not all destroyed at death.

272
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The usual of materialist assumption is that all our memories are inside our heads and our brains and everyone agrees the brain decays after death.

273
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And so for materialists, all memories are wiped out totally.

274
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Therefore, there's no possibility of survival of bodily death in any form whatever.

275
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:03,000
This is one reason that materialists are atheists and that atheists are materialists because it refutes all religions because they all have some belief in survival of death.

276
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Now, whether in what kind of state our ancestors go on existing is another question.

277
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The popular Catholic vision of this is beautifully embodied in that Disney film Coco, which about the Mexican Day of the Dead, where people relate to the ancestors.

278
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Now, I myself think it's important to relate to the ancestors on November the same, all souls day.

279
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Now, I always do some kind of ceremony for my ancestors.

280
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Most Catholic and Anglican churches have services for all souls day.

281
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And Chill does workshops over all souls day.

282
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And they include a requiem mass at our parish church in Hampstead, which our priest conducts.

283
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And the people in her workshops are relating to their ancestors through that.

284
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Some would never normally go to church, some are Jewish, some are atheists, etc.

285
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But it's very meaningful in the context Chill sets of where you're relating to those who've gone before.

286
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So these are traditional ways of doing it.

287
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So is that why if we heal ourself in this lifetime of something through Chill's work or something like that, then we also can heal backwards and forwards?

288
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Because of his morphic resonance, something that would explain that phenomena that people feel is possible.

289
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Like stopping the cycle of abuse in your lifetime and healing backwards generations and forward generations.

290
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Well, that would be the kind of thing that I would expect, but it would be hard to prove that.

291
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I mean, if the family field is healed through these practices, then I would expect it to affect people thereafter.

292
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:18,000
To what degree it acts retroactively, you know, whether the actual ancestors 100 years ago are through time travel from Chill's workshops affected by what's happening in the workshop.

293
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:29,000
No, we can't test that really, but whether the ancestors in the afterlife, whatever form it takes for them are affected, that seems to be perfectly possible, but that can only be speculative.

294
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Thank you very much for sharing these views. It's fascinating.

295
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:49,000
My question is, do you hope that the residence is quantifiable, and if so, where would you look?

296
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Well, you'd study it through its effects.

297
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It works through fields, morphic fields, and in science you study fields through their effects.

298
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You study gravitational fields through gravitational effects, electric fields through electric effects, and so on.

299
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And the resonance of morphic resonance, you'd study through its effects.

300
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So if, for example, you train a rat to learn a new trick, then you can see whether a rat a thousand miles away learns it quicker.

301
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And then if you train a thousand rats, say on Cortis Island, to learn a new trick, would rats far away learn it much quicker than if one had done it here?

302
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And the evidence suggests they do.

303
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So the bigger the influence, the bigger the effect.

304
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And so you can actually study it through its effects.

305
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And at present, the experiments so far what they seem to show is that the bigger the number of individuals, the greater the effect.

306
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
But there also may be an intensity factor.

307
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
People who learn things that involve very intense learning programme may have a greater effect than people who just superficially learn something.

308
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
So all of these are empirical questions, really.

309
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So you study it through the effects.

310
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You wouldn't expect to be able to study it through some electrical meter that you hold up in the air, because you can't even study gravitation through an electrical meter.

311
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You can study electricity and magnetism through electric meters, but not gravitation or quantum fields.

312
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So you have to study things through their own appropriate effects.

313
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I had a thought when you were talking about, yes, we're designed to be both habitual and creative.

314
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And I think you said morphic resonance doesn't really explain creativity.

315
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The thought I had is, because in psychotherapy, you know, with family constellations, Hakomi, which is what I'm trained in,

316
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I love to normalise the fact that we're habitual, and it seems to me that the bridge to creativity is consciousness.

317
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Well, I agree. I think certainly in our own case, the bridge to creativity is consciousness.

318
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Although when people have a creative insight, it comes through consciousness rather than from it.

319
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You know, people would say it came to me in a flash or it came to me in a dream or something like that.

320
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So consciousness may be the medium through which we get it, but not necessarily through which we make it.

321
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
There are traditional views of creativity in the Greek world, for example, of the muses.

322
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
There are creative spirits that work through us. That's why music is called music.

323
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The music of music works through musicians, and that's why you have museums where the human arts, all governed by the muses, are collected together.

324
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
In India, if you go to a classical music concert in South India, it will start with an invocation to the goddess of music.

325
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Saraswati, to inspire the performers and the musicians.

326
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And in the Christian tradition, the angels which are creative spirits and the Holy Spirit itself work through us.

327
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So creativity traditionally is understood in the human realm through inspiration, the breathing in of the spirit, of the creative spirit from beyond us and through us.

328
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And it's mediated through our consciousness, but not originating within it.

329
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And of course these are speculations, but when most creative people talk about the creative process, they usually say they don't know where it came from.

330
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It came in a flash, that kind of thing. It came as it were from outside, coming through them.

331
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I have one other kind of fun thought when we were talking about how it shows up in the way people learn things.

332
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You know, golfers are so much better now than they were. Even the ones who are golfing now and winning, they're so much better than Tiger Woods even was.

333
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And wouldn't it be fun to get some of these awesome golfers to play with old equipment and I think what would be demonstrated is they're still hitting the ball farther than Tiger Woods was?

334
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That's a very good point. Yes, I mean in most sports there's been an improvement in skills and that's a very good experimental test to use the old equipment and see if they're still good at it.

335
01:00:46,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I know we're talking about memory and stuff, but I'm wondering if there's a way to resonate with future happenings.

336
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm interested in kind of prophetic dreams and visions and stuff and if we can tap into things in the future.

337
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I think we can, but I don't think that's through morphic resonance. Morphic resonance is mainly about habits and the more habitual something is, the more unconscious it is.

338
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I think that we are open to the future in ways that are more related to the kind of creative aspects of consciousness.

339
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think there's no doubt that precognitive dreams occur. People have premonitions, people have dreams about events in the future, not all the time.

340
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Animals can feel the future too. I mean the warnings of earthquakes and tsunamis by dogs, cats and many kinds of wild animals suggest that they're able to feel what's about to happen.

341
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And there's a phenomenon called pre-sentiment where humans can feel what's about to happen a few seconds in advance.

342
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
This is something that parapsychologists like Dean Radin have studied, I think very convincingly.

343
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So I think that we are open to the future, not all the time, not as reliably as we're open to the past.

344
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:23,000
These pre-sentiments don't work as reliably as memory does, but they definitely seem to happen.

345
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:32,000
No-one knows quite how or why. And there's all sorts of speculative theories, but it's really not understood how it works.

346
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:40,000
But I'm sure it happens. I myself have studied, in my book, the sense of being stared at and other aspects of the extended mind.

347
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I discuss human pre-sentiments, precognitive dreams and this openness to the future.

348
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
In my book, dogs that know when their owners are coming home and other unexplained powers of animals,

349
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I discuss earthquake warning by animals and tsunami warnings and air raid warnings and that kind of thing.

350
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Epileptic seizure dogs that give warnings of seizures and so on.

351
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So I think this ability is deep in our biological nature, it's not specifically human.

352
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But if you stand under that tree you can be Newton.

353
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yes, well we've got a perfect demonstration of gravitation going on here.

354
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Oh heavens, we've got to visit from this tank.

355
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Come for the food, stay for the talk.

356
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Well we're running late a bit late now, I'm sure we have just one more.

357
01:03:44,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Hi Rupert. My question is whether morphic resonance could be interrupted or disrupted at all.

358
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Well I don't think it can be sort of screened out by a faraday cage or anything like that.

359
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
But it can be competed with, I mean you can have competing resonances.

360
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,000
For example if you make a hybrid between two species like a mule is a hybrid between a horse and a donkey,

361
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
then you get both influences working and not all the horse influences would come through,

362
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
not all the donkey influences but you'd have a kind of mixture of them.

363
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:44,000
If you have in genetics, I think the reason most mutations and most new forms of organisms are recessive

364
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
is because they're rare, they're new things that haven't happened very much.

365
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And if you cross a mutant with a recessive what's called a recessive gene,

366
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I don't think it's really the gene that's recessive.

367
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I think the fact that it's only happened a little bit before is what makes it recessive.

368
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Cross it with the so-called wild type, then you'll no longer see this rare recessive characteristic.

369
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
The morphic resonance will be swamped by the more powerful regular resonance.

370
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So the morphic resonance, the influence on the given organism or system from the past

371
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
is from countless other systems and if you want to neutralise one particular thing

372
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
then it can be overwhelmed by other ones.

373
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Or you can change the tuning, so you tune into a different one, like on a TV set.

374
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
All those channels are broadcasting, change the tuning knob and you change the tuning to a different channel.

375
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And that happens in developmental biology.

376
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Sometimes you can change in fruit flies, for example, there's a pair of wings

377
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and the segment behind it has halt hairs or balancing organs.

378
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And there's a mutation called by thorax that changes the tuning of those

379
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
so that the halt hairs develop into another pair of wings.

380
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So you get a four-winged fly instead of a two-winged fly.

381
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And so there you've changed the resonance by switching the tuning to another channel.

382
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
So you can't exactly block it but you can change the tuning

383
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
or you can compete with it by other resonances that overwhelm it.

384
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Good. Well, I think, Aiton, I think maybe that's...

385
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Oh, yes, Charles.

386
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,000
You've been talking about the cosmology and the universes

387
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and I'm just wondering if the pictures from the web telescope

388
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
have interested you or stimulated you in these thoughts.

389
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The new pictures of the universes, the billions of them.

390
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I haven't actually seen them yet, the new pictures from the web telescope

391
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
but I will do when I have the chance.

392
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So I don't know that they change my actual view of what's going on fundamentally.

393
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I mean, more and more galaxies, more and more stars, more detailed pictures of planets,

394
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:20,000
all that kind of thing is important but it doesn't change the basic fundamental principles

395
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
of gravity.

396
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So, you know, the kinds of questions that interest me,

397
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
to what degree are these galaxies conscious and to what degree is the sun conscious

398
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
and for those of you who are interested in these things,

399
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I published a paper recently in the Journal of Consciousness Studies called

400
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Is the Sun Conscious?

401
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
To which I answer probably yes.

402
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
As we think about consciousness in the universe,

403
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
as we go beyond the cerebrocentric view of consciousness, it's just in brains,

404
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
we can then recognise that many things could be conscious in the universe.

405
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Our ancestors thought that.

406
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I mean, for the Greeks, all the stars and planets were living beings with their own minds.

407
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Plato called the planets and the stars the living gods, the visible gods.

408
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
We can see them and yet they have minds and powers greater than our own.

409
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And so, I think as we recover a sort of panpsychist sense of the universe

410
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
or animistic sense of the universe, then we can see what we see through the web telescope

411
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
or any other telescope or the Hubble telescope or whatever.

412
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
We can interpret them in a different way.

413
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
The actual image is neutral in the sense it doesn't tell us whether it's conscious or not

414
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and the usual assumption of astronomers is this is just dead matter out there.

415
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But I think we can see it in a completely different way,

416
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
in a way that may be more realistic, actually, that we live in a living universe.

417
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Thanks, Rupert.
