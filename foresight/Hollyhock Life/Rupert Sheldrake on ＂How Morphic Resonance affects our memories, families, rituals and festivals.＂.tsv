0	15000	I'm talking this evening about Morphic Resonance, which is one of my favourite themes, but I haven't talked about it here at Holyhock for at least 10 years, because I've talked about other things.
15000	28000	But some of you are familiar with the idea, some of you are not. So first I'm going to give a very brief summary of the idea of Morphic Resonance, then I'm going to talk about some of its implications.
28000	36000	Particularly implications that affect us, you know, as in our lives and our normal lives.
36000	56000	Morphic resonance is the idea that there's a kind of memory in nature. The so-called laws of nature are more like habits. Each species has a collective memory, and in the human realm that collective memory is more or less what Jung called the collective unconscious.
56000	69000	And this process of memory works through resonance from the past to the present on the basis of similarity, like on like, across space and time.
69000	82000	This theory has many, many implications. Perhaps one of the most startling is that our own memories are not stored inside our brains, as commonly assumed, but rather we tune into them.
82000	96000	Our brains are more like tuning systems, more like TVs than like video recorders. I'll come back to that in a moment, but this is just to give the brief overview.
96000	120000	Now, the idea of Morphic resonance memory in nature is rather shocking in Western science. Indeed, it's been proclaimed a heresy by some scientific authorities because it goes against the usual assumptions of Western science, which are that nature is governed by fixed eternal laws.
121000	133000	And this idea of fixed eternal laws goes back a very long way. Pythagoras in ancient Greece had the idea that there was an eternal reality which this reality reflects.
133000	141000	In fact, all the ancient Greek philosophers thought that there was an eternal reality that this changing world was a reflection of.
141000	160000	They had different theories about what the eternal reality was, and Pythagoras thought it was mathematics, numbers, ratios, proportions, harmonies, and he thought that the mathematical realm was the truly real realm, and everything in this world was a reflection of it.
160000	189000	Plato generalised Pythagoras' idea to say it's not just mathematics that's eternal, it's the whole realm of forms and ideas, the shapes of everything, red cedars, horses, cats, hedgehogs, everything in nature has an eternal form or archetype in a transcendent realm beyond space and time, the realm of platonic forms or ideas.
190000	204000	And in the beginning of the 17th century, when the scientific revolution got going, the founding fathers of modern science were all believers in this kind of platonic Pythagorean cosmology.
204000	216000	They thought that the laws of nature were mathematical, that they were discovering the mathematical principles of nature which were ideas in the mind of God, that for them God was a mathematician.
216000	235000	Mathematicians very much like the idea that God's a mathematician because it means that they're the closest of all humans to the divine, and also automatically a kind of priesthood because most of us don't understand much maths, and that means that mathematicians have this privileged role in our society.
235000	256000	So they all like that idea, right up to the present. Your most hard-nosed atheistic physicist is usually a secret Platonist. So the idea that all the laws of nature are eternal, that nature is governed by fixed laws, is really built into the foundations of western thought.
257000	265000	It's not built into the foundations of eastern thought. In Hinduism and Buddhism it's taken for granted there's a kind of memory in nature.
266000	280000	And when I came up with the idea of morphic resonance, I was working at Cambridge doing research on plant development, and I came up with this idea in terms of understanding the inheritance of form in plants and animals.
281000	299000	I didn't come up with it by studying eastern philosophy. I hadn't studied eastern philosophy. But when I then later went to work in India, I spent seven years in India, when I explained morphic resonance to my Hindu friends, most of them were deeply unimpressed.
299000	316000	They said, oh, this is an ancient idea. Rishis said this thousands of years ago and stuff. And they just thought, what's new? We've heard all this before. Whereas in Cambridge, when I talked about the idea, there was shock and horror in the scientific realm.
317000	334000	Now, I think that actually, although western science has been based on this eternal law principle, it's in a state of crisis. Until 1966, most scientists thought the universe was eternal, and having an eternal universe governed by eternal laws made sense.
335000	350000	Since 1966, we've had the big bang cosmology. The whole universe started very small, less than the size of a head of a pin. It's been expanding and cooling ever since. And as it grows and cools, new forms and structures appear within it.
351000	355000	It's much more like a developing organism than like an eternal machine.
356000	368000	So in this evolving universe that we live in, according to modern cosmology, everything evolves. But they've still gone on with the idea that the laws of nature are fixed.
369000	378000	So they assume that all the laws of nature were all there in place like a kind of Napoleonic code at the very moment of the big bang.
379000	393000	They don't explain how they got there. Many scientists are atheists, so they just assume that there were these free-floating laws that were somehow there, or which came into being with the universe itself, together with all the matter and energy in the universe.
394000	402000	And as my friend Terence McKenna would like to say, modern science is based on the principle, give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest.
403000	413000	And one free miracle is the appearance of all the laws of nature and all the matter and energy in the universe from nothing in a single instant, for no reason.
414000	418000	Anyway, we now have this radically evolving cosmos.
419000	427000	And most scientists assume that all the laws were there at the beginning and then they have endless debates about why were the laws exactly as they were and not otherwise.
428000	430000	And then there's a huge debate in modern cosmology.
431000	441000	One lot of people say, well, if they're exactly right for the universe that's just right for us and there could have been billions of alternative universes, then there must have been an intelligent designer,
441000	449000	a kind of external engineering god who fine-tuned all the laws and constants so it was just right for us before pressing the start button.
450000	455000	And that's one view, a kind of external mechanistic god.
456000	463000	The other view to avoid an external mechanistic god is to say there are billions of actrillions or quadrillions of actual universes.
464000	469000	We just happen to live in the one that's right for us and all the others actually exist.
469000	481000	And when I asked one of the opponents of this, this very extravagant hypothesis, contravening Occam's razor, the principle you should have the minimum number of entities in an explanation.
482000	489000	I said this is the ultimate violation of Occam's razor, quadrillions of universes for which there's not a shred of evidence.
490000	492000	I said, why on earth can you believe in that?
493000	495000	He said, well, this way we can get rid of God.
495000	504000	But as theologians have pointed out, it doesn't even get rid of God because an infinite God would be the God of an infinite number of universes, or could be.
505000	516000	So anyway, they locked into this debate, the universe versus the multiverse and seminars and conferences and learned discussions go on in universities about this.
517000	519000	All based on the assumption the laws were fixed at the beginning.
520000	524000	But if we're in a radically evolutionary universe, why should the laws be fixed at the beginning?
525000	533000	If they're laws at all, why shouldn't they be more like common law in the English and American system depending on precedents?
534000	537000	And in fact, why shouldn't they be more like habits?
538000	543000	The minute you think about the idea of laws of nature, you realise that is deeply anthropomorphic concept.
543000	549000	Only humans have laws and only civilised humans have laws. In fact, tribes have customs.
550000	559000	So the idea of laws of nature is a very peculiar idea the more you think about it. Habits makes much more sense.
560000	566000	And that's what I've been saying since I put forward the idea of morphic resonance in 1981 for the first time.
566000	579000	Since then cosmologists, including Lee Smolin, who's a theoretical physicist, have indeed started talking about the habits of nature and they are coming round to this idea.
580000	593000	But I mean they'll have to come round to it because it just doesn't make sense to have this hangover from the old platonic cosmology sort of tacked on to and evolve a radically evolutionary world view.
593000	605000	Well, this way of looking at nature provides a very different interpretation of many physical phenomena.
606000	621000	For example, when you crystallise a new chemical for the very first time, according to the standard view, the way it forms is already predetermined by the laws of electromagnetism, quantum physics, thermodynamics, etc.
621000	628000	And in principle you should be able to predict the form of the crystal in practice you can't, it's too complicated.
629000	638000	But in principle you should and the first time it forms and the millionth time and the billionth time it should be exactly the same because the laws are the same at all times and in all places.
639000	647000	According to morphic resonance, the first time you make the crystal it may take a long time for the new crystal form to come into being.
647000	656000	And when you make it repeatedly over and over again in labs all around the world, a new habit builds up and the crystal should form, crystallise more easily.
657000	661000	And that's exactly what chemists find, crystals get easier and easier to crystallise.
662000	674000	But of course they don't explain it in terms of morphic resonance, they explain it in terms of firstly anecdotes about chemists carrying seeds or nuclei, little bits of previous crystals around the world on their beards or clothing.
674000	681000	And or secondly in terms of dust particles from previous crystals being wafted around the world in the atmosphere.
682000	689000	What I'm saying is that this should happen even when bearded chemists are excluded and when the dust is filtered from the atmosphere.
690000	702000	And also this theory predicts the melting points of crystals which are called physical constants should go up as time goes on because the crystals get more stable through morphic resonance.
702000	709000	The form becomes more habitual and therefore it should be harder to break the form down. You'd need a higher temperature to do it.
710000	718000	And actually the melting points of new compounds do go up sometimes by 10, 20 degrees. I've studied this with hundreds of chemicals.
719000	726000	And most chemists simply they have to acknowledge the fact that this is happening even though these are supposed to be physical constants.
726000	735000	But they say oh it's just because we get better at making the crystals and their pure samples and pure samples have higher melting points.
736000	748000	But it's incredibly difficult to get them to test this hypothesis. It's already been tested through everyday practice of chemistry but the facts fit very well with morphic resonance.
749000	771000	In the realm of animal behaviour there's a well-known example of rats. A long series of experiments at Harvard, Edinburgh and Melbourne University in Australia showed that when you train rats to learn a new trick escaping from a water maze the more rats that learned it the easier it got for other rats to learn it even in other parts of the world.
771000	782000	And this wasn't just rats that were descended from trained rats who might have inherited this epigenetically but it was all rats of that breed even ones whose parents had never been in a water maze before.
784000	792000	Now I think the same is happening in the human realm. I think it's getting easier to learn things other people have already learned. There's already lots of evidence for this.
793000	810000	IQ tests for example have got at least 30% the scores on average scores on intelligence tests have got at least 30% higher over the last decade so over throughout the 20th century ever since they were invented in 1918.
811000	823000	There's no independent evidence that people are getting smarter. If anything they're not doing as well on other exams you know because of dumbing down effects of TV etc low attention spans.
824000	831000	I think they're getting the IQ scores are going up because so many people have done the same tests they get easier to do.
832000	844000	And I would predict that wordle should be getting easier to do throughout the day from the moment it's published in the morning throughout the day as it goes on and every single day there's a new wordle puzzle.
845000	851000	And I would predict if you could get access to the data that there would be an increasing rate of score throughout the day.
851000	861000	I first got onto this through people writing and telling me in the 1980s that they find the times crossword puzzle easier to do if they did it in the evening or the next day.
862000	872000	And some people had noticed this anyway. They left it till the evening to do it. It was more satisfying to be able to succeed with more clues.
873000	877000	And so I think Morphic Residence is working in these very practical things.
878000	889000	When I thought of testing using wordle as a test the very day I thought of it I wrote to the inventor of wordle but that very day it was bought by the New York Times.
890000	899000	And so I tried to get the New York Times to let me see the data and I thought cold calling New York Times wasn't going to work.
899000	915000	So one of Merlin's friends is an editor at the New York Times. So through Merlin's friend I got access to the head of games at the New York Times and asked her if we could look at the data from the point of view of seeing if this was really happening.
916000	922000	And she was terrible spoilsport. She just wrote back saying the games department are not interested in this project at this time.
923000	933000	So unfortunately they've got all this data and it's can't get hands on it but there's something called chordle and octordle and what are the other ones children.
934000	943000	There's all these other versions of wordle which may be more accessible for looking at the data.
944000	947000	I'm going to try and get in touch with them when I get back to England.
948000	956000	So I think that there have already been quite a number of experiments on learning. Morphic resonance facilitated learning.
957000	964000	And it should affect learning. It should be easier to learn things lots of people have learned and the more that learn it the easier it should get.
965000	971000	And this should apply to skateboarding, snowboarding, windsurfing, you know all these new physical skills as well as mental skills.
972000	980000	And when I talk to people in those areas of activity many of them say yes indeed people are getting easier to teach.
981000	987000	But the trouble is you can't disentangle better equipment designs, training videos etc from Morphic resonance.
988000	995000	So it's hard to use that as evidence. One needs more special situations and wordle would be really good for this.
995000	1013000	So this hypothesis is still controversial and many scientists are scared of it really because it would overthrow so much of established science.
1014000	1022000	Actually business as usual could still go on because if a habit is strongly enough established it behaves almost as if it's governed by an eternal law.
1022000	1031000	The habits of hydrogen atoms which have been going on for 13 billion years probably you hardly tell the difference from an eternal law.
1032000	1044000	But when something is new that's when you notice the difference and that's why to test Morphic resonance you have to look at new patterns of behaviour, new forms of animals, new chemicals, new crystals etc.
1044000	1055000	Now this has many implications in different realms of science and one is for inheritance in biology.
1056000	1065000	Living organisms inherit a great deal from their ancestors and the usual assumption is that this is genetic.
1066000	1069000	Many people use the words hereditary and genetic as synonyms.
1069000	1076000	If it's inherited it must be in the DNA. DNA is a chemical molecule and we know what DNA does.
1077000	1087000	It enables cells to make proteins by spelling out the sequence of amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins which are strings of amino acids which then fold up.
1088000	1093000	But DNA spells out the sequence of amino acids in the primary string within a protein.
1094000	1101000	Well that's what it does and some DNA controls the activity of other DNA switches on and off genes.
1102000	1111000	But making the right proteins doesn't equate to the shape of your face or your arms or your legs it just enables you to have the right proteins.
1112000	1117000	It's rather like saying having the right building materials would explain a house or a cabin.
1117000	1127000	It doesn't. You have to have them to build the house or cabin but the architectural plan is not in the genes or in the building materials or in the DNA.
1128000	1136000	And I think that it's inherited through morphic resonance through the forms of previous organisms.
1137000	1155000	When the human genome project was completed in 2000 the assumption was that they'd soon be able to predict all details of human beings based on the genome and that you could patent genes and that you'd be able to predict exactly which diseases people would get with great accuracy and so on.
1156000	1168000	It turned out not to work out that way at all. Soon after the human genome was sequenced there was the share price of these genome sequencing companies collapsed.
1168000	1193000	Celera genomics, the private genome company headed by Craig Venter, collapsed from $64 a share to about $0.15 and shortly afterwards when interviewed Craig Venter said I'm a guy who's made a million the hard way by working my way down from a billion and it turned out to be almost useless.
1194000	1213000	By 2008 it had become clear in biology that there was a major problem called the missing heritability problem that if you knew all the genes of a person you could predict the likelihood of breast cancer or schizophrenia or something like that
1213000	1228000	with an accuracy of less than 10% with schizophrenia is about 3% even for height which is a fairly obvious physical characteristic you can only explain about 10% in terms of genes.
1229000	1244000	So where's all the rest of the inheritance coming from and this is called within biology the missing heritability problem. Part of it I think is due to epigenetics which is the inheritance of acquired characters.
1244000	1255000	Those of you who were at school or university in the 20th century will know that this was the biggest taboo in biology, the inheritance of acquired characters, the marking inheritance.
1256000	1273000	It was really bad if anyone believed in that and there was sort of hissing noises and stuff and it was just the worst heresy in biology. It's now mainstream, it definitely happens, it's been rebranded epigenetic inheritance and it's one of the hottest areas of biological research.
1274000	1289000	I think quite a bit of it depends on morphic resonance. So the whole subject of heredity and evolution is now up for grabs in a way that didn't seem very likely in the 20th century when neo Darwinism based on selfish genes was the dominant theory.
1289000	1313000	There's now extended evolutionary synthesis which is a much broader theory of evolution that's not just based on genes but on epigenetics, on cultural inheritance, on the ability of organisms to modify their environment, much broader and more inclusive theory than this narrow and rather shrill neo Darwinism that many of us grew up with.
1313000	1327000	This is now mainstream, the extended evolutionary synthesis, there's papers in nature on it, there's papers in science and all the main journals and it's basically what most people who are active in this field believe nowadays.
1327000	1356000	Neo Darwinism was a passing phase and a very narrow phase in the history of biology. One aspect of this is the study of identical twins. As all of you know, there used to be a lot of studies, and there still are, of identical twins separated soon after birth in order to find out how to do that.
1357000	1375000	How much of human nature depends on genetics and on the environment. It turns out that identical twins separated soon after birth have a huge number of features in common, not just their physical appearance but in the Minnesota twin studies involving thousands of pairs of twins.
1376000	1389000	Ridiculously detailed things like painting their houses the same colour, calling their kids by the same names, not the kinds of things even the most ardent neo Darwinian would expect to be encoded in the genes.
1390000	1407000	That was one reason why people thought genetics accounted for so much of inheritance from these identical twin studies and the usual alternatives were environment or genes or a mixture of both.
1408000	1419000	So when it turns out there's all these enormous similarities people said well it's primarily genes and that was really the foundation of the whole edifice of selfish gene theory.
1420000	1438000	Well if morphic resonance is taking place the very fact that they're identical or at least very similar means they'd specifically resonate with each other across space and time even if they're living in separate places and in separate families and there'd be a great deal of connection between them and similarity.
1438000	1446000	So what this evidence may suggest is that morphic resonance is going on rather than it's all due to the genes.
1446000	1456000	And when you think about similarity if you ask yourself the question who in the past is most similar to me now the answer is you.
1456000	1469000	You're most similar to yourself in the past, I'm most similar to myself in the past, the most specific resonance acting on me is from my past, the most specific resonance acting on you is from your past.
1469000	1482000	And I think that's why we retain our form because we resonate with our past forms even though the proteins and the cells are continually changing, turning over and I think it's how memories work.
1482000	1499000	Now the materialist conventional theory of memory is of course that all memories are stored inside the brain, everything you remember somewhere stored inside your head either in a DNA molecule, a phosphorylated protein or the favourite theory, modified nerve endings, synapses.
1500000	1508000	But despite a hundred years of trying to find memory traces they've proved elusive over and over and over again.
1508000	1519000	But instead of scientists think well maybe they don't exist, they'll say well we need billions more dollars to look even further and to have even more detailed studies.
1519000	1535000	And I think the reason they haven't found them is very simple, they're not there. Just as if I came to analyse your TV set to see what you'd watched last night and analyse the wires and transistors, I wouldn't find out what programme you'd watched last night, it's not how it works.
1536000	1555000	So I think that the memories I don't think are stored in the brain, if you damage the brain you can certainly affect memories, if you damage a TV set you can affect the pictures or the sounds, but it doesn't prove they're all produced inside the TV set, it proves it's necessary for their processing, reception etc.
1556000	1575000	Now, memories, morphic resonance also applies to social groups, flocks of birds, schools of fish, termite colonies. A termite colony, the members of it can remember from previous genera, previous termite colonies, how to do that architecture.
1575000	1595000	Each individual termite is blind and they move little bits of mud, put them in exactly the right place to produce these prodigious structures. Millions of termites can live in a single colony, they can build mountains that are 10 feet high, with complex tunnels and passageways and ventilation shafts and so on.
1596000	1610000	How and asked does a tiny termite know where to put a little ball of mud? I think they're within a field, the morphic field of the termite colony and the individuals are responding to this field which has an inherent memory.
1611000	1623000	There's no way this can be programmed in proteins that they make in so just switching on or off genes that make the right proteins. So I think social groups have morphic resonance as well.
1623000	1649000	And where this affects us is that families are social groups and families have a kind of memory in the family field. And when we start new families, when people get married or live together and have children and start a new family, both the parents have family fields, they bring with them a field from their family of origin.
1649000	1671000	And the families are kind of hybrid between these two family fields. And some families are more complicated of course with step parents and so on. But to take the simplest case, you'd have two family fields, both with a kind of history, a pattern formed in previous generations.
1672000	1686000	And the kind of work that happens in family constellation therapy depends very much on these family fields. And I know more about this than some because Jill has been practicing this for many years.
1686000	1706000	My wife, Jill Perse, who's here, and has, through her work and through the work of others, it becomes clear that the people's behavior is shaped by the family field, often by unconscious habitual patterns from previous generations, of which people are often completely unaware.
1707000	1727000	And individuals within those families may behave in ways that individual psychotherapy can't really deal with because, for example, if in previous generations someone's been excluded from the family because they've committed suicide, committed a crime, done something shameful, or for whatever reason they've been excluded,
1727000	1738000	then in a later generation, one member of the family may unconsciously identify with the excluded person and exclude themselves by behaving in a dysfunctional way or becoming suicidal.
1739000	1749000	And individual psychotherapy just can't get to the bottom of this because it's not an individual problem. It's to do with something that's within the habitual field of the family.
1750000	1765000	And family constellation therapy is extraordinarily effective in bringing to light these patterns. And I can't describe it all now, there isn't time, but there are representatives for different members of the family selected from the group.
1766000	1786000	And those representatives, someone who's standing in for the mother, the father, the brother, the sister, and so on, often speak, when they're asked how they feel, often speak in a very appropriate way about their situation in that family field, even though they don't know very much about the family at all,
1786000	1791000	and they somehow come through as if they channel it from the field.
1792000	1802000	There are now many people doing this work, but Joel has been doing it for years and has now developed an extraordinarily effective way of doing it online, perforce through Covid.
1803000	1814000	Her first actual in-person mum for three years was here at Holly Hawk last month, but she does them online, there's one coming up quite soon, when Joel, is it?
1816000	1825000	9 September, so it's amazing that these fields work on Zoom, even when the participants and the representatives can be hundreds of miles apart.
1826000	1828000	I mean, I'm amazed it works, but it does.
1829000	1834000	That again, I think, is an example of morphic fields and morphic resonance working through them.
1835000	1842000	Now, I want to deal with two or three more examples here where morphic resonance touches are in lives.
1842000	1853000	One is through rituals. All cultures and societies have rituals, and rituals involve reenacting a story of origins, not all rituals.
1854000	1867000	Some myths of origins and rituals of remembrance are about reenacting a story of the group's origin, and by reenacting it, people participate in it and affirm their identity.
1868000	1876000	For example, for Jewish people, the festival of Passover is extremely important, and it reenacts the story of the original Passover.
1877000	1890000	Jewish people were slaves in Egypt. There were a series of curses or plagues visited on the Egyptians to let them go, and the tenth one involved killing all the firstborn of the Egyptians and their cattle.
1891000	1900000	The Jewish people escaped this by smearing the blood of a lamb on the doorways of their houses. They were passed over.
1901000	1910000	For Jewish people, reenacting this story through the Passover feast or dinner is a key part of being Jewish and telling the story.
1911000	1922000	Present-day Jewish people and children are brought within this field of being Jewish through reenacting a ritual meal, which recreates that original meal.
1923000	1931000	Rituals are highly conservative. They involve the right food, the right gestures, the right words. They have to be done in a very similar way to the way they've been done before.
1932000	1947000	The Christian Holy Communion itself, a Passover dinner with Jesus and his disciples, is reenacted in the Eucharist or the Mass in churches all over the world every Sunday, in fact every day, in many churches and cathedrals.
1948000	1957000	It is, again, a reenacting of that original act, and it has to be done in the right way, the right gestures, the right ceremony, the right procedure.
1958000	1972000	The American Thanksgiving dinner is an example of a secular or national ritual commemorating the survival of the first colonizers of the New World from England and from Europe,
1973000	1990000	giving thanks for their surviving in the New World, and reenacting that Thanksgiving dinner every year makes Americans and Canadians in the Canadian Thanksgiving affirm their identity and their connection with all those who've done it before, right back to the first time.
1991000	2009000	Now, there are countless rituals all religions and societies have them, and they generally have this very conservative quality. It has to be done the same way, and I think the reason that that works is that by doing it in the similar way as possible, the right chance, the right words, the gestures, etc.
2010000	2022000	In the right liturgical language, Sanskrit is the language of Hindu rituals, Old Slavic of Russian Orthodox rituals, Ancient Egyptian of Coptic rituals in the Coptic Church in Egypt.
2022000	2033000	These highly conservative use of ancient languages is because by doing it in the way it's been done before, you connect with those who've done it before you. That's the whole point of doing it.
2033000	2049000	And if Morphic resonance is happening, you see this provides a very natural explanation for why rituals really do connect participants with the ancestors with those who've gone before, why there really is a presence of the past through these rituals.
2050000	2073000	The same principles apply on the smaller scale to mantras, which are sacred phrases or words which are used in meditation and in rituals and in prayers, and mantras are not meaningful statements usually, they're not necessarily words that tell you some information.
2073000	2092000	The whole point of the mantra is that by chanting the mantra, your body physically resonates. If you're doing it with other people, you resonate with other people by chanting together because you're doing it at the same time and you're in resonance with others, and you resonate with all those who've done that mantra before.
2093000	2106000	And again, this is something I've learned a lot about from Jill, who in her sound workshops, sound and voice workshops, teaches the very principles of mantra and you get to experience them directly.
2106000	2115000	So again, this fits very well with the idea of Morphic resonance. It would be hard to understand the power of mantras without something like Morphic resonance.
2116000	2143000	Similar principles also apply to holy places, and one of the things that I do in England is that I help with the work of something called the British Pilgrimage Trust, which I helped found, which is opening footpath pilgrimages to the holy places of England, including cathedrals, churches, holy wells, ancient trees, stone circles and other holy places.
2143000	2156000	And these are footpath pilgrimages you walk on foot. There's a big revival of pilgrimage going on all over Europe at the moment, the iconic pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.
2156000	2169000	In 1987, when the first of the sort of modern version of the pilgrimage got going, a thousand people walked it. In 2019, 330,000 people walked it.
2169000	2191000	There's been a huge increase in pilgrimage in Europe, and not only from people who are devout Catholics or religious people. In the British Pilgrimage Trust, when we have organised pilgrimages that people can join in, groups can go together, one of the slogans for these pilgrimages, B-Y-O-B, bring your own beliefs.
2192000	2205000	When people go to holy places, say you go to one of our great Gothic medieval cathedrals, whatever your belief system, these have an enormously powerful effect on most people.
2205000	2215000	They were built to change consciousness. Their vast structures designed to expand your mind. The stained glass windows have a kind of psychedelic quality.
2215000	2223000	In the Middle Ages, when people lived in drab grey huts and things, this must have been even more powerful than it is today.
2223000	2232000	One reason that sacred places have this power, I think, is that when you enter them, you come into resonance with other people who've been in that place before.
2232000	2250000	If they've had visionary or inspiring experiences there, or many have prayed there, or given thanks there, then that's part of your experience. You tune into that, and these places have a particular power, which I think depends on morphic resonance from those who've been there before.
2250000	2263000	Of course, you can have places where bad things have happened, like battlefields, where there can be a negative feeling, and that, again, would be a morphic resonance with the negative emotions of those who've been there before.
2264000	2279000	In the form of seasonal festivals, we have another collective form of celebration, which is found all over the world in all cultures, where people celebrate together.
2280000	2295000	It's one of the ways in which societies and families acquire cohesion through celebrating together. That collective celebration is essential, really, for building positive communities.
2295000	2313000	Seasonal festivals have always done this in all cultures, and we still have them, even in very secular countries like modern Britain. Christmas is still a hugely important seasonal festival, even for people who are not religious believers at Easter.
2313000	2333000	All cultures have their seasonal festivals, and, again, you have the same morphic resonance properties. Christmas has Christmas carols, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, Snowman's song, Jingle bells, all that kind of thing, which all sound hopelessly out of place if you hear them in bright summer's day.
2333000	2349000	But because they're appropriate to that season, and it falls in that season, there's this resonance with those who've taken part before. So I think all of us come within that field of resonance, and as spiritual practices, what they do is connect us.
2349000	2367000	Spiritual practices are about connection. Meditation is about connection to a deeper source of consciousness. The spiritual practices of rituals connect you with others who are doing the ritual and connect you with the ancestors and those who've done them before.
2367000	2382000	And with the primal transcendent event, which is some special event, a divinely inspired event, which they're commemorating. So they're all about connection, and seasonal festivals have this quality too.
2382000	2398000	One of the great periods of seasonal festivals in Britain and all over Europe was Midsummer's Day, which is June the 24th, just after the solstice, just as Christmas is just after the winter solstice, Midsummer's Day is just after the summer solstice.
2399000	2411000	And it's interesting that the Glastonbury Festival, the biggest music festival in England, the most iconic of all our summer festivals, happens over Midsummer's Day.
2411000	2423000	Midsummer's Day is the Feast of St John the Baptist, and Pilton, the village where the Glastonbury Festival happens, is the patron saint of Pilton happens to be St John the Baptist.
2423000	2433000	And I once went to a service on a Sunday in the Glastonbury Festival. I was staying, I was at the festival, but I make a practice of going to church on Sundays wherever I am.
2433000	2445000	And so I went to the ancient parish church at Pilton, and there was the festival in the background. And I said to the vicar, the priest, I said, you've got the biggest patronal festival of any village in England.
2445000	2454000	And he just looked a bit puzzled, and then he realised what I was saying, and he sort of chuckled. And yes indeed, this is a very ancient tradition.
2454000	2474000	And here on Cortes we've had a new revival of that kind of tradition in the Love Fest or Summer of Love, which those of you who live on the island may have been to recently, is again a revival of this kind of principle of seasonal festival.
2474000	2487000	And joint and collective celebration with music and dancing and happy celebration.
2487000	2501000	So these are some of the ways in which I think Morphic Resonance touches our own lives. It underlies our growth, our development, our memories, our collective life, our festivals, rituals, celebrations.
2502000	2514000	And I think Morphic Resonance is, as I was saying before, inherent in all of nature. We experience its human forms and its cultural forms.
2514000	2522000	But I think it applies to all self-organising systems in nature. Not everything in nature is self-organising.
2523000	2537000	It may be worth spelling out what it is. Atoms are self-organising. They make themselves molecules, and the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, oxygen molecules, nitrogen molecules, they're not made in factories.
2537000	2548000	They're self-organising. Planets are self-organising. Stars are self-organising. Galaxies are self-organising. Animals and plants are self-organising. Crystals are self-organising.
2548000	2559000	Termite societies are self-organising. But chairs are not self-organising. They're made in factories. Tables aren't self-organising. Rocks are not self-organising.
2559000	2574000	Because although the crystals within them are, if a big rock falls down a mountain and splinters into lots of little bits, those little bits were risen because of external forces, not because that's how the rock grows.
2575000	2584000	And computers are not self-organising. They're made in factories. Computer programmes are not self-organising. They're programmed by computer programmers.
2584000	2590000	So none of these systems would have morphic resonance, chairs, tables, computers and so on.
2591000	2610000	And that's one reason I think that artificial intelligence is very unlikely to be truly intelligent, because it's programmed into computers which are mechanistic machine-like systems, which are deterministic, which don't have that capacity to self-organise and therefore to have a kind of memory.
2610000	2639000	You have to build in a solid state memory into disks or magnetic tapes or whatever in computers. If we had a truly living technology, it would never be a digital computer, I think, but possibly analog computers, possibly quantum computers, if they get to a state where they have a holistic property which really is self-organising, then they may have their own memory by morphic resonance and they may connect up with other similar computers all around the world in a kind of collective memory.
2639000	2651000	A new technology could possibly emerge in the artificial intelligence computer world, but not with digital computers, possibly with analog or quantum computers.
2652000	2660000	So by recognising what's self-organising and what isn't, it makes it easier to understand what things may have their own memory.
2660000	2674000	And in the modern philosophy of panpsychism, the idea of mind in all things in atoms, molecules, crystals, stars, galaxies, this is becoming surprisingly fashionable in the academic world at the moment.
2675000	2681000	Again, this would apply only to self-organising systems, not to tables, chairs, computers and socks.
2681000	2687000	I mean, this is a common repost of skeptics when people say they're panpsychists.
2687000	2694000	So you mean my socks are conscious? No, that's not what they're saying and I'm not saying they have morphic resonance.
2694000	2706000	So I think self-organising things throughout nature, things which are basically alive, animate or self-organising, have this kind of memory.
2706000	2712000	And the entire universe is self-organising, so the whole universe would have a kind of cosmic memory.
2713000	2727000	Now finally, a though morphic resonance helps to explain many aspects of nature, what it explains is repetition and the maintenance of things.
2727000	2736000	If you're familiar with the Hindu pantheon of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, Brahma is the sort of creator.
2736000	2745000	Vishnu is the preserver who keeps the order of the universe and Shiva is the creator who creates and destroys and is the creative principle.
2745000	2751000	Well, morphic resonance is more the Vishnu principle, it's the principle of preservation of form and order.
2751000	2757000	It's a conservative principle because it enables patterns to be repeated, orders to be sustained.
2757000	2763000	But it doesn't explain creativity, doesn't explain where new forms come from and new order appears.
2763000	2771000	So within the universe within evolution has to be a creative principle as well and that's another story.
2771000	2776000	I'm not going to talk about that now because there isn't time and it's a huge topic.
2776000	2780000	But evolution has to involve an interplay of habit and creativity.
2780000	2784000	If there were any habit there would be repetition and only repetition.
2784000	2792000	If there were only creativity there would be a constant display of novelty but nothing would ever stabilise, there would be a kind of chaos.
2792000	2799000	What we have is an interplay between these two, both in the entire cosmos and in our own lives.
2800000	2807000	So those are a few words about morphic resonance and how it affects our lives and I'll leave it at that for now.
2807000	2835000	Thank you, there's at some time for Q&A and I've asked Aiton to pick the questioners so I don't, because I can't see everyone very well, especially people at the back.
2835000	2837000	And he's got a raving microphone.
2837000	2842000	And I'm passing the hat now. Martha, get that started for me. Thank you.
2845000	2849000	Erika, but before Erika I wanted to ask a question.
2849000	2851000	I'm first in line.
2851000	2860000	There are many people who postulate that the trance state is a fundamental need of humans.
2860000	2869000	And I was just wondering if you could talk about the relationship between trance states and morphic resonance.
2869000	2878000	You mean as in sort of dance-induced trances and drug-induced trances and so on.
2878000	2885000	Well, I think those, as states of consciousness, they'd have their own field and organising principles.
2885000	2889000	And I think that those would also have a kind of morphic field.
2889000	2904000	For example, I think that psychedelic experiences, when you take a particular psychedelic, then the pattern of change in your own brain and mind would resonate with that of other people who've taken the same psychedelic in the past.
2904000	2914000	So if you have a psychedelic like ayahuasca, which has been taken in tribal societies in the Amazon with mythologies about jaguars and serpents and so on.
2914000	2925000	If people who know nothing about Amazon mythologies take ayahuasca in modern urban settings, then some of them may see jaguars and serpents, and indeed some do.
2925000	2936000	I think that this is not because the molecules of ayahuasca trigger jaguar molecules in the brain, but because they tune you in to those who've done it before.
2936000	2944000	Now, it doesn't explain how trans states originate in the first place, because morphic resonance doesn't explain creativity.
2944000	2951000	But it does explain how, when you're in a particular kind of trans state, you'd resonate with others who've been in a similar state.
2951000	2954000	So there'd be a trans personal aspect to them.
2954000	2963000	Hello.
2963000	2983000	I'm curious, and this question isn't fully formed, but I'm curious about relations who've passed, and if you can, in the present, resonate with them,
2983000	2988000	not in the past, but in the present.
2988000	2990000	Resonate with what?
2990000	2999000	With relations who have passed, and so not resonating to what they were, but what they are.
2999000	3010000	Well, I mean morphic resonance is usually from the past to the present, but you could say that if something's a millisecond in the past, it would be almost the same as in the present.
3010000	3018000	I think that something like that underlies telepathy, which is a kind of resonance between people in the present.
3018000	3028000	It's different from memory, because it is more or less in the present, and the whole point of telepathy tells you what's going on for other people now.
3028000	3032000	So it's not exactly the same as morphic resonance, but it's closely related.
3032000	3034000	What do you mean by ancestors?
3034000	3048000	Well, ancestors, as I mentioned in the ancestral field, the ancestors influence us continually, both directly through resonance with us personally.
3048000	3056000	Individual ancestors may, our parents and our grandparents and other ancestors may influence us directly by resonance.
3056000	3067000	But then the ancestral families, although not just the individuals, but the way they related to each other within our parents' family, our grandparents' family, our great-grandparents' family,
3067000	3074000	those then would resonate with our families in the present, but individuals would resonate with us as individuals.
3074000	3079000	So you have both the individual and the family resonances working on us in the present.
3079000	3092000	So I think we're greatly influenced by ancestors and the past, and sometimes people have skills or abilities or interests which are very similar to those of grandparents or something,
3092000	3096000	even if they never knew their grandparents had these interests.
3096000	3099000	So I think this is very much part of our nature.
3099000	3103000	Part of our heredity is this resonance with the past and our ancestors.
3103000	3107000	Genes are part of it, but as I said, there's much more to it than just genes.
3110000	3133000	I'm curious, though I see that sort of past connection, but I'm curious if you can resonate with, you know, or what you're saying, sort of telepathy with an ancestor who has passed sort of currently rather than what they were.
3134000	3138000	Oh, you mean if they're in the afterlife and you're resonating with them? No.
3138000	3143000	Well, that's a much more complicated question because it depends on what form we survive in.
3143000	3156000	And one thing that is relevant to this that I should have pointed out or could have pointed out is that if memories are not stored in our brains, then they're not all destroyed at death.
3156000	3164000	The usual of materialist assumption is that all our memories are inside our heads and our brains and everyone agrees the brain decays after death.
3164000	3168000	And so for materialists, all memories are wiped out totally.
3168000	3173000	Therefore, there's no possibility of survival of bodily death in any form whatever.
3173000	3183000	This is one reason that materialists are atheists and that atheists are materialists because it refutes all religions because they all have some belief in survival of death.
3184000	3190000	Now, whether in what kind of state our ancestors go on existing is another question.
3190000	3202000	The popular Catholic vision of this is beautifully embodied in that Disney film Coco, which about the Mexican Day of the Dead, where people relate to the ancestors.
3202000	3208000	Now, I myself think it's important to relate to the ancestors on November the same, all souls day.
3209000	3213000	Now, I always do some kind of ceremony for my ancestors.
3213000	3217000	Most Catholic and Anglican churches have services for all souls day.
3217000	3224000	And Chill does workshops over all souls day.
3224000	3230000	And they include a requiem mass at our parish church in Hampstead, which our priest conducts.
3230000	3236000	And the people in her workshops are relating to their ancestors through that.
3236000	3241000	Some would never normally go to church, some are Jewish, some are atheists, etc.
3241000	3247000	But it's very meaningful in the context Chill sets of where you're relating to those who've gone before.
3247000	3250000	So these are traditional ways of doing it.
3251000	3270000	So is that why if we heal ourself in this lifetime of something through Chill's work or something like that, then we also can heal backwards and forwards?
3270000	3277000	Because of his morphic resonance, something that would explain that phenomena that people feel is possible.
3278000	3287000	Like stopping the cycle of abuse in your lifetime and healing backwards generations and forward generations.
3287000	3294000	Well, that would be the kind of thing that I would expect, but it would be hard to prove that.
3294000	3303000	I mean, if the family field is healed through these practices, then I would expect it to affect people thereafter.
3304000	3318000	To what degree it acts retroactively, you know, whether the actual ancestors 100 years ago are through time travel from Chill's workshops affected by what's happening in the workshop.
3318000	3329000	No, we can't test that really, but whether the ancestors in the afterlife, whatever form it takes for them are affected, that seems to be perfectly possible, but that can only be speculative.
3334000	3341000	Thank you very much for sharing these views. It's fascinating.
3341000	3349000	My question is, do you hope that the residence is quantifiable, and if so, where would you look?
3349000	3354000	Well, you'd study it through its effects.
3354000	3361000	It works through fields, morphic fields, and in science you study fields through their effects.
3361000	3367000	You study gravitational fields through gravitational effects, electric fields through electric effects, and so on.
3367000	3372000	And the resonance of morphic resonance, you'd study through its effects.
3372000	3380000	So if, for example, you train a rat to learn a new trick, then you can see whether a rat a thousand miles away learns it quicker.
3380000	3392000	And then if you train a thousand rats, say on Cortis Island, to learn a new trick, would rats far away learn it much quicker than if one had done it here?
3392000	3394000	And the evidence suggests they do.
3394000	3398000	So the bigger the influence, the bigger the effect.
3398000	3401000	And so you can actually study it through its effects.
3402000	3412000	And at present, the experiments so far what they seem to show is that the bigger the number of individuals, the greater the effect.
3412000	3415000	But there also may be an intensity factor.
3415000	3422000	People who learn things that involve very intense learning programme may have a greater effect than people who just superficially learn something.
3422000	3427000	So all of these are empirical questions, really.
3427000	3429000	So you study it through the effects.
3429000	3437000	You wouldn't expect to be able to study it through some electrical meter that you hold up in the air, because you can't even study gravitation through an electrical meter.
3437000	3444000	You can study electricity and magnetism through electric meters, but not gravitation or quantum fields.
3444000	3448000	So you have to study things through their own appropriate effects.
3449000	3464000	I had a thought when you were talking about, yes, we're designed to be both habitual and creative.
3464000	3470000	And I think you said morphic resonance doesn't really explain creativity.
3470000	3479000	The thought I had is, because in psychotherapy, you know, with family constellations, Hakomi, which is what I'm trained in,
3479000	3489000	I love to normalise the fact that we're habitual, and it seems to me that the bridge to creativity is consciousness.
3491000	3496000	Well, I agree. I think certainly in our own case, the bridge to creativity is consciousness.
3497000	3504000	Although when people have a creative insight, it comes through consciousness rather than from it.
3504000	3509000	You know, people would say it came to me in a flash or it came to me in a dream or something like that.
3509000	3517000	So consciousness may be the medium through which we get it, but not necessarily through which we make it.
3517000	3524000	There are traditional views of creativity in the Greek world, for example, of the muses.
3524000	3529000	There are creative spirits that work through us. That's why music is called music.
3529000	3539000	The music of music works through musicians, and that's why you have museums where the human arts, all governed by the muses, are collected together.
3539000	3546000	In India, if you go to a classical music concert in South India, it will start with an invocation to the goddess of music.
3546000	3551000	Saraswati, to inspire the performers and the musicians.
3551000	3559000	And in the Christian tradition, the angels which are creative spirits and the Holy Spirit itself work through us.
3559000	3570000	So creativity traditionally is understood in the human realm through inspiration, the breathing in of the spirit, of the creative spirit from beyond us and through us.
3570000	3575000	And it's mediated through our consciousness, but not originating within it.
3575000	3584000	And of course these are speculations, but when most creative people talk about the creative process, they usually say they don't know where it came from.
3584000	3591000	It came in a flash, that kind of thing. It came as it were from outside, coming through them.
3592000	3605000	I have one other kind of fun thought when we were talking about how it shows up in the way people learn things.
3605000	3616000	You know, golfers are so much better now than they were. Even the ones who are golfing now and winning, they're so much better than Tiger Woods even was.
3616000	3631000	And wouldn't it be fun to get some of these awesome golfers to play with old equipment and I think what would be demonstrated is they're still hitting the ball farther than Tiger Woods was?
3631000	3646000	That's a very good point. Yes, I mean in most sports there's been an improvement in skills and that's a very good experimental test to use the old equipment and see if they're still good at it.
3646000	3662000	I know we're talking about memory and stuff, but I'm wondering if there's a way to resonate with future happenings.
3662000	3670000	I'm interested in kind of prophetic dreams and visions and stuff and if we can tap into things in the future.
3671000	3681000	I think we can, but I don't think that's through morphic resonance. Morphic resonance is mainly about habits and the more habitual something is, the more unconscious it is.
3681000	3689000	I think that we are open to the future in ways that are more related to the kind of creative aspects of consciousness.
3690000	3700000	I think there's no doubt that precognitive dreams occur. People have premonitions, people have dreams about events in the future, not all the time.
3703000	3715000	Animals can feel the future too. I mean the warnings of earthquakes and tsunamis by dogs, cats and many kinds of wild animals suggest that they're able to feel what's about to happen.
3715000	3722000	And there's a phenomenon called pre-sentiment where humans can feel what's about to happen a few seconds in advance.
3722000	3728000	This is something that parapsychologists like Dean Radin have studied, I think very convincingly.
3728000	3735000	So I think that we are open to the future, not all the time, not as reliably as we're open to the past.
3735000	3743000	These pre-sentiments don't work as reliably as memory does, but they definitely seem to happen.
3743000	3752000	No-one knows quite how or why. And there's all sorts of speculative theories, but it's really not understood how it works.
3752000	3760000	But I'm sure it happens. I myself have studied, in my book, the sense of being stared at and other aspects of the extended mind.
3760000	3766000	I discuss human pre-sentiments, precognitive dreams and this openness to the future.
3767000	3773000	In my book, dogs that know when their owners are coming home and other unexplained powers of animals,
3773000	3780000	I discuss earthquake warning by animals and tsunami warnings and air raid warnings and that kind of thing.
3780000	3785000	Epileptic seizure dogs that give warnings of seizures and so on.
3785000	3790000	So I think this ability is deep in our biological nature, it's not specifically human.
3790000	3794000	But if you stand under that tree you can be Newton.
3794000	3800000	Yes, well we've got a perfect demonstration of gravitation going on here.
3803000	3806000	Oh heavens, we've got to visit from this tank.
3812000	3815000	Come for the food, stay for the talk.
3818000	3822000	Well we're running late a bit late now, I'm sure we have just one more.
3824000	3842000	Hi Rupert. My question is whether morphic resonance could be interrupted or disrupted at all.
3842000	3848000	Well I don't think it can be sort of screened out by a faraday cage or anything like that.
3848000	3855000	But it can be competed with, I mean you can have competing resonances.
3855000	3863000	For example if you make a hybrid between two species like a mule is a hybrid between a horse and a donkey,
3863000	3869000	then you get both influences working and not all the horse influences would come through,
3869000	3874000	not all the donkey influences but you'd have a kind of mixture of them.
3874000	3884000	If you have in genetics, I think the reason most mutations and most new forms of organisms are recessive
3884000	3888000	is because they're rare, they're new things that haven't happened very much.
3888000	3893000	And if you cross a mutant with a recessive what's called a recessive gene,
3893000	3896000	I don't think it's really the gene that's recessive.
3896000	3901000	I think the fact that it's only happened a little bit before is what makes it recessive.
3901000	3908000	Cross it with the so-called wild type, then you'll no longer see this rare recessive characteristic.
3908000	3914000	The morphic resonance will be swamped by the more powerful regular resonance.
3914000	3923000	So the morphic resonance, the influence on the given organism or system from the past
3923000	3929000	is from countless other systems and if you want to neutralise one particular thing
3929000	3933000	then it can be overwhelmed by other ones.
3933000	3939000	Or you can change the tuning, so you tune into a different one, like on a TV set.
3939000	3946000	All those channels are broadcasting, change the tuning knob and you change the tuning to a different channel.
3946000	3949000	And that happens in developmental biology.
3949000	3955000	Sometimes you can change in fruit flies, for example, there's a pair of wings
3955000	3959000	and the segment behind it has halt hairs or balancing organs.
3959000	3964000	And there's a mutation called by thorax that changes the tuning of those
3964000	3967000	so that the halt hairs develop into another pair of wings.
3967000	3970000	So you get a four-winged fly instead of a two-winged fly.
3970000	3976000	And so there you've changed the resonance by switching the tuning to another channel.
3976000	3980000	So you can't exactly block it but you can change the tuning
3980000	3984000	or you can compete with it by other resonances that overwhelm it.
3984000	3991000	Good. Well, I think, Aiton, I think maybe that's...
3991000	3993000	Oh, yes, Charles.
3993000	4000000	You've been talking about the cosmology and the universes
4000000	4003000	and I'm just wondering if the pictures from the web telescope
4003000	4007000	have interested you or stimulated you in these thoughts.
4007000	4012000	The new pictures of the universes, the billions of them.
4013000	4017000	I haven't actually seen them yet, the new pictures from the web telescope
4017000	4021000	but I will do when I have the chance.
4021000	4026000	So I don't know that they change my actual view of what's going on fundamentally.
4026000	4031000	I mean, more and more galaxies, more and more stars, more detailed pictures of planets,
4031000	4040000	all that kind of thing is important but it doesn't change the basic fundamental principles
4040000	4044000	of gravity.
4044000	4049000	So, you know, the kinds of questions that interest me,
4049000	4054000	to what degree are these galaxies conscious and to what degree is the sun conscious
4054000	4056000	and for those of you who are interested in these things,
4056000	4060000	I published a paper recently in the Journal of Consciousness Studies called
4060000	4062000	Is the Sun Conscious?
4062000	4065000	To which I answer probably yes.
4065000	4068000	As we think about consciousness in the universe,
4068000	4073000	as we go beyond the cerebrocentric view of consciousness, it's just in brains,
4073000	4077000	we can then recognise that many things could be conscious in the universe.
4077000	4079000	Our ancestors thought that.
4079000	4085000	I mean, for the Greeks, all the stars and planets were living beings with their own minds.
4085000	4090000	Plato called the planets and the stars the living gods, the visible gods.
4090000	4096000	We can see them and yet they have minds and powers greater than our own.
4096000	4102000	And so, I think as we recover a sort of panpsychist sense of the universe
4102000	4108000	or animistic sense of the universe, then we can see what we see through the web telescope
4108000	4112000	or any other telescope or the Hubble telescope or whatever.
4112000	4115000	We can interpret them in a different way.
4115000	4119000	The actual image is neutral in the sense it doesn't tell us whether it's conscious or not
4119000	4124000	and the usual assumption of astronomers is this is just dead matter out there.
4124000	4128000	But I think we can see it in a completely different way,
4128000	4133000	in a way that may be more realistic, actually, that we live in a living universe.
4135000	4137000	Thanks, Rupert.
