Processing Overview for Hollyhock Life

Checking Hollyhock Life/Rupert Sheldrake on ＂How Morphic Resonance affects our memories, families, rituals and festivals.＂.txt
1. **Morphic Resonance vs. Faraday Cage**: Rupert Sheldrake discusses morphic resonance and how it can be influenced or overpowered by other resonances. Unlike electromagnetic signals that can be blocked by a Faraday cage, morphic resonance can be affected by competing influences or by changing the 'tuning' of the system in question, similar to how you might change channels on a TV to avoid interference.

2. **Genetics and Morphic Resonance**: He explains that rare mutations are often recessive because they haven't been expressed frequently in the past. When such a mutation is crossed with a 'wild type', the new characteristic may not be visible due to the dominance of the more common form.

3. **Developmental Biology Examples**: Rupert gives examples from developmental biology where changes in 'tuning' can lead to different expressions of traits, such as a fruit fly developing four wings instead of two due to a mutation that alters the resonance governing wing development.

4. **Web Telescope Images and Consciousness**: He mentions that while new images from the web telescope are important for detailed observations of the universe, they do not inherently tell us about consciousness. Rupert advocates for a broader view of consciousness in the universe, one that aligns with ancient Greek beliefs that stars and planets were living beings with their own minds.

5. **Panpsychism and the Universe**: Rupert suggests that as science progresses beyond a cerebrocentric view of consciousness (where consciousness is thought to originate solely within brains), we might come to recognize various forms of consciousness throughout the universe, including in celestial bodies like the sun. He believes this perspective could lead us to interpret cosmic phenomena in a more alive and conscious context.

Rupert's ideas challenge conventional scientific views by proposing that consciousness may not be limited to biological organisms but could be a fundamental aspect of the universe, a view that has roots in ancient cosmology.
