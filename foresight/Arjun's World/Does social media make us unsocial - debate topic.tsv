0	5920	Good morning everyone. I stand for the motion that social media makes us
5920	13200	unsocial. We live in an era where we prefer texting than conversations, online
13200	20280	chat than face-to-face meetings. Social media is in effect turning us into one
20280	27280	of the most unsocial generations. My first point to support is that social media
27280	33600	is creating a false friendship and later these are leading to emotional and
33600	39280	psychological problems. When one posts something in social media they're
39280	45200	looking for social acceptance and appreciation. Nowadays research shows
45200	49920	that there is something called Facebook depression. Not getting enough
49920	57440	feedback for one's post is leading to anxiety. The second harm of social
57440	63240	media is that it can become easily addictive, taking away family time and
63240	70360	personal time as well as diminish interpersonal skills. We really need the
70360	77360	comfort of family members when we have to celebrate a birth or when someone is
77360	84160	really sick. Mainly communicating to a person through Facebook or WhatsApp does
84160	91280	not solve the situation. A physical presence is very much required at those
91280	99280	critical stages of life. Lastly, social media has become a tool for criminals.
99280	104600	Many criminals have taken the advantage of social media to hide their
104640	112320	identity and commit several crimes. Several people have committed suicide
112320	119680	for playing games like blue ale etc. To sum up, the more social media we have, the
119680	124200	more we think we are connecting but actually we are disconnecting from each
124200	130640	other. Hence, I believe that social media makes us unsocial. Thank you.
