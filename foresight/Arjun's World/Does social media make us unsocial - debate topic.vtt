Good morning everyone. I stand for the motion that social media makes us

00:05.920 --> 00:13.200
unsocial. We live in an era where we prefer texting than conversations, online

00:13.200 --> 00:20.280
chat than face-to-face meetings. Social media is in effect turning us into one

00:20.280 --> 00:27.280
of the most unsocial generations. My first point to support is that social media

00:27.280 --> 00:33.600
is creating a false friendship and later these are leading to emotional and

00:33.600 --> 00:39.280
psychological problems. When one posts something in social media they're

00:39.280 --> 00:45.200
looking for social acceptance and appreciation. Nowadays research shows

00:45.200 --> 00:49.920
that there is something called Facebook depression. Not getting enough

00:49.920 --> 00:57.440
feedback for one's post is leading to anxiety. The second harm of social

00:57.440 --> 01:03.240
media is that it can become easily addictive, taking away family time and

01:03.240 --> 01:10.360
personal time as well as diminish interpersonal skills. We really need the

01:10.360 --> 01:17.360
comfort of family members when we have to celebrate a birth or when someone is

01:17.360 --> 01:24.160
really sick. Mainly communicating to a person through Facebook or WhatsApp does

01:24.160 --> 01:31.280
not solve the situation. A physical presence is very much required at those

01:31.280 --> 01:39.280
critical stages of life. Lastly, social media has become a tool for criminals.

01:39.280 --> 01:44.600
Many criminals have taken the advantage of social media to hide their

01:44.640 --> 01:52.320
identity and commit several crimes. Several people have committed suicide

01:52.320 --> 01:59.680
for playing games like blue ale etc. To sum up, the more social media we have, the

01:59.680 --> 02:04.200
more we think we are connecting but actually we are disconnecting from each

02:04.200 --> 02:10.640
other. Hence, I believe that social media makes us unsocial. Thank you.
