Good morning everyone. I stand for the motion that social media makes us

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,200
unsocial. We live in an era where we prefer texting than conversations, online

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,280
chat than face-to-face meetings. Social media is in effect turning us into one

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,280
of the most unsocial generations. My first point to support is that social media

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,600
is creating a false friendship and later these are leading to emotional and

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,280
psychological problems. When one posts something in social media they're

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,200
looking for social acceptance and appreciation. Nowadays research shows

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
that there is something called Facebook depression. Not getting enough

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,440
feedback for one's post is leading to anxiety. The second harm of social

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,240
media is that it can become easily addictive, taking away family time and

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,360
personal time as well as diminish interpersonal skills. We really need the

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,360
comfort of family members when we have to celebrate a birth or when someone is

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,160
really sick. Mainly communicating to a person through Facebook or WhatsApp does

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,280
not solve the situation. A physical presence is very much required at those

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,280
critical stages of life. Lastly, social media has become a tool for criminals.

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,600
Many criminals have taken the advantage of social media to hide their

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,320
identity and commit several crimes. Several people have committed suicide

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,680
for playing games like blue ale etc. To sum up, the more social media we have, the

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,200
more we think we are connecting but actually we are disconnecting from each

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,640
other. Hence, I believe that social media makes us unsocial. Thank you.
