0	12000	It's actually a joy to be here in Skye. Your brother ended up on a Greek island, you ended up on a Hebridean island. Who do you think won?
12000	20000	Oh, my brother. He was a sensible one. I could have made that decision for a long time ago.
20000	33000	Well, it feels extraordinary as a place. It feels like you're the end of the world. You could have ended up anywhere. You know, Trondlass and Oxford or whatever. Why?
33000	43000	I don't think I'd ever have ended up living in a city. I find it very important to be close to a wild and natural scene.
43000	59000	My brother and I shared a lot. When we were young, we just said there were two great places to live. One of them is the Scottish islands and the other is the Greek islands. He's ended up on the Greek islands and I've ended up in the Scottish islands.
60000	62000	You can live vicariously.
65000	80000	I came to see you eight years ago or so for the same project where I'd speak to influential and compelling thinkers about a question that they think you should be asking yourselves.
80000	101000	The question you offered them was, what is my culture preventing me from seeing? Since then, you've written a massive tome, which I have here, the matter with things. You've produced a huge amount. Is that still the question that you think we do well to start considering a bit more closely?
101000	120000	I think it's a very important question, because if you don't know what it is that's missing from your life, you won't know how to lead your life so as to rediscover the things that you no longer see.
120000	132000	So not knowing what it is you don't know is the fatal problem. Not knowing is fine, but knowing that you don't know is a very good position and exploring that.
132000	144000	But in our culture, we're encouraged to think that increasingly we know it all, that we've got it all worked out and we're organising life according to lines that we have set up.
145000	163000	And we're not aware of what it is that's gone missing. I think people of my age, I'm 71, see things having disappeared from life during their lifetime.
163000	177000	And I don't know quite how young people would know that these things were missing really, unless we were able to discuss them and open eyes to them.
178000	189000	So I wonder if we could begin by talking about what we, well maybe what you mean by seeing, attention as a moral act is kind of a shorthand for much of your work.
189000	193000	When you talk about what we're seeing, are you talking about what we're paying attention to?
193000	200000	I am, I'm not talking about visual sight, I'm talking about the things that we recognise and understand.
200000	212000	And though sight is a very important and powerful sense with which we get to know things in the world, it's not really what I'm talking about.
213000	221000	So what is it, I suppose, what is it that you think we are seeing and not seeing?
221000	228000	What are we paying attention to, to the exclusion of other things? What would be, say, examples of that?
229000	243000	Well, I think that we've been led to adopt and become enslaved by a certain way of looking at the world, which is mechanistic and reductionist.
244000	264000	And with that, a sense of values, a sense of purpose, a sense of there being something wonderful or inspiring and perhaps sacred in the world has gone missing.
265000	277000	And it's very sad that, it's not just my impression, but the research shows that a very large majority of young people over 80% think that their life is meaningless.
278000	295000	It may be that we've developed all kinds of gadgetry and technology, but nothing can really replace the sense of meaning by sheer material wherewithal.
296000	302000	So we value, we seem to be valuing what the left hemisphere values.
302000	308000	The left hemisphere is essentially in the service of utility.
308000	314000	The reason we have two hemispheres, and it's not just us, but all the creatures that we know have brains have two hemispheres.
314000	319000	And the difference is that they pay attention to the world in different ways.
319000	324000	And the left hemisphere's attention is in the service of utility.
324000	331000	It's a very narrowly targeted attention to something that's already known to be of value when it goes and gets it.
331000	338000	Now that is essentially how we look at what do we need, what would we like, what would make us more powerful, let's go for it and get it.
339000	354000	But the right hemisphere is seeing the whole picture, it has a sort of sustained, not a sort of sustained, it has sustained broad, vigilant attention to the whole.
354000	362000	And it therefore sustains our sense of a whole to which we belong and where our position has meaning.
362000	366000	But we've decontextualized everything.
366000	375000	We now don't understand that a thing is not just a thing, it changes its nature depending on the context that it's in.
375000	382000	When we take it out of the context in which it belongs and from which it derives its meaning, it no longer seems to have any meaning.
382000	392000	So the trouble with this world picture is it sees meaningless items whose only possible value can come from ways in which we can use them.
392000	408000	And this has largely dominated, certainly in certain sectors, the way in which people now think of the natural world as a heap of resource which we can mine and use and exploit for effectively utilitarian purposes.
409000	418000	But the kind of attention that the right hemisphere is able to give sees a living web of interrelationships.
418000	428000	So it sees that nothing is just what it is outside of the context, but always is what it is because of the relations in which it stands for everything else.
428000	437000	And indeed, in the matter of things, I argue that relations are primary, they come before the relator, the things that are said to be related.
437000	447000	So they actually emerge out of a web of meaning, and that meaning is often implicit, whereas the left hemisphere doesn't understand what's not made explicit.
447000	455000	This is also a facet of our culture, that things have to be spelled out in language that, as it were, a machine could understand.
455000	467000	But in fact, almost everything that matters to us can't be subjected in this way to a translation or a degradation into everyday language.
467000	475000	And so if you ask me for examples, obviously poetry, when you explain a poem, you've somehow destroyed it.
476000	489000	Although it's perfectly legitimate to pay that kind of attention to it for a while, but unless you re-embrace the whole with the new information, then you've lost something important.
489000	501000	But not just poetry, but obviously all the arts and music and painting and architecture, but also ritual, myth, narrative.
501000	518000	The ways in which we come to understand our place in the cosmos, which have always been very important, usually also involved with a story of the cosmos, a story about the superhuman, in other words, again, this sacred realm.
518000	534000	And I think all of this we lack to a large extent now. People are hungry for it, and when I speak to them about what has happened and show them, they immediately understand what's missing.
534000	544000	But they often say things like, until I read you or until I heard you, I wasn't really aware of how much was missing from my world.
545000	551000	So I wonder if we could begin by talking about what we, well, maybe what you mean by seeing.
551000	560000	Attention as a moral actor is kind of a short hand for much of your work. When you talk about what we're seeing, are you talking about what we're paying attention to?
560000	579000	I am. I'm not talking about visual sight. I'm talking about the things that we recognise and understand. And though sight is a very important and powerful sense with which we get to know things in the world, it's not really what I'm talking about.
580000	595000	So what is it, I suppose, what is it that you think we are seeing and not seeing? What are we paying attention to, to the exclusion of other things? What would be examples of that?
596000	610000	Well, I think we've been led to adopt and become enslaved by a certain way of looking at the world, which is mechanistic and reductionist.
611000	631000	And with that, a sense of values, a sense of purpose, a sense of there being something wonderful or inspiring and perhaps sacred in the world has gone missing.
631000	644000	And it's very sad that, it's not just my impression, but the research shows that a very large majority of young people over 80% think that their life is meaningless.
645000	662000	And it may be that we've developed all kinds of gadgetry and technology, but nothing can really replace the sense of meaning by sheer material wherewithal.
663000	675000	So we value, or we seem to be valuing, what the left hemisphere values. The left hemisphere is essentially in the service of utility.
675000	686000	The reason we have two hemispheres, and it's not just us, but all the creatures that we know have brains have two hemispheres, and the difference is that they pay attention to the world in different ways.
686000	698000	And the left hemisphere's attention is in the service of utility. It's a very narrowly targeted attention to something that's already known to be a value and it goes and gets it.
698000	706000	Now that is essentially how we, what do we need, what would we like, what would make us more powerful, let's go for it and get it.
706000	721000	But the right hemisphere is seeing the whole picture. It has a sort of sustained, not a sort of sustained, has sustained broad, vigilant attention to the whole.
721000	733000	And it therefore sustains our sense of a whole to which we belong and where our position has meaning. But we've decontextualised everything.
733000	742000	We now don't understand that a thing is not just a thing, it changes its nature depending on the context that it's in.
742000	750000	When we take it out of the context in which it belongs and from which it derives its meaning, it no longer seems to have any meaning.
750000	760000	So the trouble with this world picture is it sees meaningless items whose only possible value can come from ways in which we can use them.
760000	776000	And this has largely dominated, certainly in certain sectors, the way in which people now think of the natural world as a heap of resource which we can mine and use and exploit for effectively utilitarian purposes.
777000	786000	But the kind of attention that the right hemisphere is able to give sees a living web of interrelationships.
786000	795000	So it sees that nothing is just what it is outside of a context, but always is what it is because of the relations in which it stands for everything else.
795000	804000	And indeed, in the matter of things, I argue that relations are primarily they come before the relator, the things that are said to be related.
804000	810000	So they actually emerge out of a web of meaning and that meaning is often implicit.
810000	814000	Whereas the left-hand is it doesn't understand what's not made explicit.
814000	822000	This is also a facet of our culture that things have to be spelled out in language that has it where a machine could understand.
822000	834000	But in fact, almost everything that matters to us can't be subjected in this way to a translation or a degradation into everyday language.

843000	848000	Although it's perfectly legitimate to pay that kind of attention to it for a while.
848000	856000	But unless you re-embrace the whole with the new information, then you've lost something important.
856000	868000	But not just poetry, but obviously all the arts, music and painting and architecture, but also ritual myth, narrative.
869000	879000	The ways in which we come to understand our place in the cosmos, which have always been very important, usually also involved with the story of the cosmos,
879000	885000	the story about the superhuman, in other words, again, this sacred realm.
885000	890000	And I think all of this we lack to a large extent now.
890000	901000	People are hungry for it, and when I speak to them about what has happened and show them, they immediately understand what's missing.
901000	912000	But they often say things like, until I read you or until I heard you, I wasn't really aware of how much was missing from my world.
913000	923000	You say that never has humanity known so much, but understood so little in your book.
923000	930000	I feel like it's due to the very helpful sentence. Could you unpack what you mean then by understanding?
930000	941000	Yes, absolutely. I think I would make a distinction between information and knowledge, which has different kinds.
941000	945000	And understanding at a bubble wisdom.
945000	952000	So if we start with information, information is the collection of points of data, directly.
952000	960000	And obviously on that on its own, until somebody makes sense of it, it's not telling us anything.
961000	966000	That's where the idea that we're beginning to know something comes in.
966000	980000	And knowing can have two importantly different meanings, which carry with them different verbs in Latin, Greek and German, for example.
980000	983000	But in English we're saddled with the word know.
983000	989000	And I say I know that Paris is the capital of France.
989000	994000	That is the kind of model that the Germans call this.
994000	999000	And it's French, you know the facts.
999000	1006000	But I can say I know Paris because I spent two years living there and I'm familiar with it.
1006000	1009000	And that is a different kind of knowing.
1009000	1019000	Now, in the sense of understanding, it's that second sense of kong-pong-do-kenen in German that they're knowing by acquaintance.
1019000	1027000	An experiential connection immersed in it in all its complexity that gives us knowledge.
1027000	1032000	Now understanding is taking it a further step.
1032000	1038000	And understanding is the equivalent of intelligence.
1038000	1055000	And one of my worries is that in calling whatever artificial mechanisms we create intelligent, we are denying something very important about the human and indeed animal mind.
1055000	1070000	Which is that it creates holes which are built up from experience of something that has flesh and blood, that has emotions, that has an innate moral sense.
1070000	1079000	Not something that's been fed into it by a clever chap in California and to make creative simulacrum, but actually intelligence.
1079000	1087000	And intelligence, again there are different words in the different languages.
1087000	1095000	But our word intelligence comes from Latin roots, inter-ledgeric, to read between.
1095000	1103000	And that brings on straight to my idea that in fact what we are looking at always is relations.
1103000	1113000	It is not the things that create the world, but the relations between them out of which they come into being that is important.
1113000	1123000	Everything is relational primary. And it's only secondary becomes non-relational when whatever it is we focus on has been abstracted from its context.
1123000	1129000	So being able to see the betweens of everything is really special and important.
1129000	1136000	And also what I like is inter-ledgeric, also means sort of reading between the lines if you like.
1136000	1149000	So in poetry I usually take an example of Hardy's astonishing body of poetry that he wrote in 1912 to 13 after his wife's death.
1149000	1156000	And the poems are unique and powerful, but if you ask me what are they about?
1156000	1160000	I say well they're about how painful it is when somebody you love knows.
1160000	1166000	Sort of collapsed, completely collapsed the meaning, the depth of meaning.
1166000	1176000	And that's another thing that matters is that if like information is two dimensional, if that, probably only one dimensional.
1176000	1183000	Knowledge begins to get, especially with the experiential kind of knowledge, to have depth.
1183000	1193000	And intelligence is when we can see into the depths of a larger picture and put it together in a way that means something.
1193000	1202000	But surprisingly this is very like the way in which the hemispheres do in fact relate to one another and should do correctly.
1202000	1213000	So the right hemisphere we know takes the first take on a new experience.
1213000	1222000	So this has been laid out by various neurosciences, particularly Elton on Gilbert,
1222000	1228000	that when we have a new experience in whatever modality the right hemisphere is alert to it.
1228000	1233000	And then almost instantly it's taken up by the right hemisphere and categorized.
1233000	1242000	And so it no longer becomes that particular experience in all its specialness and richness, but an exemplar of something.
1242000	1243000	A map, not the territory.
1243000	1248000	So effectively it's building a map. It's building a schema, a diagram.
1248000	1260000	And that's fine, but that information, there's nothing wrong with a map, but it needs to be applied to a real world, not mistaken for the real world.
1260000	1265000	And the difficulty at the moment is that we're beginning to mistake the map for the experiential world.
1265000	1277000	So we live in this very thin theoretical version of life in which everything has been decontextualized, rendered neutered by being made explicit.
1277000	1279000	It's lost its life.
1279000	1290000	And literally another interesting difference between the hemispheres is the capacity to see things as animate in the right hemisphere and the tendency to see them as inanimate in the left hemisphere.
1290000	1304000	You're right at the end of Matter of Things in your epilogue about the meaning crisis which you mentioned and the lack of belonging we have because we are disconnected from nature,
1304000	1313000	disconnected from one another, and disconnected from the divine which now seems like superstition and nature, a bank of resources we can read.
1313000	1322000	How can you connect the dots there between this kind of flattened, revitalized view of the world and the fact that we've become sort of disconnected from it?
1322000	1335000	Absolutely. You say the word belong there, and of course that suggests a sense of familiar, be it a family, be it nature or be it the divine cosmos, in which we play a part.
1335000	1346000	Out of which we came, so we derive from it, we're not external to it, which is why I reject the word environment, suggesting something different around us, is in us and we are in it.
1346000	1363000	And so in each of these cases we are what we are because of the set of relationships we would ideally have with a society of people that we can trust who share our values and with whom we can eat, pray, lead our lives.
1363000	1374000	And in the case of nature the very strong bond at one field which in me is a sort of instinctual longing to be in the presence of the wildness and of the natural theme.
1374000	1387000	I think we all have that feeling in us, for most of us, and until a couple of hundred years ago almost everybody in the world would have been living anyway in a natural setting whereas now perhaps only half do.
1387000	1394000	And the third is this is a belonging, in the sense of knowing that there's something beyond us, that is greater than us.
1394000	1402000	And if you want you can stop there and just say there is something higher than us, it would be irrational actually to suppose that there wasn't.
1402000	1409000	And that comes from being locked into the left hemisphere, the view of things, it only knows what it is it knows, it doesn't know what it doesn't know.
1409000	1417000	So obviously it thinks it knows everything because that follows. So it's bound to be missing anything else than what it can rationalise.
1417000	1426000	And the difficulty there is that we are evolving beings. What makes us think that at this point in evolution we finally can understand everything.
1426000	1435000	I sometimes say a mouse might think that, but we know more than the mouse, maybe the mouse probably knows more than we do in some areas.
1436000	1447000	We are missing something important. And I just want to say that in talking about those I mentioned that there's a sort of deep yearning for.
1447000	1455000	And I want to mention that belonging comes from an Anglo-Saxon root, Langian, to stretch.
1455000	1464000	And I talk about this more in the master and his microscope, but the idea is that there is a connection between things that can be stretched apart up to a point.
1464000	1473000	But they feel the need of the tension in that relationship and so they long across the length of the connection for one another.
1473000	1477000	So belonging is a very, very important point.
1477000	1489000	And this presumably is some measure of explanation for the epidemic of luminous, of mental health crisis.
1489000	1495000	This is the fruits of a left hemisphere view of the world.
1495000	1504000	Absolutely, yes. Because the left hemisphere does isolate things and sees them only in abstract and is frankly not emotionally very intelligent.
1504000	1508000	It's actually not cognitively that intelligent either.
1508000	1516000	I was surprised when researching the matter of things to discover that the right hemisphere is not only very obviously much more emotionally and socially intelligent,
1516000	1520000	but actually more important for cognitive intelligence than for IQ.
1520000	1530000	So the left hemisphere has done a good job on projecting itself as the one that knows and the one that understands.
1530000	1533000	But it's relatively stupid.
1533000	1542000	And in psychology there's something called the done in Kruger effect, which means that the less you know the more you think you know it all.
1543000	1547000	Yeah, absolutely.
1547000	1559000	You mentioned earlier values and purpose, which you've got chapters on, really small books on in the matter of things.
1559000	1565000	The way we pay attention is predicated to a shape to some degree by what we value.
1565000	1569000	And the values of the left are different from the values of the right.
1569000	1579000	You speak about Mach-Eller and his hierarchy of values with the holy and the good, the true and beautiful at the top and then the bottom, the instrumental and the pleasurable.
1579000	1593000	I guess if we're valuing things wrongly and therefore attending to things wrongly, what are the mechanisms by which that can be corrected?
1593000	1603000	We were speaking earlier in this podcast season to Dr. Keltner, who studies all and he says experiencing all seems to realign your values.
1603000	1610000	It often makes you go much more connected to one another, to nature, to the divine.
1610000	1623000	Did you say a little bit about when people have their values realigned in a way that reflects the right hemisphere more?
1623000	1626000	What are those experiences that lead to that?
1626000	1629000	That makes sense as a question.
1629000	1638000	Well, I think again, beginning from the sense that we don't know it all is a very good place to start.
1638000	1644000	I think the key feature of the way we think now is that it is hubristic.
1644000	1651000	In other words, it exemplifies an arrogant, overbearing sense that we know far more than we do.
1651000	1659000	And it not only is that disruptive of value and meaning, but it's also really not very intelligent.
1659000	1669000	So if one can rekindle the sense of awe before things that are beautiful, before things in people that are genuinely good,
1669000	1679000	and things that speak to us and therefore have a kind of truthfulness in the connection with us,
1679000	1685000	then we can begin to see a world that has much more meaning in it.
1685000	1696000	But currently, beauty is curiously being neglected by almost everything, including art.
1696000	1702000	A lot of modern art, the creator does not wish to be told that it's beautiful.
1702000	1704000	They wish to be told that it's powerful.
1704000	1709000	And power, of course, is the only value recognised by the left hemisphere.
1709000	1714000	But as Dostoevsky said, it's beauty that will save the world.
1714000	1726000	I puzzled over that for a long time because, of course, a sense of aesthetic value can lead one to be deceived.
1726000	1733000	But then making wrong judgments about what's good and true can also lead you to deceive.
1733000	1740000	But I think what he was getting at is that when we have really lost our bearings on truth and what is meant by goodness,
1740000	1746000	so that now truth is whatever my truth is, we make it happen, there's no sense of it being,
1746000	1754000	despite the fact that we, of course, I acknowledge and talk about this a lot, that we go to make parts of everything we experience.
1754000	1759000	That doesn't mean that we just make it up, and it doesn't mean that some things are not sure of another,
1759000	1762000	even though they may not be one single absolute truth.
1762000	1772000	Goodness has been reduced to the following over a lot of rather mindless rules and ticking boxes for having expressed certain values or positions.
1772000	1775000	And that, of course, has nothing really to do with goodness.
1775000	1782000	But the one thing that can speak to us directly is beauty.
1782000	1794000	And so in that state where we've been abandoned and felt lost by no particular bearings or goodness and truth, beauty can still call to us.
1794000	1797000	And I think that's a good and important point.
1797000	1807000	So I think all those three values, and they are, in my view, contributors to the sense of the sacred, their facets of the sacred,
1807000	1810000	regaining that in our world I think is important.
1810000	1814000	I'm not saying that everybody must suddenly start going to church or whatever.
1814000	1816000	That's not my point.
1816000	1825000	And I'd rather oppose to people who think that it's all in a book, whether that be a Christian book or a Muslim book or whatever.
1825000	1831000	It's about a disposition of one's spirit, one's soul, towards the world.
1831000	1834000	And what kind of a disposition is that?
1834000	1847000	It's one in which there is room for awe and wonder, which helps us to see not that we're useless or meaningless but curiously that we have meaning and value.
1847000	1852000	Because we're connected to something that is all inspiring that we know is bigger than us.
1852000	1860000	But nonetheless, we're not humbled in the negative sense that we're made to feel small, although that might happen.
1860000	1864000	We derive richness from that relationship.
1864000	1871000	I think that's one thing, and I know we're to be the sense of compassion for things.
1871000	1885000	And I think that's an important thing that's gone missing in our culture of anger, narcissistic rage, the heuristic belief that we are right and you must be wrong and so on.
1885000	1891000	And a degree of modesty, basically.
1891000	1906000	So I think those features, if we started adopting a more wondered, more modest and more compassionate view towards others, towards the world,
1906000	1911000	I think a lot of our problems will begin to heal themselves.
1911000	1922000	But as you know, in this world where people no longer feel there is any need or connection, mental illness is a colossal height.
1922000	1926000	Most people think of themselves as basically lonely.
1926000	1935000	And why? Because we have destroyed all the context in which people used to find their being and belonging.
1935000	1951000	This idea that we're prevented from seeing these things, which has come through, to some extent, technology, technology is our ability to manipulate the world.
1951000	1954000	It has removed us from it.
1954000	1960000	And you might also say that we are kind of educated into it. We're given a value system.
1960000	1973000	So as someone who's personally invested in the interest of education, I wonder what the principles might be of an education, if education is the way we create our own future,
1973000	1985000	like on what kind of priorities and principles should it try and move forward?
1985000	1991000	Well, it's only difficult to recapture things only in an educational system.
1991000	2002000	Although an educational system can be very valuable and important, obviously, and I believe my own education was profoundly important in shaping me.
2002000	2020000	But I think things have to revalidate the importance of the family, that the way in which you think about the world, the things that you hope to be good and right,
2020000	2030000	are part of what your family inculcates in you, by example, and sometimes by precept.
2031000	2046000	As to schools, I think the first thing I'd say, because a lot of people imagine that the right hemisphere is a bit sort of let it all hang out, you know, this is sort of a hippie hemisphere.
2046000	2059000	And that's how it was projected in the bad old days, when we used to say things like the left hemisphere is rational and verbal and the right hemisphere does pictures and gets emotional.
2060000	2070000	The important point for here is that the right hemisphere is not only much better at feeling really the deep emotions rather than superficial social emotions.
2070000	2088000	The ones preferred by the left hemisphere, anger, scorn, derision, a sense of self-pride, these are different from the deep emotions of togetherness, of sympathy, empathy.
2088000	2101000	And so forth. But the right hemisphere is also the hemisphere of control of inappropriate or excessive emotion, which people perhaps didn't expect.
2101000	2109000	And what I'm leaning to here is that I don't think that education should just be a matter of do your own thing and let it all hang out.
2109000	2116000	I think it's very important that there should be discipline. And discipline is now a sort of dirty word.
2116000	2130000	But actually, the loss of self-discipline in our world, which has been eroded very badly in the last 50 years, with trades of self-indulgence, self-promotion, and so forth, over self-discipline.
2131000	2139000	This will lead to tyranny, because if we don't discipline ourselves, then there's a need for external constraints on everything.
2139000	2158000	And so you see an explosion of rules and algorithms and principles and handbooks and so on, which none of it should be necessary if people have any sensitivity to what is required of them through a morally cohesive society.
2158000	2173000	So I think the sense that it's not all about us, it is about a society that we build to be proud of a society and its values, and as much as one recognizes what they are and agrees with them.
2173000	2183000	But above all, to know more about humanities. I mean, the key is in the word. Without humanities, we don't really understand human beings.
2183000	2193000	So it's very well to promote STEM subjects, which are the technical subjects, and I'm not saying they're not important at all.
2193000	2204000	But like the left hemisphere not being unimportant, it is very important, it nonetheless needs to be set within a context of what the right hemisphere knows.
2204000	2216000	And so all that technical information is only good if it's set in the context of a broader understanding of what human beings are and where we're going with our lives and with our society.
2216000	2226000	And that will come from studying literature, history, music, drama. These things are not just add-ons, you know.
2226000	2239000	These are the core in my view. And in the universities to begin with a thorough knowledge of Western civilization, beginning with the Greeks and the Romans and working forward.
2239000	2245000	I expect nowadays somebody will say that it's exclusive or something, but I think it's extremely important.
2245000	2260000	If you want to completely demoralize the people, tyrants have named this, destroy their history, cut them off from their history, and they will lose any will to defend themselves or anything else because they can't see any point anymore.
2260000	2275000	So we really do need to stop being silly about this and accept that we are depriving young people of something very, very important unless we give them a proper grounding in their own culture.
2275000	2290000	And that's not to say that it shouldn't include admiration for things that come from other cultures. I spent a lot of my life trying to emphasize the importance of Eastern values against those of the West.
2290000	2307000	And it's only more recently that I realized that it's really important now with people taking, you know, Sledgehammers and pneumatic drills through Western culture to say, hang on, this is something completely amazing that we created.
2307000	2320000	And you're using the freedom that it created, almost uniquely in the history of mankind, to destroy it. You have that liberty because of the very culture that you're against.
2320000	2336000	So something absurd is happening in education now, and it involves reintroducing what is required. It's not that everybody must go on being educated, quote educated, up to university level.
2336000	2349000	Some people will benefit from university and I'm sorry, some people won't. And when everybody has to go to university, then the universities themselves become less good places to learn.
2349000	2358000	And I know this is all very unpopular, but it seems to me common sense actually. And there's a lot of people that don't want to be in school after a certain age.
2358000	2373000	They become disruptive, pretty boys, and maybe the thing is to allow them to leave. And if they want to later, I think that universities should be a choice we make later when we've had a little bit of experience of life.
2373000	2380000	And then if you really want to go to university, you've got a burning desire to know more about whatever, good, go for it.
2380000	2390000	And better support such people in doing what they want to do, and that will make a better society and better universities to produce people that will make a better society.
2390000	2415000	It sounds wise, I resonate with that. Something you kind of alluded to and have written at length about is purpose and a sense that we maybe have produced purpose to something extrinsic.
2415000	2435000	It's instrumental. And lots of the most valuable stuff in life is intrinsically purposeful. And if we aim at, so I think you observed that we aim at happiness, and I would never call it measurably less happy, we aim at freedom and autonomy, but we're bound by restrictions and so on.
2435000	2448000	So I guess those are kind of extrinsic purposes, arguably. How do we know what to aim at? Do you think that's right? How do we know what to aim at?
2449000	2453000	Obviously in some ways this brings us to values again.
2453000	2454000	Yes, yes.
2454000	2472000	Because I see values as things that call to us from ahead. They may not be entirely resolved in the sense of brought into sharp focus for us, but they are entities that speak to us, that call to us. That is how I have experienced them.
2472000	2477000	One is drawn forwards towards the good, the beautiful, the true.
2477000	2492000	Now most of our images come from machines, and there's nothing more harmful than one can do. One can do it, then to try and approximate a human life to that of a machine, the functioning of a machine.
2492000	2506000	So they are things that guide where we want to go from and front, whereas a machine is pushed from behind. A machine has no sense of direction. It's made to go in certain ways.
2506000	2519000	When we come to talk about purpose, it's terribly important to distinguish between two kinds of purposes, and you did really allude to that when you said intrinsic, because machines have extrinsic purpose.
2519000	2529000	In other words, the machine itself is not aware of a purpose. The machine is simply carrying out a purpose of the human being that made it.
2529000	2545000	However, not everything has this utilitarian nature that is valued for it, and obviously examples are music and dance. These things are not valuable because they lead to us doing certain things.
2545000	2555000	They are valuable because they have intrinsic meaning and value that speaks to us. They acquaint us with something that is beautiful and speaks to us.
2555000	2570000	And that's what I mean by an intrinsic purpose. James Carrs, a philosopher, made a distinction between games that are infinite and games that are finite.
2570000	2582000	So an example of an infinite game would be something like music, which doesn't reach a goal and then stop, but can be carried on for as long as people want to do it because its purpose is in itself.
2583000	2595000	Finite games are done as a football game, so that we want an outcome out of a certain 90 minutes we have it and one team with one or the other.
2595000	2609000	So that is a kind of distinction. And I suppose that what I'm very keen not to suggest is that if I say that I believe there is purpose in the cosmos and I think it's there,
2609000	2615000	that I'm meaning it's put there by an engineering guard.
2615000	2633000	So when you look at the cosmos, even the inanimate cosmos at large, or what we think is inanimate anyway, we see something that is constantly evolving, changing towards complexity and a kind of beauty.
2633000	2644000	And there are drives, even in the inanimate world, inanimate structures have tendencies to go in certain directions.
2644000	2656000	When it comes to life, much more so. So that's an important thing to realise, that there is a kind of direction.
2657000	2668000	But it's not something that has been written in advance by the cosmos or by the ground of being or by God, whatever you want to call it.
2668000	2683000	That doesn't mean to say it has no purpose, it has a direction towards certain values and the details as it were are absolutely open.
2683000	2689000	So we're not, I believe, programmed to do every single thing we do.
2689000	2702000	And I just don't believe and I can't believe that anyone now could possibly defend Laplace's 18th century vision that if you knew the position of momentum of every particle in the universe at a certain point,
2702000	2705000	you wouldn't be able to unpack the whole of the rest of history.
2705000	2711000	Surely modern physics already tells us that such certainty is not available.
2711000	2715000	Now that doesn't mean to say that the only alternative is pure chaos.
2715000	2723000	There is something very important in the dipole of order and disorder and that the important thing is that there should be both present.
2723000	2729000	Without a bit of disorder the thing is dead and will sclerose and fossilise.
2729000	2740000	It's that element of potential for change that is so important in everything, not just in the living world, but perhaps particularly obviously in the living world.
2741000	2748000	And equally, of course, if there was only disorder and randomness, nothing would have any directional meaning.
2748000	2761000	So I believe that we are and exemplify something that is purposeful but does not mean that I have no choice.
2761000	2766000	I play it part and maybe I could expand on this a little.
2766000	2775000	Because the really fascinating thing is why should there be life at all?
2775000	2780000	It's a very expensive business life.
2780000	2785000	It uses a great deal of energy, causes a lot of suffering,
2785000	2792000	and it has to kick against the second law of thermodynamics,
2792000	2801000	against the increase in entropy that suggests, because we are all the time moving against that trend.
2801000	2803000	How could this have come about?
2803000	2816000	I think the first thing to say about it is that to get over a phase in a process that would always stop any further progress because it was in itself disadvantageous,
2816000	2822000	there has to be an ability for whatever it is to have a sense of something beyond.
2822000	2831000	A very good point made by Bruce Charlton is that a simple one really but an important one.
2831000	2836000	Why did sexual reproduction take hold?
2836000	2844000	Originally organisms existed by parthenogenesis, in other words they divided, and that was it.
2844000	2857000	The idea of having to find a suitable mate and only producing when you reproduce smaller numbers than you would get from being able to divide yourself
2857000	2864000	means that you're perpetually in that early phase at a disadvantage in terms of competition.
2864000	2876000	You're trying to do something that is uphill, and yet nonetheless somehow this has been brought into play and we carry on with that system.
2876000	2892000	Another important point is that life gives us the capacity to respond to something beyond.
2892000	2898000	Now that sounds a bit grand and vague but let me unpack it a bit.
2898000	2905000	So inanimate things do respond to another inanimate thing.
2905000	2912000	So we have periods of millions of years, rocks and dung get formed and move and change and so on.
2912000	2921000	But their ability to respond to things is very limited for them to have in them, I suggest, consciousness.
2921000	2926000	Though they exist in consciousness which is another matter.
2926000	2930000	So what is it special about life that makes it worthwhile?
2930000	2945000	I think it is actually the ability to respond to the values that are in the nature of the ground of being which are goodness, beauty and truth primarily.
2946000	2959000	But those are the key elements and I think that it's the bringing about it of beings that can respond to them and therefore resonate with them and help them fulfil themselves and help further them.
2959000	2965000	Or alternatively choose to ignore them and that's from right to do so, we have free agents.
2965000	2969000	But I think that is why there is life, otherwise it's a great puzzle.
2969000	2979000	As Ellen Whitehead said, there is very little survival in being alive, you last for a few years.
2979000	2983000	But if you are inanimate you can persist for a very long time.
2983000	2988000	So it can't be to do with creating creatures as a better and better at surviving.
2988000	2992000	Because life itself is not a very good system for surviving.
2992000	3002000	For the most ancient creatures, some examples of certain actinobacteria in the depths of the ocean, individual examples of them are a million years old.
3002000	3010000	So everything that's happened since the evolution has been generally towards things becoming shorter lived.
3010000	3021000	So how does one defend the difficulty of creating life, the problem with getting over the hump of entropy and the purpose of life?
3021000	3029000	And I think that purpose is to be in the dynamic partnership of cosmos and creation.
3029000	3040000	And Whitehead himself thought this, that the ground of being was ever more coming into being through, as it were, the dance of evolution with what it was bringing into being.
3040000	3049000	So is that baked into evolution? Evolution is the algorithm that kind of explains developing towards complexity and life.
3049000	3055000	But do you think baked into that is this ability to discern the given beautiful truth?
3055000	3059000	Yes I do think so, that's right.
3059000	3076000	I think another point that's relevant here is that until very recently we believe that evolution could only work by making billions and billions of false attempts until one happened by chance turned out to be helpful.
3077000	3092000	A single cell can be faced with an assault for which it is not programmed by evolution, nor has experience in its own lifetime if you'd like to put it that way.
3092000	3102000	It can make a change within a period of only a few days that if it had to happen by trial and error would take perhaps literally billions of years.
3103000	3121000	So there is built into these adaptive changes is something that allows us to make changes much faster than a kind of blind, furrowing of the cars up in the air and hoping that the one that you want will land in your hand.
3121000	3130000	That seems to be no longer a defensible position. I don't know why this is but it is the case anyway.
3130000	3135000	One has to take that into account. So interesting how does that happen? I don't know.
3135000	3142000	I think there are shapes, patterns if you like, that draw things towards themselves.
3142000	3162000	And in fact, since we accomplished that wonderful feat of decoding the human genome, we've been made to realise how little information there is in the human genome, never near enough to deal with what a growing organism is faced with.
3162000	3177000	And so there must be something else that allows forms and three dimensional shapes to be expressed that can't be expressed in the only 2% of DNA that actually gives information, instructional information.
3177000	3191000	So where is that? And I think that people are beginning to see that there must be electromagnetic fields or fields of some kind that physics could recognise that contains information
3191000	3204000	of a fish out of a form that something is moving towards. We see this in the evolution of creatures. If we interfere with their development, they will try to steer back to something.
3204000	3219000	If you chop off the head of an hematode worm, it will end to regrow its head. And it will also, the new head will have the knowledge that the old head had, that that head has been incinerated.
3219000	3234000	So where does it come from? When you cut off the antlers of a deer, every deer's antlers has a particular pattern, and it will produce the same pattern exactly that it has before, not the surrounding pattern.
3234000	3240000	But where is that three dimensional pattern stored? I don't have the answer to that.
3240000	3255000	I mean, what fascinating examples. You maybe think of, I think it's Simon Conway Morris, the paleozojous, who says that he points out that your evolution as an algorithm is very effective at describing these, but it doesn't describe something like music,
3255000	3265000	you know, where whales and song cultures, birds of counterpoint and melody and harmony and so on. So it's more like mathematics, something you discover that is beautiful.
3265000	3276000	And it brings to mind this idea that we are growing towards the beauty of the beautiful and the true that is part of the fabric of the universe.
3276000	3290000	Yes, yes. I mean, quite how it works is it's not something I claim to understand. But I don't think that that's a reason for trying to conceal or deny things that are matters of observation.
3290000	3302000	So there's something there that is shaping the course, the form, the nature of whatever it is that is coming into being.
3303000	3313000	May I ask you about those people who probably sound somewhere significantly different to you, who think the world is making good progress.
3314000	3327000	The late Hans Rosling or Stephen Pinker, who would say that. Actually, here's our hard data on longevity or literacy or healthcare.
3327000	3336000	What we're doing is clearly moving in the right direction. It seems like you would like to say, we're actually not moving in the right direction.
3336000	3341000	We need to back up and figure out where we've lost our way.
3341000	3354000	I know you've actually corresponded a bit with Stephen Pinker. What's your response to the people who say we're making good progress and this is the right direction?
3354000	3361000	Well, I think probably once again, it's a difference between the two illustrated by the difference between the hemispheres.
3361000	3372000	So the left hemisphere would want to say that something was good by ticking certain boxes that it's beforehand decided are going to be important.
3372000	3383000	So it finds, for example, that more people now earn a wage than in the past have did. So it says we're making progress.
3383000	3399000	And one of the things I'd like to say about that is that the reason that there are more people who earn wages is that there has been massive erosion and destruction of the environment and ways of life of indigenous people
3399000	3409000	who would be more or less forced to go to cities to try and get jobs, where of course they do get a pittance, but they are for the first time truly poor.
3409000	3419000	We know that levels of human flourishing, in other words, a sense of wellbeing, a sense of belonging, a sense of happiness, a sense of fulfillment,
3419000	3427000	these things are much higher in pre-modern Western societies than they are in such societies.
3427000	3437000	And that as people move into such societies, as unfortunately they do all the time, they become progressively more unhappy.
3437000	3455000	And one of the fascinating findings is that poor Mexicans who move to America, in the first generation of those who go there, their rates of mental illness are relatively low compared with the Native American population.
3455000	3468000	But in the next generation they become considerably higher, and in the generation after that they approximate to the levels of misery that are typical of the US population.
3468000	3474000	Now it seems to me that you can only argue that this is a better society by chance.
3475000	3489000	One of the things that strikes me about your work in is that you are taken in by people who have pretty different worlds.
3489000	3499000	They might be fairly Eastern, very Christian, or not religious at all, and to some extent they put a flag in your technique,
3499000	3503000	and he's like, what are you saying is something we resonate with?
3503000	3517000	So if you have a Venn diagram of these different perspectives with you in the middle, what is it that you think you're putting your finger on that they all resonate with?
3517000	3531000	I think that what a lot of people say when they write to me, and God bless them, a lot of do saying that my writing has changed their lives, or even saved their lives and so on, which is a remarkable and wonderful thing.
3531000	3550000	The common thing they say is, there was a lot of this that I knew at some level, and I understood at some level, but had no words to express, and what you've done is to enable me to see why believing those things and knowing those things is important.
3550000	3574000	And so I think what I've done is to bring things that are very hard to express, and are pitfalls and traps everywhere, in trying to express them to a point where people can read them and get them, even if they don't begin from that standpoint of understanding what it is I'm trying to unfold.
3574000	3594000	So I see my work as taking people on a journey to say, look at this, and let's have a look at this, and there's a good bit coming in an hour or two when we see a beautiful view, and then leading them to a position where their view of the world is quite different than the one they started off with.
3594000	3621000	And they're not forced to accept it, of course, I'm sure some people don't, but pleasingly a lot of people do, and so I think that is opening people's eyes to the value of imagination and of intuition, as well as science and reason, which I find myself championing a lot these days, because they're also under attack from people who don't like science and reason,
3621000	3642000	because they might show the things that they believe to be, you know, poorly evidenced. So I think it's that, and I think I hope, giving people hope, and giving them some sense that there is meaning and beauty and purpose there to discover.
3643000	3656000	But, you know, you have to have skin in the game, as it were, you can't sort of sit there and expect it to go plump into your lap, you have to make choices and you have to strive a little for those things.
3657000	3671000	I don't mean that sort of compete, but you need to sort of have a degree of conviction and determination to follow a path. And, you know, following through on something is quite important.
3671000	3691000	One thing that I come to realise rather late in life, that actually following through something, even though it may take you through a viewpoint where you have to change, and it should take you through a viewpoint where you have to change, is rather important.
3691000	3696000	If you're not sure when you don't like what's coming next.
3696000	3699000	Like you say, creativity requires resistance.
3699000	3701000	It requires resistance.
3701000	3713000	And growth, I think it was, I heard you point out in previous talk about that fascinating fact that trees, the grow into like a bio-do, never develop the internal strength because the resistance of wind isn't there.
3713000	3714000	That's right.
3714000	3715000	And I love that as a metaphor.
3715000	3723000	The biologists couldn't understand why are all these mature trees protected from every kind of heart? Why are they all falling over before they reach full maturity?
3723000	3728000	And the answer is they had nothing to resist and trees actually thrive on wind.
3728000	3731000	It's nice testing the wood and building the wood.
3731000	3738000	It's a beautiful metaphor for why life is not supposed to be a walk in the park.
3738000	3743000	It's not supposed to be just a matter of enjoyment.
3743000	3747000	In fact, that would be extremely disappointing.
3747000	3758000	I don't want to do a spoiler for people who haven't read the history of the world in ten and a half chapters, but maybe I will anyway.
3758000	3775000	It's a wonderful clever book and at the end of it, there was a story about somebody waking up in a hospital and a very beautiful nurse is bringing lots of things to eat.
3775000	3778000	And the person said, where am I?
3778000	3785000	And in the insuring conversation, it turns out that he's tied and he is in fact in heaven.
3785000	3790000	And he said, what am I supposed to do? You can do anything you like.
3790000	3794000	If you're a keen golfer, you can have a round of golf with kept nipples.
3794000	3798000	Whatever it is that you want to do, you can do it.
3798000	3807000	And he sort of thinks about this as a long conversation and he says, do people tend to stay up here?
3807000	3813000	And he says, no, usually after about 300 years they're asked to go back.
3813000	3822000	I just thought that was such a brilliant insight that actually we're not happiest when just everything is given to us.
3822000	3830000	There's something to be said for having to put oneself out to encounter resistance or overcome resistance and it helps one grow.
3830000	3839000	You're thinking of a very person in problem because technology has made life far too convenient.
3839000	3851000	There's not enough resistance and the texture of life feels different if you can breeze through it.
3851000	3861000	Yes, apparently architects have been asked to design shocking sensors with steps and things so that people actually do have to exert themselves.
3861000	3867000	And it's healthier than being whisked everywhere in lifts and on moving.
3867000	3873000	Yeah, of course the consequences in your body are not insignificant to climb stairs.
3873000	3879000	Where do you find hope in the best case scenario?
3879000	3884000	When you look at the world and you see things are not going too well,
3884000	3892000	things are not being made in the interests of the planet or the people in it.
3892000	3898000	But at the same time you get letters, you give talks, you inspire people to think differently.
3898000	3906000	Where do you find, I suppose, hope and what are going to be the engines of change?
3906000	3914000	Well, I think the answer to those two questions come together.
3914000	3922000	First of all, although things don't look as though they're getting better, it's a fool who predicts the future.
3922000	3930000	I don't know what's in store and therefore there is always room for hope and I think one has a duty in a way to hope
3930000	3936000	because otherwise we'd all just give up and then certainly everything would collapse.
3936000	3945000	But there is really grounds for hope in the very people who are going to have to be the agents of change,
3945000	3949000	namely young people.
3949000	3962000	And in just the last couple of months I gave lectures, public lectures in Oxford and Cambridge
3962000	3968000	and then in America in three or four different places.
3968000	3977000	And once I came away with was an overwhelming sense of how good and decent a lot of young people are
3977000	3989000	and they can be caricatured, the worst of them can be caricatured as having sort of righteous slogans about what must happen.
3989000	4003000	But the people I met were appropriately less arrogant, less know-it-all, delightful, responsive, creative, imaginative
4003000	4020000	and committed to trying to understand things and make them better and not just follow whatever rules were being laid down for them by the current media kind of pundits.
4020000	4030000	So I thought there is a great deal of hope here and it really was lovely for me and for them to say that they really resonated with what I was saying.
4031000	4034000	And so that was very strong.
4034000	4038000	There is a piece of experience, right, which is the right hemisphere.
4038000	4041000	Yes, absolutely.
4041000	4043000	So there we are.
4043000	4057000	So if I pull the threads together, I've asked you, well, we've got to know all over the place because there's so much in your thinking that it seems to connect to this question of what are cultures preventing us from seeing.
4057000	4083000	And it seems like if you take that characterisation of the left hemisphere as utilitarian, understanding values of your utility of pleasure but little else, and that's shaped the way we're attending and the purposes we're finding to great injury to the way that we're living and to the planet we're living in and so on.
4084000	4099000	And so to discover the answer to what are like cultures preventing us from seeing means listening more keenly to discern what is good and true and beautiful.
4099000	4108000	Would that be one kind of summary of how we attend better to what it is we're not seeing?
4108000	4112000	Yes, I think the first thing is being aware of what it is one isn't seeing.
4112000	4116000	Because unless you have that knowledge, you won't make the effort, of course.
4116000	4128000	So the first thing is to get people to a place where they experience some of the things that would give them a sense of something beyond what it is they so cleverly already know.
4129000	4141000	The business of education is not about confirming the prejudice that you come into education with about shaking your prejudices and by enabling you to see another point of view.
4141000	4153000	And so I always say that in education, it should be part of the business to teach people to argue for different points of view.
4154000	4162000	And so I could make an argument against myself before positions I may have stated in this interview.
4162000	4172000	But I think it's important to be able to do that and not to think that everybody who thinks differently for you must be criminal or stupid.
4172000	4178000	But they may have something there that is worth hearing and that there may be things that it's worth trying to experience.
4178000	4196000	I think reconnecting spending more time in nature and trying to bring yourself to be part of a group of people whose values you respect and spending some time with them.
4196000	4207000	And if possible spending time in spiritual practices, which may be conventional or unconventional, but they're better than none.
4207000	4216000	These things are at least orientating us to the idea that what we know is not at all. It's not the whole story.
4216000	4220000	And whatever that whole story is, we will never know it in full.
4220000	4232000	But it is part of the business of life to try and take ourselves on that journey towards a fuller understanding of who we are.
4233000	4235000	That was a wonderful lift.
4235000	4238000	Ian, thank you so much for your time.
4238000	4240000	Thanks for being so generous with your thoughts.
4240000	4242000	Thank you very much indeed.
