Processing Overview for Unison Language
============================
Checking Unison Language/Abilities： the ultimate domain specific language.txt
1. The presenter has been working on a project in Unison that allows for imperative-style drawing on a canvas, which can be run in a browser using WebSockets.
2. They are excited about the potential of Unison's abilities feature to handle concurrency and mutable state in a straightforward manner, as seen with STM (Software Transactional Memory) and TVars (Transactional Variables).
3. The presenter plans to extend the framework to support both imperative and declarative styles of programming for animation and behavior, such as gravity, velocity, and inertia.
4. They aim to create a dual interface that could interpret the same underlying drawing library in different ways, potentially allowing for two different approaches (imperative and declarative) to be used side by side.
5. The code for the current canvas project is available on GitHub under the project name Clarity, and the presenter will push an updated version later that evening for participants to explore.
6. While the presenter has shown some of this work to conference attendees, their kids—a tougher audience—haven't yet been impressed, indicating there's still more to achieve before they are satisfied with what's been built.

The presenter's journey with Unison reflects a broader trend in the Haskell community, where Unison is seen as an excellent language for modeling imperative processes through its monadic and functional constructs. The future work envisions a more robust framework that can handle both imperative and declarative styles, showcasing the versatility of Unison's capabilities.
