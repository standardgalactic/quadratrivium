0	28600	Hello YouTube. What you have just heard is a piece I composed for this video. It demonstrates
28600	34920	how a song can progress through chords. Just as we've learned in our skills, chords
34920	42280	also have the ability to build up and release tension. Before we can get into understanding
42280	50120	how to build these progression of chords, we must learn basic points of rest and tension.
50120	57760	Exam the diagram on the screen. This is called the circle of fists. Just as the name suggests,
57760	64760	we can pick any key on the piano, then move up an interval of five. The key we land on
64760	71720	will be a chord, a tension, and our home key, or the key we began on before we counted up
71720	90000	five is our resolution point. So if we began on C, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, G would be our fifth note.
90440	96200	Let's hear how our tension chord G resolves down to C.
96200	113920	Pay attention to how comfortable C sounds in our ear after G. Can you figure out why this
113920	120800	tension disappears at C? I think you can. Remember from our previous video, we learned
120800	128440	about the flow of notes in a scale. Let's take a look at the G major chord. We have the notes G,
128440	142760	B, and D. If we take a look at our diagram for the scale, we can recall that B resolves to C.
142760	151400	Additionally, D moves to our two resolution points, C and E. So we have two tension notes from our
151400	160040	chord, B and D. With these tension notes moved, our ears can relax. Before we can continue along
160040	168480	in the circle of fifths, we must be familiar with our major scale formula. Because we moved to G on
168480	176400	the circle of fifths, this means we're counting in G major now. Knowing this, we must proceed with
176400	183360	caution and pay attention to our steps. Let's count up from G, five keys, and see where we go.
183360	200400	One, two, three, four, and five. We end up on the D chord. Similar to when we counted up from C,
200400	209760	the circle of fifths shows us that when we play in G major, the D chord is our tension chord. What
209760	216080	does a tension chord really mean on the circle of fifths? Let's examine our scale degree diagram
216080	224800	from the previous videos. Here we can see what degree is major, what degree is minor. We know by
224800	231600	moving at a certain point in the scale, we may create tensions. So other chords other than our
231600	239280	fifths should create tensions as well, right? The fifth chord has a special name in music. It is
239280	247200	referred to as the dominant chord. That is because the dominant chord has more force than other chords
247200	254560	in our scale. Playing from the dominant chord in a key, and then proceeding with the chord on the
254560	260640	first degree in our scale is like putting a period at the end of a sentence. Remember that
260640	266960	short example we heard in the beginning of the video? Let's listen to that again. This time I
266960	272080	will display the chords being played throughout the song. You don't need to be concerned about all
272080	278640	of the chords. Just pay attention when we play our G chord, our dominant chord, then move down to our
278640	282720	C chord, our home key, the first chord in our scale.
283120	308480	Did you hear how the movement from G to C finished the short song?
309360	316480	It is just as if the chords in the song are words, and when we move from our dominant chord G
317440	325360	to C, we are putting a period at the end of our sentence. I'll introduce more and more word to
325360	335680	you in this video, and that is the cadence. This period or movement from our dominant chord
335680	343680	to the first chord in our scale is called a cadence. There exists other cadences in music,
343680	351600	and we will discuss these in future videos.
