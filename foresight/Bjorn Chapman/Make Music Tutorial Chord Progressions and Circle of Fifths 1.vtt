Hello YouTube. What you have just heard is a piece I composed for this video. It demonstrates

00:28.600 --> 00:34.920
how a song can progress through chords. Just as we've learned in our skills, chords

00:34.920 --> 00:42.280
also have the ability to build up and release tension. Before we can get into understanding

00:42.280 --> 00:50.120
how to build these progression of chords, we must learn basic points of rest and tension.

00:50.120 --> 00:57.760
Exam the diagram on the screen. This is called the circle of fists. Just as the name suggests,

00:57.760 --> 01:04.760
we can pick any key on the piano, then move up an interval of five. The key we land on

01:04.760 --> 01:11.720
will be a chord, a tension, and our home key, or the key we began on before we counted up

01:11.720 --> 01:30.000
five is our resolution point. So if we began on C, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, G would be our fifth note.

01:30.440 --> 01:36.200
Let's hear how our tension chord G resolves down to C.

01:36.200 --> 01:53.920
Pay attention to how comfortable C sounds in our ear after G. Can you figure out why this

01:53.920 --> 02:00.800
tension disappears at C? I think you can. Remember from our previous video, we learned

02:00.800 --> 02:08.440
about the flow of notes in a scale. Let's take a look at the G major chord. We have the notes G,

02:08.440 --> 02:22.760
B, and D. If we take a look at our diagram for the scale, we can recall that B resolves to C.

02:22.760 --> 02:31.400
Additionally, D moves to our two resolution points, C and E. So we have two tension notes from our

02:31.400 --> 02:40.040
chord, B and D. With these tension notes moved, our ears can relax. Before we can continue along

02:40.040 --> 02:48.480
in the circle of fifths, we must be familiar with our major scale formula. Because we moved to G on

02:48.480 --> 02:56.400
the circle of fifths, this means we're counting in G major now. Knowing this, we must proceed with

02:56.400 --> 03:03.360
caution and pay attention to our steps. Let's count up from G, five keys, and see where we go.

03:03.360 --> 03:20.400
One, two, three, four, and five. We end up on the D chord. Similar to when we counted up from C,

03:20.400 --> 03:29.760
the circle of fifths shows us that when we play in G major, the D chord is our tension chord. What

03:29.760 --> 03:36.080
does a tension chord really mean on the circle of fifths? Let's examine our scale degree diagram

03:36.080 --> 03:44.800
from the previous videos. Here we can see what degree is major, what degree is minor. We know by

03:44.800 --> 03:51.600
moving at a certain point in the scale, we may create tensions. So other chords other than our

03:51.600 --> 03:59.280
fifths should create tensions as well, right? The fifth chord has a special name in music. It is

03:59.280 --> 04:07.200
referred to as the dominant chord. That is because the dominant chord has more force than other chords

04:07.200 --> 04:14.560
in our scale. Playing from the dominant chord in a key, and then proceeding with the chord on the

04:14.560 --> 04:20.640
first degree in our scale is like putting a period at the end of a sentence. Remember that

04:20.640 --> 04:26.960
short example we heard in the beginning of the video? Let's listen to that again. This time I

04:26.960 --> 04:32.080
will display the chords being played throughout the song. You don't need to be concerned about all

04:32.080 --> 04:38.640
of the chords. Just pay attention when we play our G chord, our dominant chord, then move down to our

04:38.640 --> 04:42.720
C chord, our home key, the first chord in our scale.

04:43.120 --> 05:08.480
Did you hear how the movement from G to C finished the short song?

05:09.360 --> 05:16.480
It is just as if the chords in the song are words, and when we move from our dominant chord G

05:17.440 --> 05:25.360
to C, we are putting a period at the end of our sentence. I'll introduce more and more word to

05:25.360 --> 05:35.680
you in this video, and that is the cadence. This period or movement from our dominant chord

05:35.680 --> 05:43.680
to the first chord in our scale is called a cadence. There exists other cadences in music,

05:43.680 --> 05:51.600
and we will discuss these in future videos.
