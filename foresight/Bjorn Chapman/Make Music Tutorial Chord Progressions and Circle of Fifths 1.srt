Hello YouTube. What you have just heard is a piece I composed for this video. It demonstrates

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,920
how a song can progress through chords. Just as we've learned in our skills, chords

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,280
also have the ability to build up and release tension. Before we can get into understanding

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:50,120
how to build these progression of chords, we must learn basic points of rest and tension.

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,760
Exam the diagram on the screen. This is called the circle of fists. Just as the name suggests,

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,760
we can pick any key on the piano, then move up an interval of five. The key we land on

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,720
will be a chord, a tension, and our home key, or the key we began on before we counted up

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:30,000
five is our resolution point. So if we began on C, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, G would be our fifth note.

9
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,200
Let's hear how our tension chord G resolves down to C.

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:53,920
Pay attention to how comfortable C sounds in our ear after G. Can you figure out why this

11
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,800
tension disappears at C? I think you can. Remember from our previous video, we learned

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:08,440
about the flow of notes in a scale. Let's take a look at the G major chord. We have the notes G,

13
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:22,760
B, and D. If we take a look at our diagram for the scale, we can recall that B resolves to C.

14
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,400
Additionally, D moves to our two resolution points, C and E. So we have two tension notes from our

15
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:40,040
chord, B and D. With these tension notes moved, our ears can relax. Before we can continue along

16
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:48,480
in the circle of fifths, we must be familiar with our major scale formula. Because we moved to G on

17
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,400
the circle of fifths, this means we're counting in G major now. Knowing this, we must proceed with

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,360
caution and pay attention to our steps. Let's count up from G, five keys, and see where we go.

19
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:20,400
One, two, three, four, and five. We end up on the D chord. Similar to when we counted up from C,

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,760
the circle of fifths shows us that when we play in G major, the D chord is our tension chord. What

21
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,080
does a tension chord really mean on the circle of fifths? Let's examine our scale degree diagram

22
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,800
from the previous videos. Here we can see what degree is major, what degree is minor. We know by

23
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,600
moving at a certain point in the scale, we may create tensions. So other chords other than our

24
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,280
fifths should create tensions as well, right? The fifth chord has a special name in music. It is

25
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,200
referred to as the dominant chord. That is because the dominant chord has more force than other chords

26
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,560
in our scale. Playing from the dominant chord in a key, and then proceeding with the chord on the

27
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,640
first degree in our scale is like putting a period at the end of a sentence. Remember that

28
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,960
short example we heard in the beginning of the video? Let's listen to that again. This time I

29
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,080
will display the chords being played throughout the song. You don't need to be concerned about all

30
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,640
of the chords. Just pay attention when we play our G chord, our dominant chord, then move down to our

31
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,720
C chord, our home key, the first chord in our scale.

32
00:04:43,120 --> 00:05:08,480
Did you hear how the movement from G to C finished the short song?

33
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,480
It is just as if the chords in the song are words, and when we move from our dominant chord G

34
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:25,360
to C, we are putting a period at the end of our sentence. I'll introduce more and more word to

35
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:35,680
you in this video, and that is the cadence. This period or movement from our dominant chord

36
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,680
to the first chord in our scale is called a cadence. There exists other cadences in music,

37
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,600
and we will discuss these in future videos.
