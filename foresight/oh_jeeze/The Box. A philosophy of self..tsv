0	3000	Introduction. Acquiring Wisdom.
3000	8000	There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way,
8000	9000	who nods at them and says,
9000	11000	morning boys, how's the water?
11000	14000	And the two young fish swim on for a bit,
14000	17000	and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes,
17000	19000	what the hell is water?
19000	21000	David Foster Wallace.
21000	25000	So it seemed like it represented many different ways,
25000	29000	but there's this self part.
29000	32000	You know, if you think this is the center of everything,
32000	35000	your perspective, you start here,
35000	40000	this is the water, this is the expanse that the fish swims in,
40000	41000	that he doesn't know he's in,
41000	45000	because he has no idea that there is anything without.
45000	47000	This is his existence,
47000	49000	like before we discovered oxygen,
49000	50000	what was air?
50000	52000	What was air compared to space?
52000	56000	Did we know what space was compared to atmosphere?
56000	58000	From our frame of reference,
58000	60000	what we were standing on was flat,
60000	62000	and what was above us was expansive.
62000	64000	To explain that as a human being,
64000	71000	it's probably how do I get what I think of myself to match what other people see?
71000	74000	That way they think I am the way that I am,
74000	76000	regardless of what is going on.
76000	79000	I can't remember what it was like to think from this perspective.
79000	80000	It was so long ago.
80000	82000	I think that in this part,
82000	85000	in most wisdom is considered man,
85000	91000	as lonely and confused within the expanse of existence,
91000	95000	that an organism that is aware of itself can be.
95000	96000	And just to keep it simple,
96000	98000	it seems like for most people,
98000	101000	their success as a reproductive organism,
101000	103000	it would be somebody who gets a lot of women,
103000	105000	or somebody that has a lot of money,
105000	106000	or something like that.
106000	111000	So when they imagine what success will be like,
111000	113000	this is man, flesh,
113000	118000	just an organism that is navigating a reproductive game.
118000	121000	As far as free will and autonomy is concerned,
121000	124000	this person believes they have absolute free will,
124000	126000	because they choose who they have sex with.
126000	129000	They make the choice of who they're having sex with.
129000	132000	They're not making a choice of whether or not
132000	135000	they have to have sex to feel validated,
135000	137000	or a rush of dopamine
137000	142000	for achieving the human reproductive behavior,
142000	145000	which is ejaculate or orgasm.
145000	149000	So sure, you might be choosing who you're having sex with.
149000	152000	You might have the autonomy over who you're having sex with.
152000	153000	If you have free will,
153000	156000	go fall in love with someone you find very unattractive.
156000	158000	When you think about how attractive you are
158000	160000	to the people around you,
160000	162000	and what qualities draw you to people,
162000	164000	you're not consciously aware that
164000	167000	you're making those decisions based on reproductive urge,
167000	169000	which you find most replicable,
169000	174000	which are both sexual selection and natural selection.
174000	176000	Outside of this understanding
176000	182000	is I find to be overridden by religious directives.
182000	184000	So all of this might guide your functioning,
184000	188000	say, as a younger person, your sexual behavior or something.
188000	190000	As you get older, though,
190000	191000	and through experience,
191000	193000	you might realize that this was for naught.
193000	196000	That maybe saving some of that
196000	198000	or delaying some of this gratification
198000	201000	may have kept you or gotten you maybe a little higher
201000	202000	than you wanted to,
202000	205000	or that you might have achieved something greater
205000	207000	if you were concerned with other things.
207000	210000	That's experience and wisdom.
210000	214000	The aggregate, the sum of all of this experience
214000	217000	is that there's more to life than just this experience.
217000	218000	You go through all of this
218000	220000	and you come out on the other side knowing,
220000	222000	okay, maybe I could have gone without that.
222000	224000	That's typically what people find out.
224000	228000	However, you're very drawn to that sort of impulsive behavior
228000	232000	because if you just think simply as genetics, as DNA,
232000	234000	that makes more copies of DNA.
234000	237000	And as long as more copies of DNA are being made,
237000	238000	then we're good.
238000	241000	All threatening people with the extinction of their DNA does,
241000	244000	makes them breed impulsively and create more DNA.
244000	247000	Just a byproduct of their behavior.
247000	250000	Outside of this is religion,
250000	253000	which doesn't really make much sense to a whole lot of people.
253000	256000	I doubt it even makes a whole lot of sense to religious people.
256000	258000	But there are rules embedded in here
258000	261000	that override all of these things
261000	266000	and keep you from having to experience the vicissitude
266000	269000	of trying to get fucking pussy all the time
269000	271000	and how worthless it might be in the long run.
271000	273000	That's not why it was designed.
273000	275000	It's just something that gives you a higher purpose
275000	278000	and overrides man, flesh, and regulation.
278000	280000	The ability to say no.
280000	284000	The only actual free will, free won't, to reject the wrong.
284000	285000	What is wrong?
285000	289000	Some people think there's this arbitrary list of rules
289000	291000	that you have to follow that are random,
291000	293000	unconnected, cut your penis tip off,
293000	296000	pray to the invisible man, give him some money,
296000	299000	say the words, do the dance, celebrate Christmas,
299000	302000	hate gay people, whatever they think the rules are,
302000	306000	somehow fit somewhere into overriding to the next level,
306000	309000	just level up from what to do
309000	311000	when you're not just behaving in a reproductive manner.
311000	313000	So you've already got fear of the afterlife
313000	316000	keeping you from being sexually promiscuous.
316000	319000	You're already delaying gratification with monogamy.
319000	321000	So there's a big plus, monogamy.
321000	324000	Just an extension of the impulsive self.
324000	329000	This is still an unregulated sense of control.
329000	334000	Within this, you use their religion to justify this behavior,
334000	338000	which is lies, betrayal, darkness, wickedness,
338000	342000	concepts that we have independent of God, lies, darkness.
342000	345000	Because from this position, lying is a necessary
345000	347000	for navigation of the system,
347000	349000	because the system's out to get you,
349000	351000	so you have to lie your way through it,
351000	352000	which isn't true.
352000	356000	That's just someone that can't understand the simple behavior
356000	358000	that rewards you in the long run.
358000	361000	The rules of religion and ideology,
361000	364000	as far as culture is concerned, create regulation.
364000	366000	And if you just understand,
366000	369000	you need some level of regulation to build upwards.
369000	373000	You need foundations and angles and approaches
373000	377000	and support for this to happen properly
377000	379000	without it collapsing on you.
379000	380000	You need regulation.
380000	383000	You can't just get a bunch of boards and a bunch of hammers
383000	384000	and start nailing them together
384000	387000	and wonder where the fucking skyscraper is,
387000	388000	because the bitch will fall over.
388000	391000	You have to have technology and practice and shit like that.
391000	393000	These things are learned over several generations,
393000	397000	written down and recorded on tablets and religions
397000	399000	and mythology and things like that,
399000	400000	and just passed down.
400000	401000	We sort of take for granted.
401000	403000	However, this is still, like I said,
403000	405000	an extension of reproductive behavior.
405000	407000	This is still like low level.
407000	409000	Now, at some point,
409000	412000	there's a possibility that you might realize
412000	414000	that there's more up here.
414000	417000	If you really are into getting to understand the religion,
417000	420000	you might take a journey through some sort of
420000	423000	higher level of God or self.
423000	426000	I'm sure a lot of people that are spiritual, spirituality.
426000	429000	The feeling that it is out of the self,
429000	431000	it is independent of self,
431000	433000	but it is still an extension of self.
433000	438000	This is where you get lots of theories about egg theory.
438000	440000	We are one consciousness.
440000	444000	Our mission to raise consciousness.
444000	446000	A lot of people, I think, get this confused for like,
446000	449000	okay, this down here judges people,
449000	453000	and this up here allows people to be themselves.
453000	456000	It's like a realization that God's not real,
456000	460000	but not denying the feeling that is the source of God,
460000	462000	main character syndrome,
462000	465000	an echo of this reproductive behavior.
465000	468000	Down here is all your neurotransmitters
468000	471000	and your feedback loops, dopamine, serotonin,
471000	474000	ephedrine, adrenaline, these things, these neurotransmitters.
474000	478000	So if you've ever been able to identify yourself here
478000	483000	as an organism that is capable of trapping itself
483000	487000	in the belief that the feelings that it has somehow
487000	490000	inside that can't be rationally explained
490000	495000	aren't a product of this being kept at bay by culture,
495000	497000	social standards, etc.
497000	501000	Then you have to identify yourself within a species.
501000	503000	Whatever path you take,
503000	506000	whatever higher level of study you do,
506000	508000	if you reach this concept of,
508000	511000	so however you reach it, if you do,
511000	512000	and you know what it means,
512000	514000	and you reach this point of,
514000	516000	here you see the like,
516000	519000	learning truth, this barrier would be like,
519000	521000	if you break through this barrier
521000	526000	into the awareness that you exist as a part of something larger,
526000	529000	then you can start, you break through this barrier
529000	536000	and you land in truth, self, like I am, darkness.
536000	541000	You just break through these layers of social expectation.
541000	543000	Who am I?
543000	545000	What is me?
545000	547000	What is purpose?
547000	548000	And you hit this like,
548000	550000	I wouldn't say it's nirvana yet.
550000	554000	You hit this light up here, the enlightenment phase,
554000	558000	which when you first hit, seems endless.
558000	560000	You know, this thing seems endless,
560000	564000	but it's not until you crack into nirvana
564000	568000	or like a boundless conscious realm,
568000	574000	where the way that you process the information that you have
574000	581000	is based nothing on the way other people would have you process
581000	583000	the information that's available.
583000	586000	You can only get here through parallels,
586000	590000	drawing conclusions, making bridges between concepts
590000	593000	that you wouldn't otherwise would not think of.
593000	597000	This is so far beyond the person that's telling you,
597000	600000	you don't get no bitches, you're an insult.
600000	603000	These things down here to this person are huge.
603000	607000	This removed your ability to choose who you're having sex with.
607000	610000	You have to have sex with someone other than who you want to,
610000	612000	you know, this kind of shit.
612000	615000	And to somebody who's concerned about those things,
615000	618000	it will affect their decision-making into the future.
618000	623000	But somebody that's already risen out of all of these perceptions
623000	627000	of self within culture, within a species, within society,
627000	630000	and shit like that, that knows itself, that knows the truth,
630000	635000	that understands what is real, what is true.
635000	639000	It's arbitrary, you know, it goes out compared to the amount of effort
639000	640000	you're willing to give it.
640000	645000	It opens up the ability to process in parallels.
645000	648000	These are called parables, metaphors.
648000	652000	The better you are at understanding the connection between the two,
652000	656000	the better your outcome will be with the information.
656000	659000	You know, so like a lot of these things that I talk about,
659000	664000	I had figured out by, you know, 2022,
664000	669000	it was exciting because it gave me something to explain to people.
669000	675000	Still hitting zeros on people that are willing to understand
675000	676000	what I'm talking about.
676000	677000	It's not their fault.
677000	678000	It's not necessarily my fault.
678000	680000	I'm just getting better at explaining it.
680000	684000	But there are some things that I do beyond, you know,
684000	687000	just figuring out those immediate things.
687000	690000	I let my mind wander to many different things.
690000	694000	One of the cool things that, you know, I did early last year was,
694000	701000	I understand that we think of concepts like numbers in base 10.
701000	704000	I had reached a place where I could, you know,
704000	707000	chill out on thinking of religion or, you know,
707000	709000	the solar system and shit like that,
709000	711000	because I didn't think anybody was ever going to,
711000	713000	I don't think anybody's ever going to get that shit.
713000	718000	But I started to let my mind wander towards the potential
718000	721000	of different counting system.
721000	727000	How would I comprehend something like that's not base 10 counting?
727000	730000	We understand whole round numbers,
730000	733000	like 10 as a round digestible,
733000	736000	dividable, even number that we can comprehend.
736000	741000	But there were times when they went by other systems like base 7.
741000	742000	I don't know exactly.
742000	748000	Some base 6 or something like that is how we got the 360 degree turn
748000	750000	of circle or something like that.
750000	753000	Like 36 divided by 6 is 6.
753000	756000	And when you start dividing by numbers like that
756000	759000	and they become round that you are able to build
759000	763000	more complicated, intricate calculation systems out of them,
763000	766000	which is, you know, being able to go beyond
766000	769000	what we can just normally hold in our head.
769000	771000	Not to complicate that too much,
771000	773000	but I just was thinking, man,
773000	778000	I wonder what it would be like to think in a different base.
778000	781000	Like to think in base 6 or something like that.
781000	785000	And so I would just change my mind to think
785000	788000	and process numbers in like base 6.
788000	790000	What is even base 6?
790000	791000	Is that even a thing?
791000	794000	I initially found out because I was doing like base 7,
794000	795000	I was like wondering what it would be.
795000	798000	21 would be like a whole number.
798000	800000	Just like 30 is a whole number.
800000	802000	7 would be like 10.
802000	803000	But when I would think of these things,
803000	806000	I would think of it as like 7 out of 10.
806000	809000	It's very hard to understand that 7
809000	812000	would represent the same amount as 10
812000	813000	or something like that.
813000	815000	Imperial and metric systems
815000	817000	are good things to compare here, I think.
817000	819000	Because some people understand that
819000	822000	these are all divided by 10.
822000	825000	One meter, a thousand meters, a kilometer,
825000	827000	one, and then it goes backward,
827000	831000	0.1, 0.01, 0.001,
831000	834000	a decimeter, centimeter, millimeter.
834000	836000	It just moves the decimal.
836000	838000	It can be 750 kilometers.
838000	840000	A kilometer is a thousand meters.
840000	842000	You have to do a bunch of conversion and shit
842000	844000	to understand what's going on
844000	847000	unless you can just see them in 14 stone.
847000	849000	Okay, well, that's about 180 pounds.
849000	850000	I don't know if that's correct,
850000	852000	but you can do the conversion back and forth,
852000	854000	which is where I'm stuck here.
854000	856000	How can I just see it in a way
856000	858000	where I just say I was used to kilometers
858000	861000	and somebody just came up and explained miles.
861000	863000	And I didn't know how to do the conversion.
863000	865000	I don't know if that's a way,
865000	867000	if I'm explaining that correctly,
867000	869000	but I found out that like,
869000	870000	I mean, it was really difficult.
870000	875000	I found that having that base six or something like that,
875000	882000	if I think of three as half of six,
882000	885000	like I think of five as half of 10,
885000	887000	then I can work from there.
887000	891000	I also noticed that like seven base seven
891000	896000	would break down into four, fours and threes pretty easily,
896000	899000	which I found really interesting
899000	902000	because I was also thinking a lot.
902000	906000	I also had the orbits and stuff in my mind quite a bit.
906000	911000	We'd measure time in that sense as one year as one orbit.
911000	915000	However, we have like an extra day left over,
915000	920000	which means that we're like using an incomplete base system.
920000	924000	If we could figure out a base that was even,
924000	927000	then you would be able to calculate that out
927000	932000	and not have to have the extra leap day.
932000	934000	The extra leap day was like a,
934000	936000	it's like a band aid for something
936000	939000	that doesn't fit the base six system.
939000	944000	So instead of looking at one orbit is 365 days,
944000	946000	this unit is one.
946000	950000	That is split into 12 months,
950000	954000	with four weeks and seven days.
954000	959000	Feet, inches, miles, yards, an inch is this long.
959000	961000	Feet is 12 of those.
961000	966000	Yards, miles, a fucking, a lot of those.
966000	975000	1,200, 5,800 and 20 something.
975000	979000	50, 230.
979000	987000	How many feet in a mile?
987000	997000	52, 80.
997000	999000	Oh, feet 52, 80.
999000	1000000	Nice.
1000000	1004000	I was like, huh, I really was putting my mind into this mode of,
1004000	1007000	okay, are there any other ways to break this down?
1007000	1009000	I know that this is moving.
1009000	1011000	This would create almost like a coil.
1011000	1015000	If these four didn't add up to four of these,
1015000	1020000	to the point where it was an extra 0.25 days,
1020000	1022000	where you had to just add one day,
1022000	1025000	is there any way that you could find this place?
1025000	1028000	Quack, okay, cut it like a spring.
1028000	1033000	Now I've got one, two, three, four of these movements.
1033000	1035000	How many different ways can I break that up?
1035000	1037000	Well, I can actually do it into three.
1037000	1042000	If I just considered these motions to not be one,
1042000	1045000	I just considered all of this to be one.
1045000	1050000	So if the four cycle was one, what does that mean for a base seven?
1050000	1053000	Well, I could cut it into three.
1053000	1055000	How many ways could I cut it into three?
1055000	1059000	Well, not only could I cut these into three instead of four
1059000	1062000	and have something like this for one,
1062000	1066000	this to make one instead of this to make one.
1066000	1070000	So three would equal one full cycle,
1070000	1073000	whereas it used to be four plus an extra day.
1073000	1076000	I still have 12 months in each year to work with.
1076000	1079000	So each one of these circles from above
1079000	1082000	could be split different ways.
1082000	1086000	Could this be a three-month block or a three-section block
1086000	1087000	three times?
1087000	1090000	What if I spread them out over these three?
1090000	1092000	What if I spread them out over four?
1092000	1095000	What if I did four over three or three over four?
1095000	1099000	What if I changed the minutes to 70 seconds
1099000	1102000	or an hour to 70 minutes?
1102000	1105000	This is where it got wild.
1105000	1107000	But then I got into thinking,
1107000	1109000	what's wrong with as a symbol,
1109000	1114000	why not different variables or variations of, say,
1114000	1117000	like a long line of connected?
1117000	1119000	I don't know, it's hard to explain.
1119000	1123000	If you chopped it up into different sections
1123000	1127000	and symbols start to look like just different patterns
1127000	1130000	of this spring understanding.
1130000	1133000	How many different ways could you calculate out information
1133000	1135000	from that perspective?
1135000	1137000	And I got pretty far into a lot of it,
1137000	1139000	but there's nobody to discuss this stuff with.
1139000	1142000	I have no idea if it has any value.
1142000	1145000	I'm just exploring this thing up here quite by myself,
1145000	1148000	it feels like, which is okay for now.
1148000	1151000	It's just, I know that people are going to ask me
1151000	1153000	why I didn't do it a different way.
1153000	1156000	And I'm doing it the only way that I know how
1156000	1158000	in the nicest, most patient way,
1158000	1161000	without trying to take any of the value of the understanding
1161000	1164000	away from anyone that could possibly understand it.
1164000	1166000	I just don't know.
1166000	1169000	I feel like I'm going to be stuck up here alone my entire life,
1169000	1171000	which I'd rather be up here alone.
1171000	1174000	But because of no idea how cool it is.
1174000	1177000	I want people to understand me.
1177000	1179000	I don't want people to not understand me.
1179000	1182000	It feels like, it feels like a curse
1182000	1186000	for trying and doing a good thing.
1186000	1189000	It feels too much of a curse to be...
1196000	1198000	I don't know.
1208000	1211000	I'm just glad I'm me, you know.
1213000	1216000	I used to not feel that way.
1230000	1233000	You must convince yourself of the following.
1234000	1237000	People get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve
1237000	1240000	through their actions in life.
1240000	1243000	Despite the popularity of genetic explanations
1243000	1246000	for our behavior, recent discoveries in neuroscience
1246000	1248000	are overturning long-held beliefs
1248000	1251000	that the brain is genetically hardwired.
1251000	1253000	Scientists are demonstrating the degree
1253000	1256000	to which the brain is actually quite plastic.
1256000	1259000	How our thoughts determine our mental landscape.
1259000	1263000	They are exploring the relationship of willpower to physiology.
1263000	1267000	How profoundly the mind can affect our health and functionality.
1267000	1271000	It is possible that more and more will be discovered
1271000	1274000	about how deeply we create the various patterns of our lives
1274000	1276000	through certain mental operations.
1276000	1281000	How we are truly responsible for so much of what happens to us.
