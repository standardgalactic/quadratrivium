00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Introduction. Acquiring Wisdom.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
who nods at them and says,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
morning boys, how's the water?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And the two young fish swim on for a bit,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what the hell is water?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
David Foster Wallace.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So it seemed like it represented many different ways,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but there's this self part.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You know, if you think this is the center of everything,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
your perspective, you start here,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
this is the water, this is the expanse that the fish swims in,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that he doesn't know he's in,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because he has no idea that there is anything without.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is his existence,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
like before we discovered oxygen,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
what was air?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What was air compared to space?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Did we know what space was compared to atmosphere?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
From our frame of reference,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
what we were standing on was flat,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and what was above us was expansive.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To explain that as a human being,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
it's probably how do I get what I think of myself to match what other people see?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That way they think I am the way that I am,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
regardless of what is going on.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't remember what it was like to think from this perspective.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was so long ago.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think that in this part,

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in most wisdom is considered man,

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
as lonely and confused within the expanse of existence,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that an organism that is aware of itself can be.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And just to keep it simple,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
it seems like for most people,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
their success as a reproductive organism,

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
it would be somebody who gets a lot of women,

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
or somebody that has a lot of money,

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
or something like that.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So when they imagine what success will be like,

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
this is man, flesh,

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
just an organism that is navigating a reproductive game.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As far as free will and autonomy is concerned,

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
this person believes they have absolute free will,

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because they choose who they have sex with.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They make the choice of who they're having sex with.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They're not making a choice of whether or not

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
they have to have sex to feel validated,

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
or a rush of dopamine

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
for achieving the human reproductive behavior,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which is ejaculate or orgasm.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So sure, you might be choosing who you're having sex with.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You might have the autonomy over who you're having sex with.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you have free will,

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
go fall in love with someone you find very unattractive.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When you think about how attractive you are

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
to the people around you,

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and what qualities draw you to people,

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you're not consciously aware that

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
you're making those decisions based on reproductive urge,

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
which you find most replicable,

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
which are both sexual selection and natural selection.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Outside of this understanding

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is I find to be overridden by religious directives.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So all of this might guide your functioning,

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
say, as a younger person, your sexual behavior or something.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
As you get older, though,

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and through experience,

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you might realize that this was for naught.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That maybe saving some of that

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
or delaying some of this gratification

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
may have kept you or gotten you maybe a little higher

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
than you wanted to,

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
or that you might have achieved something greater

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
if you were concerned with other things.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's experience and wisdom.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The aggregate, the sum of all of this experience

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
is that there's more to life than just this experience.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You go through all of this

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and you come out on the other side knowing,

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
okay, maybe I could have gone without that.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's typically what people find out.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
However, you're very drawn to that sort of impulsive behavior

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
because if you just think simply as genetics, as DNA,

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that makes more copies of DNA.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And as long as more copies of DNA are being made,

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
then we're good.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All threatening people with the extinction of their DNA does,

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
makes them breed impulsively and create more DNA.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Just a byproduct of their behavior.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Outside of this is religion,

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
which doesn't really make much sense to a whole lot of people.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I doubt it even makes a whole lot of sense to religious people.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But there are rules embedded in here

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
that override all of these things

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and keep you from having to experience the vicissitude

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
of trying to get fucking pussy all the time

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and how worthless it might be in the long run.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's not why it was designed.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's just something that gives you a higher purpose

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and overrides man, flesh, and regulation.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The ability to say no.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The only actual free will, free won't, to reject the wrong.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What is wrong?

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Some people think there's this arbitrary list of rules

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that you have to follow that are random,

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
unconnected, cut your penis tip off,

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
pray to the invisible man, give him some money,

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
say the words, do the dance, celebrate Christmas,

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
hate gay people, whatever they think the rules are,

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
somehow fit somewhere into overriding to the next level,

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
just level up from what to do

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
when you're not just behaving in a reproductive manner.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So you've already got fear of the afterlife

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
keeping you from being sexually promiscuous.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're already delaying gratification with monogamy.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So there's a big plus, monogamy.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Just an extension of the impulsive self.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is still an unregulated sense of control.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Within this, you use their religion to justify this behavior,

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
which is lies, betrayal, darkness, wickedness,

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
concepts that we have independent of God, lies, darkness.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because from this position, lying is a necessary

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
for navigation of the system,

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
because the system's out to get you,

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
so you have to lie your way through it,

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
which isn't true.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's just someone that can't understand the simple behavior

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that rewards you in the long run.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The rules of religion and ideology,

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
as far as culture is concerned, create regulation.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And if you just understand,

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
you need some level of regulation to build upwards.

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You need foundations and angles and approaches

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and support for this to happen properly

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
without it collapsing on you.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You need regulation.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You can't just get a bunch of boards and a bunch of hammers

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and start nailing them together

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and wonder where the fucking skyscraper is,

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
because the bitch will fall over.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You have to have technology and practice and shit like that.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
These things are learned over several generations,

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
written down and recorded on tablets and religions

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and mythology and things like that,

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and just passed down.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We sort of take for granted.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
However, this is still, like I said,

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
an extension of reproductive behavior.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is still like low level.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, at some point,

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
there's a possibility that you might realize

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that there's more up here.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If you really are into getting to understand the religion,

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you might take a journey through some sort of

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
higher level of God or self.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sure a lot of people that are spiritual, spirituality.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The feeling that it is out of the self,

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it is independent of self,

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
but it is still an extension of self.

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is where you get lots of theories about egg theory.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We are one consciousness.

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Our mission to raise consciousness.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A lot of people, I think, get this confused for like,

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
okay, this down here judges people,

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and this up here allows people to be themselves.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's like a realization that God's not real,

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but not denying the feeling that is the source of God,

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
main character syndrome,

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
an echo of this reproductive behavior.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Down here is all your neurotransmitters

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and your feedback loops, dopamine, serotonin,

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
ephedrine, adrenaline, these things, these neurotransmitters.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So if you've ever been able to identify yourself here

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
as an organism that is capable of trapping itself

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in the belief that the feelings that it has somehow

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
inside that can't be rationally explained

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
aren't a product of this being kept at bay by culture,

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
social standards, etc.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Then you have to identify yourself within a species.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Whatever path you take,

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
whatever higher level of study you do,

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
if you reach this concept of,

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
so however you reach it, if you do,

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and you know what it means,

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and you reach this point of,

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
here you see the like,

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
learning truth, this barrier would be like,

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if you break through this barrier

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
into the awareness that you exist as a part of something larger,

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
then you can start, you break through this barrier

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and you land in truth, self, like I am, darkness.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You just break through these layers of social expectation.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Who am I?

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What is me?

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is purpose?

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And you hit this like,

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I wouldn't say it's nirvana yet.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You hit this light up here, the enlightenment phase,

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
which when you first hit, seems endless.

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You know, this thing seems endless,

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
but it's not until you crack into nirvana

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
or like a boundless conscious realm,

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
where the way that you process the information that you have

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is based nothing on the way other people would have you process

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the information that's available.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You can only get here through parallels,

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
drawing conclusions, making bridges between concepts

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that you wouldn't otherwise would not think of.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is so far beyond the person that's telling you,

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you don't get no bitches, you're an insult.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
These things down here to this person are huge.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This removed your ability to choose who you're having sex with.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You have to have sex with someone other than who you want to,

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you know, this kind of shit.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And to somebody who's concerned about those things,

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
it will affect their decision-making into the future.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But somebody that's already risen out of all of these perceptions

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
of self within culture, within a species, within society,

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and shit like that, that knows itself, that knows the truth,

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that understands what is real, what is true.

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's arbitrary, you know, it goes out compared to the amount of effort

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
you're willing to give it.

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It opens up the ability to process in parallels.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
These are called parables, metaphors.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The better you are at understanding the connection between the two,

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the better your outcome will be with the information.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You know, so like a lot of these things that I talk about,

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I had figured out by, you know, 2022,

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it was exciting because it gave me something to explain to people.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Still hitting zeros on people that are willing to understand

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
what I'm talking about.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's not their fault.

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's not necessarily my fault.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm just getting better at explaining it.

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But there are some things that I do beyond, you know,

237
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
just figuring out those immediate things.

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I let my mind wander to many different things.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
One of the cool things that, you know, I did early last year was,

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I understand that we think of concepts like numbers in base 10.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I had reached a place where I could, you know,

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
chill out on thinking of religion or, you know,

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
the solar system and shit like that,

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
because I didn't think anybody was ever going to,

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't think anybody's ever going to get that shit.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But I started to let my mind wander towards the potential

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
of different counting system.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
How would I comprehend something like that's not base 10 counting?

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We understand whole round numbers,

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
like 10 as a round digestible,

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
dividable, even number that we can comprehend.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But there were times when they went by other systems like base 7.

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know exactly.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Some base 6 or something like that is how we got the 360 degree turn

255
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
of circle or something like that.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Like 36 divided by 6 is 6.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And when you start dividing by numbers like that

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and they become round that you are able to build

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
more complicated, intricate calculation systems out of them,

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which is, you know, being able to go beyond

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
what we can just normally hold in our head.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Not to complicate that too much,

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but I just was thinking, man,

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I wonder what it would be like to think in a different base.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Like to think in base 6 or something like that.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And so I would just change my mind to think

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and process numbers in like base 6.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What is even base 6?

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is that even a thing?

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I initially found out because I was doing like base 7,

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I was like wondering what it would be.

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
21 would be like a whole number.

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just like 30 is a whole number.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
7 would be like 10.

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But when I would think of these things,

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I would think of it as like 7 out of 10.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's very hard to understand that 7

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
would represent the same amount as 10

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
or something like that.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Imperial and metric systems

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
are good things to compare here, I think.

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Because some people understand that

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
these are all divided by 10.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
One meter, a thousand meters, a kilometer,

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
one, and then it goes backward,

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
0.1, 0.01, 0.001,

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
a decimeter, centimeter, millimeter.

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It just moves the decimal.

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It can be 750 kilometers.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
A kilometer is a thousand meters.

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You have to do a bunch of conversion and shit

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to understand what's going on

293
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
unless you can just see them in 14 stone.

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay, well, that's about 180 pounds.

295
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know if that's correct,

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
but you can do the conversion back and forth,

297
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
which is where I'm stuck here.

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How can I just see it in a way

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
where I just say I was used to kilometers

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and somebody just came up and explained miles.

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I didn't know how to do the conversion.

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know if that's a way,

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
if I'm explaining that correctly,

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
but I found out that like,

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, it was really difficult.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I found that having that base six or something like that,

307
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
if I think of three as half of six,

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
like I think of five as half of 10,

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
then I can work from there.

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I also noticed that like seven base seven

311
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
would break down into four, fours and threes pretty easily,

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
which I found really interesting

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
because I was also thinking a lot.

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I also had the orbits and stuff in my mind quite a bit.

315
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We'd measure time in that sense as one year as one orbit.

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
However, we have like an extra day left over,

317
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
which means that we're like using an incomplete base system.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If we could figure out a base that was even,

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
then you would be able to calculate that out

320
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and not have to have the extra leap day.

321
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The extra leap day was like a,

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
it's like a band aid for something

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that doesn't fit the base six system.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So instead of looking at one orbit is 365 days,

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
this unit is one.

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That is split into 12 months,

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
with four weeks and seven days.

328
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Feet, inches, miles, yards, an inch is this long.

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Feet is 12 of those.

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yards, miles, a fucking, a lot of those.

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
1,200, 5,800 and 20 something.

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
50, 230.

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
How many feet in a mile?

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:37,000
52, 80.

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, feet 52, 80.

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Nice.

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I was like, huh, I really was putting my mind into this mode of,

338
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
okay, are there any other ways to break this down?

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I know that this is moving.

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This would create almost like a coil.

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If these four didn't add up to four of these,

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
to the point where it was an extra 0.25 days,

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
where you had to just add one day,

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
is there any way that you could find this place?

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Quack, okay, cut it like a spring.

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Now I've got one, two, three, four of these movements.

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
How many different ways can I break that up?

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, I can actually do it into three.

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If I just considered these motions to not be one,

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I just considered all of this to be one.

351
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So if the four cycle was one, what does that mean for a base seven?

352
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, I could cut it into three.

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
How many ways could I cut it into three?

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, not only could I cut these into three instead of four

355
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and have something like this for one,

356
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
this to make one instead of this to make one.

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So three would equal one full cycle,

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
whereas it used to be four plus an extra day.

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I still have 12 months in each year to work with.

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So each one of these circles from above

361
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
could be split different ways.

362
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Could this be a three-month block or a three-section block

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
three times?

364
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What if I spread them out over these three?

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What if I spread them out over four?

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What if I did four over three or three over four?

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What if I changed the minutes to 70 seconds

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or an hour to 70 minutes?

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This is where it got wild.

370
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But then I got into thinking,

371
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
what's wrong with as a symbol,

372
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
why not different variables or variations of, say,

373
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like a long line of connected?

374
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know, it's hard to explain.

375
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If you chopped it up into different sections

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and symbols start to look like just different patterns

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
of this spring understanding.

378
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
How many different ways could you calculate out information

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
from that perspective?

380
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And I got pretty far into a lot of it,

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
but there's nobody to discuss this stuff with.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I have no idea if it has any value.

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm just exploring this thing up here quite by myself,

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
it feels like, which is okay for now.

385
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's just, I know that people are going to ask me

386
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
why I didn't do it a different way.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I'm doing it the only way that I know how

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
in the nicest, most patient way,

389
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
without trying to take any of the value of the understanding

390
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
away from anyone that could possibly understand it.

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I just don't know.

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I feel like I'm going to be stuck up here alone my entire life,

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
which I'd rather be up here alone.

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But because of no idea how cool it is.

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I want people to understand me.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't want people to not understand me.

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It feels like, it feels like a curse

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
for trying and doing a good thing.

399
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It feels too much of a curse to be...

400
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm just glad I'm me, you know.

402
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I used to not feel that way.

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You must convince yourself of the following.

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
People get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve

405
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
through their actions in life.

406
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Despite the popularity of genetic explanations

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
for our behavior, recent discoveries in neuroscience

408
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
are overturning long-held beliefs

409
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that the brain is genetically hardwired.

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Scientists are demonstrating the degree

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to which the brain is actually quite plastic.

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
How our thoughts determine our mental landscape.

413
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They are exploring the relationship of willpower to physiology.

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How profoundly the mind can affect our health and functionality.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It is possible that more and more will be discovered

416
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
about how deeply we create the various patterns of our lives

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
through certain mental operations.

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
How we are truly responsible for so much of what happens to us.
