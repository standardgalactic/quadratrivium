00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Introduction. Acquiring Wisdom.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
who nods at them and says,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
morning boys, how's the water?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
And the two young fish swim on for a bit,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
what the hell is water?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
David Foster Wallace.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
So it seemed like it represented many different ways,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
but there's this self part.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
You know, if you think this is the center of everything,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
your perspective, you start here,

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
this is the water, this is the expanse that the fish swims in,

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
that he doesn't know he's in,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
because he has no idea that there is anything without.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
This is his existence,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
like before we discovered oxygen,

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
what was air?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
What was air compared to space?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Did we know what space was compared to atmosphere?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
From our frame of reference,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
what we were standing on was flat,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
and what was above us was expansive.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
To explain that as a human being,

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
it's probably how do I get what I think of myself to match what other people see?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
That way they think I am the way that I am,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
regardless of what is going on.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I can't remember what it was like to think from this perspective.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It was so long ago.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I think that in this part,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
in most wisdom is considered man,

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
as lonely and confused within the expanse of existence,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
that an organism that is aware of itself can be.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
And just to keep it simple,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
it seems like for most people,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
their success as a reproductive organism,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
it would be somebody who gets a lot of women,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
or somebody that has a lot of money,

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
or something like that.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
So when they imagine what success will be like,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
this is man, flesh,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
just an organism that is navigating a reproductive game.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
As far as free will and autonomy is concerned,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
this person believes they have absolute free will,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
because they choose who they have sex with.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
They make the choice of who they're having sex with.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
They're not making a choice of whether or not

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
they have to have sex to feel validated,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
or a rush of dopamine

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
for achieving the human reproductive behavior,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
which is ejaculate or orgasm.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
So sure, you might be choosing who you're having sex with.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
You might have the autonomy over who you're having sex with.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
If you have free will,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
go fall in love with someone you find very unattractive.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
When you think about how attractive you are

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
to the people around you,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and what qualities draw you to people,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
you're not consciously aware that

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
you're making those decisions based on reproductive urge,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
which you find most replicable,

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
which are both sexual selection and natural selection.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Outside of this understanding

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
is I find to be overridden by religious directives.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
So all of this might guide your functioning,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
say, as a younger person, your sexual behavior or something.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
As you get older, though,

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
and through experience,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
you might realize that this was for naught.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
That maybe saving some of that

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
or delaying some of this gratification

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
may have kept you or gotten you maybe a little higher

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
than you wanted to,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
or that you might have achieved something greater

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
if you were concerned with other things.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
That's experience and wisdom.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
The aggregate, the sum of all of this experience

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
is that there's more to life than just this experience.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You go through all of this

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
and you come out on the other side knowing,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
okay, maybe I could have gone without that.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
That's typically what people find out.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
However, you're very drawn to that sort of impulsive behavior

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
because if you just think simply as genetics, as DNA,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
that makes more copies of DNA.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And as long as more copies of DNA are being made,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
then we're good.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
All threatening people with the extinction of their DNA does,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
makes them breed impulsively and create more DNA.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Just a byproduct of their behavior.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Outside of this is religion,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
which doesn't really make much sense to a whole lot of people.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I doubt it even makes a whole lot of sense to religious people.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But there are rules embedded in here

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
that override all of these things

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
and keep you from having to experience the vicissitude

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
of trying to get fucking pussy all the time

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and how worthless it might be in the long run.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
That's not why it was designed.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
It's just something that gives you a higher purpose

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
and overrides man, flesh, and regulation.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
The ability to say no.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
The only actual free will, free won't, to reject the wrong.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
What is wrong?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Some people think there's this arbitrary list of rules

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
that you have to follow that are random,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
unconnected, cut your penis tip off,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
pray to the invisible man, give him some money,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
say the words, do the dance, celebrate Christmas,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
hate gay people, whatever they think the rules are,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
somehow fit somewhere into overriding to the next level,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
just level up from what to do

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
when you're not just behaving in a reproductive manner.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So you've already got fear of the afterlife

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
keeping you from being sexually promiscuous.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
You're already delaying gratification with monogamy.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So there's a big plus, monogamy.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Just an extension of the impulsive self.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
This is still an unregulated sense of control.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Within this, you use their religion to justify this behavior,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
which is lies, betrayal, darkness, wickedness,

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
concepts that we have independent of God, lies, darkness.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Because from this position, lying is a necessary

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
for navigation of the system,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
because the system's out to get you,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
so you have to lie your way through it,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
which isn't true.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
That's just someone that can't understand the simple behavior

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
that rewards you in the long run.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
The rules of religion and ideology,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
as far as culture is concerned, create regulation.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And if you just understand,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
you need some level of regulation to build upwards.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
You need foundations and angles and approaches

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
and support for this to happen properly

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
without it collapsing on you.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
You need regulation.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
You can't just get a bunch of boards and a bunch of hammers

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
and start nailing them together

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and wonder where the fucking skyscraper is,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
because the bitch will fall over.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
You have to have technology and practice and shit like that.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
These things are learned over several generations,

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
written down and recorded on tablets and religions

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
and mythology and things like that,

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
and just passed down.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
We sort of take for granted.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
However, this is still, like I said,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
an extension of reproductive behavior.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
This is still like low level.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Now, at some point,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
there's a possibility that you might realize

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
that there's more up here.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
If you really are into getting to understand the religion,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
you might take a journey through some sort of

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
higher level of God or self.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm sure a lot of people that are spiritual, spirituality.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
The feeling that it is out of the self,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
it is independent of self,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
but it is still an extension of self.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
This is where you get lots of theories about egg theory.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
We are one consciousness.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Our mission to raise consciousness.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
A lot of people, I think, get this confused for like,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
okay, this down here judges people,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
and this up here allows people to be themselves.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
It's like a realization that God's not real,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
but not denying the feeling that is the source of God,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
main character syndrome,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
an echo of this reproductive behavior.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Down here is all your neurotransmitters

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
and your feedback loops, dopamine, serotonin,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
ephedrine, adrenaline, these things, these neurotransmitters.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
So if you've ever been able to identify yourself here

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
as an organism that is capable of trapping itself

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
in the belief that the feelings that it has somehow

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
inside that can't be rationally explained

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
aren't a product of this being kept at bay by culture,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
social standards, etc.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Then you have to identify yourself within a species.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Whatever path you take,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
whatever higher level of study you do,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
if you reach this concept of,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
so however you reach it, if you do,

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
and you know what it means,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
and you reach this point of,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
here you see the like,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
learning truth, this barrier would be like,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
if you break through this barrier

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
into the awareness that you exist as a part of something larger,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
then you can start, you break through this barrier

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
and you land in truth, self, like I am, darkness.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
You just break through these layers of social expectation.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Who am I?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What is me?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
What is purpose?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
And you hit this like,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I wouldn't say it's nirvana yet.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
You hit this light up here, the enlightenment phase,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
which when you first hit, seems endless.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
You know, this thing seems endless,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
but it's not until you crack into nirvana

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
or like a boundless conscious realm,

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
where the way that you process the information that you have

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
is based nothing on the way other people would have you process

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
the information that's available.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
You can only get here through parallels,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
drawing conclusions, making bridges between concepts

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
that you wouldn't otherwise would not think of.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
This is so far beyond the person that's telling you,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
you don't get no bitches, you're an insult.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
These things down here to this person are huge.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
This removed your ability to choose who you're having sex with.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
You have to have sex with someone other than who you want to,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
you know, this kind of shit.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And to somebody who's concerned about those things,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
it will affect their decision-making into the future.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
But somebody that's already risen out of all of these perceptions

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
of self within culture, within a species, within society,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
and shit like that, that knows itself, that knows the truth,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
that understands what is real, what is true.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
It's arbitrary, you know, it goes out compared to the amount of effort

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
you're willing to give it.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
It opens up the ability to process in parallels.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
These are called parables, metaphors.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
The better you are at understanding the connection between the two,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
the better your outcome will be with the information.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
You know, so like a lot of these things that I talk about,

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I had figured out by, you know, 2022,

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
it was exciting because it gave me something to explain to people.

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
Still hitting zeros on people that are willing to understand

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
what I'm talking about.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It's not their fault.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
It's not necessarily my fault.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm just getting better at explaining it.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
But there are some things that I do beyond, you know,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
just figuring out those immediate things.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I let my mind wander to many different things.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
One of the cool things that, you know, I did early last year was,

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
I understand that we think of concepts like numbers in base 10.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I had reached a place where I could, you know,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
chill out on thinking of religion or, you know,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
the solar system and shit like that,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
because I didn't think anybody was ever going to,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I don't think anybody's ever going to get that shit.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
But I started to let my mind wander towards the potential

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
of different counting system.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
How would I comprehend something like that's not base 10 counting?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
We understand whole round numbers,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
like 10 as a round digestible,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
dividable, even number that we can comprehend.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
But there were times when they went by other systems like base 7.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I don't know exactly.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Some base 6 or something like that is how we got the 360 degree turn

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
of circle or something like that.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Like 36 divided by 6 is 6.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
And when you start dividing by numbers like that

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
and they become round that you are able to build

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
more complicated, intricate calculation systems out of them,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
which is, you know, being able to go beyond

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
what we can just normally hold in our head.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Not to complicate that too much,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
but I just was thinking, man,

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
I wonder what it would be like to think in a different base.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Like to think in base 6 or something like that.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And so I would just change my mind to think

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
and process numbers in like base 6.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
What is even base 6?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Is that even a thing?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I initially found out because I was doing like base 7,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I was like wondering what it would be.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
21 would be like a whole number.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Just like 30 is a whole number.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
7 would be like 10.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
But when I would think of these things,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I would think of it as like 7 out of 10.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
It's very hard to understand that 7

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
would represent the same amount as 10

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
or something like that.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Imperial and metric systems

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
are good things to compare here, I think.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Because some people understand that

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
these are all divided by 10.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
One meter, a thousand meters, a kilometer,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
one, and then it goes backward,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
0.1, 0.01, 0.001,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
a decimeter, centimeter, millimeter.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It just moves the decimal.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It can be 750 kilometers.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
A kilometer is a thousand meters.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
You have to do a bunch of conversion and shit

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
to understand what's going on

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
unless you can just see them in 14 stone.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Okay, well, that's about 180 pounds.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I don't know if that's correct,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
but you can do the conversion back and forth,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
which is where I'm stuck here.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
How can I just see it in a way

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
where I just say I was used to kilometers

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
and somebody just came up and explained miles.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And I didn't know how to do the conversion.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't know if that's a way,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
if I'm explaining that correctly,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
but I found out that like,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
I mean, it was really difficult.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
I found that having that base six or something like that,

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
if I think of three as half of six,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
like I think of five as half of 10,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
then I can work from there.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
I also noticed that like seven base seven

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
would break down into four, fours and threes pretty easily,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
which I found really interesting

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
because I was also thinking a lot.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
I also had the orbits and stuff in my mind quite a bit.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
We'd measure time in that sense as one year as one orbit.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
However, we have like an extra day left over,

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
which means that we're like using an incomplete base system.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
If we could figure out a base that was even,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
then you would be able to calculate that out

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
and not have to have the extra leap day.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
The extra leap day was like a,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
it's like a band aid for something

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
that doesn't fit the base six system.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
So instead of looking at one orbit is 365 days,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
this unit is one.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
That is split into 12 months,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
with four weeks and seven days.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Feet, inches, miles, yards, an inch is this long.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Feet is 12 of those.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Yards, miles, a fucking, a lot of those.

16:06.000 --> 16:15.000
1,200, 5,800 and 20 something.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
50, 230.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
How many feet in a mile?

16:27.000 --> 16:37.000
52, 80.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh, feet 52, 80.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Nice.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
I was like, huh, I really was putting my mind into this mode of,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
okay, are there any other ways to break this down?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I know that this is moving.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
This would create almost like a coil.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
If these four didn't add up to four of these,

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
to the point where it was an extra 0.25 days,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
where you had to just add one day,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
is there any way that you could find this place?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Quack, okay, cut it like a spring.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Now I've got one, two, three, four of these movements.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
How many different ways can I break that up?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Well, I can actually do it into three.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
If I just considered these motions to not be one,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I just considered all of this to be one.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
So if the four cycle was one, what does that mean for a base seven?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, I could cut it into three.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
How many ways could I cut it into three?

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Well, not only could I cut these into three instead of four

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
and have something like this for one,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
this to make one instead of this to make one.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
So three would equal one full cycle,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
whereas it used to be four plus an extra day.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I still have 12 months in each year to work with.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
So each one of these circles from above

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
could be split different ways.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
Could this be a three-month block or a three-section block

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
three times?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
What if I spread them out over these three?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
What if I spread them out over four?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
What if I did four over three or three over four?

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
What if I changed the minutes to 70 seconds

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
or an hour to 70 minutes?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
This is where it got wild.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
But then I got into thinking,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
what's wrong with as a symbol,

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
why not different variables or variations of, say,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
like a long line of connected?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I don't know, it's hard to explain.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
If you chopped it up into different sections

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
and symbols start to look like just different patterns

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
of this spring understanding.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
How many different ways could you calculate out information

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
from that perspective?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And I got pretty far into a lot of it,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
but there's nobody to discuss this stuff with.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I have no idea if it has any value.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
I'm just exploring this thing up here quite by myself,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
it feels like, which is okay for now.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
It's just, I know that people are going to ask me

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
why I didn't do it a different way.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And I'm doing it the only way that I know how

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
in the nicest, most patient way,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
without trying to take any of the value of the understanding

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
away from anyone that could possibly understand it.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I just don't know.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I feel like I'm going to be stuck up here alone my entire life,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
which I'd rather be up here alone.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
But because of no idea how cool it is.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I want people to understand me.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I don't want people to not understand me.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
It feels like, it feels like a curse

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
for trying and doing a good thing.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It feels too much of a curse to be...

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I don't know.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm just glad I'm me, you know.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
I used to not feel that way.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
You must convince yourself of the following.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
People get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
through their actions in life.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Despite the popularity of genetic explanations

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
for our behavior, recent discoveries in neuroscience

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
are overturning long-held beliefs

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
that the brain is genetically hardwired.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Scientists are demonstrating the degree

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
to which the brain is actually quite plastic.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
How our thoughts determine our mental landscape.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
They are exploring the relationship of willpower to physiology.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
How profoundly the mind can affect our health and functionality.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
It is possible that more and more will be discovered

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
about how deeply we create the various patterns of our lives

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
through certain mental operations.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
How we are truly responsible for so much of what happens to us.
