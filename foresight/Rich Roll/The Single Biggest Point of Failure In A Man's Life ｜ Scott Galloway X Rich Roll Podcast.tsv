0	5000	We're raising a generation of men who are going to be increasingly psychotic and crazy.
5000	6000	That was ugly.
6000	9000	That is like, yeah, it's so depressing.
9000	12000	What does healthy masculinity look like?
12000	14000	Masculinity is an amazing thing.
14000	15000	You shouldn't apologize for it.
15000	16000	You should lean into it.
16000	17000	But what does it mean?
17000	20000	We've conflated toxicity with masculinity.
20000	24000	There's so many lonely young men who don't have any interaction with people,
24000	30000	very susceptible to anything or any algorithm giving them a sense of self-worth.
30000	35000	I would have been one of those guys today, angry, upset.
35000	37000	So I relate.
37000	39000	My guest today is Scott Galloway.
39000	43000	Scott is a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.
43000	44000	He's a best-selling author.
44000	50000	He's also the host of the Prof. G podcast and a co-host of the Pivot podcast with Kara Swisher.
50000	56000	Masculinity is a societal construct, and a lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculinity.
56000	58000	It's not the domain of people born as men.
58000	64000	In urban areas now in the U.S., women under the age of 30 are making more money than men.
64000	65000	And by the way, that's wonderful.
65000	67000	We should do nothing to get in the way of that.
67000	71000	Women are, I think, ready for more economically and emotionally viable young men.
71000	75000	So the question is, how do we level up young men?
80000	99000	Today's episode is brought to you by the awesome organizations that make this show possible.
99000	101000	Scott, thank you for doing this.
101000	102000	I know it's a schlep to come out here.
102000	104000	I appreciate you making the time.
104000	108000	I've been looking forward to this for a very long time, and there's so much to talk about.
108000	110000	You're such an interesting figure.
110000	114000	You're at the intersection of business and entrepreneurship advice.
114000	122000	You're sort of this really smart cultural critic pundit on tech, the reformation of higher education,
122000	124000	and also self-help.
124000	135000	You have this really sagacious facility for counsel that's aimed broadly, but also very specifically this particular lens on young men
135000	137000	and this concern that you have for the next generation.
137000	144000	And I think the sentiment behind it is really that we have a demonstrable problem with males in the next generation,
144000	152000	the culture of men, the evolution of men, the growth of men, who they are, where and how they are being guided or not being guided,
152000	159000	and how they're being distracted or led astray in a way that's really interfering with their growth and their potential,
159000	162000	and in turn, like the growth of a healthy society.
162000	164000	Yeah, well, first off, thanks for the kind words.
164000	169000	I think I said when I came in, we went through all the podcasts and vites we have,
169000	174000	and I just mentioned your name and before I even finished it, like half my staff, we just went ape shit.
174000	176000	You deeply resonate with a lot of people.
176000	177000	I appreciate that.
177000	180000	Yeah, look, this is something that I'm passionate about.
180000	182000	I think the data's overwhelming.
182000	188000	You know, three times as likely to be addicted, four times as likely to kill themselves as women,
188000	191000	12 times as likely to be incarcerated, 70% opioid every day.
191000	193000	You know, we don't have a homeless problem.
193000	195000	We don't have an opioid problem.
195000	197000	We don't have an incarceration problem.
197000	201000	We have a male suicide, homeless and incarceration problem.
201000	208000	And if any other special interest group were committing suicide at four times the rate of the control group,
208000	210000	we would talk about it in different terms.
210000	215000	We would talk about the need for social programs, intervention, empathy.
215000	219000	But when something like this happens to young men, there's a lack of empathy.
219000	224000	You hear words like accountability or if they were just more in touch with their emotions.
224000	228000	And I think that's really gotten in the way of a productive conversation.
228000	233000	And because there hasn't been a productive conversation and people out there feel and see what's going on,
233000	237000	some voices have entered into that void that are sort of unproductive voices.
237000	245000	And sometimes that kind of this pro-man rhetoric oftentimes is just suddenly veiled misogyny or lack of empathy.
245000	247000	Or kind of what I'll call the manosphere.
247000	248000	It starts off fine.
248000	252000	It's the action-oriented, be fit, take control.
252000	254000	Then it goes to really weird places.
254000	262000	It treats women as property or talks about immigrants taking your job or just sign up for my crypto university.
262000	264000	It just goes to weird places.
264000	272000	It's also been a bit of a third rail issue to raise the peril of the wayward young man in a world in which
272000	280000	the conversation around elevating certain sectors of culture and society is about women and people of color.
280000	283000	And yet the quote that I've heard you often repeat is,
283000	287000	the most dangerous person in the world is a man that is broken and alone.
287000	291000	If you look globally, the most unstable violent societies in the world all have one thing in common.
291000	296000	They have a disproportionate amount of young men with a lack of economic or romantic prospects.
296000	297000	What do we do?
297000	298000	We send them off to war.
298000	301000	If they don't have economic prospects internally, they'll overthrow the government.
301000	304000	So we find conflict and we send them off to war.
304000	310000	Also, this younger generation of men is paying for the unfair advantage you and I had growing up.
310000	315000	I was born in Los Angeles or Southern California in 1964.
315000	316000	I hit the lottery.
316000	320000	You know, being born a white heterosexual male just had huge advantage in California.
320000	321000	Myself as well.
321000	323000	I was born in 66.
323000	324000	You went to UCLA.
324000	325000	I went to Stanford.
325000	330000	I'm the beneficiary of, you know, an incredible education and privilege.
330000	336000	And now that, you know, access to what you and I had access to is all the more remote these days.
336000	337000	Like, what is going on?
337000	339000	Like, how did we get to this place?
339000	344000	What are the tectonic plates that have led us to this situation that we find ourselves in?
344000	347000	So just to make the point around accessibility, I don't know the numbers in Stanford,
347000	353000	but when I applied to UCLA in 1982, the acceptance rate was 76% and it cost $1,200 a year.
353000	355000	And I had to apply twice and I got in.
355000	359000	The acceptance rate this year will be 9% and it's $34,000.
359000	364000	So it's just inaccessible to anyone who's not remarkable, remarkable or rich.
364000	365000	So how did we get here?
365000	370000	I think there's been a variety of things, confluence of factors that have all collided around young men.
370000	373000	One, there's just a lack of empathy.
373000	379000	People see it as a zero-sum game where if you feel empathy for men, it must mean that you are anti-women.
379000	383000	And so there's a lack of empathy and what I call zero-sum gaming.
383000	385000	You know, civil rights didn't hurt white people.
385000	386000	It helped them.
386000	388000	Gay marriage doesn't hurt heteronormative marriage.
388000	390000	It enhances it.
390000	396000	So to talk about empathy for young men is in no way and should in no way be seen as anti-women.
396000	402000	I think the group that wants more viable young men, first and foremost mothers, that's who I hear from the most,
402000	406000	who see what's going on with their daughters and the difference between their daughters and their sons.
406000	407000	And also women.
407000	411000	Women are, I think, ready for more economically and emotionally viable young men.
411000	417000	Women are dating older and older because they're having trouble finding what they would perceive as viable young men.
417000	418000	So a few things.
418000	420000	One, just biological.
420000	422000	Men's prefrontal cortex matures later.
422000	427000	They just don't have the same executive function or adult in the room.
427000	429000	They're less mature, literally less mature.
429000	432000	Two, we have an education system that is biased against them.
432000	438000	If you talk about the behaviors we reward in school, you're essentially going to describe a girl.
438000	439000	Be organized.
439000	440000	Be a pleaser.
440000	441000	Sit still.
441000	444000	You also have an education industrial complex.
444000	447000	92% of kindergarten teachers are women.
447000	451000	There's more female per capita fighter pilots than male kindergarten teachers.
451000	457000	It's about 70, 80% K through 6 and about 60, 70% in high school.
457000	461000	And naturally you're going to empathize with a little version of you.
461000	465000	So I just don't think there's the same level of empathy for young men.
465000	469000	We've also done away with metal shop, auto shop, wood shop.
469000	478000	So the guy who's not cut out for college, who doesn't sit still, who's not academically focused as fewer and fewer on ramps into a middle class lifestyle.
478000	481000	And then these guys get into the workforce.
481000	483000	There's fewer middle class trades jobs.
483000	491000	In America, parents have done a really good job of convincing themselves they've failed as a parent if their kid doesn't end up at Stanford or UCLA.
491000	494000	So there's a lot of rage and shame in the household.
494000	499000	There's not visible on ramps into a healthy middle class life.
499000	502000	3% of LinkedIn profiles in America say apprentice.
502000	505000	It's 11% in the UK and Germany.
505000	508000	50% of Germans have some sort of vocational certification.
508000	509000	That's not true here.
509000	514000	It's kind of become this you either get to Stanford or UCLA or you and your parents have failed.
514000	521000	And then a lot of dynamics dating apps where you have two, three to one men to women.
521000	532000	And you also have this effect where because everyone has access to everyone, not everyone, but women who have a much finer filter are all drawn to the kind of what I call same guy.
532000	538000	So you have 50 men on Tinder, 50 women, 46 of those women will show all of their attention and interest to just four guys.
538000	542000	So it's great to be in the top 10% on a dating app if you're a guy.
542000	544000	The bottom 90, it's really difficult.
544000	553000	And the bottom half of men on dating apps, we're now one in two relationships begin, get validation that they have absolutely no worth in the dating market.
553000	559000	So lack of economic prospects, a lack of maturity, a society that doesn't seem to have a lot of empathy for them.
559000	563000	And then a mating market that validates they don't have a lot of value.
563000	569000	And you see these men go down this downward spiral where they start, and this is where you know, we've really lost them.
569000	572000	They start becoming ultra-nationalists.
572000	573000	They start blaming immigrants.
573000	574000	They start blaming women.
574000	576000	They become prone to conspiracy theory.
576000	579000	In some, they just become really shitty citizens.
579000	587000	And the final thing I would say is that the most profitable, valuable companies in the world have one thing in common.
587000	593000	And that is they're tapping into a lack of regulation and instinctive flaws.
593000	594000	Men are more risk aggressive.
594000	599000	So the fastest growing technology sector right now is gaming, which is the play way of saying gambling.
599000	600000	Men are more risk aggressive.
600000	601000	They like to gamble.
601000	603000	85% of gamblers are men.
603000	606000	They're four to six times more likely to develop a gambling addiction.
606000	613000	You then put it on a phone and you have Kevin Hart and Charles Barkley telling you that you're smart and you should bet on March Madness.
613000	625000	And then you have social media apps or Robin Hood or Metta or YouTube sort of tapping into these instincts, these flawed instincts of men,
625000	635000	where they become prone to conspiracy theory, much more risk aggressive, much more inclined to develop a relationship with you porn as opposed to saying,
635000	644000	okay, how do I go out there and develop the skills in the game and the economic and emotional viability to find my own romantic partner?
644000	647000	They're mistaking Reddit and Discord for friendship.
647000	651000	They're mistaking Robin Hood and Coinbase for making a living.
651000	655000	They're mistaking you porn for establishing a relationship.
655000	663000	And so a lot of these men have had the real world or the motivation to find real relationships replaced with algorithms and screens.
663000	668000	It's a low entry, low risk cost of having a reasonable facsimile of life.
668000	673000	And if you're not careful, you wake up a few years later, you don't have those skills and you're depressed.
673000	682000	Because getting out and finding a job, getting out, going into work, getting up, putting on a tie, learning how to read the room,
682000	689000	learning how to make a woman laugh, establish body language, be persistent, endure rejection.
689000	692000	There's a reason romantic comedies are two hours, not 15 minutes.
692000	697000	This shit is hard and it's humiliating, but that's what real victory in real life looks like.
697000	705000	And I think there's a disproportionate or a small number of young men who are ever going to experience that real joy and that real victory
705000	712000	because of the low cost, low entry, reasonable facsimile of life that these companies prey on.
712000	716000	That's a pretty dire portrait of the current state of affairs.
716000	722000	The eradication of opportunity, the lack of adequate on-ramps to higher education,
722000	733000	and the confluence of all these technologies that are conspiring to capture the attention of the young male and channel it in unhealthy ways
733000	740000	is going to leave that individual not just depressed but angry and looking for an outlet for that anger.
740000	744000	Well, there's an upside. If you're in the top 10%, life's never been better.
744000	750000	We're in a Hunger Games economy. The winner leads a remarkable life and everybody else dies a slow death.
750000	755000	If you have your shit together as a young man and you have the discipline to get the right certification,
755000	760000	the graduates of my class at Stern, I teach the MBA, their average salary is $212,000.
760000	763000	They go on a dating app, they're going to get a ton of attention.
763000	766000	Their opportunities have never been more exceptional.
766000	771000	Their vacations, their ability to take care of their parents at a young age, their economic opportunity,
771000	775000	their chance to make millions is within reach by the time of 30.
775000	781000	Those opportunities did not exist for our parents, so it's become sort of a winner-take-most environment.
781000	788000	So it's great to be in the top 10%, but I can prove to all of us that 90% of our sons are not in the top 10%.
788000	793000	And when you think about, it goes back to me, like, what is America supposed to be?
793000	797000	And the reason I got involved here, I was in that bottom 90. I was probably in that bottom 50.
797000	804000	Is America about identifying the remarkable or identifying the children of rich people and turning them into billionaires?
804000	806000	Is that what America is supposed to do?
806000	812000	My view is America is about identifying or giving everyone in the bottom 90 a shot to be in the top 10%.
812000	815000	That's how it was when I grew up. I was unremarkable.
815000	821000	I think that when I look at you, I see somebody, I mean, you're clearly passionate about this.
821000	827000	This is a very mission-based, service-oriented kind of endeavor that you found yourself in.
827000	831000	And you're somebody who's had many successes in different areas of life.
831000	836000	You have economic independence. You could choose to be doing lots of different things.
836000	843000	And you've chosen through all of the ways that you show up publicly in Prophetic Media and the podcasting, et cetera,
843000	846000	to really focus your advocacy around this.
846000	850000	And it strikes me as very earnest and heartfelt.
850000	854000	Like, this really is a mission that you're passionate about.
854000	859000	I don't know that much about you, Rich, but I was that guy, you know?
859000	863000	I didn't have a lot of money. No, no romantic prospects.
863000	876000	But America loved me, right? Free education, remarkable institution, great job,
876000	882000	a chance to, you know, get economically viable, a chance to take care of my mother.
882000	889000	I would have been one of those guys today, angry, upset.
890000	893000	So, I relate.
893000	898000	Yeah. Your mother was an integral figure in all of this.
898000	904000	Yeah, look, the reason I'm here with you now, it's easy to credit your grit and your character for your success
904000	906000	and blame the market for your failures.
906000	912000	I get to come here and I get to bomb out of here and go to the Beverly Hills Hotel and have, like, you know,
912000	917000	do whatever the fuck I want and, you know, have an incredible life
917000	922000	because of, one, the generosity and vision of California taxpayers and the Regency University of California
922000	927000	who said, our job is to give unremarkable kids remarkable opportunity,
927000	932000	being born at the right place at the right time and the unconditional love of my mother, right?
932000	935000	Single immigrant mother lived and died a secretary.
935000	939000	But, you know, every day told me that I was wonderful and I think that stuck with me.
939000	944000	But yeah, like, I don't know what your relationship was like with your parents,
944000	948000	but if you think about investing, there's some basics, right?
948000	952000	You invest a little bit of money, compound interest is just this remarkable thing.
952000	955000	Most people feel that the singular relationship in their life,
955000	958000	if they're asked to identify the singular relationship in their life,
958000	961000	they usually, more often than not, number one is their mother.
961000	965000	And it's because she made those tiny little investments in you every day,
965000	971000	waking you up with a soft voice, worried about you, could hear you get up when you were a kid
971000	975000	and come in and comfort you every day, just dozens of little investments.
975000	978000	And, you know, your mom wakes up and you wake up when you're older,
978000	982000	regardless of whether you don't get along, maybe you don't even like each other,
982000	984000	but it's a singular relationship.
984000	990000	And, you know, I think a lot about the relationship, how powerful it was for me
990000	992000	and what was really wonderful about my mom,
992000	995000	she had the foresight to get a lot of men involved in my life.
995000	1000000	Because if you look at the singular point of failure in a young man's life,
1000000	1002000	it's when he loses a male role model.
1002000	1008000	And it's interesting because we have the second most single parent homes in the world behind Sweden.
1008000	1012000	And when we say single parent, 92% of the time, that means it's a single mother.
1012000	1017000	And what's interesting is the data shows that the daughters of single mothers have the same outcomes,
1017000	1021000	same college attendance, same income, same rates of self-harm.
1021000	1024000	Boys, once they lose a male role model,
1024000	1027000	immediately become dramatically more likely to be incarcerated,
1027000	1030000	dramatically less likely to graduate from high school,
1030000	1032000	dramatically more likely to suffer from addiction.
1032000	1037000	What it ends up is that while boys are physically stronger,
1037000	1040000	they're emotionally and mentally much weaker.
1040000	1045000	Just because you say it's really important that a boy have a man involved in his life,
1045000	1050000	that's in no way diminishing the superheroes that are single mothers.
1050000	1056000	But I think we have to acknowledge that it is really important that men be involved
1056000	1059000	and that's the problem with schools now that don't have enough men
1059000	1066000	because there's an entire generation of young men that go through their lives until they're 25 with absolutely no men involved.
1066000	1070000	And if you have kids, you see that occasionally dad just plays a bigger role,
1070000	1073000	his physical size, his voice, whatever it might be.
1073000	1076000	And I'm thinking a lot about masculinity.
1076000	1078000	I think the ultimate expression of masculinity is,
1078000	1082000	I've got my shit sewed together, I can take care of myself, I can take care of my media family,
1082000	1086000	I can take care of my kids, the people I work with, I pay good taxes.
1086000	1091000	But the ultimate expression of masculinity is getting involved in the life of a boy that isn't yours.
1091000	1096000	And unfortunately, Michael Jackson and Catholic Church have fucked it up for all of us
1096000	1100000	and created this weird notion that if you're a guy your age and you're super successful,
1100000	1104000	you might have love to give and you might see a 15-year-old boy that could use your help
1104000	1107000	and it feels unnatural to get involved in his life.
1107000	1108000	And that's not true.
1108000	1111000	Yeah, the culture of mentorship has waned to say the least
1111000	1118000	and I think it's fair to say that America was built on the idea of apprenticeship and mentorship.
1118000	1122000	But that culture seems to have evaporated.
1122000	1126000	Like where are the mentors? Where are the sage councils
1126000	1132000	and the healthy masculine men who are helping to guide the next generation?
1132000	1135000	Well, I got it from coaches, but a lot of kids aren't going to church though.
1135000	1137000	They used to get it from the Reverend or the rabbi.
1137000	1142000	Community-oriented programs have gone away.
1142000	1145000	What are the rates of young men in sports?
1145000	1147000	Is it the way that it was when we were kids?
1147000	1150000	Are less young men participating in sports?
1150000	1156000	And where are the other healthy outlets for the young men in need of mentorship?
1156000	1158000	So, sports is like most things.
1158000	1162000	There's still the same level of participation, but unfortunately it's been crowded towards the wealthy.
1162000	1166000	Engaging in a sport has become not a luxury item, but pretty close.
1166000	1170000	Even if you look at the college athletes outside of basketball and football,
1170000	1174000	it's disproportionately rich kids because if your kid wants to play lacrosse,
1174000	1177000	to send them to lacrosse camps or hurdle lacrosse camps
1177000	1180000	and get them the right training and the right equipment, it's just expensive.
1180000	1184000	But I think sports and after-school programs are being cut,
1184000	1188000	but going to solutions, I think there's a ton of solutions.
1188000	1194000	So, starting boys a year late in elementary school, they're just less mature.
1194000	1198000	The worst thing that happened to me or almost happened to me is my parents wanted me to skip a grade
1198000	1202000	because it was back in the space race and if you were offered the opportunity to skip a grade,
1202000	1204000	that meant you were going to be at work for NASA.
1204000	1211000	I showed up at UCLA at the age of 17 and I was way too immature to handle the alcohol and the pressure of it all.
1211000	1216000	Starting a year later, trying to create greater incentives to get more men in primary and secondary,
1216000	1220000	high school and elementary school, more vocational programming.
1220000	1225000	There's just a ton of jobs in the real economy for specialty construction, specialty nursing.
1225000	1230000	Anyone who's renovating a house knows that a roofer makes really good money, much less a plumber,
1230000	1233000	and stops shaming those jobs, start elevating them.
1233000	1237000	I think we have to level up young people in general.
1237000	1240000	There's been an enormous transfer of wealth from young people to old people.
1240000	1246000	Specifically, people only the age of 40 used to control 19% of the GDP in terms of their wealth.
1246000	1247000	It's been cut to 9%.
1248000	1252000	The average 70-year-old is 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago.
1252000	1256000	The average person under the age of 40 is 24% less wealthy.
1256000	1260000	And that affects women and men, but it's disproportionately affecting men
1260000	1267000	because men are fairly or unfairly evaluated from a mating perspective based on their economic viability.
1267000	1272000	The best example of, I think, that depicts this, the greatest innovation in history
1272000	1274000	wasn't the iPhone or a semiconductor.
1274000	1276000	It was the American middle class.
1276000	1281000	Bought wars, pushed back on fascism, paid an enormous amount of taxes, was innovative,
1281000	1286000	came up with DARPA, came up with vaccines, came up with GPS.
1286000	1290000	And where it all started was 7 million men returned from World War II,
1290000	1292000	and they demonstrated excellence in uniform.
1292000	1295000	And the government said, we're going to make a massive investment in them
1295000	1298000	in terms of the GI Bill and the highway construction bill.
1298000	1300000	We're going to make jobs, we're going to make economic viability.
1300000	1302000	And quite frankly, they were just very attractive.
1302000	1307000	And they had an easier time finding mating, finding a house, two-car garage,
1307000	1309000	and it set off the baby boom.
1309000	1314000	And it set off a generation of confident, loving kids who were comfortable and said,
1314000	1315000	all right, it's time for civil rights.
1315000	1317000	It's time to bring women into the workforce.
1317000	1319000	It's time for women's rights.
1319000	1325000	And it just set off this kind of post-World War II liberal progressive society,
1325000	1328000	the likes of which we've never seen that type of prosperity.
1328000	1330000	But the middle class is an accident.
1330000	1331000	It doesn't self-sustain.
1331000	1334000	The incumbents and people on the far right will claim that the middle class
1334000	1336000	is a self-repairing organism.
1336000	1337000	It's not.
1337000	1338000	It's an anomaly.
1338000	1340000	Middle classes have never existed in society before.
1340000	1342000	We figured it out.
1342000	1345000	But unless you have economically and emotionally viable men,
1345000	1346000	you can't have a middle class.
1346000	1349000	So the question is, how do we level up young men?
1349000	1352000	And I don't think you can just have affirmative action for men.
1352000	1354000	I think that's too political.
1354000	1357000	But I do think we have to put more money into the pockets of young people
1357000	1359000	who have seen a transfer of wealth.
1359000	1361000	And I'll touch a third rail here.
1361000	1363000	Every year we transfer one and a half trillion dollars.
1363000	1367000	The greatest economic transfer in history happens every year from young people
1367000	1370000	to the wealthiest generation in history, senior citizens.
1370000	1372000	And it's called social security.
1372000	1378000	And it just is insane that this group that has consistently seen their wealth
1378000	1382000	and on an inflation-adjusted basis, their livelihood go down and down and down,
1382000	1386000	transfer money to the wealthiest population in the world.
1386000	1388000	So let's talk more about economics.
1388000	1393000	Mortgage tax deduction and capital gains are the two biggest deductions in our tax code.
1393000	1396000	Who makes their money selling stocks and selling assets?
1396000	1397000	Guys my age.
1397000	1399000	Who makes their money with sweat?
1399000	1401000	The guys in this room, the younger guys.
1401000	1402000	Who owns homes?
1402000	1403000	Older people.
1403000	1404000	Who rents?
1404000	1405000	Younger people.
1405000	1410000	I feel like almost every economic policy is nothing but a thinly veiled transfer of wealth
1410000	1411000	from the young to the old.
1411000	1416000	And then the final one, the greatest intergenerational train robbery in history
1416000	1421000	was the CARES Act in the transfer of wealth during COVID.
1421000	1424000	Eighty-five percent of the money flushed into households was saved.
1424000	1426000	It wasn't spent.
1426000	1430000	So five of the seven trillion dollars wasn't spent on food or housing.
1430000	1435000	It went into the markets, which absolutely sent the asset prices of real estate
1435000	1437000	and stock markets screaming.
1437000	1439000	Who owns homes and stocks?
1439000	1441000	The incumbents and the old.
1441000	1447000	The reason I'm rich is because in 2008, the government let the economy crash.
1447000	1449000	It bailed out banks, but it didn't bail out the economy.
1449000	1450000	I had a little bit of money.
1450000	1452000	I was coming into my prime income earning years.
1452000	1458000	So I was able to buy Apple and Amazon and Netflix at seven, four, and 10 bucks.
1458000	1459000	Right?
1459000	1460000	Yeah.
1460000	1462000	Where the fuck did these guys put their money out?
1462000	1464000	In Virginia at $900 a share?
1464000	1469000	Would they buy a home in Agura Hills, a cute ranch home for $2.3 million?
1469000	1474000	When they bailed out me and the incumbents three years ago,
1474000	1476000	all they were doing was robbing opportunity from young people.
1476000	1480000	When you bail out the boomer who owns a restaurant,
1480000	1484000	all you're doing is robbing opportunity from the 26-year-old female graduate
1484000	1486000	of the Brooklyn Culinary Academy.
1486000	1487000	She's not getting her shot.
1487000	1492000	The churn and turnover are key to giving young people an opportunity.
1492000	1496000	So we effectively decided during COVID was a million people dying would be bad,
1496000	1500000	but letting the NASDAQ go down and making boomers less rich would be tragic.
1500000	1501000	It was pure theft.
1501000	1503000	And who's going to have to pay for this shit?
1503000	1504000	Not you or me.
1504000	1506000	Them and their kids.
1506000	1507000	Yeah.
1507000	1508000	That doesn't bode well.
1508000	1514000	And then when you think about that in the context of increasing polarization
1514000	1518000	and the kind of denigration of our public discourse
1518000	1525000	and the increase in distrust in institutions matched with the lack of opportunity
1525000	1530000	and everything that you just outlined, like, does America survive this?
1530000	1537000	Like, how are we going to get back to a place where we're providing adequate opportunity to young people
1537000	1541000	and we're in a social contract with our brothers and sisters
1541000	1545000	where we agree upon the things that are important to create a healthy culture
1545000	1549000	that can survive and flourish as a democratic republic?
1549000	1553000	Well, I mean, the ground zero, I think, for almost all of our problems
1553000	1558000	or the incendiary port on our problems is that for the first time in our nation's history,
1558000	1563000	a 30-year-old man or woman isn't doing as well as his or her parents were at 30.
1563000	1565000	That's never happened before.
1565000	1570000	What's so upsetting about it is it's in the face of unprecedented prosperity.
1570000	1573000	Five minutes post the earnings release of NVIDIA,
1573000	1578000	it adds $240 billion in market capitalization,
1578000	1580000	but we can't afford the child tax credit.
1580000	1586000	Child tax credit between $24 billion and $40 billion immediately eliminated poverty
1586000	1589000	for 40% of kids in food insecure homes.
1589000	1592000	Like, I didn't even think you could do that with $24 or $40 million.
1592000	1595000	We spent $800 billion on our military and I'm not suggesting we should reduce it.
1595000	1596000	I think it's important.
1596000	1598000	We have a robust defense department.
1598000	1599000	But what do you know?
1599000	1603000	Social security gets a 9% cost of living adjustment increase
1603000	1608000	and the child tax credit gets stripped out of the infrastructure bill.
1608000	1611000	So we have elected representatives average age 63.
1611000	1614000	D.C. is a cross between the walking dead and the golden girls
1614000	1617000	and if that sounds ageist, it is ageist.
1617000	1618000	But here's the thing.
1618000	1622000	Do they really relate to a 28-year-old who's trying to build a home with kids
1622000	1627000	and kids don't vote and young people don't vote, but old people vote?
1627000	1630000	So we're about to see for the first time in our nation's history
1630000	1637000	almost 50% of our entire federal budget be allocated towards seniors.
1637000	1641000	And young people as a result just don't have as much opportunity
1641000	1644000	and they're not dumb, it pisses them off.
1644000	1647000	They look up, they see us, they see the opportunities we had,
1647000	1650000	they see how much money is being spent on seniors
1650000	1653000	and then every day they're reminded that they're failing.
1653000	1656000	They live in a society where algorithms are constantly telling them
1656000	1659000	everyone else is rich, you failed.
1659000	1661000	If you're not hanging out at the Amman Hotel
1661000	1664000	or you're not flying private or you don't have a six-pack
1664000	1667000	or you don't have a hot boyfriend or a girlfriend, you failed
1667000	1669000	and you get these reminders every day.
1669000	1674000	So I think these righteous movements around Black Lives Matter and Me Too,
1674000	1676000	they are righteous movements,
1676000	1681000	but every movement now has a ton of incendiary report on it
1681000	1683000	because young people are just angry.
1683000	1687000	Okay, my neighbor works at Google, she's killing it.
1687000	1689000	I'm not on the top 1%.
1689000	1694000	And the thing is, as Americans, our superpowers are optimism,
1694000	1698000	but we all believe our kid is going to be in that top 1%.
1698000	1700000	And I just think we moved away from America,
1700000	1703000	which used to be about giving unremarkable kids
1703000	1706000	a remarkable opportunity to, we've decided, okay,
1706000	1711000	let's elect a series of people who continue to transfer wealth from young people.
1711000	1714000	And oh, wait, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates dropped out of college.
1714000	1715000	That can happen.
1715000	1718000	Well, okay, but most young people, if you look at the numbers,
1718000	1720000	are having a tough time.
1720000	1723000	We have the most anxious, depressed generation in history.
1724000	1727000	The science is in people, hot and cold therapy.
1727000	1730000	In other words, using sauna and cold water immersion
1730000	1732000	has so many powerful benefits,
1732000	1735000	like lowering inflammation, reducing muscle soreness,
1735000	1738000	boosting energy, and elevating mood.
1738000	1743000	But the thing is, DIY ice baths are this colossal hassle
1743000	1747000	and basically just impractical, making the whole affair unsustainable,
1747000	1750000	which is a problem solved by the guys at Plunge,
1750000	1753000	who pioneered the all-in-one solution,
1753000	1758000	this gorgeous, elegant, modern tub that's easy to install indoors or out
1758000	1760000	with cooling and filtration built right into it.
1760000	1763000	So it basically requires almost zero maintenance.
1763000	1765000	And I use it almost every single day,
1765000	1768000	which has greatly impacted my physical health,
1768000	1772000	and I got to say, vastly improved my mental well-being.
1772000	1775000	The Plunge team now also offers a beautiful sauna
1775000	1777000	for the ultimate hot, cold experience.
1777000	1780000	This gorgeously designed addition to your space.
1780000	1782000	I got mine up and running recently,
1782000	1785000	and I got to say, I can no longer imagine life without it.
1785000	1789000	It really has been an absolute game changer for my physical health, of course,
1789000	1793000	but also all these profound benefits to my mental well-being.
1793000	1797000	To learn more and get your own cold plunge tub or sauna,

1807000	1811000	One of the solutions to providing greater opportunity
1811000	1814000	is to better democratize access to higher education.
1814000	1817000	And, you know, one of the things you talk a lot about
1817000	1820000	is how we need to be reforming those institutions,
1820000	1824000	which have become luxury brands that thrive on scarcity
1824000	1826000	as opposed to being public servants
1826000	1831000	who are trying to elevate the sort of base-level intelligence
1831000	1834000	of the younger generations.
1834000	1838000	Look, we have a tendency to believe that me and my colleagues
1838000	1840000	are somehow more noble than the rest of the population,
1840000	1842000	and we sit around with our labradors
1842000	1844000	and our corduroy vests watching PBS
1844000	1846000	thinking about how to make the world a better place.
1846000	1848000	And there's some of that.
1848000	1851000	I have remarkable colleagues who are good people,
1851000	1853000	but we're like everybody else.
1853000	1855000	And I think we wake up, a lot of administrators
1855000	1857000	and leadership on campus wake up
1857000	1859000	and ask themselves the same question every day
1859000	1861000	when they look in the mirror.
1861000	1863000	How do I increase my compensation
1863000	1865000	while reducing my accountability?
1865000	1867000	And we found the ultimate strategy.
1867000	1869000	I called the LVMA strategy.
1869000	1872000	When I went to UCLA, the facilities were shitty,
1872000	1875000	but 76% got in and it was 400 bucks.
1876000	1878000	And what they figured out is, I know,
1878000	1881000	keep the admissions rates static and low.
1881000	1882000	When the dean announces,
1882000	1885000	we rejected 92% of our applicants this year at NYA,
1885000	1887000	we stand up and we applaud.
1887000	1890000	And the alumni love it because their degree goes up in value.
1890000	1893000	And this same rejectionist LVMA strategy
1893000	1895000	has been adopted across the larger economy.
1895000	1898000	If you own a home, you get very concerned.
1898000	1899000	You're in the Malibu Canyon.
1899000	1901000	I bet any homeowner in the Malibu Canyon
1901000	1904000	takes a real interest in new plans for new development,
1904000	1906000	and they show up and they're very concerned
1906000	1908000	and come up with thoughtful reasons
1908000	1910000	why new developments never get the permits.
1910000	1913000	And the result is we have a shortage every year
1913000	1917000	of somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 million houses we need.
1917000	1920000	And then you have big companies who weaponize government
1920000	1923000	and create it harder and harder for small companies to emerge.
1923000	1929000	So the result is the incumbents see their asset values increase,
1929000	1932000	but people can't get into these schools.
1932000	1935000	Harvard sits on a $53 billion endowment,
1935000	1937000	which is the GDP of Costa Rica,
1937000	1940000	and it's kept its freshman class at 1,500 kids.
1940000	1943000	A good Starbucks serves 1,500 people.
1943000	1947000	They could admit 15,000 and have no tax,
1947000	1949000	absolutely no tax on their resources.
1949000	1951000	So one of the solutions in my view
1951000	1953000	is if you are not growing your freshman enrollment
1953000	1955000	faster than population growth,
1955000	1957000	you should lose your nonprofit status.
1957000	1960000	And COVID provided the perfect opportunity
1960000	1963000	to reevaluate what you just shared
1963000	1967000	and create a situation through online education
1967000	1970000	to broaden the aperture and make it accessible
1970000	1971000	to so many more people.
1971000	1973000	And we all know what happened.
1973000	1974000	That didn't happen.
1974000	1975000	It didn't.
1975000	1976000	Yeah.
1976000	1978000	I speak at a lot of corporations, a lot of big companies,
1978000	1979000	and they'll say, what can we do?
1979000	1983000	The first thing a corporation could do to make this better
1983000	1987000	is to stop fetishizing graduates from elite universities.
1987000	1989000	When I went to work for Morgan Stanley,
1989000	1992000	they recruited at Stanford and Berkeley,
1992000	1994000	and I was the first analyst I hired at UCLA.
1994000	1996000	UCLA wasn't good enough for them.
1996000	1998000	And I fell into the trap.
1998000	2000000	When I started my company, I fetishized hiring people.
2000000	2003000	We only hired people from Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA,
2003000	2004000	and for some reason UVA.
2004000	2006000	We had people from UVA.
2006000	2010000	When you decide that you're only hiring from elite universities,
2010000	2013000	you're saying, I'm not interested in single mothers.
2013000	2016000	You're immediately excluding people who don't even have rich parents
2016000	2018000	or are freakishly remarkable.
2018000	2021000	So my recommendation, I was talking to the CEO of Salesforce
2021000	2022000	about this,
2022000	2025000	move away from a certification-based hiring strategy
2025000	2027000	to a skills-based strategy.
2027000	2030000	How do you figure out the testing, and it's expensive and it's hard
2030000	2035000	to hire really talented young people that based on their skills
2035000	2037000	as opposed to their certification?
2037000	2040000	Because the reason we have entered into this LVMH strategy
2040000	2043000	at elite universities is that corporations love it.
2043000	2045000	People think our student is our consumer.
2045000	2047000	No, our consumer is our product.
2047000	2049000	Our consumer is the corporation.
2049000	2051000	And the corporation is basically
2051000	2053000	outsourced screening and hiring to these universities,
2053000	2056000	thinking if they're only leading an 8% of their applicants,
2056000	2058000	they must be pretty good.
2058000	2062000	So corporations moving to a certification saying 10%, 20%,
2062000	2064000	50% of our applicants.
2064000	2066000	And I'm not talking about admin jobs.
2066000	2068000	I'm talking about professional track jobs.
2068000	2071000	Are going to be reserved for people based on a skills-based assessment
2071000	2073000	where it is certification-blind.
2073000	2076000	You couldn't get past the front desk without an elite university degree
2076000	2078000	at Morgan Stanley when I was there.
2078000	2080000	Isn't tech a little bit different though?
2080000	2084000	I feel like they are slightly more progressive in terms of how they hire
2084000	2086000	because they are looking at skills,
2086000	2090000	and it's a bit more untethered from pedigree.
2090000	2092000	Is that true?
2092000	2095000	A little bit, especially when I'm programming,
2095000	2097000	but I would argue if you want a job
2097000	2100000	in a traditional professional track and met or alphabet,
2100000	2103000	it's pretty hard to get in without an elite university degree.
2103000	2106000	And it's a self-reinforcing mechanism because they're so populated
2106000	2108000	with people from amazing universities.
2108000	2111000	I mean, this goes back to why it's so important to get out of your house
2111000	2113000	and that you're social.
2113000	2115000	Because there was just a study done at Google,
2115000	2117000	and a hiring manager says,
2117000	2119000	we put out a job opening for a product manager.
2119000	2121000	We get immediately 200 resumes and we cut it down
2121000	2123000	because we don't need more than 200.
2123000	2125000	We decide to bring in 20 people.
2125000	2128000	And of the 20 people the hire we make is almost always someone
2128000	2130000	who is referred internally.
2130000	2132000	So if you want a job, you better have a lot of friends.
2133000	2135000	But I don't know.
2135000	2137000	I think tech is probably as big an offender.
2137000	2141000	I think tech founders oftentimes don't have college degrees.
2141000	2144000	If you're an AI engineer, okay, fine.
2144000	2146000	You don't need a degree.
2146000	2148000	But I would argue for the majority of the jobs,
2148000	2150000	the professional track jobs,
2150000	2153000	they still fetishize an elite college degree.
2153000	2156000	Part of getting young males out of the basement
2156000	2159000	and into the world and face-to-face with people
2159000	2163000	requires some modeling of that healthy behavior.
2163000	2167000	And I think what's so potent about who you are
2167000	2171000	and how you show up is that you're this really successful dude,
2171000	2175000	but you're also like an alpha guy who's progressive,
2175000	2177000	who's ribald at times,
2177000	2179000	like you're not afraid to tell a dirty joke,
2179000	2181000	you're strong, you're fit,
2181000	2183000	and you know what you're talking about
2183000	2187000	when you're talking about economics and social sciences, etc.
2187000	2191000	Why aren't there more people like you?
2191000	2193000	Well, you're being generous.
2193000	2195000	Let's unpack that.
2195000	2197000	Do you remember the Presidential Fitness Awards?
2197000	2198000	Sure.
2198000	2200000	I was going to figure out a way.
2200000	2201000	I got a three years in a row,
2201000	2203000	and then I hit a growth spurt in the eighth grade,
2203000	2205000	and I didn't get the badge, and it was devastating for me.
2205000	2207000	And I started doing pull-ups every day
2207000	2210000	until I got back to seven pull-ups, which is what I needed.
2210000	2214000	We have become so politically correct
2214000	2217000	that we romanticize obesity.
2217000	2218000	You're finding your truth.
2218000	2219000	No, you're not.
2219000	2221000	You're finding a fucking ventilator.
2221000	2223000	I mean, that's not to say that we shouldn't have empathy.
2223000	2225000	We shouldn't figure out programs
2225000	2227000	to give people in food deserts
2227000	2229000	the opportunity to eat more healthy,
2229000	2231000	but we should be celebrating fitness.
2231000	2232000	One of the first things I say to men
2232000	2234000	if I coach a young man,
2234000	2237000	lean into your strengths as a man.
2237000	2240000	We have superior or more dense bone structure,
2240000	2242000	a lot more muscle,
2242000	2245000	and then testosterone gets poured over it.
2245000	2247000	I think any man under the age of 30
2247000	2249000	should be able to walk into any room
2249000	2250000	and know that if shit got real,
2250000	2253000	they could either kill and eat everybody or outrun them.
2253000	2255000	And it's an amazing feeling.
2255000	2256000	It's going to make you kinder.
2256000	2258000	Who breaks up fights at bars?
2258000	2259000	A big, strong man.
2259000	2260000	Who is kinder?
2260000	2262000	Who has an easier time finding mates?
2262000	2264000	Who wants to protect others?
2264000	2266000	Who's going to be less depressed,
2266000	2268000	make more money?
2268000	2271000	Fitness and celebrating strength is a wonderful thing.
2272000	2273000	Especially for men.
2273000	2274000	It's key.
2274000	2276000	And then we have become so politically correct
2276000	2279000	around potentially offending people.
2279000	2281000	The people who are the most profane
2281000	2283000	used to be the most liberal.
2283000	2286000	Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin.
2286000	2290000	And on the far left, we become such snowflakes
2290000	2291000	that anything,
2291000	2294000	I think the thing that hurts people from being elected
2294000	2296000	to implement many of the policies I'm promoting
2296000	2299000	are that we're seen as humorless.
2299000	2300000	Like, at some point,
2300000	2302000	we're going to get to celebrate our differences.
2302000	2305000	I co-host a podcast with Cara Swisher, who's a lesbian.
2305000	2308000	I make fun of her sexual orientation.
2308000	2310000	I make inappropriate jokes.
2310000	2311000	And then there's a pause.
2311000	2312000	And she laughs.
2312000	2315000	And she gives everyone else permission to laugh.
2315000	2316000	I think that's really important.
2316000	2319000	Social media has created this infrastructure
2319000	2321000	where you get guardian of gotcha points
2321000	2324000	by if someone says something off color,
2324000	2325000	you go after them.
2325000	2327000	And I think it's awful.
2327000	2330000	And I purposely dial up the profanity.
2330000	2333000	Because I'm like, for God's sakes,
2333000	2336000	the left needs to take back profanity and vulgarity.
2336000	2338000	That doesn't mean you're a bad person.
2338000	2342000	But what you do is also matched with a compassion
2342000	2343000	and a vulnerability.
2343000	2345000	Because I think what you just shared
2345000	2348000	is also the portal to bad influence on the internet.
2348000	2352000	Like, make your bed, get fit, eat right,
2352000	2354000	show up when you say you're going to show up.
2354000	2357000	Those are all sound and solid principles.
2357000	2358000	It's good advice.
2358000	2362000	But too often that, as you were sharing earlier,
2362000	2366000	is sort of the beginning of a slide into a darker world.
2366000	2368000	And those influencers seem to commandeer
2368000	2371000	too large of a percentage of the internet
2371000	2373000	and capture the minds and the fascination
2373000	2377000	of these wayward young men who are in search of good influence
2377000	2378000	and just take what's available,
2378000	2381000	what's showing up when they're scrolling on their feet.
2381000	2383000	Like, why is it that those are the voices
2383000	2386000	that rise to the top and a more grounded,
2386000	2390000	kind of kinder, more conscientious approach
2390000	2394000	that you model isn't the one that's rising to the top?
2394000	2396000	Or why aren't there more people
2396000	2400000	who are talking about the warrior mindset
2400000	2402000	but from a perspective that the ultimate warrior
2402000	2405000	never has to remove their sword from the sheath
2405000	2408000	and is a protector of those that are weaker
2408000	2412000	and is a compassionate force for the community?
2412000	2414000	Well, unfortunately, again, thanks.
2414000	2415000	I think you're being generous.
2415000	2418000	We've conflated toxicity with masculinity.
2418000	2420000	You don't hear the term masculine femininity.
2420000	2423000	We've spent the last 30 or 40 years
2423000	2426000	highlighting the wonderful things about feminine attributes.
2426000	2427000	It's a celebration.
2427000	2428000	It's wonderful.
2428000	2430000	Women are doing so well.
2430000	2432000	More single women own a home than a single man.
2432000	2436000	It's now 60, 40 female to male, college grads,
2436000	2438000	enrollees, and it's about to go two to one college grads
2438000	2440000	because men drop out.
2440000	2442000	In urban areas now in the U.S.,
2442000	2446000	women under the age of 30 are making more money than men.
2446000	2447000	And by the way, that's wonderful.
2447000	2449000	We should do nothing to get in the way of that.
2449000	2452000	But also, trying to find role models
2452000	2456000	and trying to envision a new aspirational frame
2456000	2457000	of masculinity that says,
2457000	2458000	masculinity is an amazing thing.
2458000	2460000	You shouldn't apologize for it.
2460000	2461000	You should lean into it.
2461000	2462000	But what does it mean?
2462000	2464000	And I'm writing a book on masculinity
2464000	2465000	and I'm trying to figure it out
2465000	2467000	and quite frankly, it's really challenging.
2467000	2470000	You know, I think of it as loosely speaking,
2470000	2472000	protector, provider, procreator.
2472000	2474000	When you think about the jobs associated
2474000	2476000	with masculinity, a cop, a fireman,
2476000	2480000	I was at a hotel in Seattle and a fire alarm went off
2480000	2483000	and these eight farm people showed up,
2483000	2485000	seven men, one woman.
2485000	2487000	They didn't ask if there was a fire.
2487000	2488000	They didn't ask what was going on.
2488000	2489000	They're like, what floor is this?
2489000	2491000	They got in the elevator and they went to seventh floor.
2491000	2492000	That's just it.
2492000	2494000	If you look at 9-11, they were like,
2494000	2495000	oh, this building's coming down.
2495000	2496000	They just run into the building.
2496000	2498000	They're like, our job is to protect others.
2498000	2501000	I think that's a great place to start for men,
2501000	2504000	that real masculinity is you are,
2504000	2506000	your job is to protect other people
2506000	2509000	and it also fits to our instincts.
2509000	2511000	I think it's called the Carnegie Foundation
2511000	2514000	gives out an award every year or awards
2514000	2517000	for people who in the moment
2517000	2519000	put their own physical safety at risk
2519000	2521000	to save someone else they don't know.
2521000	2523000	It's literally pulling people out of a burning car.
2523000	2525000	What you're talking about is service.
2525000	2528000	And I think a lot of the messaging around masculinity
2528000	2530000	is about individuality.
2530000	2532000	It's about going out and getting yours
2532000	2535000	and killing the lion and getting the car and the job.
2535000	2538000	It's all about kind of selfish aggrandizement
2538000	2543000	in a showy, flashy sort of way to kind of peacock.
2543000	2546000	But real masculinity is purpose-driven
2546000	2547000	and service-oriented.
2547000	2549000	How are you showing up for other people?
2549000	2551000	Where I was going with this,
2551000	2553000	the 81 awards they gave last year,
2553000	2555000	77 were given to men.
2555000	2557000	Men are more risk aggressive.
2557000	2560000	Men will rush out into a field of combat
2560000	2563000	to pull a comrade out who's shot risking their own lives.
2563000	2565000	Women tend to be more thoughtful.
2565000	2568000	Women tend to be like, is that a good idea?
2568000	2569000	And there's a role for both.
2569000	2572000	And by the way, I'm making a reductive generalization.
2572000	2575000	Masculinity is a societal construct.
2575000	2576000	It's what we fill it with.
2576000	2579000	And a lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculinity.
2579000	2581000	It's not the domain of people born as men.
2581000	2583000	One of those fire people was a woman.
2583000	2585000	Well, I go to CrossFit.
2585000	2588000	I mean, the most impressive people in CrossFit are women.
2588000	2591000	And we celebrate their strength.
2591000	2593000	Personally, I'm drawn to men who are more feminine.
2593000	2595000	My best friends demonstrate that kind of care,
2595000	2597000	that nurturing, that grace.
2597000	2600000	So I think where it comes off the rails is you say,
2600000	2602000	only men can be masculine or people born as men.
2602000	2603000	These are wonderful attributes.
2603000	2605000	What I'm suggesting is that people born as men
2605000	2607000	have an easier time leaning into these things.
2608000	2609000	And we should celebrate them.
2609000	2611000	I think what you're saying around service is something
2611000	2612000	I should think about,
2612000	2613000	because maybe that's a better frame.
2613000	2615000	The protector, provider,
2615000	2619000	the majority of men still are evaluated
2619000	2621000	based on their ability to provide economically.
2621000	2623000	And if we're going to have an honest conversation,
2623000	2625000	we have to have an honest conversation.
2625000	2627000	Three in four women say economic viability
2627000	2630000	is a key criteria in a mate, a male mate.
2630000	2632000	Whereas it's less than a quarter of men.
2632000	2633000	We just don't really care.
2633000	2634000	It appears.
2634000	2638000	Well, maybe a wrinkle on service is the idea of contribution.
2638000	2641000	Because I think self-esteem is bred through contributing.
2641000	2643000	Are you being productive
2643000	2645000	for something that's greater than yourself?
2645000	2647000	I did ketamine therapy on Monday.
2647000	2649000	And I was trying to...
2649000	2651000	Told me more.
2651000	2652000	Oh God, have you done it?
2652000	2653000	No, I haven't.
2653000	2654000	No.
2654000	2655000	I know some people that have though.
2655000	2656000	Yeah, so I...
2656000	2657000	What led to that?
2657000	2659000	I call it the Burning Man effect.
2659000	2661000	It's like, I've always been curious about Burning Man.
2661000	2663000	But I've always chickened out
2663000	2665000	and I've always wanted to do ketamine.
2665000	2667000	And I was just curious about it.
2667000	2670000	So a friend of mine is an investor in these clinics
2670000	2672000	and basically set my...
2672000	2674000	Of my appointment while I was in Austin
2674000	2676000	and it came up and I went.
2676000	2679000	But I was trying to write down the takeaways for me.
2679000	2684000	And Richard Reeves of Boys and Men fame
2684000	2686000	has this great frame.
2686000	2688000	And that is adding surplus value.
2688000	2689000	I teach my boys.
2689000	2691000	I'm like, you're negative value right now.
2691000	2693000	Your mom spends a ton of time.
2693000	2694000	We spend a ton of money on you.
2694000	2696000	We give you more love than you give us.
2696000	2697000	You go to school.
2697000	2699000	This incredible infrastructure
2699000	2702000	is spending time and energy to educate you.
2702000	2704000	I'm like, when you become a man
2704000	2707000	is when you're doing enough for other people
2707000	2709000	that you're adding surplus value.
2709000	2711000	You're producing more than you're taking.
2711000	2712000	I love that frame.
2712000	2715000	At some point in the service of others
2715000	2717000	are you actually giving more than you're taking?
2717000	2718000	You know, that's...
2718000	2720000	Our economy is based on that.
2720000	2722000	Our economy is to take in resources
2722000	2726000	and then output more than the cost of the resources going in.
2726000	2728000	I don't know how I thought of the ketamine therapy
2728000	2730000	but the only kind of real actionable item I took away from it
2730000	2732000	was like my boys kept coming up and I thought
2732000	2735000	if I can love my boys more than people have loved me
2735000	2738000	if I can push more of that confidence and concern
2738000	2740000	and love to other people
2740000	2742000	that's the real surplus value, right?
2742000	2744000	And that was a nice framing for me.
2744000	2746000	That's like I wanted to come out
2746000	2748000	with some intentionality around my purpose.
2748000	2750000	And this is what I took from it is like
2750000	2753000	I have these vessels that really are open
2753000	2758000	and sponges of my time, regard, attention and love
2758000	2762000	and if I think one of my purposes as a man
2762000	2766000	is surplus value is how can I do more of that for them
2766000	2767000	than was done for me?
2767000	2770000	I have a very complicated relationship with my father.
2770000	2772000	He wasn't very good to me or my mom
2772000	2774000	but here's the thing, he was much better to me
2774000	2776000	than his dad was to him.
2776000	2778000	He's checked the box in the universe.
2778000	2780000	He's added surplus value
2780000	2782000	but I think that's a great frame for men.
2782000	2784000	Really think about young men,
2784000	2786000	the resources, the government, your family,
2786000	2789000	our society are investing in you
2789000	2791000	and at what point does it flip
2791000	2794000	and you're actually adding more value than you're taking
2794000	2796000	and a lot of men never get there
2796000	2799000	and grow up thinking that the world is just about giving them shit
2799000	2802000	and spending time and love on them.
2802000	2805000	I think that's a great frame for what it means to be a man
2806000	2809000	I also think that's why qualitatively
2809000	2812000	like what you're doing now in this chapter of your life
2812000	2815000	I suspect and I'm projecting is
2815000	2817000	so much more meaningful to you.
2817000	2820000	Yes, it's a for-profit enterprise, profg media
2820000	2823000	but in comparison to being an activist,
2823000	2825000	investor or an investment banker
2825000	2827000	or just an entrepreneur in general
2827000	2830000	the meaning behind it, the intentionality, the purpose
2830000	2832000	that seems to be very clear to you
2832000	2835000	gives it a sense of meaning
2835000	2838000	that I would imagine contributes to your happiness
2838000	2840000	and your sense of direction.
2840000	2842000	Yeah, look, it's hugely rewarding.
2842000	2845000	I'm not, I don't want to virtue too much.
2845000	2848000	I'm a capitalist, I love money, I love making money.
2848000	2850000	I think there's a huge economic opportunity
2850000	2852000	and being the white space I feel commercially
2852000	2854000	as a marketing professor I can tell you
2854000	2856000	is I'm a white heterosexual male
2856000	2858000	that talks openly about his feelings.
2858000	2860000	There's a huge white space for that.
2860000	2863000	People respond to it, people respond to it.
2863000	2865000	And so it's a frame, I make good money
2865000	2867000	talking about this stuff
2867000	2870000	but the stuff around
2870000	2873000	struggling young men is so rewarding
2873000	2877000	because it's a conversation that has been unproductive
2877000	2880000	and by far the people I get the most
2880000	2883000	support for for this work are mothers.
2883000	2885000	They come up and they say something along the following
2885000	2887000	I have three kids, two daughters and a son
2887000	2889000	one daughter's in Chicago and PR
2889000	2890000	the other's at Penn
2890000	2893000	my son's in the basement vaping and playing video games.
2893000	2895000	It's hugely rewarding
2895000	2897000	and also quite frankly it just makes me feel good
2897000	2899000	it makes me feel strong, it makes me feel masculine
2899000	2903000	it makes me feel successful that I can influence other people
2903000	2905000	and also try and be open and vulnerable
2905000	2906000	about my own shortcomings.
2906000	2908000	I've fucked up so many times
2908000	2910000	and I continue to disappoint myself.
2910000	2912000	I have huge imposter syndrome
2912000	2914000	I don't know if you ever feel like you're about to be found out.
2914000	2915000	All the time.
2915000	2917000	Someone's going to break in right now
2917000	2919000	I can't even believe you're sitting across from me
2919000	2921000	and you know like yourself
2921000	2922000	I'm an approval junkie
2922000	2924000	like you know I want you to like me
2924000	2926000	you know what I mean like there's
2926000	2927000	there's all kinds of layers to that
2927000	2928000	like I get all that
2928000	2930000	but I think fundamentally
2930000	2932000	it's so important
2932000	2935000	to model that type of vulnerability
2935000	2938000	it's you know I do it in the work that I do
2938000	2939000	in the way that you show up
2939000	2941000	and do that for other people
2941000	2943000	is an invitation
2943000	2945000	and it allows people to understand
2945000	2947000	that like being vulnerable isn't a weakness
2947000	2948000	it's not kryptonite
2948000	2949000	it's actually a superpower
2949000	2951000	it's an invitation to let people in
2951000	2953000	it's giving permission to other people
2953000	2955000	to engage with their emotions
2955000	2956000	and their feelings
2956000	2959000	and not treat it like it's a weakness
2959000	2961000	or to admit something that you're scared about
2961000	2963000	makes you a failure.
2963000	2966000	It's also a fantastic way
2966000	2967000	to live a more rewarding life
2967000	2970000	because from the age of 29 to 44
2970000	2971000	I never cried.
2971000	2972000	I just forgot how.
2972000	2974000	I didn't cry when my mother died
2974000	2975000	I didn't cry when I got divorced
2975000	2978000	I didn't cry when my company went chapter 11
2978000	2980000	and I was broke at the age of 40
2980000	2982000	I just forgot how
2982000	2984000	and what I would advise any man
2984000	2986000	is to lean into your emotions
2986000	2988000	when you think something's funny
2988000	2990000	learn how to laugh out loud
2990000	2992000	when you find something inspiring
2992000	2995000	you know really lean into God
2995000	2997000	this really moves me
2997000	2999000	you know when you read something you love
2999000	3000000	or you see a visualization
3000000	3001000	or you see the sunset
3001000	3003000	or you're riding a wave
3003000	3005000	like just fucking get into it
3005000	3007000	and if you feel sad
3007000	3009000	don't check back on some weird
3009000	3011000	screwed up sense of masculinity
3011000	3013000	really lean in and feel the emotion
3013000	3015000	and if you can cry
3015000	3017000	because it informs what's important to you
3017000	3019000	it informs what moves you
3019000	3021000	it informs what you're good at
3021000	3023000	otherwise you're just sort of
3023000	3025000	sleepwalking through life
3025000	3027000	you never really register anything
3027000	3029000	and here's the fear
3029000	3031000	you know life is a sense of sensations
3031000	3033000	and reward
3033000	3035000	the fear is when you talk to people at the end
3035000	3037000	my colleague at NYU Adam Alter
3037000	3039000	has done this great work around palliative care
3039000	3041000	you know
3041000	3043000	you're stuck in the past
3043000	3044000	I struggle with anger and depression
3044000	3045000	I'm in the past way too much
3045000	3046000	I don't forgive myself
3046000	3048000	I get very down on myself
3048000	3050000	I'm a lot in the future
3050000	3051000	because I'm successful
3051000	3053000	and to be successful you have to be planning
3053000	3055000	and sacrificing for the future
3055000	3057000	but I'm never really here
3057000	3059000	like I'm already thinking about the traffic
3059000	3060000	on the way home
3060000	3061000	I'm already thinking should I stop it in and out
3061000	3062000	in Van Nuys
3062000	3063000	I have a friend in Westlake
3063000	3065000	I'm like I'm already kind of like
3065000	3067000	halfway thinking about
3067000	3069000	tonight the people I'm going to be meeting
3069000	3071000	I'm thinking about my flight on Saturday
3071000	3073000	I'm thinking I'm just already like in the future
3073000	3075000	and the thing people regret the most
3075000	3077000	you know when they're older
3077000	3079000	they just didn't
3079000	3081000	lean into their relationships
3081000	3083000	they didn't feel emotion
3083000	3084000	and that's the fear
3084000	3085000	my biggest fear
3085000	3086000	as an atheist
3086000	3088000	and I'd be curious to get your
3088000	3089000	I'll put it back to you
3089000	3091000	my biggest fear is I get at the end
3091000	3092000	I mean I believe at the end
3092000	3093000	I'm going to look into my kids life
3093000	3095000	eyes and know that our relationship's coming to an end
3095000	3097000	I don't think anyone's going to talk me out of that
3097000	3099000	my fear is I look back and go
3099000	3102000	oh my god what enormous blessings
3102000	3105000	prosperity I would have never imagined
3105000	3109000	people that love me and let me love them immensely
3109000	3111000	but I was never there
3111000	3113000	never really felt any of it
3113000	3115000	and one way to put yourself in the moment
3115000	3118000	is to really lean into those emotions
3118000	3120000	and not like that
3120000	3122000	people are really understanding
3122000	3123000	people like it
3123000	3125000	I'm not suggesting you cry at work
3125000	3127000	there's a time and a place for emotion
3127000	3129000	but people respond to it
3129000	3131000	and distinct to the affirmation
3131000	3133000	and accolades or reinforcement you get
3133000	3134000	or don't get
3134000	3136000	it informs your life
3136000	3138000	it puts you in the moment
3138000	3139000	because that's my biggest fear
3139000	3140000	as I get to the end
3140000	3142000	and it's like this really didn't happen
3142000	3143000	there was a series of past and future
3143000	3145000	but the moments were just very few
3150000	3152000	so how did you make that change
3152000	3155000	to go from the person who couldn't cry
3155000	3157000	to leaning into your emotions
3157000	3160000	was there a pivotal experience?
3160000	3162000	you know the seminal experience for me
3162000	3164000	I think that it's very basic stuff
3164000	3166000	and again I'm curious
3166000	3168000	you think more about this than I do
3168000	3170000	the real seminal things in my life
3170000	3173000	were my mom dying
3173000	3176000	just the harshness the first time you lose someone
3176000	3177000	have you lost a parent?
3177000	3178000	not yet
3178000	3179000	have you lost anyone close to you?
3179000	3180000	I really haven't
3180000	3183000	okay that is just the harshest
3183000	3185000	strangest experience to date
3185000	3186000	when it happens
3186000	3188000	the harshness of it
3188000	3189000	the finality of it
3189000	3191000	if we could register
3191000	3193000	and really understand what death is
3193000	3195000	at all before it happens
3195000	3197000	we'd be so freaked out
3197000	3198000	that we wouldn't go outside
3198000	3199000	we're purposely wired
3199000	3201000	not to really think a lot about death
3201000	3202000	so when it happens
3202000	3203000	you just can't imagine it
3203000	3205000	it's so brutal
3205000	3206000	for a lot of people
3206000	3207000	I think it gives you a sense
3207000	3209000	of the finite nature of life
3209000	3210000	it changes your frame
3210000	3211000	made me more appreciative
3211000	3213000	made me more bold and courageous
3213000	3214000	with my feelings
3214000	3216000	to tell people how I cared about them
3216000	3217000	and then the other one
3217000	3218000	is the other side of the life spectrum
3218000	3219000	when my kids were born
3219000	3221000	you know all of a sudden
3221000	3222000	it's no longer about me
3222000	3223000	my whole life
3223000	3224000	Monday through Friday was
3224000	3226000	how do I make more money
3226000	3228000	how do I hang out with more fabulous people
3228000	3230000	how do I have more sex with hotter people
3230000	3231000	and then more money
3231000	3232000	and then more fabulous
3232000	3233000	and then more sex
3233000	3234000	and then more relevance
3234000	3235000	and more act
3235000	3237000	but it was like the vampire
3237000	3238000	from an Anne Rice movie
3238000	3240000	I could never quite be satisfied
3240000	3241000	so it was more
3241000	3242000	fucking more
3242000	3243000	I want more
3243000	3245000	and then when I had kids
3245000	3246000	it's kind of cathartic
3246000	3247000	because all of a sudden
3247000	3249000	you're thinking instinctively more
3249000	3250000	about someone else than you
3250000	3251000	it's like
3251000	3252000	my Friday used to be
3252000	3254000	where am I having brunch
3254000	3255000	how do I find more fabulous people
3255000	3256000	and things to do
3256000	3257000	now I know what I'm doing
3257000	3259000	I'm going to soccer practice
3259000	3261000	and it's boring and hard
3261000	3262000	for a couple years
3262000	3264000	and then I find it quite relaxing
3264000	3266000	but having kids
3266000	3268000	and thinking about other people
3268000	3271000	has been really cathartic
3271000	3272000	and there's just a few moments
3272000	3273000	they don't have that often
3273000	3274000	but they do happen
3274000	3276000	I'll be on the couch
3276000	3278000	watching a Premier League football game
3278000	3279000	my boys will wander in
3279000	3281000	they kind of instinctively throw
3281000	3282000	their legs on yours
3282000	3284000	like it's just natural
3284000	3286000	the dogs come in
3286000	3288000	you know they laugh at something
3288000	3289000	and you have that moment
3289000	3290000	where you're like
3290000	3291000	okay this is it
3291000	3292000	I can't imagine anymore
3292000	3293000	this is it
3293000	3294000	it's the only time in my life
3294000	3296000	I've ever felt sated
3296000	3297000	ever
3297000	3298000	I mean it sounds very trite
3298000	3300000	but death and birth
3300000	3301000	we're kind of the
3301000	3302000	getting you to I think
3302000	3303000	to the next phase
3303000	3305000	how old are your boys
3305000	3306000	13 and 16
3306000	3307000	I started late
3307000	3308000	how old are yours
3308000	3310000	two step sons
3310000	3312000	28 and 27
3312000	3313000	and a 20 year old daughter
3313000	3315000	and a 16 year old daughter
3315000	3316000	oh so you're on the back nine
3316000	3318000	yeah
3318000	3319000	my story's a little bit different though
3319000	3320000	although I haven't suffered
3320000	3322000	that kind of loss
3322000	3323000	I certainly have the experience
3323000	3324000	of having kids
3324000	3326000	and how transformative that is
3326000	3329000	but you know my root to
3329000	3332000	vulnerability and
3332000	3334000	being in constant contact
3334000	3336000	with my emotional state
3336000	3338000	was formed out of
3338000	3339000	difficulties and hardship
3339000	3341000	I had a protracted battle
3341000	3342000	with alcoholism
3342000	3343000	that destroyed my life
3343000	3345000	I went from somebody who
3345000	3348000	was an insecure quiet kid
3348000	3349000	figured it out
3349000	3351000	by the time I graduated high school
3351000	3352000	top athlete
3352000	3354000	got into all the colleges
3354000	3355000	all the promise in the world
3355000	3356000	all the opportunities
3356000	3358000	that I then squandered
3358000	3359000	until I alienated
3359000	3361000	everybody that I cared about
3361000	3362000	in my life
3362000	3363000	and was utterly broken
3363000	3365000	and had to build my life
3365000	3366000	back up again
3366000	3369000	from scratch
3369000	3371000	and I think that experience
3371000	3373000	was painful as it was
3373000	3375000	really provided me with
3375000	3377000	the tools to reconstruct
3377000	3379000	a new life based upon
3379000	3380000	new principles
3380000	3381000	you're an atheist
3381000	3382000	I'm not
3382000	3383000	I was introduced to
3383000	3384000	some spiritual principles
3384000	3386000	and tools that are now fundamental
3386000	3388000	to the way that I frame my life
3388000	3389000	and live my life
3389000	3391000	you know I owe everything
3391000	3393000	that I now have
3393000	3395000	to the experience of
3395000	3396000	getting sober
3396000	3398000	and the community of people
3398000	3400000	that have helped keep me sober
3400000	3402000	and who I help keep sober
3402000	3404000	and everything has kind of escalated
3404000	3405000	from there
3405000	3406000	but fundamentally it's
3406000	3408000	about confronting your own emotions
3408000	3410000	and taking inventory for your behavior
3410000	3412000	and repairing the damage of your past
3412000	3414000	and having a spiritual connection
3414000	3416000	to something greater than yourself
3416000	3418000	and then giving it back
3418000	3419000	and service to other people
3419000	3420000	and I try to do that
3420000	3422000	through the professional work
3422000	3423000	that I do
3423000	3425000	but fundamentally my first priority
3425000	3427000	is to that community
3427000	3428000	and to that program
3428000	3430000	was there a moment though
3430000	3432000	where you said okay
3432000	3434000	this is it I gotta get my shit together
3435000	3437000	well there were lots of moments like that
3437000	3439000	that didn't end up changing anything
3439000	3441000	because I wasn't ready
3441000	3443000	the elevator hadn't gone down far enough
3443000	3445000	and I wasn't ready to let go
3445000	3446000	so it wasn't until
3446000	3449000	literally almost everything was stripped away from me
3449000	3450000	and I had nowhere else to turn
3450000	3452000	because I don't want to change
3452000	3454000	do you like changing
3454000	3456000	do you like trying to let go of bad behavior
3456000	3457000	and adopt new habits
3457000	3458000	like it's not fun
3458000	3459000	it's not easy
3459000	3460000	and also I love drinking
3460000	3462000	yeah so me too
3462000	3464000	you know probably more than you
3464000	3466000	but I am wired in a certain way
3466000	3468000	where that wasn't going to work out for me
3468000	3470000	and it was pretty clear for a pretty long time
3470000	3472000	that I was headed in the wrong direction
3472000	3474000	and people tried to intervene
3474000	3476000	but you have to be ready
3476000	3477000	for that change
3477000	3478000	you have to
3478000	3479000	I had to suffer
3479000	3480000	I had to
3480000	3482000	get to a place of suffering where
3483000	3485000	the fear
3485000	3487000	of change
3487000	3489000	was exceeded by
3489000	3491000	the pain of my current experience
3491000	3493000	because I'm stubborn
3493000	3495000	and I'm an alcoholic
3495000	3497000	but even in sobriety
3497000	3499000	you know I've weathered
3499000	3500000	financial destitution
3500000	3502000	and had other kinds of challenges
3502000	3504000	that have in retrospect
3504000	3506000	looking back provided me with strength
3506000	3508000	and have been
3508000	3510000	foundational
3510000	3511000	and instructive
3511000	3513000	and have helped me
3513000	3515000	everything's 20-20 in the rear-view mirror
3515000	3517000	it all makes sense when you look backwards
3517000	3518000	but at the time
3518000	3520000	incredibly confusing
3520000	3522000	and a lot of fear
3522000	3524000	and a lot of insecurity
3524000	3526000	but I think those tools
3526000	3528000	and they're all just analogs
3528000	3530000	for the things that you talk about
3530000	3532000	like if you want self-esteem
3532000	3534000	you have to perform a steamable act
3534000	3535000	on behalf of yourself
3535000	3536000	on behalf of other people
3536000	3538000	you have to be true to your word
3538000	3540000	and you say you're going to show up
3540000	3542000	and it is this relationship with time
3542000	3544000	also that
3544000	3546000	building a life requires
3546000	3548000	small consistent acts taken every single day
3548000	3550000	like there's a compound interest
3550000	3552000	economically but also
3552000	3554000	just in terms of good will
3554000	3556000	and trust and all these kind of
3556000	3558000	character qualities that take a long time to build
3558000	3560000	and don't happen overnight
3560000	3562000	especially if you've destroyed that trust
3562000	3564000	or you don't feel like you're capable
3564000	3566000	or you don't have the facility
3566000	3568000	for self-love.
3568000	3570000	Another question
3570000	3572000	Atheism is a source of strength for me
3572000	3574000	I like the finite
3574000	3576000	believing that life is finite
3576000	3578000	that helps me to be a little more courageous
3578000	3580000	with my emotions and I don't think this is a dress rehearsal
3580000	3582000	so it's taken
3582000	3584000	fear away from me.
3584000	3586000	It gives impressions to the moment.
3586000	3588000	And also the people I'm so worried about
3588000	3590000	being shamed by or not
3590000	3592000	approving of me
3592000	3594000	in a hundred years nobody I know
3594000	3596000	or care about what they think of me
3596000	3598000	is going to be around.
3598000	3600000	It makes me just feel less insecure
3600000	3602000	and more bold but in terms of faith
3602000	3604000	why is it you needed
3604000	3606000	and I think it's great but what is it about faith
3606000	3608000	that's given you that kind of strength
3608000	3610000	that you couldn't find elsewhere
3610000	3612000	and also what is the role
3612000	3614000	that you have tried to present
3614000	3616000	or how have you tried to present faith
3616000	3618000	to your kids because I'm struggling with it
3618000	3620000	My 13 and 16 year olds have had no introduction
3620000	3622000	of faith and I think faith
3622000	3624000	and spirituality and religion
3624000	3626000	I think actually there's some very positive aspects
3626000	3628000	for religion. I've just always been remiss
3628000	3630000	to introduce my kids to it so
3630000	3632000	why is it you feel like you needed this
3632000	3634000	instead of just your own facilities
3634000	3636000	into what's the role that your religion
3636000	3638000	is playing your kids life? Yeah those are great questions
3638000	3640000	and challenging to answer I think
3640000	3642000	I think the way into
3642000	3644000	responding to that
3644000	3646000	has a lot to do with
3646000	3648000	self-will and a
3648000	3650000	humility of understanding that you're really
3650000	3652000	not in control of very many things
3652000	3654000	and a sense that
3654000	3656000	there are more things at play
3656000	3658000	that are outside your ability to comprehend
3658000	3660000	so I was somebody
3660000	3662000	I assume much like yourself
3662000	3664000	who was very driven, who was very ambitious
3664000	3666000	and every
3666000	3668000	success that I had had as a young person
3668000	3670000	was
3670000	3672000	attributable to my ability to
3672000	3674000	outwork everybody else
3674000	3676000	in the room to show up
3676000	3678000	earlier and stay later
3678000	3680000	and bridge the talent deficit gap
3680000	3682000	with a willingness and a capacity
3682000	3684000	in a facility
3684000	3686000	for suffering and pain
3686000	3688000	and work.
3688000	3690000	That took me to a certain place
3690000	3692000	it got me into Stanford
3692000	3694000	it made me a champion swimmer
3694000	3696000	all of these things
3696000	3698000	but when alcohol entered the picture
3698000	3700000	my self-will
3700000	3702000	was absolutely useless
3702000	3704000	in terms of addressing this problem
3704000	3706000	I tried, I tried, I tried
3706000	3708000	every time I tried to
3708000	3710000	use this facility that I had
3710000	3712000	to tackle this problem
3712000	3714000	the problem only got worse
3714000	3716000	and the problem wasn't solved
3716000	3718000	until I was willing to surrender
3718000	3720000	that I actually had no control over it
3720000	3722000	and that I needed to ask for help
3722000	3724000	not only ask for help
3724000	3726000	but accept that help
3726000	3728000	and as somebody who's very self-directed
3728000	3730000	asking for help and receiving help
3730000	3732000	is very confronting prospect
3732000	3734000	I had to be broken enough
3734000	3736000	to do that
3736000	3738000	but that process of surrender
3738000	3740000	which is a daily practice
3740000	3742000	of kind of letting go
3742000	3744000	of my own sense of what I should be doing
3744000	3746000	or what I think is in my best interest
3746000	3748000	has actually been the most
3748000	3750000	remunerative
3750000	3752000	and fulfilling
3752000	3754000	and nurturing
3754000	3756000	and gratifying experience that I've had
3756000	3758000	and I think with that comes a
3758000	3760000	an opening for awe and wonder
3760000	3762000	of things that perhaps I don't understand
3762000	3764000	because human beings we think that we can
3764000	3766000	understand everything that's happening around us
3766000	3768000	and I think there's a lot more going on
3768000	3770000	that perhaps eludes our small brains
3770000	3772000	and I find some comfort in that
3772000	3774000	and that doesn't mean that I subscribe
3774000	3776000	to a particular strain of religion
3776000	3778000	other than to say
3778000	3780000	that I'm just one person
3780000	3782000	and I don't always make the best decisions
3782000	3784000	on my own behalf and I've learned
3784000	3786000	to bring in other people
3786000	3788000	and pause when agitated
3788000	3790000	and allow others
3790000	3792000	to help guide me
3792000	3794000	and
3794000	3796000	talk about the role that you want
3796000	3798000	this has become your podcast all of a sudden
3798000	3800000	we can only do this for so long
3800000	3802000	George Hahn is a close
3802000	3804000	friend, he thinks it's just the world to you
3804000	3806000	and he says that you both share
3806000	3808000	a history of addiction
3808000	3810000	that's how he found you
3810000	3812000	and what I'll say and this is strange
3812000	3814000	but I've been thinking a lot about the
3814000	3816000	ketamine therapy I did
3816000	3818000	almost a week ago now
3818000	3820000	because the first
3820000	3822000	seven day period I've gone
3822000	3824000	I was just thinking about it and it happened actually
3824000	3826000	only in 30 years I haven't had alcohol
3826000	3828000	and it's not because I had some revelation
3828000	3830000	that I was an addict or I needed to stop
3830000	3832000	the literally physical
3832000	3834000	taste or smell of alcohol right now
3834000	3836000	is very unappealing to me
3836000	3838000	and that's never happened to me before
3838000	3840000	that's so interesting because I've heard you talk about
3840000	3842000	how you enjoy your cocktails
3842000	3844000	I'm a better version of me a little bit fucked up
3844000	3846000	I've gotten more out of alcohol than it's gotten out of me
3846000	3848000	I like it and I enjoy it
3848000	3850000	I think I'm good at it
3850000	3852000	I think I can modulate it
3852000	3854000	but I might have been fooling myself
3854000	3856000	but for some reason
3856000	3858000	the idea of having a beer right now
3858000	3860000	just makes me nauseous
3860000	3862000	and I don't know if it's the same
3862000	3864000	impact or effect those GLP-1 drugs have on you
3864000	3866000	where it turns that switch off
3866000	3868000	but I drink a lot
3868000	3870000	and for almost a week now
3870000	3872000	I don't even want to smell alcohol
3872000	3874000	that's fascinating
3874000	3876000	maybe go
3876000	3878000	you know go 30 days
3878000	3880000	see what it's like
3880000	3882000	there's this whole movement
3882000	3884000	around the alcohol-free lifestyle
3884000	3886000	right now I've had a couple people on the show
3886000	3888000	who are advocates in this space
3888000	3890000	and there's just a growing
3890000	3892000	population of people
3892000	3894000	who are realizing how much better
3894000	3896000	their life is without it
3896000	3898000	they're not addicts, they're not alcoholics
3898000	3900000	but they like to go out
3900000	3902000	and tie one on on the weekend
3902000	3904000	or whatever it is
3904000	3906000	and you reach a certain age also
3906000	3908000	those hangovers
3908000	3910000	stick around a little bit longer
3910000	3912000	when you're out of college
3912000	3914000	you go out and drink a lot
3914000	3916000	next day I have a Diet Coke
3916000	3918000	and a Big Mac and you're fine
3918000	3920000	now I feel as if I've had a battery of chemo
3920000	3922000	it takes me two days to recover
3922000	3924000	and all the research I'm making
3924000	3926000	they just keep finding out
3926000	3928000	it's worse and worse for you
3928000	3930000	so I also recognize
3930000	3932000	that the liver just can't process it the way it used to
3932000	3934000	I'm trying to tone it down
3934000	3936000	I do edibles
3936000	3938000	and one of the reasons I started doing edibles
3938000	3940000	is I enjoy the feeling of being high
3940000	3942000	or a little bit intoxicated
3942000	3944000	and so I'm trying to tone down alcohol
3944000	3946000	and I've been substituting a little bit
3946000	3948000	with edibles
3948000	3950000	but I'm thinking more about it
3950000	3952000	recognizing that it would be hard for me
3952000	3954000	to maintain the drinking I do
3954000	3956000	and stay healthy at this age
3956000	3958000	Well, you got me and George
3958000	3960000	call anytime buddy
3960000	3962000	I appreciate that
3962000	3964000	when you want to pick up
3964000	3966000	and Scott is going to have a drink
3966000	3968000	let's talk about the new book a little bit
3968000	3970000	the Algebra of Wealth
3970000	3972000	this is interesting it all kind of starts
3972000	3974000	with this equation that you have
3974000	3976000	around prosperity
3976000	3978000	and how to think about
3978000	3980000	I mean it's really fundamentally addresses the changing workplace
3980000	3982000	that's kind of happening right now
3982000	3984000	it's this sort of mission statement
3984000	3986000	for young people how to think about
3986000	3988000	money in this changing landscape
3988000	3990000	you've seen the research
3990000	3992000	where five friends who hang out together
3992000	3994000	become more like each other
3994000	3996000	you become the kind of average of your friends
3996000	3998000	the body mass index, the amount of money you make
3998000	4000000	your political party
4000000	4002000	they all begin to converge
4002000	4004000	towards the regression line
4004000	4006000	that's not true of wealth at the end of your life
4006000	4008000	same five people make the exact same amount of money
4008000	4010000	the amount of wealth they end up with is highly
4010000	4012000	variant
4012000	4014000	and I made a lot of mistakes
4014000	4016000	but I missed a series of just
4016000	4018000	small strategies and behaviors
4018000	4020000	to make sure I was economically secure
4020000	4022000	and I think it's really important
4022000	4024000	because I say that America
4024000	4026000	becomes more like itself every day
4026000	4028000	and this isn't a good thing but America is a loving generous place
4028000	4030000	if you have money
4030000	4032000	it's a rapacious violent place if you don't
4032000	4034000	so
4034000	4036000	a series of behaviors
4036000	4038000	and approaches and strategies
4038000	4040000	that aren't that hard
4040000	4042000	and they require less discipline if you start them early
4042000	4044000	can lead you to economic security
4044000	4046000	and so
4046000	4048000	the basic equation is focus
4048000	4050000	find your talent, not your passion
4050000	4052000	at NYU we have these people
4052000	4054000	who come in, we either
4054000	4056000	invite impressive, accomplished people
4056000	4058000	or invite billionaires
4058000	4060000	we've decided billionaires just have insight into life
4060000	4062000	and that would end with the same shitty advice
4062000	4064000	follow your passion
4064000	4066000	and typically the guy telling you to follow your passion
4066000	4068000	made his billions in iron ore smelting
4068000	4070000	and my thing is
4070000	4072000	find your talent, find something you're really good at
4072000	4074000	or you think you have an aptitude for
4074000	4076000	it can't be something you don't like
4076000	4078000	but most young people mistake
4078000	4080000	passion for a hobby
4080000	4082000	and I think I'm really into sports
4082000	4084000	I want to be a DJ
4084000	4086000	or I want to be a model or in fashion
4086000	4088000	just keep in mind those industries
4088000	4090000	have a 90 plus percent unemployment rate
4090000	4092000	and if you're really that talented
4092000	4094000	you'll know at a very early age
4094000	4096000	that you're meant to be the next messy
4096000	4098000	or you are really that talented
4098000	4100000	my advice would be
4100000	4102000	find something you're good at that has a 90 plus percent
4102000	4104000	employment rate
4104000	4106000	and what I have found is that
4106000	4108000	jobs are like asset classes
4108000	4110000	the more they're invested the more human capital
4110000	4112000	that goes into them the lower the return
4112000	4114000	and that there's an inverse return
4114000	4116000	on your career based on
4116000	4118000	how sexy their career is
4118000	4120000	in the example I use as a tax lawyer
4120000	4122000	if you can figure out the discipline
4122000	4124000	to get the certification to be a lawyer
4124000	4126000	you enjoy numbers you understand
4126000	4128000	the selection between taxes and laws
4128000	4130000	and how to handle a client
4130000	4132000	if you could be in the top 10%
4132000	4134000	of that you're always going to make a good living
4134000	4136000	and if you could be in the top 1%
4136000	4138000	you'll probably fly private
4138000	4140000	and have a much broader selection set of mates
4140000	4142000	than you deserve
4142000	4144000	so your job isn't to figure out what your passion is
4144000	4146000	I wanted to be an athlete like you
4146000	4148000	I thought you know and the wonderful thing about UCLA
4148000	4150000	is it disabuses you of any notion
4150000	4152000	of being a professional athlete
4152000	4154000	I knew athletes I went to school with Troy Aikman
4154000	4156000	you're surrounded by Olympians
4156000	4158000	I was literally the worst varsity athlete
4158000	4160000	at UCLA
4160000	4162000	but that was a blessing for me
4162000	4164000	find your talent and then commit the
4164000	4166000	requisite 10,000 hours
4166000	4168000	the endurance, the grit, the maturity
4168000	4170000	to try and become really top 1%
4170000	4172000	in something that has a 90%
4172000	4174000	employment rate
4174000	4176000	not a 90% unemployment rate
4176000	4178000	you want to be an actor
4178000	4180000	I don't want to crush your dreams but you better be amazing
4180000	4182000	because of the 180,000
4182000	4184000	success actors in the world that are in the SAG
4184000	4186000	after union
4186000	4188000	87% of them make less than $23,000 a year
4188000	4190000	and don't qualify for health insurance
4190000	4192000	so you better be Glenn Close
4192000	4194000	or you better be close to Glenn Close
4194000	4196000	to make a living there
4196000	4198000	whereas other industries that have a 90%
4198000	4200000	employment rate if you're just in the top 10%
4200000	4202000	even the top half
4202000	4204000	you're going to make a good living
4204000	4206000	and this is what I can promise you
4206000	4208000	being great at something that pays well
4208000	4210000	lets you take care of your kids
4210000	4212000	comradery
4212000	4214000	people start laughing at your jokes
4214000	4216000	inviting you to speak places
4216000	4218000	and anything that does that for you
4218000	4220000	will make you passionate about whatever it is
4220000	4222000	no one grows up thinking
4222000	4224000	I'm going to be passionate about tax law
4224000	4226000	but the best tax lawyers I can tell you
4226000	4228000	are really passionate about it
4228000	4230000	because they're good at it
4230000	4232000	and it pays off and I'm not saying
4232000	4234000	don't pursue your dreams
4234000	4236000	but have an honest conversation around
4236000	4238000	what it would mean to be in the top of that field
4238000	4240000	because without economic security in this country
4240000	4242000	your life's going to be full of anxiety and disappointment
4242000	4244000	so focus
4244000	4246000	find your talent
4246000	4248000	and the next things are pretty straightforward
4248000	4250000	diversity
4250000	4252000	or diversification
4252000	4254000	where I lost a lot of my money was I was always like
4254000	4256000	doubling down on my companies
4256000	4258000	and that's okay when you're younger
4258000	4260000	especially if it's your own business
4260000	4262000	can sometimes you have any choice
4262000	4264000	but the moment you have any assets start diversifying
4264000	4266000	I've taught at a business school for 20 years
4266000	4268000	I've had a lot of professors in the world
4268000	4270000	and my some total assessment
4270000	4272000	of the market is no one has any fucking idea
4272000	4274000	but the good news
4274000	4276000	is that the market because of demographic growth
4276000	4278000	because of productivity because of technology
4278000	4280000	as a whole
4280000	4282000	the market is up into the right
4282000	4284000	so the S&P was up 24% last year
4284000	4286000	but only 7 companies were responsible
4286000	4288000	for 70% of those gains
4288000	4290000	were you smart enough to buy NVIDIA?
4290000	4292000	I wasn't
4292000	4294000	and so unless you were smart enough to pick
4294000	4296000	from the stocks that accelerated
4296000	4298000	you had actually really meddling returns
4298000	4300000	but this is a good news you don't need to be a stock picker
4300000	4302000	buy the entire S&P
4302000	4304000	buy an index a low cost fund
4304000	4306000	it's gone up 11% a year for the last 15 years
4306000	4308000	11% a year when you're young
4308000	4310000	sounds really mediocre
4310000	4312000	but that means
4312000	4314000	every 21 years your
4314000	4316000	money is going up 8 times
4316000	4318000	so diversify
4318000	4320000	the other one is realize
4320000	4322000	the benefit of time
4322000	4324000	and our species has a difficult time
4324000	4326000	wrapping their head around time
4326000	4328000	for the majority of our time on this planet
4328000	4330000	we haven't lived past 35
4330000	4332000	so young people just can't imagine
4332000	4334000	and I can give them actual real tables
4334000	4336000	there's probably a 90% plus chance
4336000	4338000	they're going to live another 70 maybe even 80 years
4338000	4340000	and the other thing I can guarantee
4340000	4342000	is it's going to go really fast
4342000	4344000	I mean I don't know about you that was 30 yesterday
4344000	4346000	it goes really fast
4346000	4348000	so if you push back on our instincts
4348000	4350000	around time
4350000	4352000	so diversification
4352000	4354000	you don't need to be a hero
4354000	4356000	and then the really hard part
4356000	4358000	especially for a young person
4358000	4360000	is living a little bit like a stoic
4360000	4362000	saying what other people think of me
4362000	4364000	isn't that important
4364000	4366000	I really don't need to order a bottle of grey goose
4366000	4368000	at a club to impress people
4368000	4370000	I really don't need
4370000	4372000	a BMW at this age
4372000	4374000	I need nice clothes to make me feel good
4374000	4376000	but I don't really need
4376000	4378000	no one is concerned
4378000	4380000	about what you did as you are
4380000	4382000	that's just try and find other means
4382000	4384000	of satisfaction
4384000	4386000	and self-esteem
4386000	4388000	and really try to gamify savings
4388000	4390000	try and work out a savings muscle
4390000	4392000	the muscle you got to develop is a savings muscle
4392000	4394000	gamify it
4394000	4396000	when I was in college you were talking about sports
4396000	4398000	I was on the crew team
4398000	4400000	every summer if I didn't save $3,300
4400000	4402000	I wasn't re-enrolling at UCLA
4402000	4404000	so I had 12 weeks to make $3,300
4404000	4406000	so we would gamify it
4406000	4408000	together with six other guys who also didn't have any money
4408000	4410000	and every day on a whiteboard we would write down
4410000	4412000	how much and we would gamify it
4412000	4414000	I lived on $73 a week
4414000	4416000	I ate top ramen, bananas and milk
4416000	4418000	and I had $3,300 by the end of summer
4418000	4420000	that savings muscle
4420000	4422000	mostly stuck with me
4422000	4424000	I kind of lapsed out of it when I started making money
4424000	4426000	and thinking I was a baller
4426000	4428000	but if you can develop that savings muscle
4428000	4430000	a little bit of savings when you are young
4430000	4432000	diversification and then recognizing
4432000	4434000	how fast time will go
4434000	4436000	there are hundreds of thousands
4436000	4438000	of union and government employees
4438000	4440000	that never make more than $100,000
4440000	4442000	but because of four savings plans
4442000	4444000	and a little bit of discipline
4444000	4446000	they retire millionaires
4446000	4448000	and so hope you hit it big with a podcast
4448000	4450000	hope you sell a movie deal
4450000	4452000	hope your company gets acquired
4452000	4454000	if that's great fine
4454000	4456000	but if it doesn't make sure you're going to have
4456000	4458000	a minimum amount of economic viability
4458000	4460000	the good news is I think I know how to get you rich
4460000	4462000	the bad news is the answer is slowly
4462000	4464000	it requires a certain amount of discipline
4464000	4466000	early and this is do
4466000	4468000	as I say not as I do because I always made
4468000	4470000	a lot of money but between
4470000	4472000	divorce, the great financial recession
4472000	4474000	and the dot-bomb and always spending a lot of money
4474000	4476000	because I was a baller and at some point
4476000	4478000	I was going to make a lot of money I just knew it
4478000	4480000	I always increased my spending to my
4480000	4482000	earnings and I ended up at 42
4482000	4484000	when my first kid came marching out of my girlfriend
4484000	4486000	I didn't have that much money
4486000	4488000	and it was terrifying
4488000	4490000	I'm 42
4490000	4492000	but all of this quote-unquote curb retail success
4492000	4494000	everyone thinks I'm so successful
4494000	4496000	and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to
4496000	4498000	stay in New York and put my kid in private school
4498000	4500000	because I've just ended up with a lot less money
4500000	4502000	that was emasculating
4502000	4504000	I was humiliating if I'd just been a little smarter
4504000	4506000	a little bit more disciplined
4506000	4508000	I wouldn't have had that anxiety
4508000	4510000	so this is sort of a memo to myself
4510000	4512000	if I could go back in time saying
4512000	4514000	this isn't a book for people who are economically insecure
4514000	4516000	and need to cut up their credit cards
4516000	4518000	you know that's Susie Orman
4518000	4520000	who has a job, has some talent
4520000	4522000	knows how to make some money
4522000	4524000	and a series of behavior
4524000	4526000	that will be your base
4526000	4528000	and your plan B
4528000	4530000	What is the advice that you would give
4530000	4532000	to somebody who's
4532000	4534000	not a young person
4534000	4536000	who's starting out, who's looking for that type
4536000	4538000	of guidance to set them up for
4538000	4540000	long-term success but is instead
4540000	4542000	somebody who's
4542000	4544000	in midlife and
4544000	4546000	they've had a job for a long time
4546000	4548000	maybe perhaps they own their home, maybe they rent
4548000	4550000	but they wake up at 40
4550000	4552000	and they can pay their bills
4552000	4554000	maybe they're living check to check
4554000	4556000	but they're unfulfilled
4556000	4558000	they're in a job that is
4558000	4560000	soul draining, soul killing
4560000	4562000	and they're just not sure how long
4562000	4564000	they can keep doing it
4564000	4566000	there's just a lack of fulfillment and purpose
4566000	4568000	and they're looking for a different way
4570000	4572000	So first off, I woke up at
4572000	4574000	42 with not a lot of money
4574000	4576000	but 42 is young
4576000	4578000	you don't think it's young at 42
4578000	4580000	but that probably means you're living another 40 maybe 50 years
4580000	4582000	so it's by no means
4582000	4584000	too late to start
4584000	4586000	you might have to adjust your expectations around how much money you're going to end up with
4586000	4588000	but
4588000	4590000	wealth isn't a function of how much you make
4590000	4592000	it's a function of how much you spend and save
4592000	4594000	there's just no getting around it
4594000	4596000	if you have
4596000	4598000	kids and dependents
4598000	4600000	the aspirational thing here would be to say
4600000	4602000	Richard
4602000	4604000	take a chance, find your passion
4604000	4606000	go out, do what you want to do, be happy
4606000	4608000	it's easy to say
4608000	4610000	when I'm not paying your rent
4610000	4612000	there's a certain reality
4612000	4614000	in a Catholic
4614000	4616000	I'm not sure I have a silver bullet
4616000	4618000	one of the keys is having
4618000	4620000	a great partner
4620000	4622000	and saying kids don't talk about this
4622000	4624000	but 70% of divorce filings
4624000	4626000	are by women
4626000	4628000	and it's usually economics
4628000	4630000	the guy loses his job
4630000	4632000	it's a sort of mental breakdown
4632000	4634000	you have to have a conversation
4634000	4636000	or maybe just get lucky
4636000	4638000	to make sure that you have a real partner
4638000	4640000	if you're married
4640000	4642000	in the economic livelihood of your house
4642000	4644000	because if you're not happy
4644000	4646000	she's not going to be happy
4646000	4648000	or he's not going to be happy and your kids aren't going to be happy
4648000	4650000	I mean I sort of had this conversation
4650000	4652000	with my partner, we were living in New York
4652000	4654000	and we had two boys
4654000	4656000	and to put them in pre-k
4656000	4658000	and for my wife to continue working
4658000	4660000	we had about $100,000 a year
4660000	4662000	because we were narcissists
4662000	4664000	and wanted to get into the right schools
4664000	4666000	I'm like okay, the tax is in New York
4666000	4668000	that means we need $180,000 in pre-tax income
4668000	4670000	for our kids to go play with blocks
4670000	4672000	we had a three bedroom apartment
4672000	4674000	we needed three bedrooms
4674000	4676000	it was $18,000 a month
4676000	4678000	and we could downgrade
4678000	4680000	but in New York living in Manhattan
4680000	4682000	you really can't downgrade that much
4682000	4684000	and so what we decided was
4684000	4686000	I'm going to move to Florida
4686000	4688000	we're going to move to Delray Beach
4688000	4690000	where your parents can be involved in our kids lives
4690000	4692000	we have built in childcare
4692000	4694000	I'm going to move from $18,000 a month
4694000	4696000	to $5,500 a month
4696000	4698000	I'm going to save 13% a year in taxes
4698000	4700000	and I'm going to start saving a shit ton of money
4700000	4702000	and when I say I mean we
4702000	4704000	we're on board with this
4704000	4706000	she was my partner in it, we're on board with this
4706000	4708000	we're going to start putting away
4708000	4710000	two, three, five, ten grand a month
4710000	4712000	and then through no fault of our own
4712000	4714000	the bull market took over
4714000	4716000	everything just sort of took off from there
4716000	4718000	but I would say an open and honest conversation
4718000	4720000	with your partner if you're married
4720000	4722000	if you're single you can take some chances
4722000	4724000	and say fuck it I'm starting a podcast
4724000	4726000	or I'm going to go be a scuba instructor
4726000	4728000	or I've always wanted to write
4728000	4730000	you can take those sorts of risks
4730000	4732000	with a family I think it's really difficult
4732000	4734000	and I would say the only thing I would suggest
4734000	4736000	is really be open with your partner
4736000	4738000	about what you're feeling and what you're going through
4738000	4740000	and say is there a lifestyle arbitrage
4740000	4742000	is there a move
4742000	4744000	are there certain sacrifices we can make
4744000	4746000	as a decision together
4746000	4748000	that takes some pressure off of me
4748000	4750000	such that maybe I can start to investigate
4750000	4752000	things that aren't
4752000	4754000	if they're not joyous, are less arduous on you
4754000	4756000	because
4756000	4758000	I was talking to this famous
4758000	4760000	actually it's a podcast
4760000	4762000	I was talking to Chris Cuomo
4762000	4764000	and he'd just been fired from CNN
4764000	4766000	and he was trying to figure out his next thing
4766000	4768000	and he's like I really let my family down
4768000	4770000	I really let my family down
4770000	4772000	and that's the hardest part about all this
4772000	4774000	I'm like dude I don't know your wife
4774000	4776000	I don't know your kids and I'm almost entirely certain
4776000	4778000	what they want is for you to be happy
4778000	4780000	you know he's this big handsome
4780000	4782000	larger than life character
4782000	4784000	I'm like when you're happy I bet your household
4784000	4786000	just burns bright
4786000	4788000	and when you're not happy I bet it's not a great place to be
4788000	4790000	so stop putting that on
4790000	4792000	your family and you and all that
4792000	4794000	I'm like just find something you don't
4794000	4796000	hate and I bet your partner
4796000	4798000	would be so supportive of anything you want
4798000	4800000	because
4800000	4802000	the money is great
4802000	4804000	but if one of you is really unhappy
4804000	4806000	oh gosh
4806000	4808000	I mean you're married right
4808000	4810000	I mean one of you is unhappy
4810000	4812000	that's rough
4812000	4814000	and if one of your kids is unhappy the whole thing
4814000	4816000	comes crumbling down right
4816000	4818000	so I think it's about partnership
4818000	4820000	and being open and honest
4820000	4822000	with someone else but there's just no getting around it
4822000	4824000	I don't know how to be economically secure
4824000	4826000	unless you're born wealthy
4826000	4828000	without working really hard
4828000	4830000	from the age of 22 to 42
4830000	4832000	I did nothing but work
4832000	4834000	and it doesn't sound aspirational
4834000	4836000	it cost me my hair it cost me my first marriage
4836000	4838000	and it was worth it
4838000	4840000	I got the currency and skills to get
4840000	4842000	economic security at some point
4842000	4844000	I just don't think there's a free lunch
4844000	4846000	I find young people are totally unrealistic
4846000	4848000	I call it the myth of balance
4848000	4850000	I mean you can have it all
4850000	4852000	but you can't have it all at once
4852000	4854000	I mean kids I mean my students
4854000	4856000	I say how much money do you expect to be making
4856000	4858000	they expect to be in the top 1%
4858000	4860000	of income earning households
4860000	4862000	80% of them by the time they're 30
4862000	4864000	and then they talk about balance
4864000	4866000	balance in the context
4866000	4868000	of an expectation
4868000	4870000	they want balance they want to work that hard
4870000	4872000	they want balance they want hobbies
4872000	4874000	they want to spend time with their family
4874000	4876000	and their dogs I'm like okay
4876000	4878000	unless you're born rich I don't know how to do that
4878000	4880000	I just I don't know anyone
4880000	4882000	that successful who didn't
4882000	4884000	for a good 10 or 20 years
4884000	4886000	work pretty
4886000	4888000	damn hard maybe Beyoncé but Beyoncé
4888000	4890000	supposed to work 60 hours a week
4890000	4892000	so I'm sure she did
4892000	4894000	yeah there's a there's a certain level
4894000	4896000	of obsession that kind of contravenes
4896000	4898000	all the negativity around
4898000	4900000	hustle culture
4900000	4902000	I mean we should all be healthy we should have
4902000	4904000	a healthy relationship with the work that we do
4904000	4906000	I'm an all-in guy
4906000	4908000	I really don't know how to do it
4908000	4910000	any other way so it's disingenuous
4910000	4912000	to you know kind of talk
4912000	4914000	about that when I'm practicing it differently
4914000	4916000	and I've improved and I'm better now
4916000	4918000	but when you're young
4918000	4920000	to live that
4920000	4922000	stoic lifestyle
4922000	4924000	where you're keeping your overhead as low as possible
4924000	4926000	and you can flex
4926000	4928000	some discipline to
4928000	4930000	really go all in on something
4930000	4932000	may sound on paper
4932000	4934000	terrible but it's actually
4934000	4936000	pretty nourishing you can learn a lot
4936000	4938000	and I think the skills that you learn
4938000	4940000	about your own capacity and your own potential
4940000	4942000	are as instructive
4942000	4944000	and informative as whatever you're learning
4944000	4946000	in the workplace
4946000	4948000	well you were an athlete so I was a Morgan Stanley
4948000	4950000	I wasn't as well educated
4950000	4952000	I don't think I was as skilled as my peers
4952000	4954000	it was an analyst class of 73 kids
4954000	4956000	so I decided I wanted to lean into my strengths
4956000	4958000	I moved in with my mom I started saving money
4958000	4960000	because I wanted to go to graduate school
4960000	4962000	every week on Tuesday morning I'd go into work
4962000	4964000	at 9 a.m. and I'd stay until Wednesday
4964000	4966000	6 p.m.
4966000	4968000	I got no one to go home to
4968000	4970000	I don't have a girlfriend
4970000	4972000	my mom's not going to miss me
4972000	4974000	and I'm physically
4974000	4976000	elite right now
4976000	4978000	I could do it no problem one cup of coffee
4978000	4980000	maybe grab 15 minutes 30 minutes
4980000	4982000	sleep at 4 in the morning
4982000	4984000	the next morning
4984000	4986000	and I sent a signal to my colleagues
4986000	4988000	that I was here to play
4988000	4990000	and the blessing of an athlete
4990000	4992000	and everyone should try
4992000	4994000	and find this environment
4994000	4996000	is that
4996000	4998000	I rode crew at one point when you're rowing
4998000	5000000	the air going down your esophagus feels like fire
5000000	5002000	you can't feel your legs
5002000	5004000	you literally start seeing black spots
5004000	5006000	because you start to pass out you're a swimmer
5006000	5008000	I mean you had some of that same
5008000	5010000	and that's at
5010000	5012000	800 meters and every time you make it
5012000	5014000	to 2000
5014000	5016000	to push yourself like that is such an incredible
5016000	5018000	gift to be given the opportunity
5018000	5020000	to really be forced
5020000	5022000	to push yourself as a gift because what you realize is
5022000	5024000	when you get divorced and you think
5024000	5026000	I can't handle this anymore I can't handle it
5026000	5028000	your business is failing
5028000	5030000	I just fucking can't deal with this
5030000	5032000	or you feel
5032000	5034000	you feel tired what you realize is about the moment
5034000	5036000	you think you're going to give up
5036000	5038000	you're about a third of the way of your limit
5038000	5040000	and it builds real incredible confidence
5040000	5042000	and grit and endurance
5042000	5044000	and I think those skills really serve
5044000	5046000	people well and other pieces of advice to young people
5046000	5048000	whether it's fitness sports
5048000	5050000	working ridiculously hard
5050000	5052000	finding something super hard
5052000	5054000	and really
5054000	5056000	try and test your limits
5056000	5058000	because it gives you a sense of confidence
5058000	5060000	like wow I just had no idea
5060000	5062000	what I was capable of
5062000	5064000	and it's a real asset the rest of your life
5064000	5066000	you're starting to smell but the lows are so low
5066000	5068000	and starting
5068000	5070000	your own business like oh my god
5070000	5072000	I'm so full of shit this isn't working
5072000	5074000	I'm spending so much money
5074000	5076000	I'm letting everybody down
5076000	5078000	I just can't get so low
5078000	5080000	if you've had the opportunity to really test
5080000	5082000	your emotional physical limits
5082000	5084000	you're like I'm fine
5084000	5086000	I'm going to get through this
5086000	5088000	it's absolutely not the limit
5088000	5090000	but I think that's a blessing
5090000	5092000	for a young person
5092000	5094000	I think in the discussion around
5094000	5096000	people who are unfulfilled
5096000	5098000	and in midlife
5098000	5100000	there's also the silver lining
5100000	5102000	that the world is different
5102000	5104000	than it was when you and I graduated
5104000	5106000	from college there are
5106000	5108000	all these new opportunities
5108000	5110000	that the internet has afforded us
5110000	5112000	to self-craft
5112000	5114000	different ways to make money
5114000	5116000	or to find meaning and purpose
5116000	5118000	and
5118000	5120000	it's important to understand that
5120000	5122000	against that narrative of like
5122000	5124000	you should just chase your passion
5124000	5126000	that
5126000	5128000	not be translated into this permission
5128000	5130000	to just quit your job especially if you're married
5130000	5132000	and you have all these responsibilities
5132000	5134000	you
5134000	5136000	flex that discipline
5136000	5138000	and that
5138000	5140000	you know kind of stoic perspective
5140000	5142000	and apply it to your time management
5142000	5144000	like we're all wasting time
5144000	5146000	now more than ever with our phones etc
5146000	5148000	like where is that extra hour
5148000	5150000	or two hours that you can carve out
5150000	5152000	either daily or weekly
5152000	5154000	to explore what it is that gets you excited
5154000	5156000	and just
5156000	5158000	kind of begin to explore that
5158000	5160000	not because you're going to quit your job
5160000	5162000	it makes you feel good
5162000	5164000	or it's fulfilling in some way
5164000	5166000	and those threads
5166000	5168000	I think there is a spirituality in that
5168000	5170000	if you give that energy
5170000	5172000	stuff starts to show up
5172000	5174000	and opportunities present themselves
5174000	5176000	and perhaps at some moment
5176000	5178000	it will be a career path for you
5178000	5180000	or some kind of fulfilling side hustle
5180000	5182000	that you can build into your life
5182000	5184000	but to do it responsibly
5184000	5186000	especially when you have dependence
5186000	5188000	I think is important in this culture
5188000	5190000	you know reinvent your life overnight
5190000	5192000	nobody's successful that I know
5192000	5194000	built anything meaningful or successful
5194000	5196000	in the way that it gets
5196000	5198000	portrayed in the media and on social media
5198000	5200000	it takes a long time
5200000	5202000	and you have to be willing to
5202000	5204000	you know, girt yourself
5204000	5206000	and to weather that
5206000	5208000	that journey
5208000	5210000	something men are not good at, lean on your friends
5210000	5212000	I got financial commitments but I'm looking for something to do
5212000	5214000	right
5214000	5216000	crowdsource some ideas
5216000	5218000	to read the label from inside of the bottle
5218000	5220000	and men always put up this front that
5220000	5222000	my masculinity is tied to
5222000	5224000	I should sew together, I'm financially secure
5224000	5226000	and I'm happy and everything's great
5226000	5228000	I think developing a circle of friends
5228000	5230000	and mentors or just, you know
5230000	5232000	a kitchen cabinet to say
5232000	5234000	you know, I don't like what I'm doing
5234000	5236000	I got to still make money
5236000	5238000	what you were saying, I, you know
5238000	5240000	workshop some things, one or two hours
5240000	5242000	spend some time, see if there's money
5242000	5244000	and see if you've enjoyed as much as you thought
5244000	5246000	we friends will tell you, by the way, don't quit your day job
5246000	5248000	it's hard to find another job without a job
5248000	5250000	whatever it might be but someone who can just ask you
5250000	5252000	really hard questions
5252000	5254000	and also might be able to help you
5254000	5256000	you know what I've been doing, I've been doing this cool thing over here
5256000	5258000	or you know what you would be good at
5258000	5260000	I've never in a million years
5260000	5262000	what I thought I'd do in podcasting
5262000	5264000	it's like, I know it
5264000	5266000	it definitely wasn't on the whiteboard
5266000	5268000	I didn't know what it was
5268000	5270000	the first podcast I listened to was a podcast
5270000	5272000	I was on with Kara Swisher, I'd never listened to a podcast
5272000	5274000	but putting yourself in a position
5274000	5276000	of success, talking to people
5276000	5278000	also
5278000	5280000	people love, if you have good friends
5280000	5282000	they like you asking them for help
5282000	5284000	right, I need to find ways to make more money
5284000	5286000	or I need to find something else
5286000	5288000	and you have any, what do you think
5288000	5290000	you have any ideas, what did you do
5290000	5292000	and we have this weird sense of masculinity
5292000	5294000	that if you're vulnerable like that
5294000	5296000	you're taking away from their impressiony or something like that
5296000	5298000	I think people like being asked for help
5298000	5300000	and I mean they're just the weirdest shit
5300000	5302000	you know what I'm talking about, go dark
5302000	5304000	or men's suicide, something like
5304000	5306000	a huge portion of men who commit suicide
5306000	5308000	no one around them had any idea
5308000	5310000	they had no idea they were even struggling
5310000	5312000	have you seen this like this
5312000	5314000	most horrific video showing the last video
5314000	5316000	in pictures of these men
5316000	5318000	and they're usually like, they look happy
5318000	5320000	so your own ability to
5320000	5322000	reach out and ask other people for help
5322000	5324000	finally in the last 10 years
5324000	5326000	I now don't make a single business
5326000	5328000	or personal decision of any importance without checking
5328000	5330000	with other people
5330000	5332000	I mistook leadership for
5332000	5334000	you have a plan, you come into a room
5334000	5336000	you tell them what you think
5336000	5338000	and then you advocate for your strategy
5338000	5340000	and you go, you never ask for people help
5340000	5342000	you never say, I don't know
5342000	5344000	I don't know what I'm doing
5344000	5346000	I'm like insecure about this, I don't know
5346000	5348000	I would never ask anybody for help until
5348000	5350000	really until I was in my 40s
5350000	5352000	I wish I'd figured that out earlier
5352000	5354000	why is that so hard
5354000	5356000	you know I'm so indoctrinated
5356000	5358000	it's helped me that
5358000	5360000	it's second nature to
5360000	5362000	talk about what's bothering me
5362000	5364000	or my weaknesses or my failures
5364000	5366000	or to solicit input
5366000	5368000	and to have a board of advisors
5368000	5370000	and all kinds of different people that I call for different reasons
5370000	5372000	it's a reflex now
5372000	5374000	but it wasn't always that way I've been doing this for a long time
5374000	5376000	but I've been doing it for so long
5376000	5378000	that I think I've lost touch with
5378000	5380000	why it's so challenging
5380000	5382000	for so many particularly
5382000	5384000	men to raise their hand
5384000	5386000	well I'm seeing a bunch of my fraternity brothers
5386000	5388000	tomorrow night
5388000	5390000	and it'll be a series of controlled boasting
5390000	5392000	yeah my wife calls it super duper
5392000	5394000	give me a shake their hand
5394000	5396000	super oh I'm great you know
5396000	5398000	it's just a front you know it's all fucking
5398000	5400000	horse shit yeah I did this
5400000	5402000	about this stock I'd have my best mother
5402000	5404000	check comes everyone fighting for the check
5404000	5406000	no one would say
5406000	5408000	you know on my kid needs braces can someone else
5408000	5410000	I mean no one would ever say that right
5410000	5412000	it's all just a set of like check
5412000	5414000	it out right
5414000	5416000	I think his men are evaluated based on their economic vitality
5416000	5418000	and having their act together
5418000	5420000	that they're just very loath to reach out for help
5420000	5422000	I think the blessing
5422000	5424000	of the addiction community
5424000	5426000	or I don't know what you call it the recovery community
5426000	5428000	is they just put that shit aside
5428000	5430000	my sense of that community is
5430000	5432000	first signal you're struggling you reach out to other people
5432000	5434000	first signal and that's a gift
5434000	5436000	I would bet a disproportionate number of men
5436000	5438000	never develop that skill women are much better
5438000	5440000	out of than men they lean on their social networks
5440000	5442000	I mean
5442000	5444000	we're dealing with a situation right now
5444000	5446000	where men are now 77% of suicides and it's going up
5446000	5448000	we're gonna have 4 to 1
5448000	5450000	male to female suicides
5452000	5454000	how much of that do you think is
5454000	5456000	tied to this loneliness epidemic
5456000	5458000	that we're seeing
5458000	5460000	I think loneliness
5460000	5462000	so I'm gonna
5462000	5464000	flex now
5464000	5466000	talking to the Department of Homeland Security about
5466000	5468000	AI
5468000	5470000	but
5470000	5472000	what are the threats of AI
5472000	5474000	is it going sentient
5474000	5476000	is it AI tested
5476000	5478000	misinformation
5478000	5480000	is it self-repairing
5480000	5482000	super weapons
5482000	5484000	I think in the short run
5484000	5486000	misinformation AI tested misinformation
5486000	5488000	is a threat if I were Putin I'd be
5488000	5490000	flooding the zone with misinformation
5490000	5492000	making Biden seem a little bit older
5492000	5494000	you know I think that's a
5494000	5496000	short term threat
5496000	5498000	is tapping into
5498000	5500000	men's loneliness
5500000	5502000	one out of seven men
5502000	5504000	don't have a single friend one out of four men
5504000	5506000	can't name a friend
5506000	5508000	the number of men who see their friends every day
5508000	5510000	in high school has been cut in half
5510000	5512000	so they don't see their friends
5512000	5514000	they don't have romantic relationships
5514000	5516000	which serve as great guardrails
5516000	5518000	the only reason I stopped smoking pot every day
5518000	5520000	was my girlfriend said if you don't get your shit together
5520000	5522000	I'm gonna stop having sex with you
5522000	5524000	that's a tremendous motivator for a young man
5524000	5526000	if I hadn't had the prospects of a romantic
5526000	5528000	relationship if I didn't have the guardrails of going
5528000	5530000	into the office every day which a lot of men don't
5530000	5532000	I just think I would have
5532000	5534000	smoked pot and watched Planet of the Apes all day long
5534000	5536000	right that was a good life for me
5536000	5538000	I enjoyed that
5538000	5540000	so so many men
5540000	5542000	have now sequestered from people
5542000	5544000	and guardrails to this mix of algorithms
5544000	5546000	and screens
5546000	5548000	that they're becoming very lonely
5548000	5550000	and I said the scenario I see is the biggest
5550000	5552000	threat to the homeland and defense
5552000	5554000	is if I were
5554000	5556000	an adversary, a bad actor
5556000	5558000	I would identify the two or three million
5558000	5560000	very lonely men who serve
5560000	5562000	in the armed services or at our
5562000	5564000	ports or our critical infrastructure
5564000	5566000	and I would develop a very sophisticated
5566000	5568000	network of AI girlfriends
5568000	5570000	that start a relationship with them
5570000	5572000	and
5572000	5574000	make them feel good it can be
5574000	5576000	three months, six months, twelve months
5576000	5578000	send them pictures increasingly erotic
5578000	5580000	you're funny like the movie Her
5580000	5582000	and get them more and more involved
5582000	5584000	and all you need
5584000	5586000	0.01% of them would be
5586000	5588000	3,000 of them and at some point
5588000	5590000	you flip it and say
5590000	5592000	you know what real leadership and real men do
5592000	5594000	is they fight against the tyranny
5594000	5596000	and what is the tyranny? The tyranny is your own
5596000	5598000	government and when
5598000	5600000	this box comes into the port
5600000	5602000	I don't want you to check it
5602000	5604000	or you're on the aircraft carrier strike force
5604000	5606000	off the coast of the Mediterranean
5606000	5608000	turn off this switch don't turn it on turn
5608000	5610000	it off I mean I think
5610000	5612000	the next big threat or soft tissue
5612000	5614000	will be a group of radicalized
5614000	5616000	young men who are susceptible to
5616000	5618000	AI algorithms and are so lonely
5618000	5620000	that they start to engage with AI
5620000	5622000	relationship specifically AI girlfriends
5622000	5624000	that will essentially
5624000	5626000	be in a position to radicalize them
5626000	5628000	and instruct them on behavior
5628000	5630000	I mean I don't think I don't
5630000	5632000	think we're gonna have Skynet it'll replace
5632000	5634000	jobs but every innovation
5634000	5636000	and technology destroys jobs in the short
5636000	5638000	run and then over the long term it creates
5638000	5640000	more jobs as will AI
5640000	5642000	but there's so many lonely young men
5642000	5644000	you don't have
5644000	5646000	any interaction with people
5646000	5648000	and they become very susceptible to
5648000	5650000	anything or any platform
5650000	5652000	or any algorithm
5652000	5654000	giving them a sense of self-worth
5654000	5656000	I literally see that as the biggest defense secret
5656000	5658000	no one's gonna take us on
5658000	5660000	kinetically we spend $800 billion
5660000	5662000	no one can attack us I think
5662000	5664000	we're gonna figure out Hamas I think we're gonna figure out
5664000	5666000	over time Russian Ukraine
5666000	5668000	I think the threat is within
5668000	5670000	I think this lonely young men
5670000	5672000	in concert with AI is a huge
5672000	5674000	threat subtle progressive
5674000	5676000	and pernicious 100%
5676000	5678000	manipulation
5678000	5680000	just moment by moment
5680000	5682000	they get huge reward from it
5682000	5684000	nice relationship
5684000	5686000	they trust each other
5686000	5688000	you start thinking it's real
5688000	5690000	and impossible to
5690000	5692000	police
5692000	5694000	that's a really scary thing
5694000	5696000	read this article what do you think
5696000	5698000	now read this one constantly testing
5698000	5700000	in a million different ways
5700000	5702000	see how you get test millions of times
5702000	5704000	over and over every second
5704000	5706000	how you get them further and further
5706000	5708000	down this path towards radicalization
5708000	5710000	that is not a good picture
5710000	5712000	is there an antidote to that
5712000	5714000	getting people out into the real world
5714000	5716000	detached and untethered from their phones
5716000	5718000	relationships
5718000	5720000	everything from church and on profit work
5720000	5722000	to third spaces to athletics to leagues
5722000	5724000	leveling up men
5724000	5726000	so they're more attractive to women
5726000	5728000	and they can have an user time getting partnerships
5728000	5730000	putting them in more situations
5730000	5732000	where they develop friendships
5732000	5734000	I'm a fan of national service
5734000	5736000	doesn't have the teen depression we have Israel
5736000	5738000	they all serve in the same uniform
5738000	5740000	it gives them a sense of purpose
5740000	5742000	they meet friends they meet mates
5742000	5744000	they meet potential future business founders
5744000	5746000	and co-founders and they have a sense of purpose
5746000	5748000	serving in the agency of something else
5748000	5750000	these kids out of the house we got to get them
5750000	5752000	making friends we got to get them
5752000	5754000	engaging in the messy
5754000	5756000	ugly business of
5756000	5758000	real world and rejection and friendships
5758000	5760000	and I mean we're mammals
5760000	5762000	put an orc in a tank alone
5762000	5764000	see what happens it goes crazy
5764000	5766000	and we're raising a generation of men
5766000	5768000	who are going to be increasingly psychotic and crazy
5770000	5772000	that was ugly
5772000	5774000	that is like yeah it's so depressing
5774000	5776000	that was ugly
5776000	5778000	you're a change agent
5778000	5780000	and I'm curious about your thoughts
5780000	5782000	as somebody who's working with young people
5782000	5784000	who's mentoring up close
5784000	5786000	and afar
5786000	5788000	what is the best way
5788000	5790000	to instigate positive change
5790000	5792000	in an individual
5792000	5794000	you probably know more about this than I do
5794000	5796000	what I'll tell you is what I do when I
5796000	5798000	coach a young man
5798000	5800000	I try to take on
5800000	5802000	and it's not a lot but I try to take on
5802000	5804000	two young men every six months
5804000	5806000	sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
5806000	5808000	and what is the differentiator
5808000	5810000	what's the difference between the person who can
5810000	5812000	hear the good information
5812000	5814000	or receive the positive influence
5814000	5816000	and put it into action versus the person who's
5816000	5818000	resistant or struggles
5818000	5820000	well the first thing is they've got to want to do it
5820000	5822000	I would say a third of the time they don't show up
5822000	5824000	or they miss it I'm like you're not ready
5824000	5826000	you don't want this your dad told you to do it
5826000	5828000	you know calm when you're serious about it
5828000	5830000	whatever it is you need to hit bottom or I don't know
5830000	5832000	you can't instill willingness
5832000	5834000	so I spent a lot of time thinking about that
5834000	5836000	like how do you make somebody more willing
5836000	5838000	short of performing some kind of
5838000	5840000	inception they have to be
5840000	5842000	in a position of receptivity that's
5842000	5844000	often related to
5844000	5846000	suffering I don't know how to do that
5846000	5848000	they either got to show up serious about
5848000	5850000	and the first thing I do it's a series of very tactical
5850000	5852000	lessons I say unlock your phone
5852000	5854000	I'm going to look at your screen time
5854000	5856000	and I'm not going to make any judgments
5856000	5858000	I watch porn I spend too much time
5858000	5860000	on tiktok so I'm not going to judge you
5860000	5862000	and then I say I find
5862000	5864000	8 to 12 hours a week
5864000	5866000	easily in screen time
5866000	5868000	coin base stupid shit trading stocks
5868000	5870000	on robin it I'm like we're going to
5870000	5872000	reallocate that time into three things
5872000	5874000	we're going to reallocate it into
5874000	5876000	fitness we're going to get really fucking strong
5876000	5878000	or much stronger right
5878000	5880000	and there's apps that don't cost
5880000	5882000	any money or cost a little bit of money

5890000	5892000	eat a little cleaner right we're going to
5892000	5894000	spend three hours maybe four hours a week
5894000	5896000	just on fitness because you can feel better
5896000	5898000	about yourself and you can be stronger and it's going to
5898000	5900000	help your mental outlook
5900000	5902000	you got to start making some money
5902000	5904000	I don't care what it is

5908000	5910000	you have to start making
5910000	5912000	some money the best way to make a lot of money is
5912000	5914000	to start making some money
5914000	5916000	some money right away
5916000	5918000	you got a smart phone you can make money
5918000	5920000	it's a full employment economy
5920000	5922000	right you're not too good
5922000	5924000	to whatever it is work at CVS whatever
5924000	5926000	it is you got to make some money even if it's

5930000	5932000	for the flesh of money money's wonderful
5932000	5934000	right you're not going to have to ask your parents
5934000	5936000	for all this shit are you going to feel a little bit better about yourself
5936000	5938000	and then third thing is
5938000	5940000	you got to get every day out
5940000	5942000	and be in the agency and company of strangers
5942000	5944000	right
5944000	5946000	church group non-profit
5946000	5948000	voter registration
5948000	5950000	riding class a league
5950000	5952000	go play tennis at the park
5952000	5954000	where they have round robins where you meet
5954000	5956000	whatever it is you have
5956000	5958000	to be in the company of strangers
5958000	5960000	and when you're with strangers
5960000	5962000	you got to be supportive and nice and introduce yourself
5962000	5964000	and you're going to be
5964000	5966000	shocked how many nice people you meet out there
5966000	5968000	who like you don't like
5968000	5970000	you whatever it might be but we're going to get fit
5970000	5972000	we're going to make a little bit of money
5972000	5974000	and be around other people
5974000	5976000	and that's where we start
5976000	5978000	you know I don't know how to do goals I don't know
5978000	5980000	I mean I'm not like that or tracking I'm like
5980000	5982000	like this is about sweat
5982000	5984000	it's about money and the company other people
5984000	5986000	does that advice apply to
5986000	5988000	the parents
5988000	5990000	who have the teen
5990000	5992000	who's in the basement playing video games
5992000	5994000	and vaping because I don't know about you Scott
5994000	5996000	but sometimes
5996000	5998000	those people have to hear it
5998000	6000000	from somebody else other than their parent
6000000	6002000	the parent is often challenged
6002000	6004000	and the advice doesn't land in the same way
6004000	6006000	as like
6006000	6008000	your buddy
6008000	6010000	who comes over and is much cooler than you
6010000	6012000	no matter how cool you are
6012000	6014000	my kids
6014000	6016000	especially my 16 year old is more inclined to take advice
6016000	6018000	from you than from me right now
6018000	6020000	yeah and vice versa
6020000	6022000	that's exactly right
6022000	6024000	and that's the way it is
6024000	6026000	and it probably should be that way
6026000	6028000	we have a healthy
6028000	6030000	instinct such that it's easier for us to leave the pack
6030000	6032000	when the time comes to leave the pack
6032000	6034000	where we start thinking our parents are idiots
6034000	6036000	that just happens especially with men
6036000	6038000	and it's quite friendly it's healthy
6038000	6040000	so there's studies showing that the most
6040000	6042000	impactful thing on your kids
6042000	6044000	your sons is their friends
6044000	6046000	and also your friends' fathers
6046000	6048000	and not what you say
6048000	6050000	but how you model it
6050000	6052000	well I figured out once boys kind of hit 13
6052000	6054000	they don't listen to anything you say the best you can do is model
6054000	6056000	I try to get my kids to be
6056000	6058000	you know good manners so I'm really conscious
6058000	6060000	of my table manners when I'm around my boys
6060000	6062000	the first thing when visitors show up
6062000	6064000	I run out to the car and I grab their luggage
6064000	6066000	and ask them to help me
6066000	6068000	I think you got to model it but there's
6068000	6070000	what you're saying is a proven phenomena
6070000	6072000	boys are much more inclined to listen to their friends
6072000	6074000	and their friends' dads
6074000	6076000	and parents than you
6076000	6078000	so just trying to surround them with good positive role models
6078000	6080000	and also
6080000	6082000	my 16 year old said he loved
6082000	6084000	we have this friend Tom Clark
6084000	6086000	I just love Tom he's the coolest guy
6086000	6088000	and immediately I just got a little jealous on the left side
6088000	6090000	and I thought you know we should really
6090000	6092000	vacation with that family because he's a good man
6092000	6094000	he's a good role model he knows my son likes him
6094000	6096000	and he's gonna have
6096000	6098000	an easier time getting through to important things
6098000	6100000	so and also I think with parents
6100000	6102000	when I tell parents when they reach out
6102000	6104000	I'm like forgive yourself
6104000	6106000	what I found is that
6106000	6108000	if you want to believe in nature over nurture
6108000	6110000	just have two kids
6110000	6112000	you know I don't know how yours are
6112000	6114000	the only thing I know about having a second kid
6114000	6116000	is you know it's gonna be totally different
6116000	6118000	yeah you realize
6118000	6120000	they come out who they are
6120000	6122000	and you guide and put the guard rails up
6122000	6124000	and you know try to exert
6124000	6126000	a good influence on them but
6126000	6128000	they pretty much come out
6128000	6130000	in a certain way
6130000	6132000	baked and that's not gonna change
6132000	6134000	well like Michelle Obama said
6134000	6136000	they come to you and the best description I've heard is
6136000	6138000	you're not an engineer
6138000	6140000	you know an engineer the sheep
6140000	6142000	you get to decide where they graze
6142000	6144000	you can point them in a direction
6144000	6146000	you get to decide what they eat
6146000	6148000	but the sheep comes to you
6148000	6150000	I mean my 16 year old
6150000	6152000	when he was a kid
6152000	6154000	he would come into my room in the morning
6154000	6156000	and he would say dressed
6156000	6158000	say dad let's make a plan
6158000	6160000	I was like okay where are the cameras
6160000	6162000	it was like something out of a hallmark channel
6162000	6164000	easy, nice, sweet
6164000	6166000	my younger one
6166000	6168000	is a terrorist constantly assessing
6168000	6170000	a terror but at the same time
6170000	6172000	it's like owning a stock
6172000	6174000	the lows are lower, volatile stock
6174000	6176000	but the highs are higher
6176000	6178000	he's so funny, so crazy
6178000	6180000	so bold and with his emotions
6180000	6182000	and so loving
6182000	6184000	they're just different people
6184000	6186000	and we just haven't treated him that much
6186000	6188000	differently so when one of them
6188000	6190000	isn't doing well
6190000	6192000	and it's hard to tell your partner this
6192000	6194000	or whatever I tell their parents is
6194000	6196000	forgive yourself because
6196000	6198000	yeah you're important
6198000	6200000	and you can shape stuff but
6200000	6202000	you know the only thing I
6202000	6204000	found with my boys
6204000	6206000	you give them the advice you can
6206000	6208000	you give them the help you can but the only thing that's really fixed
6208000	6210000	any real problems they faced
6210000	6212000	is time
6212000	6214000	and I just see
6214000	6216000	it brings the house down when kids aren't doing well
6216000	6218000	it just brings the house down and it's like
6218000	6220000	the parents don't know what to do they're beside themselves
6220000	6222000	and the first thing I say
6222000	6224000	I have a couple friends who are really starting with their kids
6224000	6226000	you're doing your best, you're a good person
6226000	6228000	you're doing your best
6228000	6230000	it's tough
6230000	6232000	when the kid is struggling
6232000	6234000	it's really hard to think about anything else
6234000	6236000	brings the house down
6236000	6238000	you're so good on
6238000	6240000	tech and your kind of predictions
6240000	6242000	and your 10,000 foot view
6242000	6244000	on you know trends
6244000	6246000	I would be remiss in not asking
6246000	6248000	a question that I'm personally
6248000	6250000	invested in which is
6250000	6252000	how do you see the current and future
6252000	6254000	state of podcasting
6254000	6256000	what's your sense of what this ecosystem
6256000	6258000	is kind of all about right now
6258000	6260000	and where is it heading
6260000	6262000	in a way that maybe we you know
6262000	6264000	is counterintuitive
6264000	6266000	I don't know if it's counterintuitive but
6266000	6268000	podcasting sort of
6268000	6270000	in many ways represents where America has had it
6270000	6272000	in a bit of a negative way in that it's
6272000	6274000	income inequality gone crazy
6274000	6276000	there's 1.7 million podcasts
6276000	6278000	I would bet
6278000	6280000	the top 500 do 98% of the
6280000	6282000	and 120% of the profits
6282000	6284000	yeah I would think it might even be
6284000	6286000	more skewed than that
6286000	6288000	well Joe Rogan does 190 million
6288000	6290000	downloads he's number one
6290000	6292000	and a really good podcast and the top
6292000	6294000	100 does 2 or 3 million I mean it just
6294000	6296000	drops off a cliff and then
6296000	6298000	you know I would bet 99.9%
6298000	6300000	of podcasts are not self sustaining
6300000	6302000	so
6302000	6304000	I mean do as I say not as I do
6304000	6306000	going into podcasting
6306000	6308000	get psychic reward for it use it to market
6308000	6310000	something else but to think you're going to
6310000	6312000	make a living in podcasting just be clear
6312000	6314000	that you better be in the top 0.01%
6314000	6316000	because it's very
6316000	6318000	difficult it's a small business
6318000	6320000	you know a successful
6320000	6322000	podcast as several million in revenue
6322000	6324000	but it's a very profitable
6324000	6326000	business once you get to that point and the thing
6326000	6328000	as a medium it's not only
6328000	6330000	growing but its CPMs are going up
6330000	6332000	because the thing about the medium
6332000	6334000	the medium is the message
6334000	6336000	I can tell how someone has been introduced
6336000	6338000	to me based on the way they behave
6338000	6340000	if someone high fives me I know
6340000	6342000	they've seen a video if someone
6342000	6344000	comes up and wants to have or sends me
6344000	6346000	a really long email or they come up
6346000	6348000	and they hold my hands and they look into my eyes
6348000	6350000	I know they've read something
6350000	6352000	I've written that doesn't resonated
6352000	6354000	when someone comes up to me I'm curious
6354000	6356000	what this happens to you and they start speaking
6356000	6358000	to you as if you know them
6358000	6360000	oh it's a podcast
6360000	6362000	and they'll say often I'm like oh you
6362000	6364000	don't know me because you're in their
6364000	6366000	ears you're physically in their ears
6366000	6368000	typically when they're doing
6368000	6370000	something intimate walking their dog
6370000	6372000	hanging out with their spouse
6372000	6374000	making breakfast they feel like
6374000	6376000	they're your friend and that's the most
6376000	6378000	rewarding thing about podcasting
6378000	6380000	is you just have friends
6380000	6382000	it's a parasocial relationship
6382000	6384000	and it's very intimate and there's a sense
6384000	6386000	of trust and friendship even if it's
6386000	6388000	imagined that is
6388000	6390000	projected onto you so I have that experience
6390000	6392000	a lot and it's very gratifying
6392000	6394000	because it's like you do know me I'm showing up
6394000	6396000	as who I am I think it's fantastic
6396000	6398000	and I think it's it makes it
6398000	6400000	a very unique form
6400000	6402000	of infotainment right
6402000	6404000	it's portable you can do something else
6404000	6406000	while you're doing it and the intimacy
6406000	6408000	and the trust that's built with the host
6408000	6410000	I think is
6410000	6412000	is also something that's
6412000	6414000	tremendously unique in the media
6414000	6416000	landscape that I'm not sure
6416000	6418000	the kind of
6418000	6420000	advertising landscape
6420000	6422000	around podcasting has fully
6422000	6424000	like acknowledged or recognized
6424000	6426000	like it's very different like
6426000	6428000	when Tom Broca is delivering the news
6428000	6430000	and then they cut to an ad he's not endorsing
6430000	6432000	the product
6432000	6434000	that ad is running independent of anything that
6434000	6436000	host readovers yeah and so in podcasting
6436000	6438000	when a host says hey listen I found this product
6438000	6440000	I think it's great you know and here's why
6440000	6442000	and there's that implicit trust that's been built
6442000	6444000	over many years there's
6444000	6446000	much more value in that that I don't know
6446000	6448000	if it's totally
6448000	6450000	appreciated and I also think
6450000	6452000	at the same time podcasting
6452000	6454000	advertising is tremendously
6454000	6456000	underpriced in terms of marketing
6456000	6458000	spend and it's confusing to me
6458000	6460000	why Fortune 500 companies
6460000	6462000	larger enterprises that have huge
6462000	6464000	marketing budgets continue
6464000	6466000	to deploy those resources on television
6466000	6468000	advertising and all kinds of other
6468000	6470000	nonsense that doesn't convert
6470000	6472000	when they could take a fraction
6472000	6474000	of that and deploy it against
6474000	6476000	podcasts that
6476000	6478000	are host
6478000	6480000	lead and
6480000	6482000	speaking to the specific demographic
6482000	6484000	that that organization is trying to reach
6484000	6486000	just seems like a better plan
6486000	6488000	to me and the companies that get it
6488000	6490000	really get it and they're building amazing
6490000	6492000	companies you know on the shoulders
6492000	6494000	of podcasters but it still
6494000	6496000	feels like it's a niche thing
6496000	6498000	yeah it's look it's a small business
6498000	6500000	right now but it's growing 12%
6500000	6502000	a year there's very few mediums outside
6502000	6504000	of search and social that are growing double digits
6504000	6506000	in a media landscape where people are cutting
6506000	6508000	back media spending
6508000	6510000	so you set up a
6510000	6512000	media company
6512000	6514000	on probably I don't know
6514000	6516000	half a million million two million
6516000	6518000	dollar investment for you to set up
6518000	6520000	a TV show or TV station
6520000	6522000	or a music label
6522000	6524000	or I mean
6524000	6526000	you have been able to set up a media
6526000	6528000	company
6528000	6530000	at a fairly like
6530000	6532000	and you could probably pay as you go
6532000	6534000	and invest as you go yeah I mean I've been doing this for 11 years
6534000	6536000	you know started off
6536000	6538000	yeah I mean I've been doing it a long time
6538000	6540000	and it was just you know me and
6540000	6542000	my step son you know running the whole thing
6542000	6544000	it wasn't like this out of the gate like this
6544000	6546000	just happened very incrementally over time
6546000	6548000	but you have
6548000	6550000	traditionally in media
6550000	6552000	you just couldn't do that
6552000	6554000	you didn't have access you couldn't you couldn't be on ABC
6554000	6556000	I mean you just there was like three channels
6556000	6558000	or to start a newspaper
6558000	6560000	or start a magazine took real like took
6560000	6562000	so much money took so much
6562000	6564000	so I do think
6564000	6566000	that if you're really good at what you do
6566000	6568000	I write books that shit's hard
6568000	6570000	podcasting
6570000	6572000	I mean this is what you've surrounded yourself
6572000	6574000	with smart people and you're creating
6574000	6576000	a thick layer of innovation on top of it
6576000	6578000	but this is just you being you
6578000	6580000	you're a naturally curious guy
6580000	6582000	and you respond authentically
6582000	6584000	and you make money doing that
6584000	6586000	you make money doing that
6586000	6588000	yeah now you know why I'm waiting
6588000	6590000	for someone to break the door down
6590000	6592000	and tell me to stand
6592000	6594000	step away from the microphone that's just a gift
6594000	6596000	right it's an incredible gift
6596000	6598000	incredible change my life
6598000	6600000	change yours
6600000	6602000	yeah yeah

6610000	6612000	is really important and
6612000	6614000	there are so many
6614000	6616000	people who are in need of
6616000	6618000	advice and solid mentorship
6618000	6620000	and the fact that you do that digitally
6620000	6622000	and in person with the clarity
6622000	6624000	of thought and in this mission
6624000	6626000	based way that you do it I think is really
6626000	6628000	worthy of note and
