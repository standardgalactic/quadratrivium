1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're raising a generation of men who are going to be increasingly psychotic and crazy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That was ugly.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That is like, yeah, it's so depressing.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What does healthy masculinity look like?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Masculinity is an amazing thing.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You shouldn't apologize for it.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You should lean into it.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But what does it mean?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We've conflated toxicity with masculinity.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's so many lonely young men who don't have any interaction with people,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
very susceptible to anything or any algorithm giving them a sense of self-worth.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I would have been one of those guys today, angry, upset.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I relate.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My guest today is Scott Galloway.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Scott is a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He's a best-selling author.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He's also the host of the Prof. G podcast and a co-host of the Pivot podcast with Kara Swisher.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Masculinity is a societal construct, and a lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculinity.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's not the domain of people born as men.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In urban areas now in the U.S., women under the age of 30 are making more money than men.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And by the way, that's wonderful.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We should do nothing to get in the way of that.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Women are, I think, ready for more economically and emotionally viable young men.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So the question is, how do we level up young men?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Today's episode is brought to you by the awesome organizations that make this show possible.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Scott, thank you for doing this.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I know it's a schlep to come out here.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I appreciate you making the time.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've been looking forward to this for a very long time, and there's so much to talk about.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're such an interesting figure.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're at the intersection of business and entrepreneurship advice.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're sort of this really smart cultural critic pundit on tech, the reformation of higher education,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and also self-help.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You have this really sagacious facility for counsel that's aimed broadly, but also very specifically this particular lens on young men

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and this concern that you have for the next generation.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I think the sentiment behind it is really that we have a demonstrable problem with males in the next generation,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the culture of men, the evolution of men, the growth of men, who they are, where and how they are being guided or not being guided,

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and how they're being distracted or led astray in a way that's really interfering with their growth and their potential,

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and in turn, like the growth of a healthy society.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, well, first off, thanks for the kind words.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think I said when I came in, we went through all the podcasts and vites we have,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and I just mentioned your name and before I even finished it, like half my staff, we just went ape shit.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You deeply resonate with a lot of people.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I appreciate that.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, look, this is something that I'm passionate about.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think the data's overwhelming.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know, three times as likely to be addicted, four times as likely to kill themselves as women,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
12 times as likely to be incarcerated, 70% opioid every day.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You know, we don't have a homeless problem.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We don't have an opioid problem.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We don't have an incarceration problem.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have a male suicide, homeless and incarceration problem.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And if any other special interest group were committing suicide at four times the rate of the control group,

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
we would talk about it in different terms.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We would talk about the need for social programs, intervention, empathy.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But when something like this happens to young men, there's a lack of empathy.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You hear words like accountability or if they were just more in touch with their emotions.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I think that's really gotten in the way of a productive conversation.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And because there hasn't been a productive conversation and people out there feel and see what's going on,

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
some voices have entered into that void that are sort of unproductive voices.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And sometimes that kind of this pro-man rhetoric oftentimes is just suddenly veiled misogyny or lack of empathy.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Or kind of what I'll call the manosphere.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It starts off fine.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's the action-oriented, be fit, take control.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then it goes to really weird places.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It treats women as property or talks about immigrants taking your job or just sign up for my crypto university.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It just goes to weird places.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's also been a bit of a third rail issue to raise the peril of the wayward young man in a world in which

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the conversation around elevating certain sectors of culture and society is about women and people of color.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And yet the quote that I've heard you often repeat is,

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the most dangerous person in the world is a man that is broken and alone.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If you look globally, the most unstable violent societies in the world all have one thing in common.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They have a disproportionate amount of young men with a lack of economic or romantic prospects.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What do we do?

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We send them off to war.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If they don't have economic prospects internally, they'll overthrow the government.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So we find conflict and we send them off to war.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Also, this younger generation of men is paying for the unfair advantage you and I had growing up.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was born in Los Angeles or Southern California in 1964.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I hit the lottery.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You know, being born a white heterosexual male just had huge advantage in California.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Myself as well.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was born in 66.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You went to UCLA.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I went to Stanford.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm the beneficiary of, you know, an incredible education and privilege.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And now that, you know, access to what you and I had access to is all the more remote these days.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Like, what is going on?

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like, how did we get to this place?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What are the tectonic plates that have led us to this situation that we find ourselves in?

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So just to make the point around accessibility, I don't know the numbers in Stanford,

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
but when I applied to UCLA in 1982, the acceptance rate was 76% and it cost $1,200 a year.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I had to apply twice and I got in.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The acceptance rate this year will be 9% and it's $34,000.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So it's just inaccessible to anyone who's not remarkable, remarkable or rich.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So how did we get here?

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think there's been a variety of things, confluence of factors that have all collided around young men.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
One, there's just a lack of empathy.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
People see it as a zero-sum game where if you feel empathy for men, it must mean that you are anti-women.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And so there's a lack of empathy and what I call zero-sum gaming.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You know, civil rights didn't hurt white people.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It helped them.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Gay marriage doesn't hurt heteronormative marriage.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It enhances it.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So to talk about empathy for young men is in no way and should in no way be seen as anti-women.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think the group that wants more viable young men, first and foremost mothers, that's who I hear from the most,

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
who see what's going on with their daughters and the difference between their daughters and their sons.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And also women.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Women are, I think, ready for more economically and emotionally viable young men.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Women are dating older and older because they're having trouble finding what they would perceive as viable young men.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So a few things.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
One, just biological.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Men's prefrontal cortex matures later.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They just don't have the same executive function or adult in the room.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They're less mature, literally less mature.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Two, we have an education system that is biased against them.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you talk about the behaviors we reward in school, you're essentially going to describe a girl.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Be organized.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Be a pleaser.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sit still.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You also have an education industrial complex.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
92% of kindergarten teachers are women.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There's more female per capita fighter pilots than male kindergarten teachers.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's about 70, 80% K through 6 and about 60, 70% in high school.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And naturally you're going to empathize with a little version of you.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So I just don't think there's the same level of empathy for young men.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We've also done away with metal shop, auto shop, wood shop.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So the guy who's not cut out for college, who doesn't sit still, who's not academically focused as fewer and fewer on ramps into a middle class lifestyle.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And then these guys get into the workforce.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There's fewer middle class trades jobs.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In America, parents have done a really good job of convincing themselves they've failed as a parent if their kid doesn't end up at Stanford or UCLA.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So there's a lot of rage and shame in the household.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There's not visible on ramps into a healthy middle class life.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
3% of LinkedIn profiles in America say apprentice.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's 11% in the UK and Germany.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
50% of Germans have some sort of vocational certification.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's not true here.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's kind of become this you either get to Stanford or UCLA or you and your parents have failed.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And then a lot of dynamics dating apps where you have two, three to one men to women.

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And you also have this effect where because everyone has access to everyone, not everyone, but women who have a much finer filter are all drawn to the kind of what I call same guy.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So you have 50 men on Tinder, 50 women, 46 of those women will show all of their attention and interest to just four guys.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So it's great to be in the top 10% on a dating app if you're a guy.

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The bottom 90, it's really difficult.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And the bottom half of men on dating apps, we're now one in two relationships begin, get validation that they have absolutely no worth in the dating market.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So lack of economic prospects, a lack of maturity, a society that doesn't seem to have a lot of empathy for them.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then a mating market that validates they don't have a lot of value.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And you see these men go down this downward spiral where they start, and this is where you know, we've really lost them.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They start becoming ultra-nationalists.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They start blaming immigrants.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They start blaming women.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They become prone to conspiracy theory.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In some, they just become really shitty citizens.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And the final thing I would say is that the most profitable, valuable companies in the world have one thing in common.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And that is they're tapping into a lack of regulation and instinctive flaws.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Men are more risk aggressive.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So the fastest growing technology sector right now is gaming, which is the play way of saying gambling.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Men are more risk aggressive.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They like to gamble.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
85% of gamblers are men.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They're four to six times more likely to develop a gambling addiction.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You then put it on a phone and you have Kevin Hart and Charles Barkley telling you that you're smart and you should bet on March Madness.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then you have social media apps or Robin Hood or Metta or YouTube sort of tapping into these instincts, these flawed instincts of men,

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:35,000
where they become prone to conspiracy theory, much more risk aggressive, much more inclined to develop a relationship with you porn as opposed to saying,

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
okay, how do I go out there and develop the skills in the game and the economic and emotional viability to find my own romantic partner?

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They're mistaking Reddit and Discord for friendship.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They're mistaking Robin Hood and Coinbase for making a living.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They're mistaking you porn for establishing a relationship.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And so a lot of these men have had the real world or the motivation to find real relationships replaced with algorithms and screens.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's a low entry, low risk cost of having a reasonable facsimile of life.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And if you're not careful, you wake up a few years later, you don't have those skills and you're depressed.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because getting out and finding a job, getting out, going into work, getting up, putting on a tie, learning how to read the room,

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
learning how to make a woman laugh, establish body language, be persistent, endure rejection.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There's a reason romantic comedies are two hours, not 15 minutes.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This shit is hard and it's humiliating, but that's what real victory in real life looks like.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And I think there's a disproportionate or a small number of young men who are ever going to experience that real joy and that real victory

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because of the low cost, low entry, reasonable facsimile of life that these companies prey on.

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's a pretty dire portrait of the current state of affairs.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The eradication of opportunity, the lack of adequate on-ramps to higher education,

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and the confluence of all these technologies that are conspiring to capture the attention of the young male and channel it in unhealthy ways

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
is going to leave that individual not just depressed but angry and looking for an outlet for that anger.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, there's an upside. If you're in the top 10%, life's never been better.

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We're in a Hunger Games economy. The winner leads a remarkable life and everybody else dies a slow death.

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If you have your shit together as a young man and you have the discipline to get the right certification,

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
the graduates of my class at Stern, I teach the MBA, their average salary is $212,000.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They go on a dating app, they're going to get a ton of attention.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Their opportunities have never been more exceptional.

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Their vacations, their ability to take care of their parents at a young age, their economic opportunity,

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
their chance to make millions is within reach by the time of 30.

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Those opportunities did not exist for our parents, so it's become sort of a winner-take-most environment.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So it's great to be in the top 10%, but I can prove to all of us that 90% of our sons are not in the top 10%.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And when you think about, it goes back to me, like, what is America supposed to be?

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And the reason I got involved here, I was in that bottom 90. I was probably in that bottom 50.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is America about identifying the remarkable or identifying the children of rich people and turning them into billionaires?

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is that what America is supposed to do?

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My view is America is about identifying or giving everyone in the bottom 90 a shot to be in the top 10%.

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's how it was when I grew up. I was unremarkable.

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think that when I look at you, I see somebody, I mean, you're clearly passionate about this.

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is a very mission-based, service-oriented kind of endeavor that you found yourself in.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And you're somebody who's had many successes in different areas of life.

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You have economic independence. You could choose to be doing lots of different things.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And you've chosen through all of the ways that you show up publicly in Prophetic Media and the podcasting, et cetera,

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to really focus your advocacy around this.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it strikes me as very earnest and heartfelt.

204
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, this really is a mission that you're passionate about.

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know that much about you, Rich, but I was that guy, you know?

206
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I didn't have a lot of money. No, no romantic prospects.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But America loved me, right? Free education, remarkable institution, great job,

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
a chance to, you know, get economically viable, a chance to take care of my mother.

209
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I would have been one of those guys today, angry, upset.

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So, I relate.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah. Your mother was an integral figure in all of this.

212
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, look, the reason I'm here with you now, it's easy to credit your grit and your character for your success

213
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and blame the market for your failures.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I get to come here and I get to bomb out of here and go to the Beverly Hills Hotel and have, like, you know,

215
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
do whatever the fuck I want and, you know, have an incredible life

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
because of, one, the generosity and vision of California taxpayers and the Regency University of California

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
who said, our job is to give unremarkable kids remarkable opportunity,

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
being born at the right place at the right time and the unconditional love of my mother, right?

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Single immigrant mother lived and died a secretary.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But, you know, every day told me that I was wonderful and I think that stuck with me.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But yeah, like, I don't know what your relationship was like with your parents,

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but if you think about investing, there's some basics, right?

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You invest a little bit of money, compound interest is just this remarkable thing.

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Most people feel that the singular relationship in their life,

225
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
if they're asked to identify the singular relationship in their life,

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
they usually, more often than not, number one is their mother.

227
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And it's because she made those tiny little investments in you every day,

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
waking you up with a soft voice, worried about you, could hear you get up when you were a kid

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and come in and comfort you every day, just dozens of little investments.

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And, you know, your mom wakes up and you wake up when you're older,

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
regardless of whether you don't get along, maybe you don't even like each other,

232
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but it's a singular relationship.

233
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And, you know, I think a lot about the relationship, how powerful it was for me

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and what was really wonderful about my mom,

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
she had the foresight to get a lot of men involved in my life.

236
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Because if you look at the singular point of failure in a young man's life,

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it's when he loses a male role model.

238
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And it's interesting because we have the second most single parent homes in the world behind Sweden.

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And when we say single parent, 92% of the time, that means it's a single mother.

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And what's interesting is the data shows that the daughters of single mothers have the same outcomes,

241
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
same college attendance, same income, same rates of self-harm.

242
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Boys, once they lose a male role model,

243
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
immediately become dramatically more likely to be incarcerated,

244
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
dramatically less likely to graduate from high school,

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
dramatically more likely to suffer from addiction.

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What it ends up is that while boys are physically stronger,

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
they're emotionally and mentally much weaker.

248
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Just because you say it's really important that a boy have a man involved in his life,

249
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that's in no way diminishing the superheroes that are single mothers.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But I think we have to acknowledge that it is really important that men be involved

251
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and that's the problem with schools now that don't have enough men

252
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because there's an entire generation of young men that go through their lives until they're 25 with absolutely no men involved.

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And if you have kids, you see that occasionally dad just plays a bigger role,

254
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
his physical size, his voice, whatever it might be.

255
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And I'm thinking a lot about masculinity.

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I think the ultimate expression of masculinity is,

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I've got my shit sewed together, I can take care of myself, I can take care of my media family,

258
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can take care of my kids, the people I work with, I pay good taxes.

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But the ultimate expression of masculinity is getting involved in the life of a boy that isn't yours.

260
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And unfortunately, Michael Jackson and Catholic Church have fucked it up for all of us

261
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and created this weird notion that if you're a guy your age and you're super successful,

262
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you might have love to give and you might see a 15-year-old boy that could use your help

263
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and it feels unnatural to get involved in his life.

264
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And that's not true.

265
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, the culture of mentorship has waned to say the least

266
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and I think it's fair to say that America was built on the idea of apprenticeship and mentorship.

267
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But that culture seems to have evaporated.

268
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Like where are the mentors? Where are the sage councils

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and the healthy masculine men who are helping to guide the next generation?

270
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, I got it from coaches, but a lot of kids aren't going to church though.

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They used to get it from the Reverend or the rabbi.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Community-oriented programs have gone away.

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What are the rates of young men in sports?

274
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Is it the way that it was when we were kids?

275
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Are less young men participating in sports?

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And where are the other healthy outlets for the young men in need of mentorship?

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So, sports is like most things.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's still the same level of participation, but unfortunately it's been crowded towards the wealthy.

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Engaging in a sport has become not a luxury item, but pretty close.

280
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Even if you look at the college athletes outside of basketball and football,

281
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
it's disproportionately rich kids because if your kid wants to play lacrosse,

282
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to send them to lacrosse camps or hurdle lacrosse camps

283
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and get them the right training and the right equipment, it's just expensive.

284
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I think sports and after-school programs are being cut,

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
but going to solutions, I think there's a ton of solutions.

286
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So, starting boys a year late in elementary school, they're just less mature.

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The worst thing that happened to me or almost happened to me is my parents wanted me to skip a grade

288
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
because it was back in the space race and if you were offered the opportunity to skip a grade,

289
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that meant you were going to be at work for NASA.

290
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I showed up at UCLA at the age of 17 and I was way too immature to handle the alcohol and the pressure of it all.

291
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Starting a year later, trying to create greater incentives to get more men in primary and secondary,

292
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
high school and elementary school, more vocational programming.

293
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There's just a ton of jobs in the real economy for specialty construction, specialty nursing.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Anyone who's renovating a house knows that a roofer makes really good money, much less a plumber,

295
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and stops shaming those jobs, start elevating them.

296
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I think we have to level up young people in general.

297
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
There's been an enormous transfer of wealth from young people to old people.

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Specifically, people only the age of 40 used to control 19% of the GDP in terms of their wealth.

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's been cut to 9%.

300
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The average 70-year-old is 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago.

301
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The average person under the age of 40 is 24% less wealthy.

302
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And that affects women and men, but it's disproportionately affecting men

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
because men are fairly or unfairly evaluated from a mating perspective based on their economic viability.

304
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The best example of, I think, that depicts this, the greatest innovation in history

305
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
wasn't the iPhone or a semiconductor.

306
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It was the American middle class.

307
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Bought wars, pushed back on fascism, paid an enormous amount of taxes, was innovative,

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
came up with DARPA, came up with vaccines, came up with GPS.

309
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And where it all started was 7 million men returned from World War II,

310
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and they demonstrated excellence in uniform.

311
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And the government said, we're going to make a massive investment in them

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
in terms of the GI Bill and the highway construction bill.

313
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We're going to make jobs, we're going to make economic viability.

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And quite frankly, they were just very attractive.

315
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And they had an easier time finding mating, finding a house, two-car garage,

316
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and it set off the baby boom.

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And it set off a generation of confident, loving kids who were comfortable and said,

318
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
all right, it's time for civil rights.

319
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's time to bring women into the workforce.

320
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's time for women's rights.

321
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And it just set off this kind of post-World War II liberal progressive society,

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
the likes of which we've never seen that type of prosperity.

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But the middle class is an accident.

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It doesn't self-sustain.

325
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The incumbents and people on the far right will claim that the middle class

326
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
is a self-repairing organism.

327
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's not.

328
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's an anomaly.

329
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Middle classes have never existed in society before.

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We figured it out.

331
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But unless you have economically and emotionally viable men,

332
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
you can't have a middle class.

333
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So the question is, how do we level up young men?

334
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And I don't think you can just have affirmative action for men.

335
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I think that's too political.

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But I do think we have to put more money into the pockets of young people

337
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
who have seen a transfer of wealth.

338
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And I'll touch a third rail here.

339
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Every year we transfer one and a half trillion dollars.

340
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The greatest economic transfer in history happens every year from young people

341
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to the wealthiest generation in history, senior citizens.

342
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And it's called social security.

343
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And it just is insane that this group that has consistently seen their wealth

344
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and on an inflation-adjusted basis, their livelihood go down and down and down,

345
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
transfer money to the wealthiest population in the world.

346
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So let's talk more about economics.

347
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Mortgage tax deduction and capital gains are the two biggest deductions in our tax code.

348
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Who makes their money selling stocks and selling assets?

349
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Guys my age.

350
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Who makes their money with sweat?

351
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The guys in this room, the younger guys.

352
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Who owns homes?

353
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Older people.

354
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Who rents?

355
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Younger people.

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I feel like almost every economic policy is nothing but a thinly veiled transfer of wealth

357
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
from the young to the old.

358
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And then the final one, the greatest intergenerational train robbery in history

359
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
was the CARES Act in the transfer of wealth during COVID.

360
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Eighty-five percent of the money flushed into households was saved.

361
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It wasn't spent.

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So five of the seven trillion dollars wasn't spent on food or housing.

363
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It went into the markets, which absolutely sent the asset prices of real estate

364
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and stock markets screaming.

365
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Who owns homes and stocks?

366
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The incumbents and the old.

367
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The reason I'm rich is because in 2008, the government let the economy crash.

368
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It bailed out banks, but it didn't bail out the economy.

369
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I had a little bit of money.

370
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I was coming into my prime income earning years.

371
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So I was able to buy Apple and Amazon and Netflix at seven, four, and 10 bucks.

372
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Right?

373
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

374
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Where the fuck did these guys put their money out?

375
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In Virginia at $900 a share?

376
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Would they buy a home in Agura Hills, a cute ranch home for $2.3 million?

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
When they bailed out me and the incumbents three years ago,

378
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
all they were doing was robbing opportunity from young people.

379
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
When you bail out the boomer who owns a restaurant,

380
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
all you're doing is robbing opportunity from the 26-year-old female graduate

381
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
of the Brooklyn Culinary Academy.

382
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
She's not getting her shot.

383
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The churn and turnover are key to giving young people an opportunity.

384
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So we effectively decided during COVID was a million people dying would be bad,

385
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
but letting the NASDAQ go down and making boomers less rich would be tragic.

386
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It was pure theft.

387
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And who's going to have to pay for this shit?

388
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Not you or me.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Them and their kids.

390
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah.

391
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That doesn't bode well.

392
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And then when you think about that in the context of increasing polarization

393
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and the kind of denigration of our public discourse

394
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and the increase in distrust in institutions matched with the lack of opportunity

395
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and everything that you just outlined, like, does America survive this?

396
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Like, how are we going to get back to a place where we're providing adequate opportunity to young people

397
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and we're in a social contract with our brothers and sisters

398
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
where we agree upon the things that are important to create a healthy culture

399
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
that can survive and flourish as a democratic republic?

400
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Well, I mean, the ground zero, I think, for almost all of our problems

401
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
or the incendiary port on our problems is that for the first time in our nation's history,

402
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a 30-year-old man or woman isn't doing as well as his or her parents were at 30.

403
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's never happened before.

404
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What's so upsetting about it is it's in the face of unprecedented prosperity.

405
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Five minutes post the earnings release of NVIDIA,

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
it adds $240 billion in market capitalization,

407
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but we can't afford the child tax credit.

408
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Child tax credit between $24 billion and $40 billion immediately eliminated poverty

409
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
for 40% of kids in food insecure homes.

410
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like, I didn't even think you could do that with $24 or $40 million.

411
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
We spent $800 billion on our military and I'm not suggesting we should reduce it.

412
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I think it's important.

413
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We have a robust defense department.

414
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But what do you know?

415
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Social security gets a 9% cost of living adjustment increase

416
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and the child tax credit gets stripped out of the infrastructure bill.

417
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So we have elected representatives average age 63.

418
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
D.C. is a cross between the walking dead and the golden girls

419
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and if that sounds ageist, it is ageist.

420
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But here's the thing.

421
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Do they really relate to a 28-year-old who's trying to build a home with kids

422
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and kids don't vote and young people don't vote, but old people vote?

423
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So we're about to see for the first time in our nation's history

424
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
almost 50% of our entire federal budget be allocated towards seniors.

425
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And young people as a result just don't have as much opportunity

426
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and they're not dumb, it pisses them off.

427
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
They look up, they see us, they see the opportunities we had,

428
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
they see how much money is being spent on seniors

429
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and then every day they're reminded that they're failing.

430
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They live in a society where algorithms are constantly telling them

431
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
everyone else is rich, you failed.

432
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If you're not hanging out at the Amman Hotel

433
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
or you're not flying private or you don't have a six-pack

434
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
or you don't have a hot boyfriend or a girlfriend, you failed

435
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and you get these reminders every day.

436
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So I think these righteous movements around Black Lives Matter and Me Too,

437
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
they are righteous movements,

438
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
but every movement now has a ton of incendiary report on it

439
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
because young people are just angry.

440
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Okay, my neighbor works at Google, she's killing it.

441
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm not on the top 1%.

442
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And the thing is, as Americans, our superpowers are optimism,

443
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but we all believe our kid is going to be in that top 1%.

444
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I just think we moved away from America,

445
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
which used to be about giving unremarkable kids

446
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
a remarkable opportunity to, we've decided, okay,

447
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
let's elect a series of people who continue to transfer wealth from young people.

448
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And oh, wait, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates dropped out of college.

449
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That can happen.

450
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, okay, but most young people, if you look at the numbers,

451
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
are having a tough time.

452
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We have the most anxious, depressed generation in history.

453
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The science is in people, hot and cold therapy.

454
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
In other words, using sauna and cold water immersion

455
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
has so many powerful benefits,

456
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
like lowering inflammation, reducing muscle soreness,

457
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
boosting energy, and elevating mood.

458
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But the thing is, DIY ice baths are this colossal hassle

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and basically just impractical, making the whole affair unsustainable,

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
which is a problem solved by the guys at Plunge,

461
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
who pioneered the all-in-one solution,

462
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
this gorgeous, elegant, modern tub that's easy to install indoors or out

463
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
with cooling and filtration built right into it.

464
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So it basically requires almost zero maintenance.

465
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And I use it almost every single day,

466
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
which has greatly impacted my physical health,

467
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and I got to say, vastly improved my mental well-being.

468
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The Plunge team now also offers a beautiful sauna

469
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
for the ultimate hot, cold experience.

470
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This gorgeously designed addition to your space.

471
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I got mine up and running recently,

472
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and I got to say, I can no longer imagine life without it.

473
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It really has been an absolute game changer for my physical health, of course,

474
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
but also all these profound benefits to my mental well-being.

475
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000

478
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
One of the solutions to providing greater opportunity

479
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
is to better democratize access to higher education.

480
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And, you know, one of the things you talk a lot about

481
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
is how we need to be reforming those institutions,

482
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
which have become luxury brands that thrive on scarcity

483
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
as opposed to being public servants

484
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
who are trying to elevate the sort of base-level intelligence

485
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
of the younger generations.

486
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Look, we have a tendency to believe that me and my colleagues

487
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
are somehow more noble than the rest of the population,

488
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and we sit around with our labradors

489
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and our corduroy vests watching PBS

490
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
thinking about how to make the world a better place.

491
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And there's some of that.

492
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I have remarkable colleagues who are good people,

493
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
but we're like everybody else.

494
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I think we wake up, a lot of administrators

495
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and leadership on campus wake up

496
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and ask themselves the same question every day

497
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
when they look in the mirror.

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
How do I increase my compensation

499
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
while reducing my accountability?

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And we found the ultimate strategy.

501
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I called the LVMA strategy.

502
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
When I went to UCLA, the facilities were shitty,

503
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
but 76% got in and it was 400 bucks.

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And what they figured out is, I know,

505
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
keep the admissions rates static and low.

506
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
When the dean announces,

507
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
we rejected 92% of our applicants this year at NYA,

508
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
we stand up and we applaud.

509
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And the alumni love it because their degree goes up in value.

510
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And this same rejectionist LVMA strategy

511
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
has been adopted across the larger economy.

512
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
If you own a home, you get very concerned.

513
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You're in the Malibu Canyon.

514
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I bet any homeowner in the Malibu Canyon

515
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
takes a real interest in new plans for new development,

516
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and they show up and they're very concerned

517
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and come up with thoughtful reasons

518
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
why new developments never get the permits.

519
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And the result is we have a shortage every year

520
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
of somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 million houses we need.

521
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And then you have big companies who weaponize government

522
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and create it harder and harder for small companies to emerge.

523
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So the result is the incumbents see their asset values increase,

524
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
but people can't get into these schools.

525
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Harvard sits on a $53 billion endowment,

526
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
which is the GDP of Costa Rica,

527
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and it's kept its freshman class at 1,500 kids.

528
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
A good Starbucks serves 1,500 people.

529
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
They could admit 15,000 and have no tax,

530
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
absolutely no tax on their resources.

531
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So one of the solutions in my view

532
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
is if you are not growing your freshman enrollment

533
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
faster than population growth,

534
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
you should lose your nonprofit status.

535
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And COVID provided the perfect opportunity

536
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
to reevaluate what you just shared

537
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and create a situation through online education

538
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to broaden the aperture and make it accessible

539
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to so many more people.

540
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And we all know what happened.

541
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That didn't happen.

542
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It didn't.

543
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah.

544
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I speak at a lot of corporations, a lot of big companies,

545
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and they'll say, what can we do?

546
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The first thing a corporation could do to make this better

547
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is to stop fetishizing graduates from elite universities.

548
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
When I went to work for Morgan Stanley,

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
they recruited at Stanford and Berkeley,

550
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and I was the first analyst I hired at UCLA.

551
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
UCLA wasn't good enough for them.

552
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I fell into the trap.

553
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
When I started my company, I fetishized hiring people.

554
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We only hired people from Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA,

555
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and for some reason UVA.

556
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We had people from UVA.

557
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
When you decide that you're only hiring from elite universities,

558
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
you're saying, I'm not interested in single mothers.

559
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're immediately excluding people who don't even have rich parents

560
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
or are freakishly remarkable.

561
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So my recommendation, I was talking to the CEO of Salesforce

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
about this,

563
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
move away from a certification-based hiring strategy

564
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
to a skills-based strategy.

565
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
How do you figure out the testing, and it's expensive and it's hard

566
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to hire really talented young people that based on their skills

567
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
as opposed to their certification?

568
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Because the reason we have entered into this LVMH strategy

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
at elite universities is that corporations love it.

570
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
People think our student is our consumer.

571
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
No, our consumer is our product.

572
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Our consumer is the corporation.

573
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And the corporation is basically

574
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
outsourced screening and hiring to these universities,

575
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
thinking if they're only leading an 8% of their applicants,

576
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
they must be pretty good.

577
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So corporations moving to a certification saying 10%, 20%,

578
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
50% of our applicants.

579
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And I'm not talking about admin jobs.

580
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm talking about professional track jobs.

581
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Are going to be reserved for people based on a skills-based assessment

582
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
where it is certification-blind.

583
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You couldn't get past the front desk without an elite university degree

584
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
at Morgan Stanley when I was there.

585
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Isn't tech a little bit different though?

586
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I feel like they are slightly more progressive in terms of how they hire

587
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
because they are looking at skills,

588
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and it's a bit more untethered from pedigree.

589
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Is that true?

590
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
A little bit, especially when I'm programming,

591
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
but I would argue if you want a job

592
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
in a traditional professional track and met or alphabet,

593
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
it's pretty hard to get in without an elite university degree.

594
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And it's a self-reinforcing mechanism because they're so populated

595
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
with people from amazing universities.

596
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I mean, this goes back to why it's so important to get out of your house

597
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and that you're social.

598
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because there was just a study done at Google,

599
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and a hiring manager says,

600
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
we put out a job opening for a product manager.

601
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We get immediately 200 resumes and we cut it down

602
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
because we don't need more than 200.

603
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We decide to bring in 20 people.

604
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And of the 20 people the hire we make is almost always someone

605
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
who is referred internally.

606
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So if you want a job, you better have a lot of friends.

607
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But I don't know.

608
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I think tech is probably as big an offender.

609
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I think tech founders oftentimes don't have college degrees.

610
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If you're an AI engineer, okay, fine.

611
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You don't need a degree.

612
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But I would argue for the majority of the jobs,

613
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the professional track jobs,

614
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
they still fetishize an elite college degree.

615
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Part of getting young males out of the basement

616
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and into the world and face-to-face with people

617
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
requires some modeling of that healthy behavior.

618
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And I think what's so potent about who you are

619
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and how you show up is that you're this really successful dude,

620
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
but you're also like an alpha guy who's progressive,

621
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
who's ribald at times,

622
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
like you're not afraid to tell a dirty joke,

623
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
you're strong, you're fit,

624
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and you know what you're talking about

625
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
when you're talking about economics and social sciences, etc.

626
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Why aren't there more people like you?

627
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Well, you're being generous.

628
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Let's unpack that.

629
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Do you remember the Presidential Fitness Awards?

630
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Sure.

631
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I was going to figure out a way.

632
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I got a three years in a row,

633
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and then I hit a growth spurt in the eighth grade,

634
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and I didn't get the badge, and it was devastating for me.

635
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And I started doing pull-ups every day

636
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
until I got back to seven pull-ups, which is what I needed.

637
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We have become so politically correct

638
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
that we romanticize obesity.

639
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You're finding your truth.

640
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
No, you're not.

641
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You're finding a fucking ventilator.

642
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I mean, that's not to say that we shouldn't have empathy.

643
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We shouldn't figure out programs

644
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
to give people in food deserts

645
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
the opportunity to eat more healthy,

646
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
but we should be celebrating fitness.

647
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
One of the first things I say to men

648
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
if I coach a young man,

649
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
lean into your strengths as a man.

650
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
We have superior or more dense bone structure,

651
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
a lot more muscle,

652
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and then testosterone gets poured over it.

653
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I think any man under the age of 30

654
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
should be able to walk into any room

655
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and know that if shit got real,

656
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
they could either kill and eat everybody or outrun them.

657
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And it's an amazing feeling.

658
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's going to make you kinder.

659
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Who breaks up fights at bars?

660
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
A big, strong man.

661
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Who is kinder?

662
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Who has an easier time finding mates?

663
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Who wants to protect others?

664
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Who's going to be less depressed,

665
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
make more money?

666
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Fitness and celebrating strength is a wonderful thing.

667
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Especially for men.

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's key.

669
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And then we have become so politically correct

670
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
around potentially offending people.

671
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The people who are the most profane

672
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
used to be the most liberal.

673
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin.

674
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And on the far left, we become such snowflakes

675
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
that anything,

676
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think the thing that hurts people from being elected

677
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
to implement many of the policies I'm promoting

678
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
are that we're seen as humorless.

679
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like, at some point,

680
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
we're going to get to celebrate our differences.

681
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I co-host a podcast with Cara Swisher, who's a lesbian.

682
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I make fun of her sexual orientation.

683
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I make inappropriate jokes.

684
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then there's a pause.

685
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And she laughs.

686
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And she gives everyone else permission to laugh.

687
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I think that's really important.

688
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Social media has created this infrastructure

689
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
where you get guardian of gotcha points

690
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
by if someone says something off color,

691
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
you go after them.

692
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And I think it's awful.

693
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I purposely dial up the profanity.

694
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because I'm like, for God's sakes,

695
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the left needs to take back profanity and vulgarity.

696
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That doesn't mean you're a bad person.

697
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But what you do is also matched with a compassion

698
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and a vulnerability.

699
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Because I think what you just shared

700
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
is also the portal to bad influence on the internet.

701
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Like, make your bed, get fit, eat right,

702
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
show up when you say you're going to show up.

703
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Those are all sound and solid principles.

704
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's good advice.

705
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But too often that, as you were sharing earlier,

706
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
is sort of the beginning of a slide into a darker world.

707
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And those influencers seem to commandeer

708
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
too large of a percentage of the internet

709
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and capture the minds and the fascination

710
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
of these wayward young men who are in search of good influence

711
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and just take what's available,

712
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
what's showing up when they're scrolling on their feet.

713
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Like, why is it that those are the voices

714
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
that rise to the top and a more grounded,

715
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
kind of kinder, more conscientious approach

716
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that you model isn't the one that's rising to the top?

717
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Or why aren't there more people

718
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
who are talking about the warrior mindset

719
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
but from a perspective that the ultimate warrior

720
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
never has to remove their sword from the sheath

721
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and is a protector of those that are weaker

722
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and is a compassionate force for the community?

723
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Well, unfortunately, again, thanks.

724
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I think you're being generous.

725
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We've conflated toxicity with masculinity.

726
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You don't hear the term masculine femininity.

727
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We've spent the last 30 or 40 years

728
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
highlighting the wonderful things about feminine attributes.

729
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's a celebration.

730
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's wonderful.

731
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Women are doing so well.

732
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
More single women own a home than a single man.

733
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's now 60, 40 female to male, college grads,

734
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
enrollees, and it's about to go two to one college grads

735
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
because men drop out.

736
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
In urban areas now in the U.S.,

737
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
women under the age of 30 are making more money than men.

738
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And by the way, that's wonderful.

739
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
We should do nothing to get in the way of that.

740
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But also, trying to find role models

741
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and trying to envision a new aspirational frame

742
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
of masculinity that says,

743
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
masculinity is an amazing thing.

744
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You shouldn't apologize for it.

745
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You should lean into it.

746
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But what does it mean?

747
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And I'm writing a book on masculinity

748
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and I'm trying to figure it out

749
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and quite frankly, it's really challenging.

750
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You know, I think of it as loosely speaking,

751
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
protector, provider, procreator.

752
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
When you think about the jobs associated

753
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
with masculinity, a cop, a fireman,

754
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I was at a hotel in Seattle and a fire alarm went off

755
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and these eight farm people showed up,

756
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
seven men, one woman.

757
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
They didn't ask if there was a fire.

758
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
They didn't ask what was going on.

759
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
They're like, what floor is this?

760
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
They got in the elevator and they went to seventh floor.

761
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That's just it.

762
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
If you look at 9-11, they were like,

763
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
oh, this building's coming down.

764
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They just run into the building.

765
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
They're like, our job is to protect others.

766
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I think that's a great place to start for men,

767
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that real masculinity is you are,

768
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
your job is to protect other people

769
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and it also fits to our instincts.

770
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I think it's called the Carnegie Foundation

771
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
gives out an award every year or awards

772
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
for people who in the moment

773
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
put their own physical safety at risk

774
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
to save someone else they don't know.

775
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's literally pulling people out of a burning car.

776
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What you're talking about is service.

777
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And I think a lot of the messaging around masculinity

778
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
is about individuality.

779
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's about going out and getting yours

780
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and killing the lion and getting the car and the job.

781
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's all about kind of selfish aggrandizement

782
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
in a showy, flashy sort of way to kind of peacock.

783
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But real masculinity is purpose-driven

784
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and service-oriented.

785
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
How are you showing up for other people?

786
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Where I was going with this,

787
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
the 81 awards they gave last year,

788
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
77 were given to men.

789
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Men are more risk aggressive.

790
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Men will rush out into a field of combat

791
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to pull a comrade out who's shot risking their own lives.

792
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Women tend to be more thoughtful.

793
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Women tend to be like, is that a good idea?

794
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And there's a role for both.

795
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And by the way, I'm making a reductive generalization.

796
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Masculinity is a societal construct.

797
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's what we fill it with.

798
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And a lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculinity.

799
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's not the domain of people born as men.

800
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
One of those fire people was a woman.

801
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Well, I go to CrossFit.

802
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I mean, the most impressive people in CrossFit are women.

803
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And we celebrate their strength.

804
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Personally, I'm drawn to men who are more feminine.

805
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
My best friends demonstrate that kind of care,

806
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
that nurturing, that grace.

807
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So I think where it comes off the rails is you say,

808
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
only men can be masculine or people born as men.

809
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
These are wonderful attributes.

810
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What I'm suggesting is that people born as men

811
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
have an easier time leaning into these things.

812
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And we should celebrate them.

813
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I think what you're saying around service is something

814
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I should think about,

815
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
because maybe that's a better frame.

816
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The protector, provider,

817
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the majority of men still are evaluated

818
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
based on their ability to provide economically.

819
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And if we're going to have an honest conversation,

820
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
we have to have an honest conversation.

821
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Three in four women say economic viability

822
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is a key criteria in a mate, a male mate.

823
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Whereas it's less than a quarter of men.

824
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We just don't really care.

825
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It appears.

826
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Well, maybe a wrinkle on service is the idea of contribution.

827
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Because I think self-esteem is bred through contributing.

828
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Are you being productive

829
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
for something that's greater than yourself?

830
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I did ketamine therapy on Monday.

831
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And I was trying to...

832
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Told me more.

833
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh God, have you done it?

834
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
No, I haven't.

835
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
No.

836
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I know some people that have though.

837
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah, so I...

838
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
What led to that?

839
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I call it the Burning Man effect.

840
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It's like, I've always been curious about Burning Man.

841
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But I've always chickened out

842
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and I've always wanted to do ketamine.

843
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And I was just curious about it.

844
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So a friend of mine is an investor in these clinics

845
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and basically set my...

846
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Of my appointment while I was in Austin

847
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and it came up and I went.

848
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
But I was trying to write down the takeaways for me.

849
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And Richard Reeves of Boys and Men fame

850
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
has this great frame.

851
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And that is adding surplus value.

852
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I teach my boys.

853
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm like, you're negative value right now.

854
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Your mom spends a ton of time.

855
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We spend a ton of money on you.

856
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We give you more love than you give us.

857
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You go to school.

858
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
This incredible infrastructure

859
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
is spending time and energy to educate you.

860
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm like, when you become a man

861
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
is when you're doing enough for other people

862
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
that you're adding surplus value.

863
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You're producing more than you're taking.

864
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I love that frame.

865
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
At some point in the service of others

866
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
are you actually giving more than you're taking?

867
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You know, that's...

868
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Our economy is based on that.

869
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Our economy is to take in resources

870
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and then output more than the cost of the resources going in.

871
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I don't know how I thought of the ketamine therapy

872
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
but the only kind of real actionable item I took away from it

873
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
was like my boys kept coming up and I thought

874
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
if I can love my boys more than people have loved me

875
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
if I can push more of that confidence and concern

876
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and love to other people

877
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
that's the real surplus value, right?

878
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And that was a nice framing for me.

879
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That's like I wanted to come out

880
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
with some intentionality around my purpose.

881
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And this is what I took from it is like

882
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I have these vessels that really are open

883
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and sponges of my time, regard, attention and love

884
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and if I think one of my purposes as a man

885
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
is surplus value is how can I do more of that for them

886
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
than was done for me?

887
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I have a very complicated relationship with my father.

888
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
He wasn't very good to me or my mom

889
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
but here's the thing, he was much better to me

890
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
than his dad was to him.

891
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He's checked the box in the universe.

892
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
He's added surplus value

893
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
but I think that's a great frame for men.

894
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Really think about young men,

895
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the resources, the government, your family,

896
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
our society are investing in you

897
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and at what point does it flip

898
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and you're actually adding more value than you're taking

899
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and a lot of men never get there

900
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and grow up thinking that the world is just about giving them shit

901
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and spending time and love on them.

902
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I think that's a great frame for what it means to be a man

903
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I also think that's why qualitatively

904
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
like what you're doing now in this chapter of your life

905
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I suspect and I'm projecting is

906
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
so much more meaningful to you.

907
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yes, it's a for-profit enterprise, profg media

908
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
but in comparison to being an activist,

909
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
investor or an investment banker

910
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
or just an entrepreneur in general

911
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
the meaning behind it, the intentionality, the purpose

912
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
that seems to be very clear to you

913
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
gives it a sense of meaning

914
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
that I would imagine contributes to your happiness

915
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
and your sense of direction.

916
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah, look, it's hugely rewarding.

917
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm not, I don't want to virtue too much.

918
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm a capitalist, I love money, I love making money.

919
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I think there's a huge economic opportunity

920
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and being the white space I feel commercially

921
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
as a marketing professor I can tell you

922
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is I'm a white heterosexual male

923
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that talks openly about his feelings.

924
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
There's a huge white space for that.

925
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
People respond to it, people respond to it.

926
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And so it's a frame, I make good money

927
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
talking about this stuff

928
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but the stuff around

929
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
struggling young men is so rewarding

930
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because it's a conversation that has been unproductive

931
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and by far the people I get the most

932
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
support for for this work are mothers.

933
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
They come up and they say something along the following

934
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I have three kids, two daughters and a son

935
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
one daughter's in Chicago and PR

936
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the other's at Penn

937
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
my son's in the basement vaping and playing video games.

938
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's hugely rewarding

939
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and also quite frankly it just makes me feel good

940
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
it makes me feel strong, it makes me feel masculine

941
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
it makes me feel successful that I can influence other people

942
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and also try and be open and vulnerable

943
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
about my own shortcomings.

944
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I've fucked up so many times

945
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and I continue to disappoint myself.

946
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I have huge imposter syndrome

947
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know if you ever feel like you're about to be found out.

948
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
All the time.

949
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Someone's going to break in right now

950
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I can't even believe you're sitting across from me

951
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and you know like yourself

952
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm an approval junkie

953
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
like you know I want you to like me

954
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you know what I mean like there's

955
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
there's all kinds of layers to that

956
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
like I get all that

957
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
but I think fundamentally

958
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
it's so important

959
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
to model that type of vulnerability

960
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
it's you know I do it in the work that I do

961
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
in the way that you show up

962
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and do that for other people

963
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
is an invitation

964
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and it allows people to understand

965
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
that like being vulnerable isn't a weakness

966
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
it's not kryptonite

967
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
it's actually a superpower

968
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
it's an invitation to let people in

969
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
it's giving permission to other people

970
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
to engage with their emotions

971
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and their feelings

972
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and not treat it like it's a weakness

973
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
or to admit something that you're scared about

974
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
makes you a failure.

975
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's also a fantastic way

976
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
to live a more rewarding life

977
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
because from the age of 29 to 44

978
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I never cried.

979
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I just forgot how.

980
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I didn't cry when my mother died

981
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I didn't cry when I got divorced

982
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I didn't cry when my company went chapter 11

983
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and I was broke at the age of 40

984
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I just forgot how

985
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and what I would advise any man

986
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
is to lean into your emotions

987
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
when you think something's funny

988
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
learn how to laugh out loud

989
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
when you find something inspiring

990
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
you know really lean into God

991
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
this really moves me

992
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
you know when you read something you love

993
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
or you see a visualization

994
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
or you see the sunset

995
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
or you're riding a wave

996
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
like just fucking get into it

997
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and if you feel sad

998
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
don't check back on some weird

999
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
screwed up sense of masculinity

1000
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
really lean in and feel the emotion

1001
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and if you can cry

1002
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
because it informs what's important to you

1003
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
it informs what moves you

1004
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
it informs what you're good at

1005
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
otherwise you're just sort of

1006
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
sleepwalking through life

1007
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
you never really register anything

1008
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and here's the fear

1009
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
you know life is a sense of sensations

1010
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
and reward

1011
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
the fear is when you talk to people at the end

1012
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
my colleague at NYU Adam Alter

1013
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
has done this great work around palliative care

1014
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
you know

1015
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
you're stuck in the past

1016
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I struggle with anger and depression

1017
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm in the past way too much

1018
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I don't forgive myself

1019
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I get very down on myself

1020
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm a lot in the future

1021
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
because I'm successful

1022
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and to be successful you have to be planning

1023
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
and sacrificing for the future

1024
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
but I'm never really here

1025
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
like I'm already thinking about the traffic

1026
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
on the way home

1027
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm already thinking should I stop it in and out

1028
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
in Van Nuys

1029
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I have a friend in Westlake

1030
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm like I'm already kind of like

1031
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
halfway thinking about

1032
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
tonight the people I'm going to be meeting

1033
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I'm thinking about my flight on Saturday

1034
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm thinking I'm just already like in the future

1035
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
and the thing people regret the most

1036
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
you know when they're older

1037
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
they just didn't

1038
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
lean into their relationships

1039
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
they didn't feel emotion

1040
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
and that's the fear

1041
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
my biggest fear

1042
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
as an atheist

1043
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and I'd be curious to get your

1044
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I'll put it back to you

1045
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
my biggest fear is I get at the end

1046
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I mean I believe at the end

1047
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm going to look into my kids life

1048
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
eyes and know that our relationship's coming to an end

1049
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I don't think anyone's going to talk me out of that

1050
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
my fear is I look back and go

1051
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
oh my god what enormous blessings

1052
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
prosperity I would have never imagined

1053
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
people that love me and let me love them immensely

1054
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
but I was never there

1055
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
never really felt any of it

1056
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and one way to put yourself in the moment

1057
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
is to really lean into those emotions

1058
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and not like that

1059
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
people are really understanding

1060
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
people like it

1061
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I'm not suggesting you cry at work

1062
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
there's a time and a place for emotion

1063
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
but people respond to it

1064
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and distinct to the affirmation

1065
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and accolades or reinforcement you get

1066
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
or don't get

1067
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
it informs your life

1068
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
it puts you in the moment

1069
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
because that's my biggest fear

1070
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
as I get to the end

1071
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and it's like this really didn't happen

1072
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
there was a series of past and future

1073
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
but the moments were just very few

1074
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
so how did you make that change

1075
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
to go from the person who couldn't cry

1076
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
to leaning into your emotions

1077
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
was there a pivotal experience?

1078
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
you know the seminal experience for me

1079
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I think that it's very basic stuff

1080
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and again I'm curious

1081
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
you think more about this than I do

1082
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
the real seminal things in my life

1083
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
were my mom dying

1084
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
just the harshness the first time you lose someone

1085
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
have you lost a parent?

1086
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
not yet

1087
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
have you lost anyone close to you?

1088
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I really haven't

1089
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
okay that is just the harshest

1090
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
strangest experience to date

1091
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
when it happens

1092
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the harshness of it

1093
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
the finality of it

1094
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
if we could register

1095
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and really understand what death is

1096
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
at all before it happens

1097
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
we'd be so freaked out

1098
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
that we wouldn't go outside

1099
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
we're purposely wired

1100
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
not to really think a lot about death

1101
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
so when it happens

1102
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
you just can't imagine it

1103
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
it's so brutal

1104
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
for a lot of people

1105
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I think it gives you a sense

1106
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
of the finite nature of life

1107
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
it changes your frame

1108
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
made me more appreciative

1109
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
made me more bold and courageous

1110
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
with my feelings

1111
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
to tell people how I cared about them

1112
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and then the other one

1113
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
is the other side of the life spectrum

1114
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
when my kids were born

1115
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
you know all of a sudden

1116
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
it's no longer about me

1117
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
my whole life

1118
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Monday through Friday was

1119
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
how do I make more money

1120
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
how do I hang out with more fabulous people

1121
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
how do I have more sex with hotter people

1122
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
and then more money

1123
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and then more fabulous

1124
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and then more sex

1125
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and then more relevance

1126
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and more act

1127
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
but it was like the vampire

1128
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
from an Anne Rice movie

1129
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I could never quite be satisfied

1130
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
so it was more

1131
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
fucking more

1132
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I want more

1133
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
and then when I had kids

1134
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
it's kind of cathartic

1135
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
because all of a sudden

1136
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
you're thinking instinctively more

1137
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
about someone else than you

1138
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
it's like

1139
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
my Friday used to be

1140
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
where am I having brunch

1141
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
how do I find more fabulous people

1142
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and things to do

1143
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
now I know what I'm doing

1144
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm going to soccer practice

1145
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and it's boring and hard

1146
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
for a couple years

1147
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and then I find it quite relaxing

1148
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
but having kids

1149
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and thinking about other people

1150
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
has been really cathartic

1151
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and there's just a few moments

1152
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
they don't have that often

1153
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
but they do happen

1154
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'll be on the couch

1155
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
watching a Premier League football game

1156
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
my boys will wander in

1157
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
they kind of instinctively throw

1158
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
their legs on yours

1159
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
like it's just natural

1160
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
the dogs come in

1161
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
you know they laugh at something

1162
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and you have that moment

1163
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
where you're like

1164
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
okay this is it

1165
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I can't imagine anymore

1166
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
this is it

1167
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
it's the only time in my life

1168
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I've ever felt sated

1169
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
ever

1170
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I mean it sounds very trite

1171
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
but death and birth

1172
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
we're kind of the

1173
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
getting you to I think

1174
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
to the next phase

1175
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
how old are your boys

1176
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
13 and 16

1177
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I started late

1178
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
how old are yours

1179
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
two step sons

1180
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
28 and 27

1181
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and a 20 year old daughter

1182
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and a 16 year old daughter

1183
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
oh so you're on the back nine

1184
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
yeah

1185
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
my story's a little bit different though

1186
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
although I haven't suffered

1187
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that kind of loss

1188
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I certainly have the experience

1189
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
of having kids

1190
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and how transformative that is

1191
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
but you know my root to

1192
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
vulnerability and

1193
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
being in constant contact

1194
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
with my emotional state

1195
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
was formed out of

1196
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
difficulties and hardship

1197
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I had a protracted battle

1198
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
with alcoholism

1199
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
that destroyed my life

1200
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I went from somebody who

1201
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
was an insecure quiet kid

1202
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
figured it out

1203
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
by the time I graduated high school

1204
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
top athlete

1205
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
got into all the colleges

1206
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
all the promise in the world

1207
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
all the opportunities

1208
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
that I then squandered

1209
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
until I alienated

1210
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
everybody that I cared about

1211
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
in my life

1212
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and was utterly broken

1213
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and had to build my life

1214
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
back up again

1215
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
from scratch

1216
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and I think that experience

1217
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
was painful as it was

1218
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
really provided me with

1219
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
the tools to reconstruct

1220
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
a new life based upon

1221
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
new principles

1222
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
you're an atheist

1223
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm not

1224
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I was introduced to

1225
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
some spiritual principles

1226
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and tools that are now fundamental

1227
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
to the way that I frame my life

1228
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and live my life

1229
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
you know I owe everything

1230
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
that I now have

1231
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
to the experience of

1232
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
getting sober

1233
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and the community of people

1234
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
that have helped keep me sober

1235
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and who I help keep sober

1236
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and everything has kind of escalated

1237
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
from there

1238
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but fundamentally it's

1239
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
about confronting your own emotions

1240
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and taking inventory for your behavior

1241
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and repairing the damage of your past

1242
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and having a spiritual connection

1243
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
to something greater than yourself

1244
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and then giving it back

1245
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and service to other people

1246
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and I try to do that

1247
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
through the professional work

1248
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
that I do

1249
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
but fundamentally my first priority

1250
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
is to that community

1251
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and to that program

1252
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
was there a moment though

1253
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
where you said okay

1254
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
this is it I gotta get my shit together

1255
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
well there were lots of moments like that

1256
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
that didn't end up changing anything

1257
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
because I wasn't ready

1258
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
the elevator hadn't gone down far enough

1259
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and I wasn't ready to let go

1260
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
so it wasn't until

1261
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
literally almost everything was stripped away from me

1262
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and I had nowhere else to turn

1263
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
because I don't want to change

1264
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
do you like changing

1265
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
do you like trying to let go of bad behavior

1266
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and adopt new habits

1267
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
like it's not fun

1268
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
it's not easy

1269
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and also I love drinking

1270
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
yeah so me too

1271
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
you know probably more than you

1272
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
but I am wired in a certain way

1273
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
where that wasn't going to work out for me

1274
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and it was pretty clear for a pretty long time

1275
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
that I was headed in the wrong direction

1276
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and people tried to intervene

1277
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
but you have to be ready

1278
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
for that change

1279
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
you have to

1280
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I had to suffer

1281
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I had to

1282
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
get to a place of suffering where

1283
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
the fear

1284
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
of change

1285
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
was exceeded by

1286
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
the pain of my current experience

1287
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
because I'm stubborn

1288
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and I'm an alcoholic

1289
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but even in sobriety

1290
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
you know I've weathered

1291
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
financial destitution

1292
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and had other kinds of challenges

1293
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
that have in retrospect

1294
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
looking back provided me with strength

1295
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
and have been

1296
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
foundational

1297
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
and instructive

1298
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and have helped me

1299
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
everything's 20-20 in the rear-view mirror

1300
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
it all makes sense when you look backwards

1301
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but at the time

1302
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
incredibly confusing

1303
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and a lot of fear

1304
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and a lot of insecurity

1305
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
but I think those tools

1306
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and they're all just analogs

1307
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
for the things that you talk about

1308
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
like if you want self-esteem

1309
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
you have to perform a steamable act

1310
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
on behalf of yourself

1311
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
on behalf of other people

1312
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
you have to be true to your word

1313
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and you say you're going to show up

1314
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and it is this relationship with time

1315
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
also that

1316
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
building a life requires

1317
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
small consistent acts taken every single day

1318
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
like there's a compound interest

1319
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
economically but also

1320
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
just in terms of good will

1321
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and trust and all these kind of

1322
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
character qualities that take a long time to build

1323
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and don't happen overnight

1324
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
especially if you've destroyed that trust

1325
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
or you don't feel like you're capable

1326
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
or you don't have the facility

1327
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
for self-love.

1328
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Another question

1329
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Atheism is a source of strength for me

1330
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I like the finite

1331
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
believing that life is finite

1332
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
that helps me to be a little more courageous

1333
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
with my emotions and I don't think this is a dress rehearsal

1334
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
so it's taken

1335
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
fear away from me.

1336
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It gives impressions to the moment.

1337
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And also the people I'm so worried about

1338
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
being shamed by or not

1339
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
approving of me

1340
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
in a hundred years nobody I know

1341
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
or care about what they think of me

1342
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
is going to be around.

1343
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It makes me just feel less insecure

1344
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and more bold but in terms of faith

1345
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
why is it you needed

1346
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and I think it's great but what is it about faith

1347
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
that's given you that kind of strength

1348
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
that you couldn't find elsewhere

1349
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and also what is the role

1350
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
that you have tried to present

1351
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
or how have you tried to present faith

1352
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
to your kids because I'm struggling with it

1353
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
My 13 and 16 year olds have had no introduction

1354
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
of faith and I think faith

1355
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
and spirituality and religion

1356
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I think actually there's some very positive aspects

1357
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
for religion. I've just always been remiss

1358
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
to introduce my kids to it so

1359
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
why is it you feel like you needed this

1360
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
instead of just your own facilities

1361
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
into what's the role that your religion

1362
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
is playing your kids life? Yeah those are great questions

1363
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and challenging to answer I think

1364
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I think the way into

1365
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
responding to that

1366
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
has a lot to do with

1367
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
self-will and a

1368
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
humility of understanding that you're really

1369
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
not in control of very many things

1370
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and a sense that

1371
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
there are more things at play

1372
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
that are outside your ability to comprehend

1373
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
so I was somebody

1374
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I assume much like yourself

1375
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
who was very driven, who was very ambitious

1376
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and every

1377
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
success that I had had as a young person

1378
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
was

1379
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
attributable to my ability to

1380
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
outwork everybody else

1381
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
in the room to show up

1382
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
earlier and stay later

1383
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and bridge the talent deficit gap

1384
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
with a willingness and a capacity

1385
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
in a facility

1386
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
for suffering and pain

1387
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and work.

1388
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That took me to a certain place

1389
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
it got me into Stanford

1390
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
it made me a champion swimmer

1391
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
all of these things

1392
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
but when alcohol entered the picture

1393
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
my self-will

1394
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
was absolutely useless

1395
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
in terms of addressing this problem

1396
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I tried, I tried, I tried

1397
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
every time I tried to

1398
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
use this facility that I had

1399
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
to tackle this problem

1400
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
the problem only got worse

1401
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and the problem wasn't solved

1402
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
until I was willing to surrender

1403
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
that I actually had no control over it

1404
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and that I needed to ask for help

1405
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
not only ask for help

1406
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
but accept that help

1407
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and as somebody who's very self-directed

1408
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
asking for help and receiving help

1409
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
is very confronting prospect

1410
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I had to be broken enough

1411
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
to do that

1412
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
but that process of surrender

1413
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
which is a daily practice

1414
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
of kind of letting go

1415
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
of my own sense of what I should be doing

1416
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
or what I think is in my best interest

1417
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
has actually been the most

1418
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
remunerative

1419
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and fulfilling

1420
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and nurturing

1421
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and gratifying experience that I've had

1422
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and I think with that comes a

1423
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
an opening for awe and wonder

1424
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
of things that perhaps I don't understand

1425
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
because human beings we think that we can

1426
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
understand everything that's happening around us

1427
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and I think there's a lot more going on

1428
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
that perhaps eludes our small brains

1429
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and I find some comfort in that

1430
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
and that doesn't mean that I subscribe

1431
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
to a particular strain of religion

1432
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
other than to say

1433
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that I'm just one person

1434
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and I don't always make the best decisions

1435
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
on my own behalf and I've learned

1436
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
to bring in other people

1437
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and pause when agitated

1438
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and allow others

1439
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
to help guide me

1440
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and

1441
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
talk about the role that you want

1442
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
this has become your podcast all of a sudden

1443
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
we can only do this for so long

1444
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
George Hahn is a close

1445
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
friend, he thinks it's just the world to you

1446
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and he says that you both share

1447
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
a history of addiction

1448
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
that's how he found you

1449
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and what I'll say and this is strange

1450
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
but I've been thinking a lot about the

1451
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
ketamine therapy I did

1452
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
almost a week ago now

1453
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
because the first

1454
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
seven day period I've gone

1455
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I was just thinking about it and it happened actually

1456
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
only in 30 years I haven't had alcohol

1457
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
and it's not because I had some revelation

1458
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
that I was an addict or I needed to stop

1459
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
the literally physical

1460
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
taste or smell of alcohol right now

1461
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
is very unappealing to me

1462
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and that's never happened to me before

1463
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
that's so interesting because I've heard you talk about

1464
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
how you enjoy your cocktails

1465
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm a better version of me a little bit fucked up

1466
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I've gotten more out of alcohol than it's gotten out of me

1467
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I like it and I enjoy it

1468
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I think I'm good at it

1469
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I think I can modulate it

1470
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
but I might have been fooling myself

1471
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
but for some reason

1472
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
the idea of having a beer right now

1473
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
just makes me nauseous

1474
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and I don't know if it's the same

1475
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
impact or effect those GLP-1 drugs have on you

1476
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
where it turns that switch off

1477
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
but I drink a lot

1478
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
and for almost a week now

1479
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't even want to smell alcohol

1480
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
that's fascinating

1481
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
maybe go

1482
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
you know go 30 days

1483
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
see what it's like

1484
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
there's this whole movement

1485
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
around the alcohol-free lifestyle

1486
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
right now I've had a couple people on the show

1487
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
who are advocates in this space

1488
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and there's just a growing

1489
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
population of people

1490
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
who are realizing how much better

1491
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
their life is without it

1492
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
they're not addicts, they're not alcoholics

1493
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
but they like to go out

1494
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
and tie one on on the weekend

1495
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
or whatever it is

1496
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and you reach a certain age also

1497
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
those hangovers

1498
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
stick around a little bit longer

1499
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
when you're out of college

1500
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
you go out and drink a lot

1501
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
next day I have a Diet Coke

1502
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
and a Big Mac and you're fine

1503
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
now I feel as if I've had a battery of chemo

1504
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
it takes me two days to recover

1505
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and all the research I'm making

1506
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
they just keep finding out

1507
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
it's worse and worse for you

1508
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
so I also recognize

1509
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
that the liver just can't process it the way it used to

1510
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I'm trying to tone it down

1511
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I do edibles

1512
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and one of the reasons I started doing edibles

1513
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
is I enjoy the feeling of being high

1514
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
or a little bit intoxicated

1515
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and so I'm trying to tone down alcohol

1516
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
and I've been substituting a little bit

1517
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
with edibles

1518
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
but I'm thinking more about it

1519
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
recognizing that it would be hard for me

1520
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
to maintain the drinking I do

1521
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
and stay healthy at this age

1522
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Well, you got me and George

1523
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
call anytime buddy

1524
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I appreciate that

1525
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
when you want to pick up

1526
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
and Scott is going to have a drink

1527
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
let's talk about the new book a little bit

1528
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
the Algebra of Wealth

1529
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
this is interesting it all kind of starts

1530
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
with this equation that you have

1531
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
around prosperity

1532
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and how to think about

1533
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I mean it's really fundamentally addresses the changing workplace

1534
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
that's kind of happening right now

1535
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
it's this sort of mission statement

1536
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
for young people how to think about

1537
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
money in this changing landscape

1538
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
you've seen the research

1539
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
where five friends who hang out together

1540
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
become more like each other

1541
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
you become the kind of average of your friends

1542
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
the body mass index, the amount of money you make

1543
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
your political party

1544
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
they all begin to converge

1545
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
towards the regression line

1546
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
that's not true of wealth at the end of your life

1547
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
same five people make the exact same amount of money

1548
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the amount of wealth they end up with is highly

1549
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
variant

1550
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and I made a lot of mistakes

1551
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
but I missed a series of just

1552
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
small strategies and behaviors

1553
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
to make sure I was economically secure

1554
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and I think it's really important

1555
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
because I say that America

1556
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
becomes more like itself every day

1557
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
and this isn't a good thing but America is a loving generous place

1558
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
if you have money

1559
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
it's a rapacious violent place if you don't

1560
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
so

1561
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
a series of behaviors

1562
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and approaches and strategies

1563
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
that aren't that hard

1564
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and they require less discipline if you start them early

1565
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
can lead you to economic security

1566
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and so

1567
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
the basic equation is focus

1568
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
find your talent, not your passion

1569
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
at NYU we have these people

1570
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
who come in, we either

1571
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
invite impressive, accomplished people

1572
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
or invite billionaires

1573
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
we've decided billionaires just have insight into life

1574
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and that would end with the same shitty advice

1575
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
follow your passion

1576
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and typically the guy telling you to follow your passion

1577
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
made his billions in iron ore smelting

1578
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and my thing is

1579
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
find your talent, find something you're really good at

1580
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
or you think you have an aptitude for

1581
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
it can't be something you don't like

1582
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
but most young people mistake

1583
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
passion for a hobby

1584
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and I think I'm really into sports

1585
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I want to be a DJ

1586
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
or I want to be a model or in fashion

1587
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
just keep in mind those industries

1588
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
have a 90 plus percent unemployment rate

1589
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and if you're really that talented

1590
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
you'll know at a very early age

1591
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
that you're meant to be the next messy

1592
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
or you are really that talented

1593
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
my advice would be

1594
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
find something you're good at that has a 90 plus percent

1595
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
employment rate

1596
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and what I have found is that

1597
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
jobs are like asset classes

1598
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the more they're invested the more human capital

1599
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
that goes into them the lower the return

1600
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and that there's an inverse return

1601
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
on your career based on

1602
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
how sexy their career is

1603
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
in the example I use as a tax lawyer

1604
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
if you can figure out the discipline

1605
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
to get the certification to be a lawyer

1606
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
you enjoy numbers you understand

1607
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
the selection between taxes and laws

1608
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and how to handle a client

1609
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
if you could be in the top 10%

1610
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
of that you're always going to make a good living

1611
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
and if you could be in the top 1%

1612
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
you'll probably fly private

1613
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and have a much broader selection set of mates

1614
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
than you deserve

1615
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
so your job isn't to figure out what your passion is

1616
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I wanted to be an athlete like you

1617
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I thought you know and the wonderful thing about UCLA

1618
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
is it disabuses you of any notion

1619
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
of being a professional athlete

1620
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I knew athletes I went to school with Troy Aikman

1621
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
you're surrounded by Olympians

1622
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I was literally the worst varsity athlete

1623
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
at UCLA

1624
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
but that was a blessing for me

1625
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
find your talent and then commit the

1626
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
requisite 10,000 hours

1627
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
the endurance, the grit, the maturity

1628
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
to try and become really top 1%

1629
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
in something that has a 90%

1630
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
employment rate

1631
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
not a 90% unemployment rate

1632
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
you want to be an actor

1633
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I don't want to crush your dreams but you better be amazing

1634
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
because of the 180,000

1635
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
success actors in the world that are in the SAG

1636
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
after union

1637
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
87% of them make less than $23,000 a year

1638
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and don't qualify for health insurance

1639
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
so you better be Glenn Close

1640
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
or you better be close to Glenn Close

1641
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
to make a living there

1642
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
whereas other industries that have a 90%

1643
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
employment rate if you're just in the top 10%

1644
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
even the top half

1645
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
you're going to make a good living

1646
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and this is what I can promise you

1647
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
being great at something that pays well

1648
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
lets you take care of your kids

1649
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
comradery

1650
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
people start laughing at your jokes

1651
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
inviting you to speak places

1652
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and anything that does that for you

1653
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
will make you passionate about whatever it is

1654
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
no one grows up thinking

1655
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I'm going to be passionate about tax law

1656
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
but the best tax lawyers I can tell you

1657
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
are really passionate about it

1658
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
because they're good at it

1659
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and it pays off and I'm not saying

1660
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
don't pursue your dreams

1661
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
but have an honest conversation around

1662
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
what it would mean to be in the top of that field

1663
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
because without economic security in this country

1664
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
your life's going to be full of anxiety and disappointment

1665
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
so focus

1666
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
find your talent

1667
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and the next things are pretty straightforward

1668
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
diversity

1669
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
or diversification

1670
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
where I lost a lot of my money was I was always like

1671
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
doubling down on my companies

1672
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and that's okay when you're younger

1673
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
especially if it's your own business

1674
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
can sometimes you have any choice

1675
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
but the moment you have any assets start diversifying

1676
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I've taught at a business school for 20 years

1677
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I've had a lot of professors in the world

1678
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and my some total assessment

1679
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
of the market is no one has any fucking idea

1680
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
but the good news

1681
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
is that the market because of demographic growth

1682
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
because of productivity because of technology

1683
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
as a whole

1684
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
the market is up into the right

1685
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
so the S&P was up 24% last year

1686
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
but only 7 companies were responsible

1687
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
for 70% of those gains

1688
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
were you smart enough to buy NVIDIA?

1689
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I wasn't

1690
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and so unless you were smart enough to pick

1691
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
from the stocks that accelerated

1692
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
you had actually really meddling returns

1693
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
but this is a good news you don't need to be a stock picker

1694
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
buy the entire S&P

1695
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
buy an index a low cost fund

1696
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
it's gone up 11% a year for the last 15 years

1697
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
11% a year when you're young

1698
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
sounds really mediocre

1699
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
but that means

1700
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
every 21 years your

1701
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
money is going up 8 times

1702
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
so diversify

1703
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
the other one is realize

1704
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
the benefit of time

1705
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and our species has a difficult time

1706
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
wrapping their head around time

1707
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
for the majority of our time on this planet

1708
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
we haven't lived past 35

1709
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
so young people just can't imagine

1710
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and I can give them actual real tables

1711
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
there's probably a 90% plus chance

1712
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
they're going to live another 70 maybe even 80 years

1713
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
and the other thing I can guarantee

1714
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
is it's going to go really fast

1715
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I mean I don't know about you that was 30 yesterday

1716
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
it goes really fast

1717
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
so if you push back on our instincts

1718
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
around time

1719
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
so diversification

1720
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
you don't need to be a hero

1721
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and then the really hard part

1722
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
especially for a young person

1723
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
is living a little bit like a stoic

1724
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
saying what other people think of me

1725
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
isn't that important

1726
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I really don't need to order a bottle of grey goose

1727
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
at a club to impress people

1728
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I really don't need

1729
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
a BMW at this age

1730
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I need nice clothes to make me feel good

1731
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
but I don't really need

1732
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
no one is concerned

1733
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
about what you did as you are

1734
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
that's just try and find other means

1735
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
of satisfaction

1736
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and self-esteem

1737
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and really try to gamify savings

1738
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
try and work out a savings muscle

1739
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the muscle you got to develop is a savings muscle

1740
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
gamify it

1741
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
when I was in college you were talking about sports

1742
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I was on the crew team

1743
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
every summer if I didn't save $3,300

1744
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I wasn't re-enrolling at UCLA

1745
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
so I had 12 weeks to make $3,300

1746
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
so we would gamify it

1747
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
together with six other guys who also didn't have any money

1748
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
and every day on a whiteboard we would write down

1749
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
how much and we would gamify it

1750
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I lived on $73 a week

1751
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I ate top ramen, bananas and milk

1752
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and I had $3,300 by the end of summer

1753
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
that savings muscle

1754
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
mostly stuck with me

1755
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I kind of lapsed out of it when I started making money

1756
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and thinking I was a baller

1757
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
but if you can develop that savings muscle

1758
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
a little bit of savings when you are young

1759
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
diversification and then recognizing

1760
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
how fast time will go

1761
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
there are hundreds of thousands

1762
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
of union and government employees

1763
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
that never make more than $100,000

1764
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
but because of four savings plans

1765
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
and a little bit of discipline

1766
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
they retire millionaires

1767
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
and so hope you hit it big with a podcast

1768
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
hope you sell a movie deal

1769
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
hope your company gets acquired

1770
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
if that's great fine

1771
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
but if it doesn't make sure you're going to have

1772
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
a minimum amount of economic viability

1773
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
the good news is I think I know how to get you rich

1774
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
the bad news is the answer is slowly

1775
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
it requires a certain amount of discipline

1776
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
early and this is do

1777
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
as I say not as I do because I always made

1778
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
a lot of money but between

1779
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
divorce, the great financial recession

1780
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and the dot-bomb and always spending a lot of money

1781
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
because I was a baller and at some point

1782
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I was going to make a lot of money I just knew it

1783
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I always increased my spending to my

1784
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
earnings and I ended up at 42

1785
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
when my first kid came marching out of my girlfriend

1786
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I didn't have that much money

1787
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and it was terrifying

1788
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm 42

1789
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
but all of this quote-unquote curb retail success

1790
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
everyone thinks I'm so successful

1791
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to

1792
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
stay in New York and put my kid in private school

1793
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
because I've just ended up with a lot less money

1794
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
that was emasculating

1795
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I was humiliating if I'd just been a little smarter

1796
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
a little bit more disciplined

1797
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I wouldn't have had that anxiety

1798
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
so this is sort of a memo to myself

1799
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
if I could go back in time saying

1800
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
this isn't a book for people who are economically insecure

1801
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and need to cut up their credit cards

1802
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
you know that's Susie Orman

1803
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
who has a job, has some talent

1804
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
knows how to make some money

1805
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
and a series of behavior

1806
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
that will be your base

1807
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and your plan B

1808
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
What is the advice that you would give

1809
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
to somebody who's

1810
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
not a young person

1811
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
who's starting out, who's looking for that type

1812
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
of guidance to set them up for

1813
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
long-term success but is instead

1814
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
somebody who's

1815
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
in midlife and

1816
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
they've had a job for a long time

1817
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
maybe perhaps they own their home, maybe they rent

1818
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
but they wake up at 40

1819
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
and they can pay their bills

1820
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
maybe they're living check to check

1821
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
but they're unfulfilled

1822
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
they're in a job that is

1823
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
soul draining, soul killing

1824
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and they're just not sure how long

1825
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
they can keep doing it

1826
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
there's just a lack of fulfillment and purpose

1827
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and they're looking for a different way

1828
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So first off, I woke up at

1829
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
42 with not a lot of money

1830
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
but 42 is young

1831
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
you don't think it's young at 42

1832
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
but that probably means you're living another 40 maybe 50 years

1833
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
so it's by no means

1834
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
too late to start

1835
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
you might have to adjust your expectations around how much money you're going to end up with

1836
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
but

1837
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
wealth isn't a function of how much you make

1838
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
it's a function of how much you spend and save

1839
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
there's just no getting around it

1840
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
if you have

1841
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
kids and dependents

1842
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
the aspirational thing here would be to say

1843
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Richard

1844
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
take a chance, find your passion

1845
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
go out, do what you want to do, be happy

1846
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
it's easy to say

1847
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
when I'm not paying your rent

1848
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
there's a certain reality

1849
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
in a Catholic

1850
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I'm not sure I have a silver bullet

1851
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
one of the keys is having

1852
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
a great partner

1853
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and saying kids don't talk about this

1854
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
but 70% of divorce filings

1855
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
are by women

1856
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and it's usually economics

1857
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
the guy loses his job

1858
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
it's a sort of mental breakdown

1859
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
you have to have a conversation

1860
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
or maybe just get lucky

1861
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
to make sure that you have a real partner

1862
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
if you're married

1863
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
in the economic livelihood of your house

1864
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
because if you're not happy

1865
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
she's not going to be happy

1866
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
or he's not going to be happy and your kids aren't going to be happy

1867
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I mean I sort of had this conversation

1868
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
with my partner, we were living in New York

1869
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and we had two boys

1870
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and to put them in pre-k

1871
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and for my wife to continue working

1872
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
we had about $100,000 a year

1873
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
because we were narcissists

1874
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and wanted to get into the right schools

1875
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I'm like okay, the tax is in New York

1876
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
that means we need $180,000 in pre-tax income

1877
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
for our kids to go play with blocks

1878
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
we had a three bedroom apartment

1879
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
we needed three bedrooms

1880
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
it was $18,000 a month

1881
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and we could downgrade

1882
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
but in New York living in Manhattan

1883
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
you really can't downgrade that much

1884
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and so what we decided was

1885
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm going to move to Florida

1886
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
we're going to move to Delray Beach

1887
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
where your parents can be involved in our kids lives

1888
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
we have built in childcare

1889
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I'm going to move from $18,000 a month

1890
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
to $5,500 a month

1891
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm going to save 13% a year in taxes

1892
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
and I'm going to start saving a shit ton of money

1893
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
and when I say I mean we

1894
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
we're on board with this

1895
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
she was my partner in it, we're on board with this

1896
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
we're going to start putting away

1897
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
two, three, five, ten grand a month

1898
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and then through no fault of our own

1899
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
the bull market took over

1900
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
everything just sort of took off from there

1901
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
but I would say an open and honest conversation

1902
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
with your partner if you're married

1903
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
if you're single you can take some chances

1904
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and say fuck it I'm starting a podcast

1905
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
or I'm going to go be a scuba instructor

1906
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
or I've always wanted to write

1907
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
you can take those sorts of risks

1908
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
with a family I think it's really difficult

1909
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
and I would say the only thing I would suggest

1910
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
is really be open with your partner

1911
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
about what you're feeling and what you're going through

1912
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
and say is there a lifestyle arbitrage

1913
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
is there a move

1914
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
are there certain sacrifices we can make

1915
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
as a decision together

1916
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
that takes some pressure off of me

1917
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
such that maybe I can start to investigate

1918
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
things that aren't

1919
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
if they're not joyous, are less arduous on you

1920
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
because

1921
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I was talking to this famous

1922
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
actually it's a podcast

1923
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I was talking to Chris Cuomo

1924
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
and he'd just been fired from CNN

1925
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and he was trying to figure out his next thing

1926
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
and he's like I really let my family down

1927
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I really let my family down

1928
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and that's the hardest part about all this

1929
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I'm like dude I don't know your wife

1930
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I don't know your kids and I'm almost entirely certain

1931
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
what they want is for you to be happy

1932
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
you know he's this big handsome

1933
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
larger than life character

1934
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I'm like when you're happy I bet your household

1935
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
just burns bright

1936
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
and when you're not happy I bet it's not a great place to be

1937
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
so stop putting that on

1938
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
your family and you and all that

1939
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I'm like just find something you don't

1940
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
hate and I bet your partner

1941
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
would be so supportive of anything you want

1942
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
because

1943
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
the money is great

1944
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
but if one of you is really unhappy

1945
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
oh gosh

1946
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I mean you're married right

1947
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I mean one of you is unhappy

1948
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
that's rough

1949
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
and if one of your kids is unhappy the whole thing

1950
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
comes crumbling down right

1951
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
so I think it's about partnership

1952
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and being open and honest

1953
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
with someone else but there's just no getting around it

1954
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I don't know how to be economically secure

1955
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
unless you're born wealthy

1956
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
without working really hard

1957
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
from the age of 22 to 42

1958
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I did nothing but work

1959
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
and it doesn't sound aspirational

1960
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
it cost me my hair it cost me my first marriage

1961
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and it was worth it

1962
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I got the currency and skills to get

1963
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
economic security at some point

1964
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I just don't think there's a free lunch

1965
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I find young people are totally unrealistic

1966
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I call it the myth of balance

1967
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I mean you can have it all

1968
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
but you can't have it all at once

1969
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I mean kids I mean my students

1970
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I say how much money do you expect to be making

1971
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
they expect to be in the top 1%

1972
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
of income earning households

1973
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
80% of them by the time they're 30

1974
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and then they talk about balance

1975
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
balance in the context

1976
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
of an expectation

1977
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
they want balance they want to work that hard

1978
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
they want balance they want hobbies

1979
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
they want to spend time with their family

1980
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
and their dogs I'm like okay

1981
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
unless you're born rich I don't know how to do that

1982
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I just I don't know anyone

1983
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
that successful who didn't

1984
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
for a good 10 or 20 years

1985
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
work pretty

1986
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
damn hard maybe Beyoncé but Beyoncé

1987
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
supposed to work 60 hours a week

1988
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
so I'm sure she did

1989
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
yeah there's a there's a certain level

1990
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
of obsession that kind of contravenes

1991
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
all the negativity around

1992
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
hustle culture

1993
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I mean we should all be healthy we should have

1994
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
a healthy relationship with the work that we do

1995
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I'm an all-in guy

1996
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I really don't know how to do it

1997
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
any other way so it's disingenuous

1998
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
to you know kind of talk

1999
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
about that when I'm practicing it differently

2000
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
and I've improved and I'm better now

2001
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
but when you're young

2002
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
to live that

2003
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
stoic lifestyle

2004
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
where you're keeping your overhead as low as possible

2005
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and you can flex

2006
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
some discipline to

2007
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
really go all in on something

2008
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
may sound on paper

2009
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
terrible but it's actually

2010
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
pretty nourishing you can learn a lot

2011
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and I think the skills that you learn

2012
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
about your own capacity and your own potential

2013
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
are as instructive

2014
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and informative as whatever you're learning

2015
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
in the workplace

2016
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
well you were an athlete so I was a Morgan Stanley

2017
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I wasn't as well educated

2018
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't think I was as skilled as my peers

2019
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
it was an analyst class of 73 kids

2020
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
so I decided I wanted to lean into my strengths

2021
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I moved in with my mom I started saving money

2022
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
because I wanted to go to graduate school

2023
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
every week on Tuesday morning I'd go into work

2024
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
at 9 a.m. and I'd stay until Wednesday

2025
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
6 p.m.

2026
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I got no one to go home to

2027
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I don't have a girlfriend

2028
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
my mom's not going to miss me

2029
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
and I'm physically

2030
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
elite right now

2031
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I could do it no problem one cup of coffee

2032
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
maybe grab 15 minutes 30 minutes

2033
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
sleep at 4 in the morning

2034
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
the next morning

2035
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and I sent a signal to my colleagues

2036
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
that I was here to play

2037
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and the blessing of an athlete

2038
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and everyone should try

2039
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
and find this environment

2040
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
is that

2041
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I rode crew at one point when you're rowing

2042
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
the air going down your esophagus feels like fire

2043
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
you can't feel your legs

2044
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
you literally start seeing black spots

2045
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
because you start to pass out you're a swimmer

2046
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I mean you had some of that same

2047
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
and that's at

2048
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
800 meters and every time you make it

2049
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
to 2000

2050
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
to push yourself like that is such an incredible

2051
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
gift to be given the opportunity

2052
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
to really be forced

2053
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
to push yourself as a gift because what you realize is

2054
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
when you get divorced and you think

2055
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I can't handle this anymore I can't handle it

2056
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
your business is failing

2057
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I just fucking can't deal with this

2058
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
or you feel

2059
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
you feel tired what you realize is about the moment

2060
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
you think you're going to give up

2061
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
you're about a third of the way of your limit

2062
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and it builds real incredible confidence

2063
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and grit and endurance

2064
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
and I think those skills really serve

2065
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
people well and other pieces of advice to young people

2066
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
whether it's fitness sports

2067
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
working ridiculously hard

2068
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
finding something super hard

2069
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and really

2070
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
try and test your limits

2071
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
because it gives you a sense of confidence

2072
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
like wow I just had no idea

2073
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
what I was capable of

2074
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and it's a real asset the rest of your life

2075
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
you're starting to smell but the lows are so low

2076
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and starting

2077
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
your own business like oh my god

2078
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I'm so full of shit this isn't working

2079
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm spending so much money

2080
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I'm letting everybody down

2081
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I just can't get so low

2082
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
if you've had the opportunity to really test

2083
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
your emotional physical limits

2084
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
you're like I'm fine

2085
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I'm going to get through this

2086
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
it's absolutely not the limit

2087
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
but I think that's a blessing

2088
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for a young person

2089
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I think in the discussion around

2090
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
people who are unfulfilled

2091
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and in midlife

2092
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
there's also the silver lining

2093
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
that the world is different

2094
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
than it was when you and I graduated

2095
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
from college there are

2096
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
all these new opportunities

2097
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that the internet has afforded us

2098
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
to self-craft

2099
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
different ways to make money

2100
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
or to find meaning and purpose

2101
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
and

2102
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
it's important to understand that

2103
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
against that narrative of like

2104
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
you should just chase your passion

2105
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
that

2106
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
not be translated into this permission

2107
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
to just quit your job especially if you're married

2108
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and you have all these responsibilities

2109
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
you

2110
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
flex that discipline

2111
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and that

2112
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
you know kind of stoic perspective

2113
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
and apply it to your time management

2114
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
like we're all wasting time

2115
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
now more than ever with our phones etc

2116
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
like where is that extra hour

2117
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
or two hours that you can carve out

2118
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
either daily or weekly

2119
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
to explore what it is that gets you excited

2120
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and just

2121
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
kind of begin to explore that

2122
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
not because you're going to quit your job

2123
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
it makes you feel good

2124
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
or it's fulfilling in some way

2125
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
and those threads

2126
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I think there is a spirituality in that

2127
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
if you give that energy

2128
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
stuff starts to show up

2129
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and opportunities present themselves

2130
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
and perhaps at some moment

2131
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
it will be a career path for you

2132
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
or some kind of fulfilling side hustle

2133
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
that you can build into your life

2134
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
but to do it responsibly

2135
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
especially when you have dependence

2136
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I think is important in this culture

2137
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
you know reinvent your life overnight

2138
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
nobody's successful that I know

2139
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
built anything meaningful or successful

2140
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
in the way that it gets

2141
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
portrayed in the media and on social media

2142
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
it takes a long time

2143
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
and you have to be willing to

2144
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
you know, girt yourself

2145
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and to weather that

2146
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
that journey

2147
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
something men are not good at, lean on your friends

2148
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I got financial commitments but I'm looking for something to do

2149
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
right

2150
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
crowdsource some ideas

2151
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
to read the label from inside of the bottle

2152
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
and men always put up this front that

2153
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
my masculinity is tied to

2154
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I should sew together, I'm financially secure

2155
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
and I'm happy and everything's great

2156
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I think developing a circle of friends

2157
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and mentors or just, you know

2158
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
a kitchen cabinet to say

2159
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
you know, I don't like what I'm doing

2160
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I got to still make money

2161
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
what you were saying, I, you know

2162
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
workshop some things, one or two hours

2163
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
spend some time, see if there's money

2164
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and see if you've enjoyed as much as you thought

2165
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
we friends will tell you, by the way, don't quit your day job

2166
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
it's hard to find another job without a job

2167
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
whatever it might be but someone who can just ask you

2168
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
really hard questions

2169
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and also might be able to help you

2170
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
you know what I've been doing, I've been doing this cool thing over here

2171
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
or you know what you would be good at

2172
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I've never in a million years

2173
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
what I thought I'd do in podcasting

2174
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
it's like, I know it

2175
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
it definitely wasn't on the whiteboard

2176
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I didn't know what it was

2177
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
the first podcast I listened to was a podcast

2178
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I was on with Kara Swisher, I'd never listened to a podcast

2179
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
but putting yourself in a position

2180
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
of success, talking to people

2181
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
also

2182
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
people love, if you have good friends

2183
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
they like you asking them for help

2184
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
right, I need to find ways to make more money

2185
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
or I need to find something else

2186
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and you have any, what do you think

2187
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
you have any ideas, what did you do

2188
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and we have this weird sense of masculinity

2189
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
that if you're vulnerable like that

2190
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
you're taking away from their impressiony or something like that

2191
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I think people like being asked for help

2192
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and I mean they're just the weirdest shit

2193
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
you know what I'm talking about, go dark

2194
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
or men's suicide, something like

2195
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
a huge portion of men who commit suicide

2196
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
no one around them had any idea

2197
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
they had no idea they were even struggling

2198
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
have you seen this like this

2199
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
most horrific video showing the last video

2200
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
in pictures of these men

2201
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
and they're usually like, they look happy

2202
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
so your own ability to

2203
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
reach out and ask other people for help

2204
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
finally in the last 10 years

2205
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I now don't make a single business

2206
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
or personal decision of any importance without checking

2207
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
with other people

2208
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I mistook leadership for

2209
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
you have a plan, you come into a room

2210
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
you tell them what you think

2211
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
and then you advocate for your strategy

2212
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and you go, you never ask for people help

2213
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
you never say, I don't know

2214
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I don't know what I'm doing

2215
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I'm like insecure about this, I don't know

2216
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I would never ask anybody for help until

2217
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
really until I was in my 40s

2218
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I wish I'd figured that out earlier

2219
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
why is that so hard

2220
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
you know I'm so indoctrinated

2221
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
it's helped me that

2222
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
it's second nature to

2223
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
talk about what's bothering me

2224
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
or my weaknesses or my failures

2225
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
or to solicit input

2226
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
and to have a board of advisors

2227
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and all kinds of different people that I call for different reasons

2228
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
it's a reflex now

2229
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
but it wasn't always that way I've been doing this for a long time

2230
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
but I've been doing it for so long

2231
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
that I think I've lost touch with

2232
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
why it's so challenging

2233
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
for so many particularly

2234
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
men to raise their hand

2235
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
well I'm seeing a bunch of my fraternity brothers

2236
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
tomorrow night

2237
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
and it'll be a series of controlled boasting

2238
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
yeah my wife calls it super duper

2239
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
give me a shake their hand

2240
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
super oh I'm great you know

2241
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
it's just a front you know it's all fucking

2242
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
horse shit yeah I did this

2243
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
about this stock I'd have my best mother

2244
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
check comes everyone fighting for the check

2245
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
no one would say

2246
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
you know on my kid needs braces can someone else

2247
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I mean no one would ever say that right

2248
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
it's all just a set of like check

2249
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it out right

2250
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I think his men are evaluated based on their economic vitality

2251
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and having their act together

2252
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
that they're just very loath to reach out for help

2253
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I think the blessing

2254
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
of the addiction community

2255
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
or I don't know what you call it the recovery community

2256
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
is they just put that shit aside

2257
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
my sense of that community is

2258
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
first signal you're struggling you reach out to other people

2259
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
first signal and that's a gift

2260
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I would bet a disproportionate number of men

2261
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
never develop that skill women are much better

2262
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
out of than men they lean on their social networks

2263
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I mean

2264
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
we're dealing with a situation right now

2265
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
where men are now 77% of suicides and it's going up

2266
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
we're gonna have 4 to 1

2267
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
male to female suicides

2268
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
how much of that do you think is

2269
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
tied to this loneliness epidemic

2270
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
that we're seeing

2271
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I think loneliness

2272
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
so I'm gonna

2273
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
flex now

2274
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
talking to the Department of Homeland Security about

2275
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
AI

2276
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
but

2277
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
what are the threats of AI

2278
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
is it going sentient

2279
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
is it AI tested

2280
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
misinformation

2281
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
is it self-repairing

2282
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
super weapons

2283
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I think in the short run

2284
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
misinformation AI tested misinformation

2285
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
is a threat if I were Putin I'd be

2286
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
flooding the zone with misinformation

2287
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
making Biden seem a little bit older

2288
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
you know I think that's a

2289
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
short term threat

2290
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
is tapping into

2291
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
men's loneliness

2292
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
one out of seven men

2293
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
don't have a single friend one out of four men

2294
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
can't name a friend

2295
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
the number of men who see their friends every day

2296
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
in high school has been cut in half

2297
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
so they don't see their friends

2298
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
they don't have romantic relationships

2299
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
which serve as great guardrails

2300
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
the only reason I stopped smoking pot every day

2301
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
was my girlfriend said if you don't get your shit together

2302
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I'm gonna stop having sex with you

2303
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
that's a tremendous motivator for a young man

2304
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
if I hadn't had the prospects of a romantic

2305
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
relationship if I didn't have the guardrails of going

2306
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
into the office every day which a lot of men don't

2307
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I just think I would have

2308
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
smoked pot and watched Planet of the Apes all day long

2309
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
right that was a good life for me

2310
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I enjoyed that

2311
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
so so many men

2312
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
have now sequestered from people

2313
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and guardrails to this mix of algorithms

2314
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and screens

2315
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
that they're becoming very lonely

2316
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
and I said the scenario I see is the biggest

2317
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
threat to the homeland and defense

2318
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
is if I were

2319
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
an adversary, a bad actor

2320
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I would identify the two or three million

2321
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
very lonely men who serve

2322
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
in the armed services or at our

2323
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
ports or our critical infrastructure

2324
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and I would develop a very sophisticated

2325
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
network of AI girlfriends

2326
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
that start a relationship with them

2327
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
and

2328
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
make them feel good it can be

2329
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
three months, six months, twelve months

2330
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
send them pictures increasingly erotic

2331
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
you're funny like the movie Her

2332
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and get them more and more involved

2333
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
and all you need

2334
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
0.01% of them would be

2335
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
3,000 of them and at some point

2336
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
you flip it and say

2337
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
you know what real leadership and real men do

2338
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
is they fight against the tyranny

2339
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and what is the tyranny? The tyranny is your own

2340
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
government and when

2341
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
this box comes into the port

2342
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I don't want you to check it

2343
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
or you're on the aircraft carrier strike force

2344
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
off the coast of the Mediterranean

2345
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
turn off this switch don't turn it on turn

2346
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
it off I mean I think

2347
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
the next big threat or soft tissue

2348
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
will be a group of radicalized

2349
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
young men who are susceptible to

2350
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
AI algorithms and are so lonely

2351
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
that they start to engage with AI

2352
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
relationship specifically AI girlfriends

2353
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
that will essentially

2354
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
be in a position to radicalize them

2355
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and instruct them on behavior

2356
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I mean I don't think I don't

2357
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
think we're gonna have Skynet it'll replace

2358
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
jobs but every innovation

2359
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
and technology destroys jobs in the short

2360
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
run and then over the long term it creates

2361
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
more jobs as will AI

2362
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
but there's so many lonely young men

2363
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
you don't have

2364
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
any interaction with people

2365
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and they become very susceptible to

2366
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
anything or any platform

2367
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
or any algorithm

2368
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
giving them a sense of self-worth

2369
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I literally see that as the biggest defense secret

2370
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
no one's gonna take us on

2371
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
kinetically we spend $800 billion

2372
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
no one can attack us I think

2373
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
we're gonna figure out Hamas I think we're gonna figure out

2374
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
over time Russian Ukraine

2375
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I think the threat is within

2376
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I think this lonely young men

2377
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
in concert with AI is a huge

2378
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
threat subtle progressive

2379
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
and pernicious 100%

2380
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
manipulation

2381
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
just moment by moment

2382
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
they get huge reward from it

2383
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
nice relationship

2384
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
they trust each other

2385
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
you start thinking it's real

2386
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and impossible to

2387
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
police

2388
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
that's a really scary thing

2389
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
read this article what do you think

2390
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
now read this one constantly testing

2391
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
in a million different ways

2392
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
see how you get test millions of times

2393
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
over and over every second

2394
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
how you get them further and further

2395
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
down this path towards radicalization

2396
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
that is not a good picture

2397
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
is there an antidote to that

2398
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
getting people out into the real world

2399
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
detached and untethered from their phones

2400
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
relationships

2401
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
everything from church and on profit work

2402
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
to third spaces to athletics to leagues

2403
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
leveling up men

2404
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
so they're more attractive to women

2405
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and they can have an user time getting partnerships

2406
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
putting them in more situations

2407
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
where they develop friendships

2408
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I'm a fan of national service

2409
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
doesn't have the teen depression we have Israel

2410
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
they all serve in the same uniform

2411
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
it gives them a sense of purpose

2412
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
they meet friends they meet mates

2413
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
they meet potential future business founders

2414
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
and co-founders and they have a sense of purpose

2415
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
serving in the agency of something else

2416
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
these kids out of the house we got to get them

2417
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
making friends we got to get them

2418
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
engaging in the messy

2419
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
ugly business of

2420
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
real world and rejection and friendships

2421
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
and I mean we're mammals

2422
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
put an orc in a tank alone

2423
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
see what happens it goes crazy

2424
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and we're raising a generation of men

2425
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
who are going to be increasingly psychotic and crazy

2426
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
that was ugly

2427
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
that is like yeah it's so depressing

2428
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
that was ugly

2429
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
you're a change agent

2430
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
and I'm curious about your thoughts

2431
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
as somebody who's working with young people

2432
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
who's mentoring up close

2433
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
and afar

2434
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
what is the best way

2435
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
to instigate positive change

2436
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
in an individual

2437
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
you probably know more about this than I do

2438
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
what I'll tell you is what I do when I

2439
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
coach a young man

2440
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I try to take on

2441
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
and it's not a lot but I try to take on

2442
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
two young men every six months

2443
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't

2444
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
and what is the differentiator

2445
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
what's the difference between the person who can

2446
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
hear the good information

2447
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
or receive the positive influence

2448
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
and put it into action versus the person who's

2449
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
resistant or struggles

2450
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
well the first thing is they've got to want to do it

2451
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I would say a third of the time they don't show up

2452
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
or they miss it I'm like you're not ready

2453
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
you don't want this your dad told you to do it

2454
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
you know calm when you're serious about it

2455
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
whatever it is you need to hit bottom or I don't know

2456
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
you can't instill willingness

2457
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
so I spent a lot of time thinking about that

2458
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
like how do you make somebody more willing

2459
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
short of performing some kind of

2460
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
inception they have to be

2461
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
in a position of receptivity that's

2462
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
often related to

2463
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
suffering I don't know how to do that

2464
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
they either got to show up serious about

2465
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
and the first thing I do it's a series of very tactical

2466

for all this shit are you going to feel a little bit better about yourself

2509
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
and then third thing is

2510
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
you got to get every day out

2511
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
and be in the agency and company of strangers

2512
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
right

2513
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
church group non-profit

2514
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
voter registration

2515
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
riding class a league

2516
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
go play tennis at the park

2517
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
where they have round robins where you meet

2518
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
whatever it is you have

2519
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
to be in the company of strangers

2520
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and when you're with strangers

2521
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
you got to be supportive and nice and introduce yourself

2522
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
and you're going to be

2523
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
shocked how many nice people you meet out there

2524
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
who like you don't like

2525
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
you whatever it might be but we're going to get fit

2526
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
we're going to make a little bit of money

2527
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
and be around other people

2528
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and that's where we start

2529
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
you know I don't know how to do goals I don't know

2530
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I mean I'm not like that or tracking I'm like

2531
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
like this is about sweat

2532
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
it's about money and the company other people

2533
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
does that advice apply to

2534
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
the parents

2535
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
who have the teen

2536
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
who's in the basement playing video games

2537
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and vaping because I don't know about you Scott

2538
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
but sometimes

2539
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
those people have to hear it

2540
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
from somebody else other than their parent

2541
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
the parent is often challenged

2542
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
and the advice doesn't land in the same way

2543
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
as like

2544
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
your buddy

2545
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
who comes over and is much cooler than you

2546
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
no matter how cool you are

2547
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
my kids

2548
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
especially my 16 year old is more inclined to take advice

2549
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
from you than from me right now

2550
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
yeah and vice versa

2551
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
that's exactly right

2552
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
and that's the way it is

2553
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
and it probably should be that way

2554
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
we have a healthy

2555
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
instinct such that it's easier for us to leave the pack

2556
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
when the time comes to leave the pack

2557
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
where we start thinking our parents are idiots

2558
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that just happens especially with men

2559
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and it's quite friendly it's healthy

2560
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
so there's studies showing that the most

2561
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
impactful thing on your kids

2562
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
your sons is their friends

2563
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
and also your friends' fathers

2564
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
and not what you say

2565
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
but how you model it

2566
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
well I figured out once boys kind of hit 13

2567
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
they don't listen to anything you say the best you can do is model

2568
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I try to get my kids to be

2569
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
you know good manners so I'm really conscious

2570
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
of my table manners when I'm around my boys

2571
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
the first thing when visitors show up

2572
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I run out to the car and I grab their luggage

2573
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
and ask them to help me

2574
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I think you got to model it but there's

2575
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
what you're saying is a proven phenomena

2576
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
boys are much more inclined to listen to their friends

2577
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
and their friends' dads

2578
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
and parents than you

2579
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
so just trying to surround them with good positive role models

2580
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
and also

2581
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
my 16 year old said he loved

2582
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
we have this friend Tom Clark

2583
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I just love Tom he's the coolest guy

2584
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
and immediately I just got a little jealous on the left side

2585
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
and I thought you know we should really

2586
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
vacation with that family because he's a good man

2587
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
he's a good role model he knows my son likes him

2588
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
and he's gonna have

2589
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
an easier time getting through to important things

2590
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
so and also I think with parents

2591
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
when I tell parents when they reach out

2592
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm like forgive yourself

2593
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
what I found is that

2594
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
if you want to believe in nature over nurture

2595
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
just have two kids

2596
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
you know I don't know how yours are

2597
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
the only thing I know about having a second kid

2598
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
is you know it's gonna be totally different

2599
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
yeah you realize

2600
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
they come out who they are

2601
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
and you guide and put the guard rails up

2602
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
and you know try to exert

2603
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
a good influence on them but

2604
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
they pretty much come out

2605
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
in a certain way

2606
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
baked and that's not gonna change

2607
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
well like Michelle Obama said

2608
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
they come to you and the best description I've heard is

2609
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
you're not an engineer

2610
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
you know an engineer the sheep

2611
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
you get to decide where they graze

2612
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
you can point them in a direction

2613
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
you get to decide what they eat

2614
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
but the sheep comes to you

2615
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I mean my 16 year old

2616
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
when he was a kid

2617
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
he would come into my room in the morning

2618
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
and he would say dressed

2619
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
say dad let's make a plan

2620
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I was like okay where are the cameras

2621
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
it was like something out of a hallmark channel

2622
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
easy, nice, sweet

2623
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
my younger one

2624
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
is a terrorist constantly assessing

2625
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
a terror but at the same time

2626
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
it's like owning a stock

2627
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
the lows are lower, volatile stock

2628
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
but the highs are higher

2629
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
he's so funny, so crazy

2630
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
so bold and with his emotions

2631
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
and so loving

2632
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
they're just different people

2633
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
and we just haven't treated him that much

2634
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
differently so when one of them

2635
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
isn't doing well

2636
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
and it's hard to tell your partner this

2637
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
or whatever I tell their parents is

2638
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
forgive yourself because

2639
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
yeah you're important

2640
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
and you can shape stuff but

2641
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
you know the only thing I

2642
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
found with my boys

2643
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
you give them the advice you can

2644
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
you give them the help you can but the only thing that's really fixed

2645
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
any real problems they faced

2646
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
is time

2647
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
and I just see

2648
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
it brings the house down when kids aren't doing well

2649
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
it just brings the house down and it's like

2650
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
the parents don't know what to do they're beside themselves

2651
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
and the first thing I say

2652
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I have a couple friends who are really starting with their kids

2653
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
you're doing your best, you're a good person

2654
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
you're doing your best

2655
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
it's tough

2656
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
when the kid is struggling

2657
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
it's really hard to think about anything else

2658
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
brings the house down

2659
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
you're so good on

2660
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
tech and your kind of predictions

2661
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
and your 10,000 foot view

2662
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
on you know trends

2663
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I would be remiss in not asking

2664
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
a question that I'm personally

2665
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
invested in which is

2666
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
how do you see the current and future

2667
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
state of podcasting

2668
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
what's your sense of what this ecosystem

2669
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
is kind of all about right now

2670
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
and where is it heading

2671
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
in a way that maybe we you know

2672
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
is counterintuitive

2673
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I don't know if it's counterintuitive but

2674
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
podcasting sort of

2675
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
in many ways represents where America has had it

2676
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
in a bit of a negative way in that it's

2677
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
income inequality gone crazy

2678
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
there's 1.7 million podcasts

2679
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I would bet

2680
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
the top 500 do 98% of the

2681
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
and 120% of the profits

2682
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
yeah I would think it might even be

2683
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
more skewed than that

2684
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
well Joe Rogan does 190 million

2685
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
downloads he's number one

2686
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and a really good podcast and the top

2687
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
100 does 2 or 3 million I mean it just

2688
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
drops off a cliff and then

2689
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
you know I would bet 99.9%

2690
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
of podcasts are not self sustaining

2691
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
so

2692
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I mean do as I say not as I do

2693
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
going into podcasting

2694
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
get psychic reward for it use it to market

2695
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
something else but to think you're going to

2696
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
make a living in podcasting just be clear

2697
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
that you better be in the top 0.01%

2698
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
because it's very

2699
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
difficult it's a small business

2700
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
you know a successful

2701
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
podcast as several million in revenue

2702
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
but it's a very profitable

2703
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
business once you get to that point and the thing

2704
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
as a medium it's not only

2705
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
growing but its CPMs are going up

2706
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
because the thing about the medium

2707
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
the medium is the message

2708
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I can tell how someone has been introduced

2709
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
to me based on the way they behave

2710
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
if someone high fives me I know

2711
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
they've seen a video if someone

2712
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
comes up and wants to have or sends me

2713
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
a really long email or they come up

2714
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
and they hold my hands and they look into my eyes

2715
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I know they've read something

2716
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I've written that doesn't resonated

2717
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
when someone comes up to me I'm curious

2718
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
what this happens to you and they start speaking

2719
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
to you as if you know them

2720
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
oh it's a podcast

2721
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
and they'll say often I'm like oh you

2722
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
don't know me because you're in their

2723
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
ears you're physically in their ears

2724
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
typically when they're doing

2725
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
something intimate walking their dog

2726
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
hanging out with their spouse

2727
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
making breakfast they feel like

2728
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
they're your friend and that's the most

2729
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
rewarding thing about podcasting

2730
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
is you just have friends

2731
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
it's a parasocial relationship

2732
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
and it's very intimate and there's a sense

2733
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
of trust and friendship even if it's

2734
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
imagined that is

2735
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
projected onto you so I have that experience

2736
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
a lot and it's very gratifying

2737
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
because it's like you do know me I'm showing up

2738
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
as who I am I think it's fantastic

2739
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
and I think it's it makes it

2740
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
a very unique form

2741
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
of infotainment right

2742
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
it's portable you can do something else

2743
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
while you're doing it and the intimacy

2744
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
and the trust that's built with the host

2745
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I think is

2746
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
is also something that's

2747
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
tremendously unique in the media

2748
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
landscape that I'm not sure

2749
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
the kind of

2750
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
advertising landscape

2751
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
around podcasting has fully

2752
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
like acknowledged or recognized

2753
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
like it's very different like

2754
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
when Tom Broca is delivering the news

2755
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
and then they cut to an ad he's not endorsing

2756
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
the product

2757
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
that ad is running independent of anything that

2758
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
host readovers yeah and so in podcasting

2759
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
when a host says hey listen I found this product

2760
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I think it's great you know and here's why

2761
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
and there's that implicit trust that's been built

2762
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
over many years there's

2763
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
much more value in that that I don't know

2764
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
if it's totally

2765
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
appreciated and I also think

2766
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
at the same time podcasting

2767
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
advertising is tremendously

2768
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
underpriced in terms of marketing

2769
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
spend and it's confusing to me

2770
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
why Fortune 500 companies

2771
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
larger enterprises that have huge

2772
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
marketing budgets continue

2773
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
to deploy those resources on television

2774
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
advertising and all kinds of other

2775
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
nonsense that doesn't convert

2776
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
when they could take a fraction

2777
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
of that and deploy it against

2778
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
podcasts that

2779
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
are host

2780
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
lead and

2781
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
speaking to the specific demographic

2782
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
that that organization is trying to reach

2783
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
just seems like a better plan

2784
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
to me and the companies that get it

2785
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
really get it and they're building amazing

2786
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
companies you know on the shoulders

2787
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
of podcasters but it still

2788
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
feels like it's a niche thing

2789
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
yeah it's look it's a small business

2790
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
right now but it's growing 12%

2791
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
a year there's very few mediums outside

2792
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
of search and social that are growing double digits

2793
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
in a media landscape where people are cutting

2794
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
back media spending

2795
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
so you set up a

2796
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
media company

2797
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
on probably I don't know

2798
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
half a million million two million

2799
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
dollar investment for you to set up

2800
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
a TV show or TV station

2801
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
or a music label

2802
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
or I mean

2803
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
you have been able to set up a media

2804
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
company

2805
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
at a fairly like

2806
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
and you could probably pay as you go

2807
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
and invest as you go yeah I mean I've been doing this for 11 years

2808
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
you know started off

2809
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
yeah I mean I've been doing it a long time

2810
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
and it was just you know me and

2811
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
my step son you know running the whole thing

2812
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
it wasn't like this out of the gate like this

2813
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
just happened very incrementally over time

2814
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
but you have

2815
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
traditionally in media

2816
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
you just couldn't do that

2817
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
you didn't have access you couldn't you couldn't be on ABC

2818
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I mean you just there was like three channels

2819
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
or to start a newspaper

2820
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
or start a magazine took real like took

2821
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
so much money took so much

2822
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
so I do think

2823
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
that if you're really good at what you do

2824
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I write books that shit's hard

2825
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
podcasting

2826
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I mean this is what you've surrounded yourself

2827
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
with smart people and you're creating

2828
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
a thick layer of innovation on top of it

2829
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
but this is just you being you

2830
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
you're a naturally curious guy

2831
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
and you respond authentically

2832
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
and you make money doing that

2833
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
you make money doing that

2834
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000

2835
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000

2837
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
