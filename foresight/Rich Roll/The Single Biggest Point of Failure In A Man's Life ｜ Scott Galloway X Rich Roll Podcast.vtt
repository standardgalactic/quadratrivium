00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
We're raising a generation of men who are going to be increasingly psychotic and crazy.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
That was ugly.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
That is like, yeah, it's so depressing.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
What does healthy masculinity look like?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Masculinity is an amazing thing.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
You shouldn't apologize for it.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
You should lean into it.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
But what does it mean?

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
We've conflated toxicity with masculinity.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
There's so many lonely young men who don't have any interaction with people,

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
very susceptible to anything or any algorithm giving them a sense of self-worth.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
I would have been one of those guys today, angry, upset.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
So I relate.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
My guest today is Scott Galloway.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Scott is a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
He's a best-selling author.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
He's also the host of the Prof. G podcast and a co-host of the Pivot podcast with Kara Swisher.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Masculinity is a societal construct, and a lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculinity.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
It's not the domain of people born as men.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
In urban areas now in the U.S., women under the age of 30 are making more money than men.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
And by the way, that's wonderful.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
We should do nothing to get in the way of that.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Women are, I think, ready for more economically and emotionally viable young men.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
So the question is, how do we level up young men?

01:20.000 --> 01:39.000
Today's episode is brought to you by the awesome organizations that make this show possible.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Scott, thank you for doing this.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
I know it's a schlep to come out here.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I appreciate you making the time.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I've been looking forward to this for a very long time, and there's so much to talk about.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You're such an interesting figure.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
You're at the intersection of business and entrepreneurship advice.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
You're sort of this really smart cultural critic pundit on tech, the reformation of higher education,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and also self-help.

02:04.000 --> 02:15.000
You have this really sagacious facility for counsel that's aimed broadly, but also very specifically this particular lens on young men

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
and this concern that you have for the next generation.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
And I think the sentiment behind it is really that we have a demonstrable problem with males in the next generation,

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
the culture of men, the evolution of men, the growth of men, who they are, where and how they are being guided or not being guided,

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
and how they're being distracted or led astray in a way that's really interfering with their growth and their potential,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
and in turn, like the growth of a healthy society.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, well, first off, thanks for the kind words.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
I think I said when I came in, we went through all the podcasts and vites we have,

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
and I just mentioned your name and before I even finished it, like half my staff, we just went ape shit.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You deeply resonate with a lot of people.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I appreciate that.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, look, this is something that I'm passionate about.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I think the data's overwhelming.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
You know, three times as likely to be addicted, four times as likely to kill themselves as women,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
12 times as likely to be incarcerated, 70% opioid every day.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
You know, we don't have a homeless problem.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
We don't have an opioid problem.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
We don't have an incarceration problem.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
We have a male suicide, homeless and incarceration problem.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
And if any other special interest group were committing suicide at four times the rate of the control group,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
we would talk about it in different terms.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
We would talk about the need for social programs, intervention, empathy.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
But when something like this happens to young men, there's a lack of empathy.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
You hear words like accountability or if they were just more in touch with their emotions.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
And I think that's really gotten in the way of a productive conversation.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
And because there hasn't been a productive conversation and people out there feel and see what's going on,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
some voices have entered into that void that are sort of unproductive voices.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
And sometimes that kind of this pro-man rhetoric oftentimes is just suddenly veiled misogyny or lack of empathy.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Or kind of what I'll call the manosphere.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
It starts off fine.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
It's the action-oriented, be fit, take control.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Then it goes to really weird places.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
It treats women as property or talks about immigrants taking your job or just sign up for my crypto university.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It just goes to weird places.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
It's also been a bit of a third rail issue to raise the peril of the wayward young man in a world in which

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
the conversation around elevating certain sectors of culture and society is about women and people of color.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
And yet the quote that I've heard you often repeat is,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
the most dangerous person in the world is a man that is broken and alone.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
If you look globally, the most unstable violent societies in the world all have one thing in common.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
They have a disproportionate amount of young men with a lack of economic or romantic prospects.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
What do we do?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
We send them off to war.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
If they don't have economic prospects internally, they'll overthrow the government.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
So we find conflict and we send them off to war.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
Also, this younger generation of men is paying for the unfair advantage you and I had growing up.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
I was born in Los Angeles or Southern California in 1964.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I hit the lottery.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
You know, being born a white heterosexual male just had huge advantage in California.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Myself as well.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I was born in 66.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
You went to UCLA.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
I went to Stanford.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm the beneficiary of, you know, an incredible education and privilege.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
And now that, you know, access to what you and I had access to is all the more remote these days.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Like, what is going on?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Like, how did we get to this place?

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
What are the tectonic plates that have led us to this situation that we find ourselves in?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
So just to make the point around accessibility, I don't know the numbers in Stanford,

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
but when I applied to UCLA in 1982, the acceptance rate was 76% and it cost $1,200 a year.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And I had to apply twice and I got in.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
The acceptance rate this year will be 9% and it's $34,000.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
So it's just inaccessible to anyone who's not remarkable, remarkable or rich.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
So how did we get here?

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
I think there's been a variety of things, confluence of factors that have all collided around young men.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
One, there's just a lack of empathy.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
People see it as a zero-sum game where if you feel empathy for men, it must mean that you are anti-women.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And so there's a lack of empathy and what I call zero-sum gaming.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You know, civil rights didn't hurt white people.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It helped them.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Gay marriage doesn't hurt heteronormative marriage.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
It enhances it.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
So to talk about empathy for young men is in no way and should in no way be seen as anti-women.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
I think the group that wants more viable young men, first and foremost mothers, that's who I hear from the most,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
who see what's going on with their daughters and the difference between their daughters and their sons.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
And also women.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Women are, I think, ready for more economically and emotionally viable young men.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
Women are dating older and older because they're having trouble finding what they would perceive as viable young men.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
So a few things.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
One, just biological.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Men's prefrontal cortex matures later.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
They just don't have the same executive function or adult in the room.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
They're less mature, literally less mature.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Two, we have an education system that is biased against them.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
If you talk about the behaviors we reward in school, you're essentially going to describe a girl.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Be organized.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Be a pleaser.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Sit still.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You also have an education industrial complex.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
92% of kindergarten teachers are women.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
There's more female per capita fighter pilots than male kindergarten teachers.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
It's about 70, 80% K through 6 and about 60, 70% in high school.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
And naturally you're going to empathize with a little version of you.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
So I just don't think there's the same level of empathy for young men.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
We've also done away with metal shop, auto shop, wood shop.

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
So the guy who's not cut out for college, who doesn't sit still, who's not academically focused as fewer and fewer on ramps into a middle class lifestyle.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And then these guys get into the workforce.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
There's fewer middle class trades jobs.

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
In America, parents have done a really good job of convincing themselves they've failed as a parent if their kid doesn't end up at Stanford or UCLA.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So there's a lot of rage and shame in the household.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
There's not visible on ramps into a healthy middle class life.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
3% of LinkedIn profiles in America say apprentice.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
It's 11% in the UK and Germany.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
50% of Germans have some sort of vocational certification.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
That's not true here.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
It's kind of become this you either get to Stanford or UCLA or you and your parents have failed.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
And then a lot of dynamics dating apps where you have two, three to one men to women.

08:41.000 --> 08:52.000
And you also have this effect where because everyone has access to everyone, not everyone, but women who have a much finer filter are all drawn to the kind of what I call same guy.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
So you have 50 men on Tinder, 50 women, 46 of those women will show all of their attention and interest to just four guys.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
So it's great to be in the top 10% on a dating app if you're a guy.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
The bottom 90, it's really difficult.

09:04.000 --> 09:13.000
And the bottom half of men on dating apps, we're now one in two relationships begin, get validation that they have absolutely no worth in the dating market.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
So lack of economic prospects, a lack of maturity, a society that doesn't seem to have a lot of empathy for them.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
And then a mating market that validates they don't have a lot of value.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
And you see these men go down this downward spiral where they start, and this is where you know, we've really lost them.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
They start becoming ultra-nationalists.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
They start blaming immigrants.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
They start blaming women.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
They become prone to conspiracy theory.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
In some, they just become really shitty citizens.

09:39.000 --> 09:47.000
And the final thing I would say is that the most profitable, valuable companies in the world have one thing in common.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
And that is they're tapping into a lack of regulation and instinctive flaws.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Men are more risk aggressive.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
So the fastest growing technology sector right now is gaming, which is the play way of saying gambling.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Men are more risk aggressive.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
They like to gamble.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
85% of gamblers are men.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
They're four to six times more likely to develop a gambling addiction.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
You then put it on a phone and you have Kevin Hart and Charles Barkley telling you that you're smart and you should bet on March Madness.

10:13.000 --> 10:25.000
And then you have social media apps or Robin Hood or Metta or YouTube sort of tapping into these instincts, these flawed instincts of men,

10:25.000 --> 10:35.000
where they become prone to conspiracy theory, much more risk aggressive, much more inclined to develop a relationship with you porn as opposed to saying,

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
okay, how do I go out there and develop the skills in the game and the economic and emotional viability to find my own romantic partner?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
They're mistaking Reddit and Discord for friendship.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
They're mistaking Robin Hood and Coinbase for making a living.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
They're mistaking you porn for establishing a relationship.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
And so a lot of these men have had the real world or the motivation to find real relationships replaced with algorithms and screens.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
It's a low entry, low risk cost of having a reasonable facsimile of life.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
And if you're not careful, you wake up a few years later, you don't have those skills and you're depressed.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
Because getting out and finding a job, getting out, going into work, getting up, putting on a tie, learning how to read the room,

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
learning how to make a woman laugh, establish body language, be persistent, endure rejection.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
There's a reason romantic comedies are two hours, not 15 minutes.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
This shit is hard and it's humiliating, but that's what real victory in real life looks like.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
And I think there's a disproportionate or a small number of young men who are ever going to experience that real joy and that real victory

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
because of the low cost, low entry, reasonable facsimile of life that these companies prey on.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
That's a pretty dire portrait of the current state of affairs.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
The eradication of opportunity, the lack of adequate on-ramps to higher education,

12:02.000 --> 12:13.000
and the confluence of all these technologies that are conspiring to capture the attention of the young male and channel it in unhealthy ways

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
is going to leave that individual not just depressed but angry and looking for an outlet for that anger.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, there's an upside. If you're in the top 10%, life's never been better.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
We're in a Hunger Games economy. The winner leads a remarkable life and everybody else dies a slow death.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
If you have your shit together as a young man and you have the discipline to get the right certification,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
the graduates of my class at Stern, I teach the MBA, their average salary is $212,000.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
They go on a dating app, they're going to get a ton of attention.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Their opportunities have never been more exceptional.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
Their vacations, their ability to take care of their parents at a young age, their economic opportunity,

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
their chance to make millions is within reach by the time of 30.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
Those opportunities did not exist for our parents, so it's become sort of a winner-take-most environment.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
So it's great to be in the top 10%, but I can prove to all of us that 90% of our sons are not in the top 10%.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
And when you think about, it goes back to me, like, what is America supposed to be?

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
And the reason I got involved here, I was in that bottom 90. I was probably in that bottom 50.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
Is America about identifying the remarkable or identifying the children of rich people and turning them into billionaires?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Is that what America is supposed to do?

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
My view is America is about identifying or giving everyone in the bottom 90 a shot to be in the top 10%.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
That's how it was when I grew up. I was unremarkable.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
I think that when I look at you, I see somebody, I mean, you're clearly passionate about this.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
This is a very mission-based, service-oriented kind of endeavor that you found yourself in.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And you're somebody who's had many successes in different areas of life.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
You have economic independence. You could choose to be doing lots of different things.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
And you've chosen through all of the ways that you show up publicly in Prophetic Media and the podcasting, et cetera,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
to really focus your advocacy around this.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
And it strikes me as very earnest and heartfelt.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Like, this really is a mission that you're passionate about.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't know that much about you, Rich, but I was that guy, you know?

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
I didn't have a lot of money. No, no romantic prospects.

14:23.000 --> 14:36.000
But America loved me, right? Free education, remarkable institution, great job,

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
a chance to, you know, get economically viable, a chance to take care of my mother.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
I would have been one of those guys today, angry, upset.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
So, I relate.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah. Your mother was an integral figure in all of this.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Yeah, look, the reason I'm here with you now, it's easy to credit your grit and your character for your success

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and blame the market for your failures.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
I get to come here and I get to bomb out of here and go to the Beverly Hills Hotel and have, like, you know,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
do whatever the fuck I want and, you know, have an incredible life

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
because of, one, the generosity and vision of California taxpayers and the Regency University of California

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
who said, our job is to give unremarkable kids remarkable opportunity,

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
being born at the right place at the right time and the unconditional love of my mother, right?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Single immigrant mother lived and died a secretary.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
But, you know, every day told me that I was wonderful and I think that stuck with me.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
But yeah, like, I don't know what your relationship was like with your parents,

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
but if you think about investing, there's some basics, right?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
You invest a little bit of money, compound interest is just this remarkable thing.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Most people feel that the singular relationship in their life,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
if they're asked to identify the singular relationship in their life,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
they usually, more often than not, number one is their mother.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
And it's because she made those tiny little investments in you every day,

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
waking you up with a soft voice, worried about you, could hear you get up when you were a kid

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
and come in and comfort you every day, just dozens of little investments.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And, you know, your mom wakes up and you wake up when you're older,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
regardless of whether you don't get along, maybe you don't even like each other,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
but it's a singular relationship.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
And, you know, I think a lot about the relationship, how powerful it was for me

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and what was really wonderful about my mom,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
she had the foresight to get a lot of men involved in my life.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Because if you look at the singular point of failure in a young man's life,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
it's when he loses a male role model.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
And it's interesting because we have the second most single parent homes in the world behind Sweden.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
And when we say single parent, 92% of the time, that means it's a single mother.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
And what's interesting is the data shows that the daughters of single mothers have the same outcomes,

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
same college attendance, same income, same rates of self-harm.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Boys, once they lose a male role model,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
immediately become dramatically more likely to be incarcerated,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
dramatically less likely to graduate from high school,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
dramatically more likely to suffer from addiction.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
What it ends up is that while boys are physically stronger,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
they're emotionally and mentally much weaker.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Just because you say it's really important that a boy have a man involved in his life,

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
that's in no way diminishing the superheroes that are single mothers.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
But I think we have to acknowledge that it is really important that men be involved

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and that's the problem with schools now that don't have enough men

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
because there's an entire generation of young men that go through their lives until they're 25 with absolutely no men involved.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
And if you have kids, you see that occasionally dad just plays a bigger role,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
his physical size, his voice, whatever it might be.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
And I'm thinking a lot about masculinity.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I think the ultimate expression of masculinity is,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
I've got my shit sewed together, I can take care of myself, I can take care of my media family,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
I can take care of my kids, the people I work with, I pay good taxes.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
But the ultimate expression of masculinity is getting involved in the life of a boy that isn't yours.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
And unfortunately, Michael Jackson and Catholic Church have fucked it up for all of us

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
and created this weird notion that if you're a guy your age and you're super successful,

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
you might have love to give and you might see a 15-year-old boy that could use your help

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
and it feels unnatural to get involved in his life.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
And that's not true.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, the culture of mentorship has waned to say the least

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
and I think it's fair to say that America was built on the idea of apprenticeship and mentorship.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
But that culture seems to have evaporated.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Like where are the mentors? Where are the sage councils

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
and the healthy masculine men who are helping to guide the next generation?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Well, I got it from coaches, but a lot of kids aren't going to church though.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
They used to get it from the Reverend or the rabbi.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
Community-oriented programs have gone away.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
What are the rates of young men in sports?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Is it the way that it was when we were kids?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Are less young men participating in sports?

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
And where are the other healthy outlets for the young men in need of mentorship?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
So, sports is like most things.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
There's still the same level of participation, but unfortunately it's been crowded towards the wealthy.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Engaging in a sport has become not a luxury item, but pretty close.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Even if you look at the college athletes outside of basketball and football,

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
it's disproportionately rich kids because if your kid wants to play lacrosse,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
to send them to lacrosse camps or hurdle lacrosse camps

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
and get them the right training and the right equipment, it's just expensive.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
But I think sports and after-school programs are being cut,

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
but going to solutions, I think there's a ton of solutions.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
So, starting boys a year late in elementary school, they're just less mature.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
The worst thing that happened to me or almost happened to me is my parents wanted me to skip a grade

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
because it was back in the space race and if you were offered the opportunity to skip a grade,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
that meant you were going to be at work for NASA.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
I showed up at UCLA at the age of 17 and I was way too immature to handle the alcohol and the pressure of it all.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
Starting a year later, trying to create greater incentives to get more men in primary and secondary,

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
high school and elementary school, more vocational programming.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
There's just a ton of jobs in the real economy for specialty construction, specialty nursing.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Anyone who's renovating a house knows that a roofer makes really good money, much less a plumber,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
and stops shaming those jobs, start elevating them.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I think we have to level up young people in general.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
There's been an enormous transfer of wealth from young people to old people.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
Specifically, people only the age of 40 used to control 19% of the GDP in terms of their wealth.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
It's been cut to 9%.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
The average 70-year-old is 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
The average person under the age of 40 is 24% less wealthy.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
And that affects women and men, but it's disproportionately affecting men

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
because men are fairly or unfairly evaluated from a mating perspective based on their economic viability.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
The best example of, I think, that depicts this, the greatest innovation in history

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
wasn't the iPhone or a semiconductor.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
It was the American middle class.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Bought wars, pushed back on fascism, paid an enormous amount of taxes, was innovative,

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
came up with DARPA, came up with vaccines, came up with GPS.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
And where it all started was 7 million men returned from World War II,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
and they demonstrated excellence in uniform.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And the government said, we're going to make a massive investment in them

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
in terms of the GI Bill and the highway construction bill.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We're going to make jobs, we're going to make economic viability.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And quite frankly, they were just very attractive.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
And they had an easier time finding mating, finding a house, two-car garage,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
and it set off the baby boom.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
And it set off a generation of confident, loving kids who were comfortable and said,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
all right, it's time for civil rights.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's time to bring women into the workforce.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's time for women's rights.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
And it just set off this kind of post-World War II liberal progressive society,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
the likes of which we've never seen that type of prosperity.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But the middle class is an accident.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
It doesn't self-sustain.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
The incumbents and people on the far right will claim that the middle class

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
is a self-repairing organism.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It's not.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
It's an anomaly.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Middle classes have never existed in society before.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
We figured it out.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
But unless you have economically and emotionally viable men,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
you can't have a middle class.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
So the question is, how do we level up young men?

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
And I don't think you can just have affirmative action for men.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I think that's too political.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
But I do think we have to put more money into the pockets of young people

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
who have seen a transfer of wealth.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
And I'll touch a third rail here.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Every year we transfer one and a half trillion dollars.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
The greatest economic transfer in history happens every year from young people

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
to the wealthiest generation in history, senior citizens.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And it's called social security.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
And it just is insane that this group that has consistently seen their wealth

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
and on an inflation-adjusted basis, their livelihood go down and down and down,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
transfer money to the wealthiest population in the world.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So let's talk more about economics.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Mortgage tax deduction and capital gains are the two biggest deductions in our tax code.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Who makes their money selling stocks and selling assets?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Guys my age.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Who makes their money with sweat?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
The guys in this room, the younger guys.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Who owns homes?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Older people.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Who rents?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Younger people.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
I feel like almost every economic policy is nothing but a thinly veiled transfer of wealth

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
from the young to the old.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
And then the final one, the greatest intergenerational train robbery in history

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
was the CARES Act in the transfer of wealth during COVID.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Eighty-five percent of the money flushed into households was saved.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It wasn't spent.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
So five of the seven trillion dollars wasn't spent on food or housing.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
It went into the markets, which absolutely sent the asset prices of real estate

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
and stock markets screaming.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Who owns homes and stocks?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
The incumbents and the old.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
The reason I'm rich is because in 2008, the government let the economy crash.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It bailed out banks, but it didn't bail out the economy.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I had a little bit of money.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I was coming into my prime income earning years.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
So I was able to buy Apple and Amazon and Netflix at seven, four, and 10 bucks.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Right?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Where the fuck did these guys put their money out?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
In Virginia at $900 a share?

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
Would they buy a home in Agura Hills, a cute ranch home for $2.3 million?

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
When they bailed out me and the incumbents three years ago,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
all they were doing was robbing opportunity from young people.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
When you bail out the boomer who owns a restaurant,

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
all you're doing is robbing opportunity from the 26-year-old female graduate

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
of the Brooklyn Culinary Academy.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
She's not getting her shot.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
The churn and turnover are key to giving young people an opportunity.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
So we effectively decided during COVID was a million people dying would be bad,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
but letting the NASDAQ go down and making boomers less rich would be tragic.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
It was pure theft.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And who's going to have to pay for this shit?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Not you or me.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Them and their kids.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
That doesn't bode well.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
And then when you think about that in the context of increasing polarization

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
and the kind of denigration of our public discourse

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
and the increase in distrust in institutions matched with the lack of opportunity

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
and everything that you just outlined, like, does America survive this?

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
Like, how are we going to get back to a place where we're providing adequate opportunity to young people

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
and we're in a social contract with our brothers and sisters

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
where we agree upon the things that are important to create a healthy culture

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
that can survive and flourish as a democratic republic?

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Well, I mean, the ground zero, I think, for almost all of our problems

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
or the incendiary port on our problems is that for the first time in our nation's history,

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
a 30-year-old man or woman isn't doing as well as his or her parents were at 30.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
That's never happened before.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
What's so upsetting about it is it's in the face of unprecedented prosperity.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Five minutes post the earnings release of NVIDIA,

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
it adds $240 billion in market capitalization,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
but we can't afford the child tax credit.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
Child tax credit between $24 billion and $40 billion immediately eliminated poverty

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
for 40% of kids in food insecure homes.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Like, I didn't even think you could do that with $24 or $40 million.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
We spent $800 billion on our military and I'm not suggesting we should reduce it.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I think it's important.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
We have a robust defense department.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
But what do you know?

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Social security gets a 9% cost of living adjustment increase

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
and the child tax credit gets stripped out of the infrastructure bill.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
So we have elected representatives average age 63.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
D.C. is a cross between the walking dead and the golden girls

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
and if that sounds ageist, it is ageist.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
But here's the thing.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Do they really relate to a 28-year-old who's trying to build a home with kids

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
and kids don't vote and young people don't vote, but old people vote?

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
So we're about to see for the first time in our nation's history

27:10.000 --> 27:17.000
almost 50% of our entire federal budget be allocated towards seniors.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
And young people as a result just don't have as much opportunity

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
and they're not dumb, it pisses them off.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
They look up, they see us, they see the opportunities we had,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
they see how much money is being spent on seniors

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
and then every day they're reminded that they're failing.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
They live in a society where algorithms are constantly telling them

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
everyone else is rich, you failed.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
If you're not hanging out at the Amman Hotel

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
or you're not flying private or you don't have a six-pack

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
or you don't have a hot boyfriend or a girlfriend, you failed

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
and you get these reminders every day.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
So I think these righteous movements around Black Lives Matter and Me Too,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
they are righteous movements,

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
but every movement now has a ton of incendiary report on it

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
because young people are just angry.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Okay, my neighbor works at Google, she's killing it.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm not on the top 1%.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
And the thing is, as Americans, our superpowers are optimism,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
but we all believe our kid is going to be in that top 1%.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And I just think we moved away from America,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
which used to be about giving unremarkable kids

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
a remarkable opportunity to, we've decided, okay,

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
let's elect a series of people who continue to transfer wealth from young people.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
And oh, wait, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates dropped out of college.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
That can happen.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Well, okay, but most young people, if you look at the numbers,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
are having a tough time.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
We have the most anxious, depressed generation in history.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
The science is in people, hot and cold therapy.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
In other words, using sauna and cold water immersion

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
has so many powerful benefits,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
like lowering inflammation, reducing muscle soreness,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
boosting energy, and elevating mood.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
But the thing is, DIY ice baths are this colossal hassle

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
and basically just impractical, making the whole affair unsustainable,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
which is a problem solved by the guys at Plunge,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
who pioneered the all-in-one solution,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
this gorgeous, elegant, modern tub that's easy to install indoors or out

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
with cooling and filtration built right into it.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
So it basically requires almost zero maintenance.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And I use it almost every single day,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
which has greatly impacted my physical health,

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
and I got to say, vastly improved my mental well-being.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
The Plunge team now also offers a beautiful sauna

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
for the ultimate hot, cold experience.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
This gorgeously designed addition to your space.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I got mine up and running recently,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
and I got to say, I can no longer imagine life without it.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
It really has been an absolute game changer for my physical health, of course,

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
but also all these profound benefits to my mental well-being.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
To learn more and get your own cold plunge tub or sauna,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
and use code richroll to get $150 off your purchase.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
One of the solutions to providing greater opportunity

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
is to better democratize access to higher education.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
And, you know, one of the things you talk a lot about

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
is how we need to be reforming those institutions,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
which have become luxury brands that thrive on scarcity

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
as opposed to being public servants

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
who are trying to elevate the sort of base-level intelligence

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
of the younger generations.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Look, we have a tendency to believe that me and my colleagues

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
are somehow more noble than the rest of the population,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
and we sit around with our labradors

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
and our corduroy vests watching PBS

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
thinking about how to make the world a better place.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And there's some of that.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
I have remarkable colleagues who are good people,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
but we're like everybody else.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And I think we wake up, a lot of administrators

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
and leadership on campus wake up

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and ask themselves the same question every day

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
when they look in the mirror.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
How do I increase my compensation

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
while reducing my accountability?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And we found the ultimate strategy.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I called the LVMA strategy.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
When I went to UCLA, the facilities were shitty,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
but 76% got in and it was 400 bucks.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And what they figured out is, I know,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
keep the admissions rates static and low.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
When the dean announces,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
we rejected 92% of our applicants this year at NYA,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
we stand up and we applaud.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
And the alumni love it because their degree goes up in value.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
And this same rejectionist LVMA strategy

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
has been adopted across the larger economy.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
If you own a home, you get very concerned.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
You're in the Malibu Canyon.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I bet any homeowner in the Malibu Canyon

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
takes a real interest in new plans for new development,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
and they show up and they're very concerned

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
and come up with thoughtful reasons

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
why new developments never get the permits.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
And the result is we have a shortage every year

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
of somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 million houses we need.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
And then you have big companies who weaponize government

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
and create it harder and harder for small companies to emerge.

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
So the result is the incumbents see their asset values increase,

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
but people can't get into these schools.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Harvard sits on a $53 billion endowment,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
which is the GDP of Costa Rica,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
and it's kept its freshman class at 1,500 kids.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
A good Starbucks serves 1,500 people.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
They could admit 15,000 and have no tax,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
absolutely no tax on their resources.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
So one of the solutions in my view

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
is if you are not growing your freshman enrollment

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
faster than population growth,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
you should lose your nonprofit status.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
And COVID provided the perfect opportunity

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
to reevaluate what you just shared

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
and create a situation through online education

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
to broaden the aperture and make it accessible

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
to so many more people.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
And we all know what happened.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
That didn't happen.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
It didn't.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I speak at a lot of corporations, a lot of big companies,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
and they'll say, what can we do?

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
The first thing a corporation could do to make this better

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
is to stop fetishizing graduates from elite universities.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
When I went to work for Morgan Stanley,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
they recruited at Stanford and Berkeley,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and I was the first analyst I hired at UCLA.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
UCLA wasn't good enough for them.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
And I fell into the trap.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
When I started my company, I fetishized hiring people.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
We only hired people from Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
and for some reason UVA.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
We had people from UVA.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
When you decide that you're only hiring from elite universities,

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
you're saying, I'm not interested in single mothers.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
You're immediately excluding people who don't even have rich parents

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
or are freakishly remarkable.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
So my recommendation, I was talking to the CEO of Salesforce

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
about this,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
move away from a certification-based hiring strategy

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
to a skills-based strategy.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
How do you figure out the testing, and it's expensive and it's hard

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
to hire really talented young people that based on their skills

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
as opposed to their certification?

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Because the reason we have entered into this LVMH strategy

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
at elite universities is that corporations love it.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
People think our student is our consumer.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
No, our consumer is our product.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Our consumer is the corporation.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And the corporation is basically

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
outsourced screening and hiring to these universities,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
thinking if they're only leading an 8% of their applicants,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
they must be pretty good.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
So corporations moving to a certification saying 10%, 20%,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
50% of our applicants.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And I'm not talking about admin jobs.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I'm talking about professional track jobs.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Are going to be reserved for people based on a skills-based assessment

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
where it is certification-blind.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
You couldn't get past the front desk without an elite university degree

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
at Morgan Stanley when I was there.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Isn't tech a little bit different though?

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
I feel like they are slightly more progressive in terms of how they hire

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
because they are looking at skills,

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
and it's a bit more untethered from pedigree.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Is that true?

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
A little bit, especially when I'm programming,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
but I would argue if you want a job

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
in a traditional professional track and met or alphabet,

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
it's pretty hard to get in without an elite university degree.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
And it's a self-reinforcing mechanism because they're so populated

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
with people from amazing universities.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
I mean, this goes back to why it's so important to get out of your house

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
and that you're social.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Because there was just a study done at Google,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
and a hiring manager says,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
we put out a job opening for a product manager.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
We get immediately 200 resumes and we cut it down

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
because we don't need more than 200.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
We decide to bring in 20 people.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
And of the 20 people the hire we make is almost always someone

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
who is referred internally.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
So if you want a job, you better have a lot of friends.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But I don't know.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I think tech is probably as big an offender.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
I think tech founders oftentimes don't have college degrees.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
If you're an AI engineer, okay, fine.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
You don't need a degree.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
But I would argue for the majority of the jobs,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the professional track jobs,

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
they still fetishize an elite college degree.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Part of getting young males out of the basement

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
and into the world and face-to-face with people

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
requires some modeling of that healthy behavior.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
And I think what's so potent about who you are

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
and how you show up is that you're this really successful dude,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
but you're also like an alpha guy who's progressive,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
who's ribald at times,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
like you're not afraid to tell a dirty joke,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
you're strong, you're fit,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
and you know what you're talking about

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
when you're talking about economics and social sciences, etc.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
Why aren't there more people like you?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Well, you're being generous.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Let's unpack that.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Do you remember the Presidential Fitness Awards?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Sure.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I was going to figure out a way.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
I got a three years in a row,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and then I hit a growth spurt in the eighth grade,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
and I didn't get the badge, and it was devastating for me.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And I started doing pull-ups every day

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
until I got back to seven pull-ups, which is what I needed.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
We have become so politically correct

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
that we romanticize obesity.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
You're finding your truth.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
No, you're not.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You're finding a fucking ventilator.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I mean, that's not to say that we shouldn't have empathy.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
We shouldn't figure out programs

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
to give people in food deserts

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
the opportunity to eat more healthy,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
but we should be celebrating fitness.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
One of the first things I say to men

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
if I coach a young man,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
lean into your strengths as a man.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
We have superior or more dense bone structure,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
a lot more muscle,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
and then testosterone gets poured over it.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I think any man under the age of 30

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
should be able to walk into any room

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
and know that if shit got real,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
they could either kill and eat everybody or outrun them.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
And it's an amazing feeling.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It's going to make you kinder.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Who breaks up fights at bars?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
A big, strong man.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Who is kinder?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Who has an easier time finding mates?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Who wants to protect others?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Who's going to be less depressed,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
make more money?

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Fitness and celebrating strength is a wonderful thing.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Especially for men.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
It's key.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And then we have become so politically correct

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
around potentially offending people.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
The people who are the most profane

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
used to be the most liberal.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
And on the far left, we become such snowflakes

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
that anything,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
I think the thing that hurts people from being elected

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
to implement many of the policies I'm promoting

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
are that we're seen as humorless.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Like, at some point,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
we're going to get to celebrate our differences.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I co-host a podcast with Cara Swisher, who's a lesbian.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
I make fun of her sexual orientation.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I make inappropriate jokes.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
And then there's a pause.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
And she laughs.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
And she gives everyone else permission to laugh.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
I think that's really important.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Social media has created this infrastructure

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
where you get guardian of gotcha points

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
by if someone says something off color,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
you go after them.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And I think it's awful.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
And I purposely dial up the profanity.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Because I'm like, for God's sakes,

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
the left needs to take back profanity and vulgarity.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That doesn't mean you're a bad person.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
But what you do is also matched with a compassion

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
and a vulnerability.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Because I think what you just shared

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
is also the portal to bad influence on the internet.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Like, make your bed, get fit, eat right,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
show up when you say you're going to show up.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Those are all sound and solid principles.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
It's good advice.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
But too often that, as you were sharing earlier,

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
is sort of the beginning of a slide into a darker world.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And those influencers seem to commandeer

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
too large of a percentage of the internet

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and capture the minds and the fascination

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
of these wayward young men who are in search of good influence

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
and just take what's available,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
what's showing up when they're scrolling on their feet.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Like, why is it that those are the voices

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
that rise to the top and a more grounded,

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
kind of kinder, more conscientious approach

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
that you model isn't the one that's rising to the top?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Or why aren't there more people

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
who are talking about the warrior mindset

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
but from a perspective that the ultimate warrior

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
never has to remove their sword from the sheath

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
and is a protector of those that are weaker

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
and is a compassionate force for the community?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Well, unfortunately, again, thanks.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I think you're being generous.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
We've conflated toxicity with masculinity.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
You don't hear the term masculine femininity.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
We've spent the last 30 or 40 years

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
highlighting the wonderful things about feminine attributes.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
It's a celebration.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
It's wonderful.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Women are doing so well.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
More single women own a home than a single man.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
It's now 60, 40 female to male, college grads,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
enrollees, and it's about to go two to one college grads

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
because men drop out.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
In urban areas now in the U.S.,

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
women under the age of 30 are making more money than men.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
And by the way, that's wonderful.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
We should do nothing to get in the way of that.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
But also, trying to find role models

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
and trying to envision a new aspirational frame

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
of masculinity that says,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
masculinity is an amazing thing.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You shouldn't apologize for it.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
You should lean into it.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
But what does it mean?

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And I'm writing a book on masculinity

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
and I'm trying to figure it out

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and quite frankly, it's really challenging.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
You know, I think of it as loosely speaking,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
protector, provider, procreator.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
When you think about the jobs associated

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
with masculinity, a cop, a fireman,

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
I was at a hotel in Seattle and a fire alarm went off

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
and these eight farm people showed up,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
seven men, one woman.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
They didn't ask if there was a fire.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
They didn't ask what was going on.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
They're like, what floor is this?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
They got in the elevator and they went to seventh floor.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
That's just it.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
If you look at 9-11, they were like,

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
oh, this building's coming down.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
They just run into the building.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
They're like, our job is to protect others.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
I think that's a great place to start for men,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
that real masculinity is you are,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
your job is to protect other people

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
and it also fits to our instincts.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I think it's called the Carnegie Foundation

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
gives out an award every year or awards

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
for people who in the moment

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
put their own physical safety at risk

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
to save someone else they don't know.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
It's literally pulling people out of a burning car.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
What you're talking about is service.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
And I think a lot of the messaging around masculinity

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
is about individuality.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
It's about going out and getting yours

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
and killing the lion and getting the car and the job.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
It's all about kind of selfish aggrandizement

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
in a showy, flashy sort of way to kind of peacock.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
But real masculinity is purpose-driven

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
and service-oriented.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
How are you showing up for other people?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Where I was going with this,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
the 81 awards they gave last year,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
77 were given to men.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Men are more risk aggressive.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Men will rush out into a field of combat

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
to pull a comrade out who's shot risking their own lives.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Women tend to be more thoughtful.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
Women tend to be like, is that a good idea?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
And there's a role for both.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
And by the way, I'm making a reductive generalization.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Masculinity is a societal construct.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
It's what we fill it with.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
And a lot of women demonstrate wonderful masculinity.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
It's not the domain of people born as men.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
One of those fire people was a woman.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Well, I go to CrossFit.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
I mean, the most impressive people in CrossFit are women.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
And we celebrate their strength.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Personally, I'm drawn to men who are more feminine.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
My best friends demonstrate that kind of care,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
that nurturing, that grace.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
So I think where it comes off the rails is you say,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
only men can be masculine or people born as men.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
These are wonderful attributes.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
What I'm suggesting is that people born as men

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
have an easier time leaning into these things.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
And we should celebrate them.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I think what you're saying around service is something

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
I should think about,

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
because maybe that's a better frame.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
The protector, provider,

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
the majority of men still are evaluated

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
based on their ability to provide economically.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And if we're going to have an honest conversation,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
we have to have an honest conversation.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Three in four women say economic viability

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
is a key criteria in a mate, a male mate.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Whereas it's less than a quarter of men.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
We just don't really care.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
It appears.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Well, maybe a wrinkle on service is the idea of contribution.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Because I think self-esteem is bred through contributing.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Are you being productive

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
for something that's greater than yourself?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I did ketamine therapy on Monday.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
And I was trying to...

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Told me more.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Oh God, have you done it?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
No, I haven't.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
No.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
I know some people that have though.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Yeah, so I...

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
What led to that?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I call it the Burning Man effect.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It's like, I've always been curious about Burning Man.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
But I've always chickened out

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
and I've always wanted to do ketamine.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
And I was just curious about it.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
So a friend of mine is an investor in these clinics

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and basically set my...

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Of my appointment while I was in Austin

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
and it came up and I went.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
But I was trying to write down the takeaways for me.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
And Richard Reeves of Boys and Men fame

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
has this great frame.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And that is adding surplus value.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
I teach my boys.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I'm like, you're negative value right now.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Your mom spends a ton of time.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
We spend a ton of money on you.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
We give you more love than you give us.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
You go to school.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
This incredible infrastructure

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
is spending time and energy to educate you.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I'm like, when you become a man

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
is when you're doing enough for other people

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
that you're adding surplus value.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
You're producing more than you're taking.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
I love that frame.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
At some point in the service of others

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
are you actually giving more than you're taking?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
You know, that's...

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Our economy is based on that.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Our economy is to take in resources

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
and then output more than the cost of the resources going in.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I don't know how I thought of the ketamine therapy

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
but the only kind of real actionable item I took away from it

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
was like my boys kept coming up and I thought

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
if I can love my boys more than people have loved me

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
if I can push more of that confidence and concern

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
and love to other people

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
that's the real surplus value, right?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
And that was a nice framing for me.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
That's like I wanted to come out

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
with some intentionality around my purpose.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And this is what I took from it is like

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
I have these vessels that really are open

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
and sponges of my time, regard, attention and love

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
and if I think one of my purposes as a man

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
is surplus value is how can I do more of that for them

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
than was done for me?

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
I have a very complicated relationship with my father.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
He wasn't very good to me or my mom

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
but here's the thing, he was much better to me

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
than his dad was to him.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
He's checked the box in the universe.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
He's added surplus value

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
but I think that's a great frame for men.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Really think about young men,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
the resources, the government, your family,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
our society are investing in you

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
and at what point does it flip

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
and you're actually adding more value than you're taking

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and a lot of men never get there

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
and grow up thinking that the world is just about giving them shit

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
and spending time and love on them.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
I think that's a great frame for what it means to be a man

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
I also think that's why qualitatively

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
like what you're doing now in this chapter of your life

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
I suspect and I'm projecting is

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
so much more meaningful to you.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Yes, it's a for-profit enterprise, profg media

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
but in comparison to being an activist,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
investor or an investment banker

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
or just an entrepreneur in general

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
the meaning behind it, the intentionality, the purpose

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
that seems to be very clear to you

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
gives it a sense of meaning

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
that I would imagine contributes to your happiness

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
and your sense of direction.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah, look, it's hugely rewarding.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
I'm not, I don't want to virtue too much.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
I'm a capitalist, I love money, I love making money.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I think there's a huge economic opportunity

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
and being the white space I feel commercially

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
as a marketing professor I can tell you

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
is I'm a white heterosexual male

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
that talks openly about his feelings.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
There's a huge white space for that.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
People respond to it, people respond to it.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And so it's a frame, I make good money

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
talking about this stuff

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
but the stuff around

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
struggling young men is so rewarding

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
because it's a conversation that has been unproductive

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
and by far the people I get the most

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
support for for this work are mothers.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
They come up and they say something along the following

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I have three kids, two daughters and a son

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
one daughter's in Chicago and PR

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
the other's at Penn

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
my son's in the basement vaping and playing video games.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It's hugely rewarding

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
and also quite frankly it just makes me feel good

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
it makes me feel strong, it makes me feel masculine

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
it makes me feel successful that I can influence other people

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and also try and be open and vulnerable

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
about my own shortcomings.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I've fucked up so many times

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and I continue to disappoint myself.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I have huge imposter syndrome

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't know if you ever feel like you're about to be found out.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
All the time.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Someone's going to break in right now

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I can't even believe you're sitting across from me

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and you know like yourself

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
I'm an approval junkie

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
like you know I want you to like me

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you know what I mean like there's

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
there's all kinds of layers to that

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
like I get all that

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
but I think fundamentally

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
it's so important

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
to model that type of vulnerability

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
it's you know I do it in the work that I do

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
in the way that you show up

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
and do that for other people

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
is an invitation

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
and it allows people to understand

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
that like being vulnerable isn't a weakness

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
it's not kryptonite

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
it's actually a superpower

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
it's an invitation to let people in

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
it's giving permission to other people

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
to engage with their emotions

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
and their feelings

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
and not treat it like it's a weakness

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
or to admit something that you're scared about

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
makes you a failure.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
It's also a fantastic way

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
to live a more rewarding life

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
because from the age of 29 to 44

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
I never cried.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
I just forgot how.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I didn't cry when my mother died

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
I didn't cry when I got divorced

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
I didn't cry when my company went chapter 11

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
and I was broke at the age of 40

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I just forgot how

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
and what I would advise any man

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
is to lean into your emotions

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
when you think something's funny

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
learn how to laugh out loud

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
when you find something inspiring

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
you know really lean into God

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
this really moves me

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
you know when you read something you love

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
or you see a visualization

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
or you see the sunset

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
or you're riding a wave

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
like just fucking get into it

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
and if you feel sad

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
don't check back on some weird

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
screwed up sense of masculinity

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
really lean in and feel the emotion

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
and if you can cry

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
because it informs what's important to you

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
it informs what moves you

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
it informs what you're good at

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
otherwise you're just sort of

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
sleepwalking through life

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
you never really register anything

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
and here's the fear

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
you know life is a sense of sensations

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
and reward

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
the fear is when you talk to people at the end

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
my colleague at NYU Adam Alter

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
has done this great work around palliative care

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
you know

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
you're stuck in the past

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
I struggle with anger and depression

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
I'm in the past way too much

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
I don't forgive myself

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I get very down on myself

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I'm a lot in the future

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
because I'm successful

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
and to be successful you have to be planning

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
and sacrificing for the future

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
but I'm never really here

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
like I'm already thinking about the traffic

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
on the way home

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
I'm already thinking should I stop it in and out

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
in Van Nuys

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
I have a friend in Westlake

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I'm like I'm already kind of like

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
halfway thinking about

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
tonight the people I'm going to be meeting

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I'm thinking about my flight on Saturday

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm thinking I'm just already like in the future

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and the thing people regret the most

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
you know when they're older

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
they just didn't

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
lean into their relationships

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
they didn't feel emotion

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
and that's the fear

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
my biggest fear

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
as an atheist

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
and I'd be curious to get your

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
I'll put it back to you

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
my biggest fear is I get at the end

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
I mean I believe at the end

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
I'm going to look into my kids life

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
eyes and know that our relationship's coming to an end

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I don't think anyone's going to talk me out of that

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
my fear is I look back and go

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
oh my god what enormous blessings

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
prosperity I would have never imagined

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
people that love me and let me love them immensely

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
but I was never there

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
never really felt any of it

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
and one way to put yourself in the moment

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
is to really lean into those emotions

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and not like that

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
people are really understanding

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
people like it

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I'm not suggesting you cry at work

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
there's a time and a place for emotion

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
but people respond to it

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
and distinct to the affirmation

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
and accolades or reinforcement you get

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
or don't get

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
it informs your life

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
it puts you in the moment

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
because that's my biggest fear

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
as I get to the end

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
and it's like this really didn't happen

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
there was a series of past and future

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
but the moments were just very few

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
so how did you make that change

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
to go from the person who couldn't cry

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
to leaning into your emotions

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
was there a pivotal experience?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
you know the seminal experience for me

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I think that it's very basic stuff

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
and again I'm curious

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
you think more about this than I do

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
the real seminal things in my life

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
were my mom dying

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
just the harshness the first time you lose someone

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
have you lost a parent?

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
not yet

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
have you lost anyone close to you?

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
I really haven't

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
okay that is just the harshest

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
strangest experience to date

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
when it happens

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
the harshness of it

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
the finality of it

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
if we could register

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
and really understand what death is

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
at all before it happens

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
we'd be so freaked out

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
that we wouldn't go outside

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
we're purposely wired

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
not to really think a lot about death

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
so when it happens

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
you just can't imagine it

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
it's so brutal

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
for a lot of people

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
I think it gives you a sense

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
of the finite nature of life

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
it changes your frame

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
made me more appreciative

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
made me more bold and courageous

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
with my feelings

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
to tell people how I cared about them

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
and then the other one

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
is the other side of the life spectrum

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
when my kids were born

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
you know all of a sudden

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
it's no longer about me

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
my whole life

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Monday through Friday was

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
how do I make more money

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
how do I hang out with more fabulous people

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
how do I have more sex with hotter people

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
and then more money

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
and then more fabulous

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
and then more sex

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
and then more relevance

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
and more act

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
but it was like the vampire

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
from an Anne Rice movie

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I could never quite be satisfied

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
so it was more

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
fucking more

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
I want more

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
and then when I had kids

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
it's kind of cathartic

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
because all of a sudden

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
you're thinking instinctively more

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
about someone else than you

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
it's like

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
my Friday used to be

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
where am I having brunch

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
how do I find more fabulous people

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
and things to do

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
now I know what I'm doing

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I'm going to soccer practice

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
and it's boring and hard

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
for a couple years

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
and then I find it quite relaxing

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
but having kids

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
and thinking about other people

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
has been really cathartic

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
and there's just a few moments

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
they don't have that often

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
but they do happen

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I'll be on the couch

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
watching a Premier League football game

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
my boys will wander in

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
they kind of instinctively throw

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
their legs on yours

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
like it's just natural

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
the dogs come in

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
you know they laugh at something

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
and you have that moment

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
where you're like

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
okay this is it

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
I can't imagine anymore

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
this is it

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
it's the only time in my life

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I've ever felt sated

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
ever

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
I mean it sounds very trite

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
but death and birth

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
we're kind of the

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
getting you to I think

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
to the next phase

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
how old are your boys

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
13 and 16

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
I started late

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
how old are yours

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
two step sons

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
28 and 27

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
and a 20 year old daughter

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
and a 16 year old daughter

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
oh so you're on the back nine

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
yeah

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
my story's a little bit different though

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
although I haven't suffered

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
that kind of loss

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
I certainly have the experience

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
of having kids

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
and how transformative that is

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
but you know my root to

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
vulnerability and

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
being in constant contact

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
with my emotional state

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
was formed out of

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
difficulties and hardship

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I had a protracted battle

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
with alcoholism

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
that destroyed my life

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I went from somebody who

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
was an insecure quiet kid

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
figured it out

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
by the time I graduated high school

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
top athlete

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
got into all the colleges

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
all the promise in the world

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
all the opportunities

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
that I then squandered

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
until I alienated

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
everybody that I cared about

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
in my life

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
and was utterly broken

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
and had to build my life

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
back up again

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
from scratch

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and I think that experience

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
was painful as it was

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
really provided me with

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
the tools to reconstruct

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
a new life based upon

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
new principles

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
you're an atheist

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
I'm not

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
I was introduced to

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
some spiritual principles

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
and tools that are now fundamental

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
to the way that I frame my life

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
and live my life

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
you know I owe everything

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
that I now have

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
to the experience of

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
getting sober

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
and the community of people

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
that have helped keep me sober

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
and who I help keep sober

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
and everything has kind of escalated

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
from there

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
but fundamentally it's

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
about confronting your own emotions

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and taking inventory for your behavior

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
and repairing the damage of your past

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
and having a spiritual connection

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
to something greater than yourself

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and then giving it back

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
and service to other people

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
and I try to do that

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
through the professional work

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
that I do

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
but fundamentally my first priority

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
is to that community

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
and to that program

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
was there a moment though

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
where you said okay

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
this is it I gotta get my shit together

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
well there were lots of moments like that

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
that didn't end up changing anything

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
because I wasn't ready

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
the elevator hadn't gone down far enough

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and I wasn't ready to let go

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
so it wasn't until

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
literally almost everything was stripped away from me

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
and I had nowhere else to turn

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
because I don't want to change

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
do you like changing

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
do you like trying to let go of bad behavior

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
and adopt new habits

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
like it's not fun

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
it's not easy

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
and also I love drinking

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
yeah so me too

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
you know probably more than you

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
but I am wired in a certain way

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
where that wasn't going to work out for me

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
and it was pretty clear for a pretty long time

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
that I was headed in the wrong direction

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
and people tried to intervene

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
but you have to be ready

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
for that change

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
you have to

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
I had to suffer

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
I had to

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
get to a place of suffering where

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
the fear

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
of change

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
was exceeded by

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
the pain of my current experience

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
because I'm stubborn

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
and I'm an alcoholic

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
but even in sobriety

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
you know I've weathered

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
financial destitution

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and had other kinds of challenges

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
that have in retrospect

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
looking back provided me with strength

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
and have been

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
foundational

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
and instructive

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
and have helped me

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
everything's 20-20 in the rear-view mirror

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
it all makes sense when you look backwards

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
but at the time

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
incredibly confusing

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and a lot of fear

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
and a lot of insecurity

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
but I think those tools

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
and they're all just analogs

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
for the things that you talk about

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
like if you want self-esteem

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
you have to perform a steamable act

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
on behalf of yourself

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
on behalf of other people

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
you have to be true to your word

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
and you say you're going to show up

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and it is this relationship with time

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
also that

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
building a life requires

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
small consistent acts taken every single day

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
like there's a compound interest

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
economically but also

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
just in terms of good will

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and trust and all these kind of

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
character qualities that take a long time to build

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and don't happen overnight

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
especially if you've destroyed that trust

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
or you don't feel like you're capable

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
or you don't have the facility

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
for self-love.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Another question

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Atheism is a source of strength for me

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I like the finite

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
believing that life is finite

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
that helps me to be a little more courageous

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
with my emotions and I don't think this is a dress rehearsal

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
so it's taken

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
fear away from me.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
It gives impressions to the moment.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
And also the people I'm so worried about

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
being shamed by or not

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
approving of me

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
in a hundred years nobody I know

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
or care about what they think of me

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
is going to be around.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It makes me just feel less insecure

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and more bold but in terms of faith

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
why is it you needed

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and I think it's great but what is it about faith

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that's given you that kind of strength

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
that you couldn't find elsewhere

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and also what is the role

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
that you have tried to present

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
or how have you tried to present faith

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
to your kids because I'm struggling with it

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
My 13 and 16 year olds have had no introduction

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
of faith and I think faith

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and spirituality and religion

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I think actually there's some very positive aspects

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
for religion. I've just always been remiss

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
to introduce my kids to it so

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
why is it you feel like you needed this

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
instead of just your own facilities

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
into what's the role that your religion

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
is playing your kids life? Yeah those are great questions

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
and challenging to answer I think

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think the way into

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
responding to that

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
has a lot to do with

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
self-will and a

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
humility of understanding that you're really

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
not in control of very many things

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and a sense that

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
there are more things at play

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
that are outside your ability to comprehend

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
so I was somebody

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I assume much like yourself

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
who was very driven, who was very ambitious

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and every

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
success that I had had as a young person

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
was

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
attributable to my ability to

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
outwork everybody else

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
in the room to show up

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
earlier and stay later

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and bridge the talent deficit gap

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
with a willingness and a capacity

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
in a facility

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
for suffering and pain

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and work.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
That took me to a certain place

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
it got me into Stanford

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
it made me a champion swimmer

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
all of these things

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
but when alcohol entered the picture

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
my self-will

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
was absolutely useless

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
in terms of addressing this problem

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I tried, I tried, I tried

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
every time I tried to

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
use this facility that I had

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
to tackle this problem

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
the problem only got worse

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
and the problem wasn't solved

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
until I was willing to surrender

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
that I actually had no control over it

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and that I needed to ask for help

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
not only ask for help

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
but accept that help

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
and as somebody who's very self-directed

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
asking for help and receiving help

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
is very confronting prospect

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I had to be broken enough

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
to do that

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
but that process of surrender

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
which is a daily practice

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
of kind of letting go

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
of my own sense of what I should be doing

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
or what I think is in my best interest

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
has actually been the most

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
remunerative

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and fulfilling

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and nurturing

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and gratifying experience that I've had

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and I think with that comes a

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
an opening for awe and wonder

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
of things that perhaps I don't understand

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
because human beings we think that we can

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
understand everything that's happening around us

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and I think there's a lot more going on

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
that perhaps eludes our small brains

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and I find some comfort in that

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and that doesn't mean that I subscribe

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
to a particular strain of religion

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
other than to say

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
that I'm just one person

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and I don't always make the best decisions

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
on my own behalf and I've learned

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
to bring in other people

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and pause when agitated

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and allow others

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
to help guide me

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
talk about the role that you want

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
this has become your podcast all of a sudden

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
we can only do this for so long

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
George Hahn is a close

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
friend, he thinks it's just the world to you

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
and he says that you both share

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
a history of addiction

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
that's how he found you

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and what I'll say and this is strange

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
but I've been thinking a lot about the

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
ketamine therapy I did

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
almost a week ago now

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
because the first

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
seven day period I've gone

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I was just thinking about it and it happened actually

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
only in 30 years I haven't had alcohol

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and it's not because I had some revelation

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
that I was an addict or I needed to stop

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the literally physical

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
taste or smell of alcohol right now

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
is very unappealing to me

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and that's never happened to me before

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
that's so interesting because I've heard you talk about

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
how you enjoy your cocktails

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm a better version of me a little bit fucked up

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I've gotten more out of alcohol than it's gotten out of me

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I like it and I enjoy it

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I think I'm good at it

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I think I can modulate it

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
but I might have been fooling myself

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
but for some reason

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
the idea of having a beer right now

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
just makes me nauseous

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
and I don't know if it's the same

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
impact or effect those GLP-1 drugs have on you

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
where it turns that switch off

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
but I drink a lot

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
and for almost a week now

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't even want to smell alcohol

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
that's fascinating

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
maybe go

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
you know go 30 days

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
see what it's like

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
there's this whole movement

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
around the alcohol-free lifestyle

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
right now I've had a couple people on the show

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
who are advocates in this space

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
and there's just a growing

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
population of people

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
who are realizing how much better

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
their life is without it

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
they're not addicts, they're not alcoholics

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
but they like to go out

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
and tie one on on the weekend

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
or whatever it is

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and you reach a certain age also

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
those hangovers

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
stick around a little bit longer

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
when you're out of college

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
you go out and drink a lot

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
next day I have a Diet Coke

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and a Big Mac and you're fine

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
now I feel as if I've had a battery of chemo

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
it takes me two days to recover

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and all the research I'm making

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
they just keep finding out

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
it's worse and worse for you

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
so I also recognize

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
that the liver just can't process it the way it used to

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I'm trying to tone it down

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I do edibles

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and one of the reasons I started doing edibles

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
is I enjoy the feeling of being high

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
or a little bit intoxicated

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
and so I'm trying to tone down alcohol

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and I've been substituting a little bit

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
with edibles

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
but I'm thinking more about it

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
recognizing that it would be hard for me

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
to maintain the drinking I do

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and stay healthy at this age

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Well, you got me and George

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
call anytime buddy

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I appreciate that

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
when you want to pick up

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
and Scott is going to have a drink

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
let's talk about the new book a little bit

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
the Algebra of Wealth

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
this is interesting it all kind of starts

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
with this equation that you have

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
around prosperity

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and how to think about

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I mean it's really fundamentally addresses the changing workplace

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
that's kind of happening right now

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
it's this sort of mission statement

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
for young people how to think about

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
money in this changing landscape

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
you've seen the research

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
where five friends who hang out together

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
become more like each other

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
you become the kind of average of your friends

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
the body mass index, the amount of money you make

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
your political party

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
they all begin to converge

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
towards the regression line

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
that's not true of wealth at the end of your life

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
same five people make the exact same amount of money

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the amount of wealth they end up with is highly

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
variant

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and I made a lot of mistakes

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
but I missed a series of just

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
small strategies and behaviors

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
to make sure I was economically secure

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and I think it's really important

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
because I say that America

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
becomes more like itself every day

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and this isn't a good thing but America is a loving generous place

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
if you have money

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
it's a rapacious violent place if you don't

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
so

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
a series of behaviors

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and approaches and strategies

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
that aren't that hard

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
and they require less discipline if you start them early

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
can lead you to economic security

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and so

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
the basic equation is focus

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
find your talent, not your passion

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
at NYU we have these people

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
who come in, we either

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
invite impressive, accomplished people

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
or invite billionaires

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
we've decided billionaires just have insight into life

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and that would end with the same shitty advice

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
follow your passion

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and typically the guy telling you to follow your passion

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
made his billions in iron ore smelting

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and my thing is

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
find your talent, find something you're really good at

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
or you think you have an aptitude for

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
it can't be something you don't like

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
but most young people mistake

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
passion for a hobby

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and I think I'm really into sports

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I want to be a DJ

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
or I want to be a model or in fashion

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
just keep in mind those industries

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
have a 90 plus percent unemployment rate

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and if you're really that talented

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
you'll know at a very early age

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
that you're meant to be the next messy

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
or you are really that talented

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
my advice would be

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
find something you're good at that has a 90 plus percent

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
employment rate

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
and what I have found is that

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
jobs are like asset classes

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the more they're invested the more human capital

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
that goes into them the lower the return

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
and that there's an inverse return

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
on your career based on

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
how sexy their career is

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
in the example I use as a tax lawyer

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
if you can figure out the discipline

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
to get the certification to be a lawyer

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
you enjoy numbers you understand

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
the selection between taxes and laws

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and how to handle a client

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
if you could be in the top 10%

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
of that you're always going to make a good living

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and if you could be in the top 1%

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
you'll probably fly private

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and have a much broader selection set of mates

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
than you deserve

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
so your job isn't to figure out what your passion is

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I wanted to be an athlete like you

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I thought you know and the wonderful thing about UCLA

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
is it disabuses you of any notion

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
of being a professional athlete

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I knew athletes I went to school with Troy Aikman

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
you're surrounded by Olympians

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I was literally the worst varsity athlete

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
at UCLA

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
but that was a blessing for me

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
find your talent and then commit the

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
requisite 10,000 hours

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
the endurance, the grit, the maturity

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
to try and become really top 1%

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
in something that has a 90%

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
employment rate

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
not a 90% unemployment rate

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
you want to be an actor

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I don't want to crush your dreams but you better be amazing

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
because of the 180,000

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
success actors in the world that are in the SAG

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
after union

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
87% of them make less than $23,000 a year

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and don't qualify for health insurance

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
so you better be Glenn Close

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
or you better be close to Glenn Close

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
to make a living there

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
whereas other industries that have a 90%

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
employment rate if you're just in the top 10%

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
even the top half

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
you're going to make a good living

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and this is what I can promise you

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
being great at something that pays well

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
lets you take care of your kids

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
comradery

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
people start laughing at your jokes

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
inviting you to speak places

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
and anything that does that for you

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
will make you passionate about whatever it is

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
no one grows up thinking

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I'm going to be passionate about tax law

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
but the best tax lawyers I can tell you

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
are really passionate about it

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
because they're good at it

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and it pays off and I'm not saying

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
don't pursue your dreams

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
but have an honest conversation around

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
what it would mean to be in the top of that field

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
because without economic security in this country

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
your life's going to be full of anxiety and disappointment

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
so focus

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
find your talent

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and the next things are pretty straightforward

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
diversity

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
or diversification

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
where I lost a lot of my money was I was always like

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
doubling down on my companies

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
and that's okay when you're younger

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
especially if it's your own business

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
can sometimes you have any choice

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
but the moment you have any assets start diversifying

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I've taught at a business school for 20 years

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I've had a lot of professors in the world

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and my some total assessment

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
of the market is no one has any fucking idea

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
but the good news

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
is that the market because of demographic growth

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
because of productivity because of technology

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
as a whole

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
the market is up into the right

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
so the S&P was up 24% last year

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
but only 7 companies were responsible

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
for 70% of those gains

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
were you smart enough to buy NVIDIA?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I wasn't

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and so unless you were smart enough to pick

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
from the stocks that accelerated

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
you had actually really meddling returns

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
but this is a good news you don't need to be a stock picker

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
buy the entire S&P

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
buy an index a low cost fund

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
it's gone up 11% a year for the last 15 years

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
11% a year when you're young

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
sounds really mediocre

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
but that means

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
every 21 years your

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
money is going up 8 times

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
so diversify

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
the other one is realize

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
the benefit of time

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and our species has a difficult time

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
wrapping their head around time

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
for the majority of our time on this planet

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
we haven't lived past 35

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
so young people just can't imagine

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and I can give them actual real tables

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
there's probably a 90% plus chance

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
they're going to live another 70 maybe even 80 years

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and the other thing I can guarantee

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
is it's going to go really fast

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I mean I don't know about you that was 30 yesterday

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
it goes really fast

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
so if you push back on our instincts

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
around time

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
so diversification

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
you don't need to be a hero

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and then the really hard part

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
especially for a young person

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
is living a little bit like a stoic

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
saying what other people think of me

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
isn't that important

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I really don't need to order a bottle of grey goose

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
at a club to impress people

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I really don't need

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
a BMW at this age

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I need nice clothes to make me feel good

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
but I don't really need

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
no one is concerned

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
about what you did as you are

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
that's just try and find other means

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
of satisfaction

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and self-esteem

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and really try to gamify savings

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
try and work out a savings muscle

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
the muscle you got to develop is a savings muscle

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
gamify it

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
when I was in college you were talking about sports

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I was on the crew team

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
every summer if I didn't save $3,300

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I wasn't re-enrolling at UCLA

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
so I had 12 weeks to make $3,300

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
so we would gamify it

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
together with six other guys who also didn't have any money

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
and every day on a whiteboard we would write down

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
how much and we would gamify it

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I lived on $73 a week

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I ate top ramen, bananas and milk

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
and I had $3,300 by the end of summer

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
that savings muscle

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
mostly stuck with me

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I kind of lapsed out of it when I started making money

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
and thinking I was a baller

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
but if you can develop that savings muscle

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
a little bit of savings when you are young

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
diversification and then recognizing

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
how fast time will go

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
there are hundreds of thousands

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
of union and government employees

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that never make more than $100,000

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
but because of four savings plans

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
and a little bit of discipline

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
they retire millionaires

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and so hope you hit it big with a podcast

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
hope you sell a movie deal

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
hope your company gets acquired

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
if that's great fine

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
but if it doesn't make sure you're going to have

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
a minimum amount of economic viability

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
the good news is I think I know how to get you rich

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
the bad news is the answer is slowly

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
it requires a certain amount of discipline

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
early and this is do

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
as I say not as I do because I always made

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
a lot of money but between

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
divorce, the great financial recession

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and the dot-bomb and always spending a lot of money

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
because I was a baller and at some point

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I was going to make a lot of money I just knew it

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I always increased my spending to my

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
earnings and I ended up at 42

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
when my first kid came marching out of my girlfriend

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I didn't have that much money

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and it was terrifying

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I'm 42

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
but all of this quote-unquote curb retail success

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
everyone thinks I'm so successful

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
stay in New York and put my kid in private school

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
because I've just ended up with a lot less money

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
that was emasculating

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I was humiliating if I'd just been a little smarter

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
a little bit more disciplined

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I wouldn't have had that anxiety

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
so this is sort of a memo to myself

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
if I could go back in time saying

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
this isn't a book for people who are economically insecure

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and need to cut up their credit cards

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
you know that's Susie Orman

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
who has a job, has some talent

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
knows how to make some money

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and a series of behavior

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
that will be your base

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and your plan B

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
What is the advice that you would give

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
to somebody who's

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
not a young person

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
who's starting out, who's looking for that type

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
of guidance to set them up for

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
long-term success but is instead

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
somebody who's

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
in midlife and

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
they've had a job for a long time

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
maybe perhaps they own their home, maybe they rent

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
but they wake up at 40

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
and they can pay their bills

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
maybe they're living check to check

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
but they're unfulfilled

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
they're in a job that is

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
soul draining, soul killing

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and they're just not sure how long

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
they can keep doing it

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
there's just a lack of fulfillment and purpose

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and they're looking for a different way

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So first off, I woke up at

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
42 with not a lot of money

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
but 42 is young

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
you don't think it's young at 42

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
but that probably means you're living another 40 maybe 50 years

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
so it's by no means

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
too late to start

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
you might have to adjust your expectations around how much money you're going to end up with

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
but

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
wealth isn't a function of how much you make

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
it's a function of how much you spend and save

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
there's just no getting around it

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
if you have

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
kids and dependents

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
the aspirational thing here would be to say

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Richard

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
take a chance, find your passion

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
go out, do what you want to do, be happy

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
it's easy to say

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
when I'm not paying your rent

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
there's a certain reality

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
in a Catholic

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I'm not sure I have a silver bullet

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
one of the keys is having

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
a great partner

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and saying kids don't talk about this

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
but 70% of divorce filings

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
are by women

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and it's usually economics

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
the guy loses his job

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
it's a sort of mental breakdown

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
you have to have a conversation

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
or maybe just get lucky

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to make sure that you have a real partner

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
if you're married

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
in the economic livelihood of your house

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
because if you're not happy

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
she's not going to be happy

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
or he's not going to be happy and your kids aren't going to be happy

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I mean I sort of had this conversation

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
with my partner, we were living in New York

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
and we had two boys

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and to put them in pre-k

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and for my wife to continue working

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
we had about $100,000 a year

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
because we were narcissists

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and wanted to get into the right schools

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I'm like okay, the tax is in New York

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
that means we need $180,000 in pre-tax income

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
for our kids to go play with blocks

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
we had a three bedroom apartment

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
we needed three bedrooms

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
it was $18,000 a month

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and we could downgrade

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
but in New York living in Manhattan

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
you really can't downgrade that much

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and so what we decided was

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I'm going to move to Florida

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
we're going to move to Delray Beach

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
where your parents can be involved in our kids lives

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
we have built in childcare

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I'm going to move from $18,000 a month

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
to $5,500 a month

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I'm going to save 13% a year in taxes

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and I'm going to start saving a shit ton of money

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and when I say I mean we

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
we're on board with this

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
she was my partner in it, we're on board with this

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
we're going to start putting away

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
two, three, five, ten grand a month

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and then through no fault of our own

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
the bull market took over

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
everything just sort of took off from there

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
but I would say an open and honest conversation

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
with your partner if you're married

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
if you're single you can take some chances

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
and say fuck it I'm starting a podcast

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
or I'm going to go be a scuba instructor

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
or I've always wanted to write

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
you can take those sorts of risks

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
with a family I think it's really difficult

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
and I would say the only thing I would suggest

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
is really be open with your partner

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
about what you're feeling and what you're going through

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
and say is there a lifestyle arbitrage

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
is there a move

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
are there certain sacrifices we can make

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
as a decision together

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
that takes some pressure off of me

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
such that maybe I can start to investigate

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
things that aren't

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
if they're not joyous, are less arduous on you

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
because

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I was talking to this famous

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
actually it's a podcast

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I was talking to Chris Cuomo

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and he'd just been fired from CNN

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and he was trying to figure out his next thing

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
and he's like I really let my family down

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I really let my family down

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
and that's the hardest part about all this

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I'm like dude I don't know your wife

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I don't know your kids and I'm almost entirely certain

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
what they want is for you to be happy

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
you know he's this big handsome

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
larger than life character

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I'm like when you're happy I bet your household

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
just burns bright

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
and when you're not happy I bet it's not a great place to be

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
so stop putting that on

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
your family and you and all that

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I'm like just find something you don't

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
hate and I bet your partner

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
would be so supportive of anything you want

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
because

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
the money is great

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
but if one of you is really unhappy

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
oh gosh

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I mean you're married right

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I mean one of you is unhappy

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
that's rough

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
and if one of your kids is unhappy the whole thing

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
comes crumbling down right

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
so I think it's about partnership

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
and being open and honest

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
with someone else but there's just no getting around it

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I don't know how to be economically secure

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
unless you're born wealthy

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
without working really hard

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
from the age of 22 to 42

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I did nothing but work

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
and it doesn't sound aspirational

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
it cost me my hair it cost me my first marriage

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
and it was worth it

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I got the currency and skills to get

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
economic security at some point

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I just don't think there's a free lunch

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I find young people are totally unrealistic

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I call it the myth of balance

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I mean you can have it all

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
but you can't have it all at once

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I mean kids I mean my students

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I say how much money do you expect to be making

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
they expect to be in the top 1%

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
of income earning households

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
80% of them by the time they're 30

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
and then they talk about balance

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
balance in the context

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
of an expectation

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
they want balance they want to work that hard

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
they want balance they want hobbies

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
they want to spend time with their family

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
and their dogs I'm like okay

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
unless you're born rich I don't know how to do that

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I just I don't know anyone

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
that successful who didn't

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
for a good 10 or 20 years

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
work pretty

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
damn hard maybe Beyoncé but Beyoncé

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
supposed to work 60 hours a week

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
so I'm sure she did

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
yeah there's a there's a certain level

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
of obsession that kind of contravenes

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
all the negativity around

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
hustle culture

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I mean we should all be healthy we should have

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
a healthy relationship with the work that we do

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I'm an all-in guy

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I really don't know how to do it

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
any other way so it's disingenuous

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
to you know kind of talk

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
about that when I'm practicing it differently

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and I've improved and I'm better now

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
but when you're young

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
to live that

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
stoic lifestyle

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
where you're keeping your overhead as low as possible

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
and you can flex

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
some discipline to

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
really go all in on something

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
may sound on paper

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
terrible but it's actually

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
pretty nourishing you can learn a lot

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and I think the skills that you learn

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
about your own capacity and your own potential

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
are as instructive

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and informative as whatever you're learning

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
in the workplace

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
well you were an athlete so I was a Morgan Stanley

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I wasn't as well educated

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I don't think I was as skilled as my peers

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
it was an analyst class of 73 kids

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
so I decided I wanted to lean into my strengths

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I moved in with my mom I started saving money

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
because I wanted to go to graduate school

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
every week on Tuesday morning I'd go into work

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
at 9 a.m. and I'd stay until Wednesday

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
6 p.m.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I got no one to go home to

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I don't have a girlfriend

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
my mom's not going to miss me

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and I'm physically

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
elite right now

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I could do it no problem one cup of coffee

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
maybe grab 15 minutes 30 minutes

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
sleep at 4 in the morning

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
the next morning

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and I sent a signal to my colleagues

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
that I was here to play

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
and the blessing of an athlete

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
and everyone should try

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and find this environment

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
is that

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I rode crew at one point when you're rowing

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
the air going down your esophagus feels like fire

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
you can't feel your legs

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
you literally start seeing black spots

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
because you start to pass out you're a swimmer

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I mean you had some of that same

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
and that's at

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
800 meters and every time you make it

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
to 2000

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
to push yourself like that is such an incredible

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
gift to be given the opportunity

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
to really be forced

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
to push yourself as a gift because what you realize is

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
when you get divorced and you think

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I can't handle this anymore I can't handle it

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
your business is failing

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I just fucking can't deal with this

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
or you feel

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
you feel tired what you realize is about the moment

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
you think you're going to give up

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
you're about a third of the way of your limit

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
and it builds real incredible confidence

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and grit and endurance

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
and I think those skills really serve

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
people well and other pieces of advice to young people

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
whether it's fitness sports

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
working ridiculously hard

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
finding something super hard

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
and really

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
try and test your limits

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
because it gives you a sense of confidence

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
like wow I just had no idea

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
what I was capable of

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
and it's a real asset the rest of your life

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
you're starting to smell but the lows are so low

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and starting

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
your own business like oh my god

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I'm so full of shit this isn't working

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I'm spending so much money

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I'm letting everybody down

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I just can't get so low

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
if you've had the opportunity to really test

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
your emotional physical limits

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
you're like I'm fine

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I'm going to get through this

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
it's absolutely not the limit

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
but I think that's a blessing

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
for a young person

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I think in the discussion around

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
people who are unfulfilled

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and in midlife

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
there's also the silver lining

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
that the world is different

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
than it was when you and I graduated

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
from college there are

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
all these new opportunities

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
that the internet has afforded us

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
to self-craft

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
different ways to make money

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
or to find meaning and purpose

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
it's important to understand that

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
against that narrative of like

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
you should just chase your passion

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
that

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
not be translated into this permission

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
to just quit your job especially if you're married

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and you have all these responsibilities

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
you

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
flex that discipline

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
and that

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
you know kind of stoic perspective

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
and apply it to your time management

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
like we're all wasting time

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
now more than ever with our phones etc

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
like where is that extra hour

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
or two hours that you can carve out

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
either daily or weekly

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
to explore what it is that gets you excited

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
and just

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
kind of begin to explore that

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
not because you're going to quit your job

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
it makes you feel good

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
or it's fulfilling in some way

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
and those threads

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I think there is a spirituality in that

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
if you give that energy

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
stuff starts to show up

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and opportunities present themselves

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and perhaps at some moment

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
it will be a career path for you

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
or some kind of fulfilling side hustle

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
that you can build into your life

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
but to do it responsibly

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
especially when you have dependence

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I think is important in this culture

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
you know reinvent your life overnight

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
nobody's successful that I know

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
built anything meaningful or successful

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
in the way that it gets

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
portrayed in the media and on social media

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
it takes a long time

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
and you have to be willing to

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
you know, girt yourself

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and to weather that

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
that journey

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
something men are not good at, lean on your friends

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I got financial commitments but I'm looking for something to do

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
right

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
crowdsource some ideas

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
to read the label from inside of the bottle

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
and men always put up this front that

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
my masculinity is tied to

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I should sew together, I'm financially secure

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
and I'm happy and everything's great

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I think developing a circle of friends

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
and mentors or just, you know

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
a kitchen cabinet to say

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
you know, I don't like what I'm doing

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I got to still make money

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
what you were saying, I, you know

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
workshop some things, one or two hours

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
spend some time, see if there's money

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
and see if you've enjoyed as much as you thought

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
we friends will tell you, by the way, don't quit your day job

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
it's hard to find another job without a job

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
whatever it might be but someone who can just ask you

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
really hard questions

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
and also might be able to help you

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
you know what I've been doing, I've been doing this cool thing over here

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
or you know what you would be good at

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I've never in a million years

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
what I thought I'd do in podcasting

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
it's like, I know it

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
it definitely wasn't on the whiteboard

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I didn't know what it was

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
the first podcast I listened to was a podcast

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I was on with Kara Swisher, I'd never listened to a podcast

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
but putting yourself in a position

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
of success, talking to people

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
also

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
people love, if you have good friends

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
they like you asking them for help

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
right, I need to find ways to make more money

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
or I need to find something else

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
and you have any, what do you think

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
you have any ideas, what did you do

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and we have this weird sense of masculinity

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
that if you're vulnerable like that

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
you're taking away from their impressiony or something like that

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I think people like being asked for help

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and I mean they're just the weirdest shit

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
you know what I'm talking about, go dark

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
or men's suicide, something like

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
a huge portion of men who commit suicide

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
no one around them had any idea

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
they had no idea they were even struggling

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
have you seen this like this

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
most horrific video showing the last video

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
in pictures of these men

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
and they're usually like, they look happy

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
so your own ability to

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
reach out and ask other people for help

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
finally in the last 10 years

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I now don't make a single business

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
or personal decision of any importance without checking

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
with other people

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I mistook leadership for

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
you have a plan, you come into a room

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
you tell them what you think

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
and then you advocate for your strategy

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and you go, you never ask for people help

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
you never say, I don't know

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I don't know what I'm doing

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I'm like insecure about this, I don't know

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I would never ask anybody for help until

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
really until I was in my 40s

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I wish I'd figured that out earlier

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
why is that so hard

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
you know I'm so indoctrinated

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
it's helped me that

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
it's second nature to

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
talk about what's bothering me

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
or my weaknesses or my failures

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
or to solicit input

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
and to have a board of advisors

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
and all kinds of different people that I call for different reasons

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
it's a reflex now

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
but it wasn't always that way I've been doing this for a long time

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
but I've been doing it for so long

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
that I think I've lost touch with

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
why it's so challenging

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
for so many particularly

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
men to raise their hand

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
well I'm seeing a bunch of my fraternity brothers

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
tomorrow night

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
and it'll be a series of controlled boasting

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
yeah my wife calls it super duper

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
give me a shake their hand

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
super oh I'm great you know

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
it's just a front you know it's all fucking

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
horse shit yeah I did this

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
about this stock I'd have my best mother

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
check comes everyone fighting for the check

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
no one would say

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
you know on my kid needs braces can someone else

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I mean no one would ever say that right

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
it's all just a set of like check

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
it out right

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I think his men are evaluated based on their economic vitality

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and having their act together

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
that they're just very loath to reach out for help

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I think the blessing

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
of the addiction community

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
or I don't know what you call it the recovery community

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
is they just put that shit aside

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
my sense of that community is

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
first signal you're struggling you reach out to other people

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
first signal and that's a gift

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I would bet a disproportionate number of men

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
never develop that skill women are much better

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
out of than men they lean on their social networks

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I mean

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
we're dealing with a situation right now

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
where men are now 77% of suicides and it's going up

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
we're gonna have 4 to 1

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
male to female suicides

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
how much of that do you think is

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
tied to this loneliness epidemic

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
that we're seeing

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I think loneliness

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
so I'm gonna

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
flex now

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
talking to the Department of Homeland Security about

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
AI

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
but

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
what are the threats of AI

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
is it going sentient

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
is it AI tested

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
misinformation

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
is it self-repairing

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
super weapons

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I think in the short run

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
misinformation AI tested misinformation

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
is a threat if I were Putin I'd be

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
flooding the zone with misinformation

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
making Biden seem a little bit older

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
you know I think that's a

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
short term threat

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
is tapping into

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
men's loneliness

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
one out of seven men

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
don't have a single friend one out of four men

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
can't name a friend

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
the number of men who see their friends every day

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
in high school has been cut in half

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
so they don't see their friends

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
they don't have romantic relationships

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
which serve as great guardrails

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
the only reason I stopped smoking pot every day

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
was my girlfriend said if you don't get your shit together

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I'm gonna stop having sex with you

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
that's a tremendous motivator for a young man

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
if I hadn't had the prospects of a romantic

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
relationship if I didn't have the guardrails of going

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
into the office every day which a lot of men don't

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I just think I would have

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
smoked pot and watched Planet of the Apes all day long

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
right that was a good life for me

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I enjoyed that

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
so so many men

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
have now sequestered from people

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and guardrails to this mix of algorithms

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
and screens

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
that they're becoming very lonely

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
and I said the scenario I see is the biggest

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
threat to the homeland and defense

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
is if I were

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
an adversary, a bad actor

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I would identify the two or three million

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
very lonely men who serve

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
in the armed services or at our

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
ports or our critical infrastructure

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
and I would develop a very sophisticated

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
network of AI girlfriends

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
that start a relationship with them

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
make them feel good it can be

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
three months, six months, twelve months

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
send them pictures increasingly erotic

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
you're funny like the movie Her

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and get them more and more involved

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
and all you need

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
0.01% of them would be

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
3,000 of them and at some point

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
you flip it and say

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
you know what real leadership and real men do

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
is they fight against the tyranny

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
and what is the tyranny? The tyranny is your own

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
government and when

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
this box comes into the port

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I don't want you to check it

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
or you're on the aircraft carrier strike force

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
off the coast of the Mediterranean

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
turn off this switch don't turn it on turn

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
it off I mean I think

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
the next big threat or soft tissue

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
will be a group of radicalized

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
young men who are susceptible to

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
AI algorithms and are so lonely

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
that they start to engage with AI

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
relationship specifically AI girlfriends

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
that will essentially

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
be in a position to radicalize them

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
and instruct them on behavior

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I mean I don't think I don't

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
think we're gonna have Skynet it'll replace

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
jobs but every innovation

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
and technology destroys jobs in the short

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
run and then over the long term it creates

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
more jobs as will AI

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
but there's so many lonely young men

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
you don't have

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
any interaction with people

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
and they become very susceptible to

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
anything or any platform

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
or any algorithm

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
giving them a sense of self-worth

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I literally see that as the biggest defense secret

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
no one's gonna take us on

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
kinetically we spend $800 billion

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
no one can attack us I think

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
we're gonna figure out Hamas I think we're gonna figure out

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
over time Russian Ukraine

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I think the threat is within

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I think this lonely young men

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
in concert with AI is a huge

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
threat subtle progressive

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
and pernicious 100%

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
manipulation

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
just moment by moment

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
they get huge reward from it

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
nice relationship

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
they trust each other

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
you start thinking it's real

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and impossible to

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
police

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
that's a really scary thing

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
read this article what do you think

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
now read this one constantly testing

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
in a million different ways

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
see how you get test millions of times

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
over and over every second

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
how you get them further and further

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
down this path towards radicalization

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
that is not a good picture

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
is there an antidote to that

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
getting people out into the real world

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
detached and untethered from their phones

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
relationships

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
everything from church and on profit work

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
to third spaces to athletics to leagues

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
leveling up men

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
so they're more attractive to women

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
and they can have an user time getting partnerships

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
putting them in more situations

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
where they develop friendships

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I'm a fan of national service

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
doesn't have the teen depression we have Israel

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
they all serve in the same uniform

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
it gives them a sense of purpose

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
they meet friends they meet mates

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
they meet potential future business founders

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
and co-founders and they have a sense of purpose

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
serving in the agency of something else

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
these kids out of the house we got to get them

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
making friends we got to get them

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
engaging in the messy

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
ugly business of

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
real world and rejection and friendships

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
and I mean we're mammals

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
put an orc in a tank alone

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
see what happens it goes crazy

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
and we're raising a generation of men

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
who are going to be increasingly psychotic and crazy

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
that was ugly

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
that is like yeah it's so depressing

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
that was ugly

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
you're a change agent

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
and I'm curious about your thoughts

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
as somebody who's working with young people

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
who's mentoring up close

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
and afar

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
what is the best way

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
to instigate positive change

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
in an individual

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
you probably know more about this than I do

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
what I'll tell you is what I do when I

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
coach a young man

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I try to take on

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
and it's not a lot but I try to take on

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
two young men every six months

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
and what is the differentiator

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
what's the difference between the person who can

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
hear the good information

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
or receive the positive influence

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
and put it into action versus the person who's

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
resistant or struggles

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
well the first thing is they've got to want to do it

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I would say a third of the time they don't show up

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
or they miss it I'm like you're not ready

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
you don't want this your dad told you to do it

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
you know calm when you're serious about it

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
whatever it is you need to hit bottom or I don't know

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
you can't instill willingness

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
so I spent a lot of time thinking about that

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
like how do you make somebody more willing

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
short of performing some kind of

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
inception they have to be

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
in a position of receptivity that's

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
often related to

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
suffering I don't know how to do that

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
they either got to show up serious about

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
and the first thing I do it's a series of very tactical

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
lessons I say unlock your phone

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'm going to look at your screen time

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
and I'm not going to make any judgments

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I watch porn I spend too much time

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
on tiktok so I'm not going to judge you

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
and then I say I find

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
8 to 12 hours a week

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
easily in screen time

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
coin base stupid shit trading stocks

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
on robin it I'm like we're going to

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
reallocate that time into three things

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
we're going to reallocate it into

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
fitness we're going to get really fucking strong

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
or much stronger right

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and there's apps that don't cost

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
any money or cost a little bit of money

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000

I'm going to track your fitness we're going to

spend three hours maybe four hours a week

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
just on fitness because you can feel better

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
about yourself and you can be stronger and it's going to

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
help your mental outlook

I don't care what it is

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
door dasher

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Uber driver I don't care what it is

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
you have to start making

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
some money the best way to make a lot of money is

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
to start making some money

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
some money right away

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
you got a smart phone you can make money

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
it's a full employment economy

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
right you're not too good

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
to whatever it is work at CVS whatever

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
it is you got to make some money even if it's

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
fifty a hundred bucks whatever it's two hundred bucks

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
we got to start making some money because you'll get a taste

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
for the flesh of money money's wonderful

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
right you're not going to have to ask your parents

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
for all this shit are you going to feel a little bit better about yourself

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
and then third thing is

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
you got to get every day out

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and be in the agency and company of strangers

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
right

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
church group non-profit

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
voter registration

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
riding class a league

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
go play tennis at the park

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
where they have round robins where you meet

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
whatever it is you have

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
to be in the company of strangers

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and when you're with strangers

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
you got to be supportive and nice and introduce yourself

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
and you're going to be

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
shocked how many nice people you meet out there

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
who like you don't like

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
you whatever it might be but we're going to get fit

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
we're going to make a little bit of money

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
and be around other people

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
and that's where we start

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
you know I don't know how to do goals I don't know

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I mean I'm not like that or tracking I'm like

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
like this is about sweat

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
it's about money and the company other people

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
does that advice apply to

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
the parents

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
who have the teen

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
who's in the basement playing video games

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and vaping because I don't know about you Scott

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
but sometimes

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
those people have to hear it

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
from somebody else other than their parent

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
the parent is often challenged

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
and the advice doesn't land in the same way

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
as like

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
your buddy

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
who comes over and is much cooler than you

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
no matter how cool you are

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
my kids

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
especially my 16 year old is more inclined to take advice

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
from you than from me right now

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
yeah and vice versa

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
that's exactly right

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and that's the way it is

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
and it probably should be that way

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
we have a healthy

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
instinct such that it's easier for us to leave the pack

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
when the time comes to leave the pack

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
where we start thinking our parents are idiots

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
that just happens especially with men

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
and it's quite friendly it's healthy

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
so there's studies showing that the most

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
impactful thing on your kids

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
your sons is their friends

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
and also your friends' fathers

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
and not what you say

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
but how you model it

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
well I figured out once boys kind of hit 13

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
they don't listen to anything you say the best you can do is model

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I try to get my kids to be

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
you know good manners so I'm really conscious

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
of my table manners when I'm around my boys

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
the first thing when visitors show up

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I run out to the car and I grab their luggage

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and ask them to help me

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I think you got to model it but there's

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
what you're saying is a proven phenomena

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
boys are much more inclined to listen to their friends

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
and their friends' dads

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
and parents than you

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
so just trying to surround them with good positive role models

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
and also

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
my 16 year old said he loved

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
we have this friend Tom Clark

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I just love Tom he's the coolest guy

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
and immediately I just got a little jealous on the left side

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and I thought you know we should really

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
vacation with that family because he's a good man

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
he's a good role model he knows my son likes him

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
and he's gonna have

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
an easier time getting through to important things

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
so and also I think with parents

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
when I tell parents when they reach out

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I'm like forgive yourself

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
what I found is that

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
if you want to believe in nature over nurture

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
just have two kids

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
you know I don't know how yours are

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
the only thing I know about having a second kid

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
is you know it's gonna be totally different

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
yeah you realize

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
they come out who they are

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and you guide and put the guard rails up

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
and you know try to exert

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
a good influence on them but

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
they pretty much come out

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
in a certain way

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
baked and that's not gonna change

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
well like Michelle Obama said

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
they come to you and the best description I've heard is

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
you're not an engineer

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
you know an engineer the sheep

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
you get to decide where they graze

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
you can point them in a direction

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
you get to decide what they eat

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
but the sheep comes to you

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I mean my 16 year old

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
when he was a kid

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
he would come into my room in the morning

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
and he would say dressed

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
say dad let's make a plan

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I was like okay where are the cameras

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
it was like something out of a hallmark channel

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
easy, nice, sweet

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
my younger one

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
is a terrorist constantly assessing

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
a terror but at the same time

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
it's like owning a stock

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
the lows are lower, volatile stock

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
but the highs are higher

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
he's so funny, so crazy

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
so bold and with his emotions

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and so loving

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
they're just different people

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
and we just haven't treated him that much

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
differently so when one of them

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
isn't doing well

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
and it's hard to tell your partner this

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
or whatever I tell their parents is

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
forgive yourself because

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
yeah you're important

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
and you can shape stuff but

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
you know the only thing I

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
found with my boys

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
you give them the advice you can

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
you give them the help you can but the only thing that's really fixed

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
any real problems they faced

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
is time

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
and I just see

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
it brings the house down when kids aren't doing well

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
it just brings the house down and it's like

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
the parents don't know what to do they're beside themselves

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
and the first thing I say

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I have a couple friends who are really starting with their kids

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
you're doing your best, you're a good person

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
you're doing your best

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
it's tough

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
when the kid is struggling

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
it's really hard to think about anything else

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
brings the house down

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
you're so good on

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
tech and your kind of predictions

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
and your 10,000 foot view

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
on you know trends

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I would be remiss in not asking

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
a question that I'm personally

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
invested in which is

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
how do you see the current and future

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
state of podcasting

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
what's your sense of what this ecosystem

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
is kind of all about right now

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
and where is it heading

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
in a way that maybe we you know

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
is counterintuitive

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I don't know if it's counterintuitive but

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
podcasting sort of

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
in many ways represents where America has had it

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
in a bit of a negative way in that it's

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
income inequality gone crazy

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
there's 1.7 million podcasts

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I would bet

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
the top 500 do 98% of the

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and 120% of the profits

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
yeah I would think it might even be

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
more skewed than that

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
well Joe Rogan does 190 million

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
downloads he's number one

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and a really good podcast and the top

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
100 does 2 or 3 million I mean it just

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
drops off a cliff and then

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
you know I would bet 99.9%

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
of podcasts are not self sustaining

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
so

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I mean do as I say not as I do

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
going into podcasting

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
get psychic reward for it use it to market

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
something else but to think you're going to

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
make a living in podcasting just be clear

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
that you better be in the top 0.01%

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
because it's very

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
difficult it's a small business

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
you know a successful

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
podcast as several million in revenue

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
but it's a very profitable

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
business once you get to that point and the thing

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
as a medium it's not only

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
growing but its CPMs are going up

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
because the thing about the medium

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
the medium is the message

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I can tell how someone has been introduced

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
to me based on the way they behave

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
if someone high fives me I know

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
they've seen a video if someone

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
comes up and wants to have or sends me

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
a really long email or they come up

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
and they hold my hands and they look into my eyes

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I know they've read something

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I've written that doesn't resonated

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
when someone comes up to me I'm curious

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
what this happens to you and they start speaking

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
to you as if you know them

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
oh it's a podcast

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
and they'll say often I'm like oh you

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
don't know me because you're in their

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
ears you're physically in their ears

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
typically when they're doing

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
something intimate walking their dog

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
hanging out with their spouse

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
making breakfast they feel like

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
they're your friend and that's the most

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
rewarding thing about podcasting

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
is you just have friends

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
it's a parasocial relationship

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
and it's very intimate and there's a sense

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
of trust and friendship even if it's

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
imagined that is

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
projected onto you so I have that experience

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
a lot and it's very gratifying

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
because it's like you do know me I'm showing up

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
as who I am I think it's fantastic

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and I think it's it makes it

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
a very unique form

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
of infotainment right

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
it's portable you can do something else

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
while you're doing it and the intimacy

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
and the trust that's built with the host

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I think is

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
is also something that's

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
tremendously unique in the media

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
landscape that I'm not sure

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
the kind of

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
advertising landscape

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
around podcasting has fully

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
like acknowledged or recognized

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
like it's very different like

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
when Tom Broca is delivering the news

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
and then they cut to an ad he's not endorsing

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
the product

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
that ad is running independent of anything that

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
host readovers yeah and so in podcasting

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
when a host says hey listen I found this product

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I think it's great you know and here's why

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
and there's that implicit trust that's been built

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
over many years there's

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
much more value in that that I don't know

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
if it's totally

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
appreciated and I also think

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
at the same time podcasting

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
advertising is tremendously

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
underpriced in terms of marketing

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
spend and it's confusing to me

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
why Fortune 500 companies

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
larger enterprises that have huge

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
marketing budgets continue

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
to deploy those resources on television

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
advertising and all kinds of other

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
nonsense that doesn't convert

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
when they could take a fraction

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
of that and deploy it against

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
podcasts that

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
are host

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
lead and

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
speaking to the specific demographic

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
that that organization is trying to reach

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
just seems like a better plan

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
to me and the companies that get it

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
really get it and they're building amazing

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
companies you know on the shoulders

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
of podcasters but it still

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
feels like it's a niche thing

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
yeah it's look it's a small business

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
right now but it's growing 12%

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
a year there's very few mediums outside

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
of search and social that are growing double digits

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
in a media landscape where people are cutting

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
back media spending

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
so you set up a

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
media company

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
on probably I don't know

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
half a million million two million

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
dollar investment for you to set up

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
a TV show or TV station

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
or a music label

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
or I mean

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
you have been able to set up a media

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
company

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
at a fairly like

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
and you could probably pay as you go

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
and invest as you go yeah I mean I've been doing this for 11 years

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
you know started off

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
yeah I mean I've been doing it a long time

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
and it was just you know me and

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
my step son you know running the whole thing

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
it wasn't like this out of the gate like this

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
just happened very incrementally over time

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
but you have

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
traditionally in media

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
you just couldn't do that

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
you didn't have access you couldn't you couldn't be on ABC

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I mean you just there was like three channels

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
or to start a newspaper

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
or start a magazine took real like took

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
so much money took so much

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
so I do think

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
that if you're really good at what you do

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I write books that shit's hard

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
podcasting

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I mean this is what you've surrounded yourself

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
with smart people and you're creating

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
a thick layer of innovation on top of it

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
but this is just you being you

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
you're a naturally curious guy

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
and you respond authentically

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
and you make money doing that

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
you make money doing that

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
yeah now you know why I'm waiting

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
for someone to break the door down

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
and tell me to stand

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
step away from the microphone that's just a gift

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
right it's an incredible gift

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
incredible change my life

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
change yours

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
yeah yeah

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
well I appreciate you man

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I gotta let you go but

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I think your real service

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
you know I think your message

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
is really important and

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
there are so many

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
people who are in need of

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
advice and solid mentorship

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
and the fact that you do that digitally

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
and in person with the clarity

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
of thought and in this mission

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
based way that you do it I think is really

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
worthy of note and

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I just want you to know that like

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I acknowledge you for that and

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
