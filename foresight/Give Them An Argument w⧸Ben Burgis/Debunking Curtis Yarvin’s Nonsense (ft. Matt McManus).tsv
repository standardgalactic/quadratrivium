0	12000	So I had a debate with Curtis Yarvin a few months ago.
12000	17000	It was actually the day before the previous live show, the one we did in LA.
17000	22000	I was in Chicago debating Yarvin.
22000	27000	I don't know if I got my donuts worth from that debate,
27000	32000	because a lot of it ended up being about,
32000	35000	I mean, in fact, the debate was much more about history
35000	37000	than I thought it was going to be coming into it.
37000	41000	Because I thought, I thought we were going to be debating principles.
41000	43000	It was about democracy.
43000	49000	And Yarvin is sometimes sort of like in his more provocative moments.
49000	51000	He'll call himself a monarchist,
51000	55000	where we can hear from Matt in a minute what he means by that.
56000	62000	So I thought we were going to be arguing about democratic principles.
62000	67000	But Yarvin, I think, was manifestly uninterested in doing that,
67000	71000	or really in arguing about much of anything.
71000	76000	And a lot of it ended up being, because he made these claims,
76000	79000	and he did a one-on-one,
79000	82000	we both did one-on-one conversations with the moderator,
82000	84000	Thaddeus Russell, before the debate between the two of us.
85000	88000	And so at the very, very beginning, Thaddeus asked,
88000	90000	okay, do you have anything you want to respond to?
90000	92000	And I was like, yeah, a lot, right?
94000	96000	It did have one of my favorite comments in the whole year, though,
96000	99000	when he's like, well, yeah, of course, if you look at what historians say,
99000	100000	they're going to agree with you, right?
100000	102000	It's like, oh, yeah.
103000	106000	Yeah, that is a new one to me.
106000	110000	I have never received that particular critique that I assume
110000	114000	that what historians say when I read them
114000	117000	is going to inform me about what happened in history.
117000	120000	And apparently, this is a totally wrong assumption,
120000	123000	and in fact, shows that I've been so brainwashed by the cathedral
123000	126000	that everything I say can be disregarded,
126000	130000	because I'm just assuming that you could read books
130000	134000	and gather information about what happened in the past
134000	138000	is the model that I'm working on.
138000	141000	Although, in this sort of previous exchange
141000	144000	with Adnan earlier today on social media,
146000	149000	you brought this up from our debate,
149000	151000	and you did point out something,
151000	153000	you put your finger on something that really infuriated me
153000	155000	with that debate,
155000	158000	if infuriated is too strong, it was frustrated in that debate,
158000	162000	which is that there's a lot of slippage.
163000	166000	And Matt has read far more
166000	168000	of Jarvan's written work that I have.
168000	170000	You know, I did some research before the debate,
170000	172000	but nothing like what Matt has been putting himself through
172000	175000	to write this Common Wheel article about Jarvan.
175000	179000	But this certainly seems to be a lot of slippage in general.
179000	183000	It's certainly the debate with me between people in the past
183000	189000	thought X, and you should believe right now that X is true.
190000	193000	Because, you know, it's like there's a point early on
193000	196000	where he was like, well, you know,
196000	199000	so I should say, just to set this up just a little bit,
199000	203000	that a lot of the sort of historical debate,
203000	206000	and it was about U.S. imperialism in Latin America,
206000	209000	and whether, you know, like Jarvan thought like,
209000	212000	oh, we're doing like too much promotion of democracy
212000	214000	in other countries that we're just, you know,
214000	216000	that we're that like, in fact, that was the problem that,
216000	218000	you know, the U.S. was just involved
218000	221000	in idealistic democracy promotion that was going wrong.
222000	225000	And my view is what the fuck are you talking about?
225000	229000	The United States has, you know,
229000	231000	especially specifically Latin America,
231000	233000	and I think he'd even mentioned Haiti.
233000	234000	I think he was the first one to do that.
234000	236000	I was like, look, I mean, how many times
236000	239000	has the United States overthrown elected governments of Haiti?
239000	241000	How many times has the United States overthrown
241000	243000	democratically elected left-wing governments
243000	245000	around Latin America?
245000	248000	I brought up, you know, some of the obvious examples,
248000	252000	you know, about Salvador Yende and et cetera, et cetera.
252000	254000	And, you know, he always had something to say about it,
254000	256000	but he didn't quite address the point.
256000	258000	You know, it was like, oh, well, Salvador Yende
258000	260000	was a very Americanized cosmopolitan, you know,
260000	262000	and Pinochet was like a real Chilean.
262000	264000	It was like, okay, let's say that this is an accurate
264000	266000	bit of cultural commentary.
266000	267000	So the fuck what?
267000	271000	What is that to do with anything that we're arguing about?
271000	273000	He loved his people enough to send 7,000 of them
273000	276000	to an early grave in Chile's native solo ill, right?
276000	278000	You know, what else could the motherland want?
278000	279000	Yeah, exactly.
279000	281000	And he kept telling me that I should be reading
281000	284000	more original sources on Google Books, which is, you know,
284000	286000	fine if you want to throw that at the end.
286000	290000	But it's also, you know, I mean, what?
290000	292000	It's a horrible waste of time during debate.
292000	294000	Like, I thought we were there to, like,
294000	297000	make arguments to each other and respond to each other's points.
297000	300000	And if you say, instead of, like, actually responding
300000	302000	to the specific things I say, you just say,
302000	305000	oh, you seem very entrapped by this worldview.
305000	307000	You know, here are some books you should read.
307000	309000	You know, it's like, well, that doesn't respond to the substance
309000	310000	of anything.
310000	313000	But also, you know, so this came out,
313000	315000	what Adnan's talking about, the slippage,
315000	320000	I think came out most vividly in the discussion about Haiti.
320000	326000	Because my view, you know, look,
326000	330000	my view of why Haiti is as much of a mess as it is right now
330000	337000	is that it has been constantly fucked over
337000	341000	by imperial powers going back to the inception of the country
341000	346000	and the slave revolution that threw off the French
346000	354000	and eventually to have the country be allowed to exist
354000	357000	for France to stop trying to intervene against them.
357000	360000	They had to make this treaty where they had to agree
360000	366000	to pay back the French for the reverse reparations,
366000	369000	you know, for the lost property in the slave revolution.
369000	371000	So let me think about, like, the slave owners, right?
371000	374000	Think about all the hard work that they put in to managing
374000	377000	those slave enterprises, getting the people into line.
377000	380000	Nobody ever thinks about them and their contribution.
380000	383000	Why does it, yeah, Helen Lovejoy voice, why would anyone
383000	387000	do that?
387000	392000	So, and they didn't finish paying that off until, I think,
392000	396000	like 1947 is when it was finally, like, it ended up being
396000	398000	transferred during one of the U.S. occupations,
398000	400000	I think the one in the 30s, ended up being transferred
400000	403000	to a U.S. bank, what they still owed, but they finished
403000	407000	paying it off in 1947, very shortly after that,
407000	411000	like within like 10 years of that, breathing room,
411000	414000	they were saddled with Papa Doc de Valier,
414000	418000	who was a really brutal, like kind of death squad dictator,
418000	421000	who was back to the hilt by the United States
421000	424000	for standard Cold War anti-communist reasons.
424000	429000	Poppy Doc was succeeded by Baby Doc,
429000	435000	and who, you know, friend of Mother Teresa,
435000	437000	but not particularly nice person,
437000	441000	and then the de Valier regime was finally overthrown.
441000	444000	You know, it's like the late 80s, they had the, you know,
444000	448000	the very first democratically elected president of Haiti,
448000	452000	Jean Bertrand, Aristide, you know, after the post-de Valiers,
452000	456000	not the first ever, but the first post-de Valiers was removed
456000	459000	in a coup where it's an open question, you know,
459000	462000	it's not a matter of dispute that a lot of the military
462000	465000	officers involved were on the CIA payroll,
465000	467000	like everybody acknowledges that.
467000	469000	It's an open question whether the company had any knowledge
469000	473000	of it, like beforehand, you know, that they,
473000	474000	or whether it was just that, you know,
474000	476000	they had a relationship with these guys,
476000	478000	and, you know, coincidentally, there was a coup,
478000	482000	but at any rate, you know, the United States did actually
482000	485000	intervene under Clinton to put him back,
485000	488000	but then it intervened again under Bush to remove him
488000	492000	at this point directly by U.S. Marines.
492000	494000	Aristide's political party, Lavalas, is, like,
494000	498000	not allowed to participate in a bunch of future elections.
498000	503000	The current president of Haiti, who after the one just now,
503000	506000	Moise, was assassinated by some guys who seem to have
506000	511000	a lot of connections to Miami, is the guy who came in after
511000	514000	who were and who nobody voted for and refuses to hold elections
514000	517000	and is strongly supported by the United States,
517000	520000	all of which is just to say, I think it's not a great mystery
520000	522000	how Haiti got to be the way that it is.
522000	524000	I think there's, like, a pretty straightforward material
524000	526000	explanation of this.
526000	532000	Jarvan's view, as far as I can tell, is he was coy
532000	534000	about whether it was cultural or genetic,
534000	538000	but he seems to have some sort of racial explanation.
538000	540000	He said...
540000	541000	Oh, he does.
541000	542000	I'll quote from his book.
542000	545000	This is his text, Muldbug on Carlisle, where he says,
546000	548000	In Haiti, we see one aspect of life without promises made
548000	552000	and kept, poverty, corruption, violence, and filth.
552000	554000	In a word, anarchy.
554000	556000	Haiti is the product of the persistence of human anarchy
556000	558000	and an excellent symbol because it symbolizes exactly
558000	560000	the same thing to Carlisle and Freud.
560000	564000	Haiti is far more anarchic now than was in 1888,
564000	567000	which, of course, whose port-a-prince is the paradise
567000	569000	next to today's.
569000	571000	The 19th century is Haiti is the 21st century's
571000	574000	whole third world, so it doesn't really take a genius
574000	576000	to sit there and extract all these references to filth
576000	578000	and garbage and trash.
578000	581000	And it's connections with the third world and Haiti
581000	583000	and drawn association between that
583000	585000	and all kinds of horrible racist views.
585000	590000	Well, he said, in the discussion with Bea,
590000	593000	he said that, well, when I think of a country,
593000	596000	I think of a people, and then he did the exact slippage
596000	598000	that Adnan was talking about, where he says,
598000	602000	well, you know, if you read, you know, go on Google Books,
603000	606000	Google Scholar, you know, you read these old books.
606000	608000	Everybody in like the 19th, you know,
608000	611000	certainly the 18th century assumes that there are these
611000	613000	real things that are like national characters,
613000	616000	that entire peoples have a certain character, whatever.
616000	618000	And the implications certainly seem to be that,
618000	622000	well, since they thought so, it must be true.
622000	626000	And I just, you know, like, I mean, just crassly,
626000	629000	I mean, my intuitive response to that is okay.
629000	633000	I mean, if you go back to like 1810, yeah, sure.
633000	635000	I mean, everybody more or less thought that,
635000	637000	but, you know, everybody thought all kinds
637000	638000	of other stupid shit, too.
638000	640000	I mean, like, why is it, you know,
640000	644000	why is like a view having been popular in 1810
644000	647000	a recommendation for...
648000	650000	Let's be clear, you know, the normal reactionary,
650000	653000	and I've met a lot of them, hasn't psychologically
653000	655000	come to terms with the French Revolution.
655000	656000	It's still a store spot.
656000	660000	Mulbug is so fucking old fashioned that he's still sore,
660000	662000	not just about the American Revolution,
662000	664000	although he's really sore about that.
664000	666000	He's pissed off about the English Civil War, right?
666000	669000	That's how fucking far back his grievances go.
669000	672000	That's a special kind of reactionary, right?
672000	675000	That's like the point where even Joseph de Maestra
675000	677000	in the 18th century would have been like,
677000	679000	okay, man, you know, it's time to get over it,
679000	681000	you know, when things have happened, it'll be okay.
681000	684000	Pat on the head, glass of wine, cigarette,
684000	686000	you know, it'll be fine, right?
686000	688000	Although I do have to say, Mulbug is entertaining
688000	690000	in the way that he'll sometimes tattle on himself
690000	692000	about his more so-called advanced views.
692000	694000	It kind of reminded me when I was reading him
694000	697000	of what Kanye did during that interview with Alex Jones,
697000	699000	where Jones offered him that beautiful off-ramp,
699000	700000	but he was like, you're not a Nazi,
700000	701000	they're trying to insult you,
701000	703000	and Tony was like, whoa!
703000	705000	You know, just decided to just avoid
705000	707000	the easiest off-ramp in history,
707000	709000	because at one point in his book,
709000	710000	a general introduction...
710000	712000	Yeah, when Jones was like, you know,
712000	714000	the Nazis did a lot of bad things, right?
714000	716000	And Kanye was like, I think they did a lot of good things, too!
716000	718000	Yeah, exactly.
718000	720000	But I mean, at one point in his book,
720000	722000	a gentle introduction to unqualified reservations,
722000	724000	Mulbug is musing a little bit on fascism,
724000	726000	and he's like, you know, it just occurred to me
726000	728000	that Hitler reads a lot like me
728000	730000	if I were to lose 25 IQ points
730000	733000	and contract a bad case of syphilis.
733000	735000	And I'm like, did you just fucking tattle on yourself?
735000	737000	And you're like, wow, it's kind of weird
737000	739000	how I sound an awful lot like Hitler.
739000	741000	Eh, what can you do about it, right?
741000	743000	You know, a lesser man might take that as an opportunity
743000	745000	to reflect on himself a little bit.
745000	746000	They would, yeah.
746000	748000	You know, say,
748000	751000	is it good to sound like Hitler?
751000	754000	But, oh yeah, I'm pleased.
754000	757000	Yeah, I just wanted to come in there because I think, you know,
757000	760000	Matt, what you said strikes a chord with me
760000	763000	because in trying to think of how to make sense
763000	767000	to some of the absurd things he was saying in that discussion,
767000	770000	it suddenly occurred to me that if he is a monarchist,
770000	773000	if he is such a reactionary conservative,
773000	776000	he would look upon the American Revolution,
776000	780000	the French Revolution, all of these things as horrible,
780000	783000	you know, turns away from tradition.
783000	787000	And as a result,
787000	789000	I mean, there's two things going on.
789000	794000	One is that he's decrying any of these changes and developments
794000	799000	so that when he's saying that America
799000	804000	is this liberal order that tries to globalize its system,
804000	808000	he, you know, there's a certain point from the perspective
808000	813000	of a monarchist that America, you know, supported and sponsored,
813000	817000	you know, was in favor of Republican revolutions
817000	821000	in, say, the New World, you know, you have the Bolivarian,
821000	824000	you know, transformation of South America.
824000	827000	Like, so there are things that he could, you know,
827000	833000	fall back on in his analysis to think that this is all part
833000	839000	of a turn in history, you know, that has gone down the wrong path.
839000	844000	And so it's the cathedral, you know, it's this new system,
844000	847000	it's this consensus, all these historians are operating
847000	851000	under the same, you know, terms and it's all illegitimate
851000	853000	as far as he's concerned.
853000	855000	Everything, really, he can pick and choose
855000	858000	and say it's all illegitimate if he doesn't like it
858000	862000	because it's this departure from that historical moment.
862000	866000	And the second thing is that he, when he, you know, articulates
866000	870000	his view on America, you know, being this liberal, globalizing,
870000	874000	you know, he's against the Monroe doctrine, you know,
874000	881000	he's against Wilson's 14 points because he believes
881000	886000	that America actually operates according to those documents
886000	891000	and not according to actual historical, you know, evidence.
891000	895000	Yeah, you're not, like, when Yorven talks about, you know,
895000	897000	the United States policy towards Latin America,
897000	899000	I don't think the expression United Fruit Company is going
899000	901000	to come up very often.
901000	905000	It is not, no, but also like, you know, Wilson, he thinks Wilson
905000	908000	is trying to promote democracy throughout the world.
908000	911000	Well, you know, as it happens, you know, if you're a Middle East
911000	916000	historian, you know that Wilson completely betrayed this,
916000	919000	you know, he meant fit for Europe and he was caught
919000	922000	by the contradiction, you know, at the Paris Peace Conference.
922000	926000	There were attempts to present new constitutional kind
926000	930000	of government, you know, they had a kind of constitutional
930000	935000	convention in Damascus in 1920, 1920, you know, 2021,
935000	937000	and they proposed the probably the most progressive
937000	940000	constitution in the history of the Arab world.
940000	943000	And of course, the powers did not accept that.
943000	946000	They turned over the Middle East to the British and the French,
946000	948000	you know, which is what he would have wanted.
948000	952000	So he doesn't even know and understand that the so-called
952000	956000	primary documents that he reads, you know, to understand,
956000	960000	you know, American political thought and so on, you know,
960000	963000	he doesn't know how to put them into any kind of context
963000	967000	and how to read them in their context to really
967000	969000	understand what they meant.
969000	973000	You know, who would help with that would be historians.
973000	975000	Who would?
975000	978000	You know, you could read some of those, you know,
978000	981000	some of those books by historians that, like, again,
981000	984000	yes, I could not, like, I could not emphasize enough
984000	986000	that that was his critique, that like, you know,
986000	988000	that like what I thought about what had happened in history
988000	991000	is like what most, you know, like historians thought,
991000	995000	you know, is okay.
995000	999000	I should point out, this is a man who said in one of his first
999000	1001000	major pieces of writing, which has just led into an
1001000	1004000	open-minded progressive, that it wasn't the case that people
1004000	1006000	like Chomsky were dissident intellectuals.
1006000	1009000	In fact, Noam Chomsky and C. Wright Mills were the power
1009000	1012000	elites of the United States at their time.
1012000	1014000	And apparently wielded more influence than the police that
1014000	1017000	were arresting people like Miller Chomsky, right,
1017000	1020000	which is just a staggering bit of historical imagination
1020000	1022000	if nothing else, right?
1022000	1025000	Yeah, I mean, I remember actually an old documentary
1025000	1031000	I saw about Noam Chomsky that his wife went to,
1031000	1034000	during this period of like anti-Vietnam War protests,
1034000	1037000	you know, she went back to school, got to grad school
1037000	1039000	because she figured there was a good chance that Noam
1039000	1042000	was going to be in prison and she was going to have to
1042000	1046000	support the family when that happened, you know.
1046000	1048000	So I don't think the Chomsky family were under the
1049000	1052000	impression that they were part of the power elite and
1052000	1055000	making decisions, but this does actually get to
1055000	1057000	something really important in the art of it, right?
1057000	1060000	So, and by the way, if anybody's watching this and
1060000	1063000	thinks, okay, why are you talking about this bizarre
1063000	1068000	reactionary crank who is, you know, like, you know,
1068000	1070000	is mad about the American Revolution happening,
1070000	1074000	like, you know, why is this guy worth the breath?
1074000	1078000	I would point out that J.D. Vance,
1078000	1081000	who was just elected to the Senate from Ohio,
1081000	1084000	has actually on the campaign trail and interviews.
1084000	1089000	He referenced Yarvin as a friend and an influence on him.
1089000	1092000	Well, so has Bannon and a bunch of the other fine people.
1092000	1095000	Steve Bannon has done that.
1095000	1098000	The Blake Masters was almost just elected at Arizona.
1098000	1102000	The Senate has done the same thing, you know, this guy.
1102000	1103000	Peter Thiel.
1103000	1104000	Yeah.
1104000	1106000	I mean, Peter, of course, the reason we've all heard of him
1106000	1110000	in the first place is because Peter Thiel decided he was
1110000	1114000	he was interested and, you know,
1114000	1115000	him out of his obscurity.
1115000	1117000	But now, unfortunately, he's not at all obscure.
1117000	1120000	And he does probably need to be dealt with.
1120000	1123000	But the thing something that just said, I mean,
1123000	1125000	I wanted to go to, because I mean, I think this is a really
1125000	1126000	important point.
1126000	1129000	In fact, in a weird way, goes back to what I was,
1129000	1131000	Adnan and I were just talking about with Harvey,
1131000	1133000	about the theory of history, because, you know,
1133000	1139000	he has this like really deeply idealist view about all this
1139000	1143000	stuff that he like ideas are primary, which, which is why,
1143000	1146000	like, you know, like that bizarre comment about,
1146000	1148000	you know, I'm Chomsky and see right mills running the world,
1148000	1150000	you know, like that, that's, that's, you know,
1150000	1155000	what he calls the cathedral is, is like academics and journalists.
1155000	1157000	And, you know, but he thinks that well,
1157000	1160000	because those people set, you know, the, you know,
1160000	1163000	they produce the ideas that that, you know,
1163000	1165000	that means that like what, you know,
1165000	1168000	literal decision makers do is just downstream of that.
1168000	1171000	And so like really it's the, it's the idea of people,
1171000	1174000	the academics and journalists who run the world.
1174000	1177000	Yeah, I should say this pension for idealism as Mark
1177000	1180000	detected is always more common in reactionaries than it is
1180000	1181000	in leftist thinkers.
1181000	1183000	And it's very easy to see why, right?
1183000	1187000	If you blame any social discontent on the distribution of
1187000	1190000	bad ideas, then the fault lies with intellectuals,
1190000	1192000	journalists, that people are stirring up trouble.
1192000	1195000	If you're a materialist, then you have to say the problem lies
1195000	1198000	in relations of power, material conditions,
1198000	1201000	how people are actually doing, and that inevitably leads you
1201000	1204000	to adopt at least a somewhat critical disposition since these
1204000	1207000	are things that you can't just chalk up to a bunch of
1207000	1210000	troublemakers spreading a bunch of gossip and propaganda.
1210000	1212000	But I think that there is something that is actually pretty
1212000	1214000	unique about YARVEN.
1214000	1216000	And I say this not with respect,
1216000	1218000	but actually with a lot of disdain.
1218000	1220000	Because from an intellectual standpoint,
1220000	1223000	his arguments are really cheap and bad.
1223000	1228000	And often, as Aiden said, historically really out there.
1228000	1230000	Like trying to say that the biggest problem with the U.S.
1230000	1233000	foreign policy over the course of the 20th century is that
1233000	1235000	people were too soft on communism.
1235000	1238000	The only thing you can kind of do is roll your eye and say,
1238000	1239000	oh, so you think that, eh?
1239000	1240000	Okay, well, whatever.
1240000	1244000	I know a few million peasants in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia
1244000	1246000	who'd like a word about that.
1246000	1247000	Yeah, absolutely.
1247000	1251000	But what's distinct about him is, again,
1251000	1255000	this attempt to reconcile libertarianism with this very
1255000	1257000	authoritarian political program.
1257000	1259000	Now, he's not the first to accomplish this.
1259000	1261000	And he's certainly not going to be the last.
1261000	1264000	But what's really interesting that you can see over the course
1264000	1268000	of his writings is a transition from really believing in the
1268000	1272000	writings of people like Marie-Raphaard or Ludwig von
1272000	1273000	Misa.
1273000	1275000	And then coming to the very Marxist, I should say,
1275000	1278000	conclusion that actually people will not be satisfied living
1278000	1280000	in this kind of libertarian universe.
1280000	1283000	And that the freedoms that people like Raphard and
1283000	1286000	Viennese want can't actually be secured without an extremely
1286000	1292000	strong state there to actually compel people to adhere to this
1292000	1293000	kind of program.
1293000	1296000	And what's really interesting is he's sometimes very overt
1296000	1300000	about that, where he says most people suck, as I put it,
1300000	1301000	the masses suck.
1301000	1304000	And they're not going to actually advance programs that are
1304000	1307000	good for them, which is precisely why it is that we need the
1307000	1311000	CEO and chief, this American Caesar, to create spaces for
1311000	1314000	freedom for the truly productive people who will go out
1314000	1316000	there and contribute everything that's meaningful in this
1316000	1317000	world.
1317000	1319000	And that's been a consistent through line in his work from
1319000	1321000	the very beginning, and it's still the case now.
1321000	1323000	One of the stupidest papers that he's written,
1323000	1326000	and that's a high threshold, let's put it that way,
1326000	1329000	came out very recently where he said, I'm bored with this
1329000	1330000	whole red pill metaphor.
1330000	1332000	Let's get toking-pilled instead.
1332000	1335000	And he actually condemns the conservative base for
1335000	1340000	imagining that in the future, they will get to share in any
1340000	1342000	kind of power once the left is defeated.
1342000	1345000	He characterizes the left as high elves in this.
1345000	1348000	He says that the job of the conservative base is to find
1348000	1351000	certain kinds of dark elves, that's the terminology he uses,
1351000	1354000	who will work on behalf of the Hobbits,
1354000	1356000	that's just named for the conservative base,
1356000	1359000	seize power, implement conservative policies,
1359000	1362000	and then the Hobbits will go back into their hold and let the
1362000	1364000	dark elves do their thing, which will include,
1364000	1367000	of course, banishing the high elves to god only fucking knows
1367000	1369000	where we're going, right?
1369000	1371000	Some kind of Gestapo.
1371000	1375000	And it's really, really, really, really disturbing when you
1375000	1378000	think that that's how much disdain he feels even for his
1378000	1380000	own base, right?
1380000	1383000	Most of you, we are going to be in charge,
1383000	1385000	we'll implement policies for you, but don't ever fucking
1385000	1387000	think that you're going to be get to have any kind of say in
1387000	1389000	how it is that you're governed.
1389000	1391000	It's our job to figure these things out for you.
1391000	1394000	It's your job to appreciate it and accept the fact that we're
1394000	1398000	banishing all these people for you.
1398000	1401000	Sounds like Hitler.
1401000	1404000	I mean, no wonder he saw an affinity.
1404000	1407000	Well, that's also fucking remarkable about this,
1407000	1412000	because if you would make one accusation against fascism,
1412000	1415000	I would not say that that accusation would be that fascism
1415000	1417000	is too democratic.
1417000	1419000	That's the biggest problem with it, you know?
1419000	1422000	When I think fascism, I don't typically lean to,
1422000	1425000	God, you know, that really indicates a lot of these
1425000	1427000	platonic problems with democracy.
1427000	1430000	But that's actually Jarvan's position, right?
1430000	1432000	That there are a number of different reasons why the right
1432000	1434000	shouldn't go fascist any longer.
1434000	1436000	Some of them are strategic and some of them are moral.
1436000	1438000	I'll give them that.
1438000	1440000	You know, he says Hitler did a few bad things here and there.
1440000	1443000	He's exaggerated, so-called, but a few bad things.
1443000	1445000	Wait, wait, wait a second.
1445000	1447000	Does he actually say that's exaggerated?
1447000	1449000	Oh, yeah, I mean, at one point he characterizes,
1449000	1451000	he would have quite put it this way, right?
1451000	1455000	The Axis powers as the rebellion and the allies as the actual
1455000	1458000	empire, because the Axis never aspired to world domination,
1458000	1460000	on his view.
1460000	1462000	The allies already ruled the world.
1462000	1464000	Cathedral dominates the globe.
1464000	1468000	And so the Axis were just rebelling against this world order
1468000	1470000	by the cathedral.
1470000	1472000	And he says, you know, I'm not making any kind of moral judgments
1472000	1474000	presenting it in this way, because yeah,
1474000	1476000	the Axis were still evil, but if you characterize something as
1476000	1478000	the empire and the Axis as the rebellion,
1478000	1481000	it's not hard if anybody's seen Star Wars to kind of infer
1481000	1483000	what the moral lesson is supposed to be,
1483000	1485000	at least historically.
1485000	1487000	Well, I mean, in the debate with me,
1487000	1489000	there's a point where he said, well,
1489000	1491000	it's, you know, yeah, people would say,
1491000	1493000	it's probably whatever.
1493000	1496000	But like, why weren't we going to war with, you know,
1496000	1498000	with Germany? Why not with the Soviet Union?
1498000	1501000	Because, you know, they were like, you know,
1501000	1503000	that really shows that, you know,
1503000	1505000	the sort of softness on communism, you know,
1505000	1509000	that like Roosevelt thought it was worth going to war with
1509000	1511000	Germany and not with the Soviet Union.
1511000	1514000	And, you know, I mean, my suggestion back to him was that
1514000	1518000	the Red Army was, you know, not in fact bombing London at the
1518000	1520000	point when, you know, when U.S.
1520000	1522000	policy has been escalated, right?
1522000	1525000	I mean, like this is, you know, the United States was not
1525000	1528000	the only player, you know, making decisions and reacting
1528000	1530000	to the decisions made by others, you know,
1530000	1532000	in this series of events, right?
1532000	1534000	I mean, like Germany, you know,
1534000	1537000	Germany was actually doing stuff leading up to the
1537000	1539000	United States and Germany, you know,
1539000	1541000	being in a state of war with each other,
1541000	1544000	ultimately, you know, declaring war on the U.S.
1544000	1547000	first after its ally, you know,
1547000	1549000	attacked it and, you know, whatever,
1549000	1554000	which is due to, you know, U.S., you know,
1554000	1557000	embargo and, you know, and demands against Japan,
1557000	1561000	but still, like just this idea that, like, you know,
1561000	1564000	I don't know, FDR and his advisors were just sitting around
1564000	1566000	with a map of the world, you know, deciding,
1566000	1569000	it's like, yeah, you know, who should we go to war with?
1569000	1571000	Let's do Germany because they're, like,
1571000	1573000	ideologically further than from us.
1573000	1575000	Yeah, I was babbling about that also.
1575000	1577000	Oh, what are you saying, Eddie?
1577000	1579000	I was just going to say, one of my favorite quotes
1579000	1581000	from Harry Truman whenever he was still in the,
1581000	1584000	was he in the house before he was vice president?
1584000	1587000	He actually said on the floor of whatever
1587000	1592000	a steer body he was in, let's back the winner
1592000	1595000	in the fight between Germany and Nazis,
1595000	1597000	you know, Nazi Germany and Russia.
1597000	1600000	If the Russians are winning, we back the Nazis,
1600000	1603000	and if the Nazis are winning, let's back Russia.
1603000	1606000	And I think that kind of sums up America's
1606000	1608000	foreign policy of that war.
1608000	1611000	Yeah, and what's also baffling about it that really frustrated me
1611000	1616000	is anybody who's been in high school knows about
1616000	1619000	the history of appeasement directed towards Germany
1619000	1621000	and the fascist powers, right?
1621000	1623000	And anybody who's actually looking to the matter
1623000	1625000	with any degree of sophistication,
1625000	1627000	and I strongly encourage people to read Richard Evans'
1627000	1629000	Third Reich Trilogy if they're interested,
1629000	1631000	I still think it's someone to work on the subject,
1631000	1633000	well, no, one of the reasons why the Nazis were shown
1633000	1636000	a soft hand at many points is there were plenty of people,
1636000	1639000	conservatives, liberals, and even a few socialists
1639000	1641000	in Western countries that actually admired
1641000	1643000	what they were doing, right?
1643000	1646000	They characterized Hitler as engaging in non-aggressive actions
1646000	1648000	when he remotorized the line land,
1648000	1651000	when he decided to enact the union with Austria.
1651000	1654000	They even said, well, he says this is going to be
1654000	1656000	his last territorial demand when he claims this
1656000	1657000	to date land.
1657000	1659000	Hitler can be a trustworthy figure, right?
1659000	1661000	Why would he lie to us?
1661000	1664000	You'd never see that kind of tolerant viewpoint
1664000	1668000	directed in the 20th century towards any communist power
1668000	1671000	that was gobbling up its neighbors in that way.
1671000	1673000	And the Western states would just be like,
1673000	1676000	oh, I guess Stalin is certainly a nice guy.
1676000	1678000	We can trust him when he says it's the last territorial demand
1678000	1679000	that he's going to make.
1679000	1682000	Now, thank God we did eventually go to war with them,
1682000	1685000	and if only we'd done it sooner, right?
1685000	1688000	But this entire historical narrative is completely
1688000	1690000	bogus and extremely self-serving,
1690000	1695000	and it does serve to whitewash
1695000	1697000	a lot of the history of the Second World War
1697000	1699000	and the horrible things that happened there,
1699000	1701000	even if Curtis will sometimes try to apply
1701000	1703000	some politically correct language
1703000	1705000	to imply that that's not what he's doing, right?
1705000	1707000	By saying, well, yeah, but of course the Nazis were evil.
1707000	1709000	Even if they were the resistance to the world empire,
1709000	1712000	they're still evil, so we shouldn't support them, right?
1712000	1714000	You know, from what I've read by Yarevan
1714000	1716000	and from the debate I had with him
1716000	1720000	from his debate with Jen Kueger, which I watched,
1720000	1723000	it seems to me like he's very slippery
1723000	1726000	about exactly what he wants,
1726000	1731000	because he has this kind of provocative mode
1731000	1734000	where he'll describe himself as a monarchist.
1734000	1736000	He'll say things like,
1736000	1739000	we want some Silicon Valley CEO
1739000	1742000	who says sometimes to become the American Augustus,
1743000	1745000	which, like...
1745000	1747000	He has a long parable in his earliest book, actually,
1747000	1750000	where Steve Jobs literally becomes
1750000	1752000	the lord and ruler of California.
1752000	1753000	Sure, why not?
1753000	1755000	He has a bit of fan fiction.
1755000	1758000	Yeah, so he'll say things like that,
1758000	1760000	which suggests that he, you know,
1760000	1762000	like taken literally would mean he's, like,
1762000	1766000	really seriously opposed to the American constitutional order,
1766000	1768000	but that he's got this sort of, like,
1768000	1771000	when he's out, you know, when he's retreated to the mod,
1771000	1773000	you know, he'll say,
1773000	1776000	well, all I really mean by monarchist is that
1776000	1779000	I think we should have a really, really strong executive branch.
1779000	1782000	And which, you know,
1782000	1784000	that would actually be more democratic,
1784000	1786000	because that's the only...
1786000	1788000	That's the only election that he pays attention to anyway,
1788000	1790000	is the president.
1790000	1792000	So, and really, you know,
1792000	1795000	because the Constitution uses the phrase chief executive,
1795000	1797000	so which he interprets,
1797000	1799000	like I'm not saying about context,
1799000	1801000	you know, he interprets as, like,
1801000	1803000	meaning, like, you know, a CEO and a corporation,
1803000	1805000	which is obviously a metaphor
1805000	1807000	that would not have been available to anybody
1807000	1809000	who was writing the Constitution.
1809000	1812000	But, you know, he says,
1812000	1814000	well, if you let, you know,
1814000	1816000	democratically elected presidents exercise
1816000	1818000	more or less absolute power,
1818000	1821000	then that would actually be the most democratic thing of all,
1821000	1824000	because who pays attention to congressional elections?
1824000	1828000	And so, and then, like,
1828000	1830000	sometimes he'll even say, well, you know,
1830000	1832000	FDR was basically like a king,
1832000	1835000	because, you know,
1835000	1837000	Congress was a rubber stamp,
1837000	1839000	and he could do whatever he wants,
1839000	1841000	which, you know,
1841000	1843000	it seems to me there's a lot of...
1843000	1845000	There's this big gap, you know,
1845000	1847000	between those three proposals that is toggling
1847000	1849000	back and forth between,
1849000	1851000	which are, you should have FDR,
1851000	1853000	in other words, you should have, like,
1853000	1855000	a president who's so popular
1855000	1857000	that, you know, congressmen feel pressured
1857000	1859000	to support his policies,
1859000	1861000	because they don't want their constituents to get mad at them,
1861000	1865000	which is, you know, fine.
1865000	1869000	Between that and presidents
1869000	1871000	should basically have all the power
1871000	1873000	and Congress should have none,
1873000	1875000	which, you know, makes me a little nervous,
1875000	1877000	I think about George W. Bush
1877000	1879000	and the ways that executive power
1879000	1881000	was expanded during the Bush administration,
1881000	1883000	to do things like, you know,
1883000	1885000	to entertain and torture people
1885000	1887000	and, you know,
1887000	1889000	send troops all over the world and et cetera, et cetera.
1889000	1891000	But even that
1891000	1893000	isn't an American Augustus.
1893000	1895000	I mean, American Augustus would, like, you know,
1895000	1897000	like, again, take it literally,
1897000	1899000	that would mean that we just, you know,
1899000	1901000	that we just don't have
1901000	1903000	a republic anymore, right?
1903000	1905000	I mean, that's what Augustus's
1905000	1907000	role was.
1907000	1909000	So as far as you can tell,
1909000	1911000	what does he actually want,
1911000	1913000	or does he just, like,
1913000	1915000	or does he just enjoy the game
1915000	1917000	of keeping people guessing?
1917000	1919000	Oh, I think it's very clear what he wants.
1919000	1921000	But I will say just to your point,
1921000	1923000	this is one of the areas where I think he's a pioneer
1923000	1925000	of sort.
1925000	1927000	And I wish I had read his work before I wrote my book
1927000	1929000	on postmodern conservatism, because I would have actually
1929000	1931000	just been, here's patient zero, right?
1931000	1933000	Because the way that he writes, including using
1933000	1935000	the pseudonym
1935000	1937000	writing on a blog, all these kind of pop culture
1937000	1939000	references that are intertwined
1939000	1941000	by a highfalutin kind of appeals
1941000	1943000	to any number of different figures,
1943000	1945000	esoteric figures in the reactionary tradition.
1945000	1947000	It means that any time
1947000	1949000	where he's pressured in the way that you're talking about,
1949000	1951000	he can retreat into the argument that
1951000	1953000	he's just joking, or that this is just
1953000	1955000	irony, or that this isn't meant to be taken
1955000	1957000	literally, or sometimes we even just say,
1957000	1959000	of course this will never actually happen, so it's just
1959000	1961000	a thought experiment, right?
1961000	1963000	And this is a very good defensive way
1963000	1965000	of guarding himself against
1965000	1967000	accusations of any kind of extremism,
1967000	1969000	because if anybody sits there and says,
1969000	1971000	what you said is fucking horrifying,
1971000	1973000	he can just say, well you're not in on the joke,
1973000	1975000	and that shows how unsophisticated you are,
1975000	1977000	because you don't actually get what I'm going for here.
1977000	1979000	Whereas, you know, to the people
1979000	1981000	who do take him literally, he can
1981000	1983000	lean in a little bit more and inhabit
1983000	1985000	that identity without these layers
1985000	1987000	of irony and shading him.
1987000	1989000	But, you know, in terms of what it is that
1989000	1991000	he's arguing for, there's been
1991000	1993000	a consistent through line that's extremely simple
1993000	1995000	and really quite
1995000	1997000	horrifying, which is that he genuinely
1997000	1999000	believes that we should have a
1999000	2001000	libertarian society, by
2001000	2003000	what he means, maximal freedom for
2003000	2005000	a certain class of people,
2005000	2007000	those that he considers worthy,
2007000	2009000	dark owls or whoever it happens to be,
2009000	2011000	and the broader
2011000	2013000	masses who suck, that was his term,
2013000	2015000	shouldn't be allowed
2015000	2017000	any significant input into
2017000	2019000	political processes, because
2019000	2021000	they're never going to accept giving
2021000	2023000	these kinds of rarefied individuals
2023000	2025000	the maximal freedom to make everything better.
2025000	2027000	And this is where he differs from
2027000	2029000	conventional libertarianism, because he says
2029000	2031000	since they're going to try to use their freedom
2031000	2033000	to put limitations on these
2033000	2035000	rarefied bunches, this is why
2035000	2037000	people, this is why we need
2037000	2039000	a very strong state
2039000	2041000	with a very strong executive that's
2041000	2043000	going to essentially put them in their place.
2043000	2045000	And maybe they'll be better
2045000	2047000	cared for, sometimes he does develop this
2047000	2049000	kind of patronizing attitude
2049000	2051000	towards the masses where he says,
2051000	2053000	you know, they'll be better off having someone
2053000	2055000	tend to them, but that doesn't mean that
2055000	2057000	get any kind of meaningful power
2057000	2059000	or certainly any kind of meaningful freedom
2059000	2061000	compared to the Peter Teals of the world,
2061000	2063000	the Steve Jobs of the world,
2063000	2065000	or Elon Musk, a recent obsession
2065000	2067000	who claims could be an American Caesar, right?
2067000	2069000	And you can see
2069000	2071000	antecedents to this all
2071000	2073000	throughout the American libertarian tradition,
2073000	2075000	the right libertarian tradition, not the
2075000	2077000	left libertarian tradition, it's just never
2077000	2079000	been made as explicit
2079000	2081000	with Jarvan. And in some ways
2081000	2083000	reading this was actually kind of fucking refreshing
2083000	2085000	because I'm like, well, at long last
2085000	2087000	what we've been telling you is the inevitable
2087000	2089000	outcome of your theory
2089000	2091000	has been stated clearly because you've
2091000	2093000	reached the conclusion like, yeah, people don't want to
2093000	2095000	live in a right libertarian universe, so we're going to
2095000	2097000	have to fucking compel them to with the state.
2097000	2099000	And it's like, bravo, you've reached the level of
2099000	2101000	19th century Marxism, it's quite an accomplishment.
