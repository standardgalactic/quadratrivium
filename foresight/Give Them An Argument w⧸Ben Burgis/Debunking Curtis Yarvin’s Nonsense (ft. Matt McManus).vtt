WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
So I had a debate with Curtis Yarvin a few months ago.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
It was actually the day before the previous live show, the one we did in LA.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
I was in Chicago debating Yarvin.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
I don't know if I got my donuts worth from that debate,

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
because a lot of it ended up being about,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
I mean, in fact, the debate was much more about history

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
than I thought it was going to be coming into it.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Because I thought, I thought we were going to be debating principles.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
It was about democracy.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
And Yarvin is sometimes sort of like in his more provocative moments.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
He'll call himself a monarchist,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
where we can hear from Matt in a minute what he means by that.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
So I thought we were going to be arguing about democratic principles.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
But Yarvin, I think, was manifestly uninterested in doing that,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
or really in arguing about much of anything.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
And a lot of it ended up being, because he made these claims,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
and he did a one-on-one,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
we both did one-on-one conversations with the moderator,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Thaddeus Russell, before the debate between the two of us.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And so at the very, very beginning, Thaddeus asked,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
okay, do you have anything you want to respond to?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
And I was like, yeah, a lot, right?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It did have one of my favorite comments in the whole year, though,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
when he's like, well, yeah, of course, if you look at what historians say,

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
they're going to agree with you, right?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
It's like, oh, yeah.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, that is a new one to me.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I have never received that particular critique that I assume

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
that what historians say when I read them

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
is going to inform me about what happened in history.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And apparently, this is a totally wrong assumption,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and in fact, shows that I've been so brainwashed by the cathedral

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
that everything I say can be disregarded,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
because I'm just assuming that you could read books

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
and gather information about what happened in the past

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
is the model that I'm working on.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Although, in this sort of previous exchange

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
with Adnan earlier today on social media,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
you brought this up from our debate,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
and you did point out something,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
you put your finger on something that really infuriated me

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
with that debate,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
if infuriated is too strong, it was frustrated in that debate,

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
which is that there's a lot of slippage.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
And Matt has read far more

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
of Jarvan's written work that I have.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You know, I did some research before the debate,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
but nothing like what Matt has been putting himself through

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
to write this Common Wheel article about Jarvan.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
But this certainly seems to be a lot of slippage in general.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
It's certainly the debate with me between people in the past

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
thought X, and you should believe right now that X is true.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Because, you know, it's like there's a point early on

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
where he was like, well, you know,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
so I should say, just to set this up just a little bit,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
that a lot of the sort of historical debate,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and it was about U.S. imperialism in Latin America,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
and whether, you know, like Jarvan thought like,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
oh, we're doing like too much promotion of democracy

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
in other countries that we're just, you know,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
that we're that like, in fact, that was the problem that,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
you know, the U.S. was just involved

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
in idealistic democracy promotion that was going wrong.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
And my view is what the fuck are you talking about?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
The United States has, you know,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
especially specifically Latin America,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
and I think he'd even mentioned Haiti.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I think he was the first one to do that.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I was like, look, I mean, how many times

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
has the United States overthrown elected governments of Haiti?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
How many times has the United States overthrown

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
democratically elected left-wing governments

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
around Latin America?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I brought up, you know, some of the obvious examples,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
you know, about Salvador Yende and et cetera, et cetera.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And, you know, he always had something to say about it,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
but he didn't quite address the point.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
You know, it was like, oh, well, Salvador Yende

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
was a very Americanized cosmopolitan, you know,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
and Pinochet was like a real Chilean.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It was like, okay, let's say that this is an accurate

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
bit of cultural commentary.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
So the fuck what?

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
What is that to do with anything that we're arguing about?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
He loved his people enough to send 7,000 of them

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
to an early grave in Chile's native solo ill, right?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You know, what else could the motherland want?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, exactly.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
And he kept telling me that I should be reading

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
more original sources on Google Books, which is, you know,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
fine if you want to throw that at the end.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
But it's also, you know, I mean, what?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It's a horrible waste of time during debate.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Like, I thought we were there to, like,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
make arguments to each other and respond to each other's points.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And if you say, instead of, like, actually responding

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
to the specific things I say, you just say,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
oh, you seem very entrapped by this worldview.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You know, here are some books you should read.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You know, it's like, well, that doesn't respond to the substance

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
of anything.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
But also, you know, so this came out,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
what Adnan's talking about, the slippage,

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I think came out most vividly in the discussion about Haiti.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Because my view, you know, look,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
my view of why Haiti is as much of a mess as it is right now

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
is that it has been constantly fucked over

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
by imperial powers going back to the inception of the country

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
and the slave revolution that threw off the French

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
and eventually to have the country be allowed to exist

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
for France to stop trying to intervene against them.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
They had to make this treaty where they had to agree

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
to pay back the French for the reverse reparations,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
you know, for the lost property in the slave revolution.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So let me think about, like, the slave owners, right?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Think about all the hard work that they put in to managing

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
those slave enterprises, getting the people into line.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Nobody ever thinks about them and their contribution.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Why does it, yeah, Helen Lovejoy voice, why would anyone

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
do that?

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So, and they didn't finish paying that off until, I think,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
like 1947 is when it was finally, like, it ended up being

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
transferred during one of the U.S. occupations,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I think the one in the 30s, ended up being transferred

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
to a U.S. bank, what they still owed, but they finished

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
paying it off in 1947, very shortly after that,

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
like within like 10 years of that, breathing room,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
they were saddled with Papa Doc de Valier,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
who was a really brutal, like kind of death squad dictator,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
who was back to the hilt by the United States

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
for standard Cold War anti-communist reasons.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Poppy Doc was succeeded by Baby Doc,

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
and who, you know, friend of Mother Teresa,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
but not particularly nice person,

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
and then the de Valier regime was finally overthrown.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You know, it's like the late 80s, they had the, you know,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
the very first democratically elected president of Haiti,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Jean Bertrand, Aristide, you know, after the post-de Valiers,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
not the first ever, but the first post-de Valiers was removed

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
in a coup where it's an open question, you know,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
it's not a matter of dispute that a lot of the military

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
officers involved were on the CIA payroll,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
like everybody acknowledges that.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's an open question whether the company had any knowledge

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
of it, like beforehand, you know, that they,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
or whether it was just that, you know,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
they had a relationship with these guys,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and, you know, coincidentally, there was a coup,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
but at any rate, you know, the United States did actually

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
intervene under Clinton to put him back,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
but then it intervened again under Bush to remove him

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
at this point directly by U.S. Marines.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Aristide's political party, Lavalas, is, like,

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
not allowed to participate in a bunch of future elections.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
The current president of Haiti, who after the one just now,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Moise, was assassinated by some guys who seem to have

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
a lot of connections to Miami, is the guy who came in after

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
who were and who nobody voted for and refuses to hold elections

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
and is strongly supported by the United States,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
all of which is just to say, I think it's not a great mystery

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
how Haiti got to be the way that it is.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I think there's, like, a pretty straightforward material

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
explanation of this.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Jarvan's view, as far as I can tell, is he was coy

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
about whether it was cultural or genetic,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
but he seems to have some sort of racial explanation.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
He said...

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh, he does.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I'll quote from his book.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
This is his text, Muldbug on Carlisle, where he says,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
In Haiti, we see one aspect of life without promises made

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
and kept, poverty, corruption, violence, and filth.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
In a word, anarchy.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Haiti is the product of the persistence of human anarchy

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
and an excellent symbol because it symbolizes exactly

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
the same thing to Carlisle and Freud.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Haiti is far more anarchic now than was in 1888,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
which, of course, whose port-a-prince is the paradise

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
next to today's.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
The 19th century is Haiti is the 21st century's

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
whole third world, so it doesn't really take a genius

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
to sit there and extract all these references to filth

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
and garbage and trash.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And it's connections with the third world and Haiti

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
and drawn association between that

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
and all kinds of horrible racist views.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Well, he said, in the discussion with Bea,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
he said that, well, when I think of a country,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I think of a people, and then he did the exact slippage

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
that Adnan was talking about, where he says,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
well, you know, if you read, you know, go on Google Books,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Google Scholar, you know, you read these old books.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Everybody in like the 19th, you know,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
certainly the 18th century assumes that there are these

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
real things that are like national characters,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
that entire peoples have a certain character, whatever.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And the implications certainly seem to be that,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
well, since they thought so, it must be true.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And I just, you know, like, I mean, just crassly,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I mean, my intuitive response to that is okay.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I mean, if you go back to like 1810, yeah, sure.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I mean, everybody more or less thought that,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
but, you know, everybody thought all kinds

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
of other stupid shit, too.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I mean, like, why is it, you know,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
why is like a view having been popular in 1810

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
a recommendation for...

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Let's be clear, you know, the normal reactionary,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
and I've met a lot of them, hasn't psychologically

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
come to terms with the French Revolution.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
It's still a store spot.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Mulbug is so fucking old fashioned that he's still sore,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
not just about the American Revolution,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
although he's really sore about that.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
He's pissed off about the English Civil War, right?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
That's how fucking far back his grievances go.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
That's a special kind of reactionary, right?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
That's like the point where even Joseph de Maestra

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
in the 18th century would have been like,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
okay, man, you know, it's time to get over it,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
you know, when things have happened, it'll be okay.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Pat on the head, glass of wine, cigarette,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
you know, it'll be fine, right?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Although I do have to say, Mulbug is entertaining

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
in the way that he'll sometimes tattle on himself

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
about his more so-called advanced views.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It kind of reminded me when I was reading him

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
of what Kanye did during that interview with Alex Jones,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
where Jones offered him that beautiful off-ramp,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
but he was like, you're not a Nazi,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
they're trying to insult you,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and Tony was like, whoa!

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
You know, just decided to just avoid

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
the easiest off-ramp in history,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
because at one point in his book,

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
a general introduction...

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah, when Jones was like, you know,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
the Nazis did a lot of bad things, right?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And Kanye was like, I think they did a lot of good things, too!

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
But I mean, at one point in his book,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
a gentle introduction to unqualified reservations,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Mulbug is musing a little bit on fascism,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and he's like, you know, it just occurred to me

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
that Hitler reads a lot like me

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
if I were to lose 25 IQ points

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
and contract a bad case of syphilis.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And I'm like, did you just fucking tattle on yourself?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And you're like, wow, it's kind of weird

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
how I sound an awful lot like Hitler.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Eh, what can you do about it, right?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You know, a lesser man might take that as an opportunity

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
to reflect on himself a little bit.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
They would, yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
You know, say,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
is it good to sound like Hitler?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
But, oh yeah, I'm pleased.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, I just wanted to come in there because I think, you know,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Matt, what you said strikes a chord with me

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
because in trying to think of how to make sense

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
to some of the absurd things he was saying in that discussion,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
it suddenly occurred to me that if he is a monarchist,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
if he is such a reactionary conservative,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
he would look upon the American Revolution,

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
the French Revolution, all of these things as horrible,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
you know, turns away from tradition.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And as a result,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, there's two things going on.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
One is that he's decrying any of these changes and developments

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
so that when he's saying that America

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
is this liberal order that tries to globalize its system,

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
he, you know, there's a certain point from the perspective

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
of a monarchist that America, you know, supported and sponsored,

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
you know, was in favor of Republican revolutions

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
in, say, the New World, you know, you have the Bolivarian,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
you know, transformation of South America.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Like, so there are things that he could, you know,

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
fall back on in his analysis to think that this is all part

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
of a turn in history, you know, that has gone down the wrong path.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
And so it's the cathedral, you know, it's this new system,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
it's this consensus, all these historians are operating

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
under the same, you know, terms and it's all illegitimate

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
as far as he's concerned.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Everything, really, he can pick and choose

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
and say it's all illegitimate if he doesn't like it

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
because it's this departure from that historical moment.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And the second thing is that he, when he, you know, articulates

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
his view on America, you know, being this liberal, globalizing,

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
you know, he's against the Monroe doctrine, you know,

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
he's against Wilson's 14 points because he believes

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
that America actually operates according to those documents

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
and not according to actual historical, you know, evidence.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah, you're not, like, when Yorven talks about, you know,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
the United States policy towards Latin America,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't think the expression United Fruit Company is going

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
to come up very often.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
It is not, no, but also like, you know, Wilson, he thinks Wilson

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
is trying to promote democracy throughout the world.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, you know, as it happens, you know, if you're a Middle East

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
historian, you know that Wilson completely betrayed this,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
you know, he meant fit for Europe and he was caught

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
by the contradiction, you know, at the Paris Peace Conference.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
There were attempts to present new constitutional kind

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
of government, you know, they had a kind of constitutional

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
convention in Damascus in 1920, 1920, you know, 2021,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
and they proposed the probably the most progressive

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
constitution in the history of the Arab world.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And of course, the powers did not accept that.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
They turned over the Middle East to the British and the French,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
you know, which is what he would have wanted.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
So he doesn't even know and understand that the so-called

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
primary documents that he reads, you know, to understand,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
you know, American political thought and so on, you know,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
he doesn't know how to put them into any kind of context

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
and how to read them in their context to really

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
understand what they meant.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
You know, who would help with that would be historians.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Who would?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
You know, you could read some of those, you know,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
some of those books by historians that, like, again,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
yes, I could not, like, I could not emphasize enough

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
that that was his critique, that like, you know,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
that like what I thought about what had happened in history

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
is like what most, you know, like historians thought,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
you know, is okay.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I should point out, this is a man who said in one of his first

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
major pieces of writing, which has just led into an

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
open-minded progressive, that it wasn't the case that people

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
like Chomsky were dissident intellectuals.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
In fact, Noam Chomsky and C. Wright Mills were the power

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
elites of the United States at their time.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And apparently wielded more influence than the police that

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
were arresting people like Miller Chomsky, right,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
which is just a staggering bit of historical imagination

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
if nothing else, right?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah, I mean, I remember actually an old documentary

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
I saw about Noam Chomsky that his wife went to,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
during this period of like anti-Vietnam War protests,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
you know, she went back to school, got to grad school

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
because she figured there was a good chance that Noam

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
was going to be in prison and she was going to have to

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
support the family when that happened, you know.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So I don't think the Chomsky family were under the

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
impression that they were part of the power elite and

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
making decisions, but this does actually get to

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
something really important in the art of it, right?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
So, and by the way, if anybody's watching this and

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
thinks, okay, why are you talking about this bizarre

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
reactionary crank who is, you know, like, you know,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
is mad about the American Revolution happening,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
like, you know, why is this guy worth the breath?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
I would point out that J.D. Vance,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
who was just elected to the Senate from Ohio,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
has actually on the campaign trail and interviews.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
He referenced Yarvin as a friend and an influence on him.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Well, so has Bannon and a bunch of the other fine people.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Steve Bannon has done that.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
The Blake Masters was almost just elected at Arizona.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
The Senate has done the same thing, you know, this guy.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Peter Thiel.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I mean, Peter, of course, the reason we've all heard of him

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
in the first place is because Peter Thiel decided he was

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
he was interested and, you know,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
him out of his obscurity.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
But now, unfortunately, he's not at all obscure.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
And he does probably need to be dealt with.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
But the thing something that just said, I mean,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I wanted to go to, because I mean, I think this is a really

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
important point.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
In fact, in a weird way, goes back to what I was,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Adnan and I were just talking about with Harvey,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
about the theory of history, because, you know,

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
he has this like really deeply idealist view about all this

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
stuff that he like ideas are primary, which, which is why,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
like, you know, like that bizarre comment about,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
you know, I'm Chomsky and see right mills running the world,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
you know, like that, that's, that's, you know,

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
what he calls the cathedral is, is like academics and journalists.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And, you know, but he thinks that well,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
because those people set, you know, the, you know,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
they produce the ideas that that, you know,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
that means that like what, you know,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
literal decision makers do is just downstream of that.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
And so like really it's the, it's the idea of people,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
the academics and journalists who run the world.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah, I should say this pension for idealism as Mark

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
detected is always more common in reactionaries than it is

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
in leftist thinkers.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And it's very easy to see why, right?

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
If you blame any social discontent on the distribution of

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
bad ideas, then the fault lies with intellectuals,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
journalists, that people are stirring up trouble.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
If you're a materialist, then you have to say the problem lies

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
in relations of power, material conditions,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
how people are actually doing, and that inevitably leads you

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
to adopt at least a somewhat critical disposition since these

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
are things that you can't just chalk up to a bunch of

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
troublemakers spreading a bunch of gossip and propaganda.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But I think that there is something that is actually pretty

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
unique about YARVEN.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And I say this not with respect,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
but actually with a lot of disdain.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Because from an intellectual standpoint,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
his arguments are really cheap and bad.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
And often, as Aiden said, historically really out there.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Like trying to say that the biggest problem with the U.S.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
foreign policy over the course of the 20th century is that

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
people were too soft on communism.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
The only thing you can kind of do is roll your eye and say,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
oh, so you think that, eh?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Okay, well, whatever.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
I know a few million peasants in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
who'd like a word about that.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah, absolutely.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
But what's distinct about him is, again,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
this attempt to reconcile libertarianism with this very

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
authoritarian political program.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Now, he's not the first to accomplish this.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And he's certainly not going to be the last.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
But what's really interesting that you can see over the course

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
of his writings is a transition from really believing in the

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
writings of people like Marie-Raphaard or Ludwig von

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Misa.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And then coming to the very Marxist, I should say,

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
conclusion that actually people will not be satisfied living

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
in this kind of libertarian universe.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
And that the freedoms that people like Raphard and

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Viennese want can't actually be secured without an extremely

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
strong state there to actually compel people to adhere to this

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
kind of program.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
And what's really interesting is he's sometimes very overt

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
about that, where he says most people suck, as I put it,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
the masses suck.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
And they're not going to actually advance programs that are

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
good for them, which is precisely why it is that we need the

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
CEO and chief, this American Caesar, to create spaces for

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
freedom for the truly productive people who will go out

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
there and contribute everything that's meaningful in this

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
world.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And that's been a consistent through line in his work from

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
the very beginning, and it's still the case now.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
One of the stupidest papers that he's written,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
and that's a high threshold, let's put it that way,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
came out very recently where he said, I'm bored with this

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
whole red pill metaphor.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Let's get toking-pilled instead.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
And he actually condemns the conservative base for

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
imagining that in the future, they will get to share in any

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
kind of power once the left is defeated.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
He characterizes the left as high elves in this.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
He says that the job of the conservative base is to find

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
certain kinds of dark elves, that's the terminology he uses,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
who will work on behalf of the Hobbits,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
that's just named for the conservative base,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
seize power, implement conservative policies,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
and then the Hobbits will go back into their hold and let the

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
dark elves do their thing, which will include,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
of course, banishing the high elves to god only fucking knows

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
where we're going, right?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Some kind of Gestapo.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
And it's really, really, really, really disturbing when you

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
think that that's how much disdain he feels even for his

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
own base, right?

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Most of you, we are going to be in charge,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
we'll implement policies for you, but don't ever fucking

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
think that you're going to be get to have any kind of say in

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
how it is that you're governed.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It's our job to figure these things out for you.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
It's your job to appreciate it and accept the fact that we're

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
banishing all these people for you.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Sounds like Hitler.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I mean, no wonder he saw an affinity.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Well, that's also fucking remarkable about this,

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
because if you would make one accusation against fascism,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I would not say that that accusation would be that fascism

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
is too democratic.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
That's the biggest problem with it, you know?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
When I think fascism, I don't typically lean to,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
God, you know, that really indicates a lot of these

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
platonic problems with democracy.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
But that's actually Jarvan's position, right?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That there are a number of different reasons why the right

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
shouldn't go fascist any longer.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Some of them are strategic and some of them are moral.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I'll give them that.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
You know, he says Hitler did a few bad things here and there.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
He's exaggerated, so-called, but a few bad things.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Wait, wait, wait a second.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Does he actually say that's exaggerated?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Oh, yeah, I mean, at one point he characterizes,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
he would have quite put it this way, right?

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
The Axis powers as the rebellion and the allies as the actual

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
empire, because the Axis never aspired to world domination,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
on his view.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
The allies already ruled the world.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Cathedral dominates the globe.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
And so the Axis were just rebelling against this world order

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
by the cathedral.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
And he says, you know, I'm not making any kind of moral judgments

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
presenting it in this way, because yeah,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the Axis were still evil, but if you characterize something as

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
the empire and the Axis as the rebellion,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
it's not hard if anybody's seen Star Wars to kind of infer

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
what the moral lesson is supposed to be,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
at least historically.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Well, I mean, in the debate with me,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
there's a point where he said, well,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
it's, you know, yeah, people would say,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
it's probably whatever.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
But like, why weren't we going to war with, you know,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
with Germany? Why not with the Soviet Union?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Because, you know, they were like, you know,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
that really shows that, you know,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
the sort of softness on communism, you know,

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
that like Roosevelt thought it was worth going to war with

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Germany and not with the Soviet Union.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And, you know, I mean, my suggestion back to him was that

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
the Red Army was, you know, not in fact bombing London at the

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
point when, you know, when U.S.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
policy has been escalated, right?

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I mean, like this is, you know, the United States was not

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
the only player, you know, making decisions and reacting

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
to the decisions made by others, you know,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
in this series of events, right?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I mean, like Germany, you know,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
Germany was actually doing stuff leading up to the

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
United States and Germany, you know,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
being in a state of war with each other,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
ultimately, you know, declaring war on the U.S.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
first after its ally, you know,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
attacked it and, you know, whatever,

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
which is due to, you know, U.S., you know,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
embargo and, you know, and demands against Japan,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
but still, like just this idea that, like, you know,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I don't know, FDR and his advisors were just sitting around

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
with a map of the world, you know, deciding,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
it's like, yeah, you know, who should we go to war with?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Let's do Germany because they're, like,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
ideologically further than from us.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah, I was babbling about that also.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Oh, what are you saying, Eddie?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I was just going to say, one of my favorite quotes

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
from Harry Truman whenever he was still in the,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
was he in the house before he was vice president?

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
He actually said on the floor of whatever

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
a steer body he was in, let's back the winner

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
in the fight between Germany and Nazis,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
you know, Nazi Germany and Russia.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
If the Russians are winning, we back the Nazis,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
and if the Nazis are winning, let's back Russia.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
And I think that kind of sums up America's

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
foreign policy of that war.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Yeah, and what's also baffling about it that really frustrated me

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
is anybody who's been in high school knows about

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
the history of appeasement directed towards Germany

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
and the fascist powers, right?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And anybody who's actually looking to the matter

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
with any degree of sophistication,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
and I strongly encourage people to read Richard Evans'

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Third Reich Trilogy if they're interested,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I still think it's someone to work on the subject,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
well, no, one of the reasons why the Nazis were shown

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
a soft hand at many points is there were plenty of people,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
conservatives, liberals, and even a few socialists

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
in Western countries that actually admired

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
what they were doing, right?

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
They characterized Hitler as engaging in non-aggressive actions

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
when he remotorized the line land,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
when he decided to enact the union with Austria.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
They even said, well, he says this is going to be

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
his last territorial demand when he claims this

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
to date land.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Hitler can be a trustworthy figure, right?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Why would he lie to us?

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
You'd never see that kind of tolerant viewpoint

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
directed in the 20th century towards any communist power

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
that was gobbling up its neighbors in that way.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And the Western states would just be like,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
oh, I guess Stalin is certainly a nice guy.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
We can trust him when he says it's the last territorial demand

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
that he's going to make.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Now, thank God we did eventually go to war with them,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
and if only we'd done it sooner, right?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
But this entire historical narrative is completely

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
bogus and extremely self-serving,

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
and it does serve to whitewash

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
a lot of the history of the Second World War

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
and the horrible things that happened there,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
even if Curtis will sometimes try to apply

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
some politically correct language

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
to imply that that's not what he's doing, right?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
By saying, well, yeah, but of course the Nazis were evil.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Even if they were the resistance to the world empire,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
they're still evil, so we shouldn't support them, right?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
You know, from what I've read by Yarevan

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
and from the debate I had with him

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
from his debate with Jen Kueger, which I watched,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
it seems to me like he's very slippery

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
about exactly what he wants,

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
because he has this kind of provocative mode

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
where he'll describe himself as a monarchist.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
He'll say things like,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
we want some Silicon Valley CEO

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
who says sometimes to become the American Augustus,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
which, like...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
He has a long parable in his earliest book, actually,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
where Steve Jobs literally becomes

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
the lord and ruler of California.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Sure, why not?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
He has a bit of fan fiction.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah, so he'll say things like that,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
which suggests that he, you know,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
like taken literally would mean he's, like,

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
really seriously opposed to the American constitutional order,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
but that he's got this sort of, like,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
when he's out, you know, when he's retreated to the mod,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
you know, he'll say,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
well, all I really mean by monarchist is that

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I think we should have a really, really strong executive branch.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
And which, you know,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
that would actually be more democratic,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
because that's the only...

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
That's the only election that he pays attention to anyway,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
is the president.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
So, and really, you know,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
because the Constitution uses the phrase chief executive,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
so which he interprets,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
like I'm not saying about context,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
you know, he interprets as, like,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
meaning, like, you know, a CEO and a corporation,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
which is obviously a metaphor

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
that would not have been available to anybody

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
who was writing the Constitution.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
But, you know, he says,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
well, if you let, you know,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
democratically elected presidents exercise

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
more or less absolute power,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
then that would actually be the most democratic thing of all,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
because who pays attention to congressional elections?

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
And so, and then, like,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
sometimes he'll even say, well, you know,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
FDR was basically like a king,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
because, you know,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Congress was a rubber stamp,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
and he could do whatever he wants,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
which, you know,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
it seems to me there's a lot of...

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
There's this big gap, you know,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
between those three proposals that is toggling

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
back and forth between,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
which are, you should have FDR,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
in other words, you should have, like,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
a president who's so popular

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
that, you know, congressmen feel pressured

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
to support his policies,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
because they don't want their constituents to get mad at them,

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
which is, you know, fine.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
Between that and presidents

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
should basically have all the power

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
and Congress should have none,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
which, you know, makes me a little nervous,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I think about George W. Bush

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
and the ways that executive power

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
was expanded during the Bush administration,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
to do things like, you know,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
to entertain and torture people

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
and, you know,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
send troops all over the world and et cetera, et cetera.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
But even that

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
isn't an American Augustus.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I mean, American Augustus would, like, you know,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
like, again, take it literally,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
that would mean that we just, you know,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
that we just don't have

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
a republic anymore, right?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I mean, that's what Augustus's

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
role was.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
So as far as you can tell,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
what does he actually want,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
or does he just, like,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
or does he just enjoy the game

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
of keeping people guessing?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Oh, I think it's very clear what he wants.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But I will say just to your point,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
this is one of the areas where I think he's a pioneer

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
of sort.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And I wish I had read his work before I wrote my book

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
on postmodern conservatism, because I would have actually

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
just been, here's patient zero, right?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Because the way that he writes, including using

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
the pseudonym

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
writing on a blog, all these kind of pop culture

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
references that are intertwined

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
by a highfalutin kind of appeals

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
to any number of different figures,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
esoteric figures in the reactionary tradition.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
It means that any time

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
where he's pressured in the way that you're talking about,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
he can retreat into the argument that

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
he's just joking, or that this is just

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
irony, or that this isn't meant to be taken

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
literally, or sometimes we even just say,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
of course this will never actually happen, so it's just

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
a thought experiment, right?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
And this is a very good defensive way

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
of guarding himself against

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
accusations of any kind of extremism,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
because if anybody sits there and says,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
what you said is fucking horrifying,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
he can just say, well you're not in on the joke,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
and that shows how unsophisticated you are,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
because you don't actually get what I'm going for here.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Whereas, you know, to the people

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
who do take him literally, he can

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
lean in a little bit more and inhabit

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
that identity without these layers

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
of irony and shading him.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
But, you know, in terms of what it is that

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
he's arguing for, there's been

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
a consistent through line that's extremely simple

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
and really quite

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
horrifying, which is that he genuinely

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
believes that we should have a

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
libertarian society, by

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
what he means, maximal freedom for

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
a certain class of people,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
those that he considers worthy,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
dark owls or whoever it happens to be,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
and the broader

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
masses who suck, that was his term,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
shouldn't be allowed

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
any significant input into

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
political processes, because

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
they're never going to accept giving

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
these kinds of rarefied individuals

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
the maximal freedom to make everything better.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
And this is where he differs from

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
conventional libertarianism, because he says

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
since they're going to try to use their freedom

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
to put limitations on these

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
rarefied bunches, this is why

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
people, this is why we need

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
a very strong state

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
with a very strong executive that's

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
going to essentially put them in their place.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And maybe they'll be better

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
cared for, sometimes he does develop this

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
kind of patronizing attitude

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
towards the masses where he says,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
you know, they'll be better off having someone

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
tend to them, but that doesn't mean that

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
get any kind of meaningful power

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
or certainly any kind of meaningful freedom

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
compared to the Peter Teals of the world,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
the Steve Jobs of the world,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
or Elon Musk, a recent obsession

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
who claims could be an American Caesar, right?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
And you can see

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
antecedents to this all

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
throughout the American libertarian tradition,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
the right libertarian tradition, not the

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
left libertarian tradition, it's just never

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
been made as explicit

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
with Jarvan. And in some ways

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
reading this was actually kind of fucking refreshing

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
because I'm like, well, at long last

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
what we've been telling you is the inevitable

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
outcome of your theory

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
has been stated clearly because you've

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
reached the conclusion like, yeah, people don't want to

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
live in a right libertarian universe, so we're going to

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
have to fucking compel them to with the state.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And it's like, bravo, you've reached the level of

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
19th century Marxism, it's quite an accomplishment.

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
Music

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You have been watching free public content

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
