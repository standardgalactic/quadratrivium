1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I had a debate with Curtis Yarvin a few months ago.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It was actually the day before the previous live show, the one we did in LA.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was in Chicago debating Yarvin.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know if I got my donuts worth from that debate,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
because a lot of it ended up being about,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I mean, in fact, the debate was much more about history

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
than I thought it was going to be coming into it.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Because I thought, I thought we were going to be debating principles.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It was about democracy.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And Yarvin is sometimes sort of like in his more provocative moments.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He'll call himself a monarchist,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where we can hear from Matt in a minute what he means by that.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So I thought we were going to be arguing about democratic principles.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But Yarvin, I think, was manifestly uninterested in doing that,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
or really in arguing about much of anything.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And a lot of it ended up being, because he made these claims,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and he did a one-on-one,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we both did one-on-one conversations with the moderator,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thaddeus Russell, before the debate between the two of us.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And so at the very, very beginning, Thaddeus asked,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
okay, do you have anything you want to respond to?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I was like, yeah, a lot, right?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It did have one of my favorite comments in the whole year, though,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when he's like, well, yeah, of course, if you look at what historians say,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
they're going to agree with you, right?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's like, oh, yeah.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, that is a new one to me.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have never received that particular critique that I assume

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that what historians say when I read them

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
is going to inform me about what happened in history.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And apparently, this is a totally wrong assumption,

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and in fact, shows that I've been so brainwashed by the cathedral

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that everything I say can be disregarded,

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
because I'm just assuming that you could read books

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and gather information about what happened in the past

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is the model that I'm working on.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Although, in this sort of previous exchange

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
with Adnan earlier today on social media,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you brought this up from our debate,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and you did point out something,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you put your finger on something that really infuriated me

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
with that debate,

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if infuriated is too strong, it was frustrated in that debate,

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which is that there's a lot of slippage.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And Matt has read far more

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
of Jarvan's written work that I have.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You know, I did some research before the debate,

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but nothing like what Matt has been putting himself through

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to write this Common Wheel article about Jarvan.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But this certainly seems to be a lot of slippage in general.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's certainly the debate with me between people in the past

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
thought X, and you should believe right now that X is true.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because, you know, it's like there's a point early on

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
where he was like, well, you know,

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so I should say, just to set this up just a little bit,

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that a lot of the sort of historical debate,

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and it was about U.S. imperialism in Latin America,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and whether, you know, like Jarvan thought like,

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
oh, we're doing like too much promotion of democracy

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in other countries that we're just, you know,

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that we're that like, in fact, that was the problem that,

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
you know, the U.S. was just involved

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in idealistic democracy promotion that was going wrong.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And my view is what the fuck are you talking about?

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The United States has, you know,

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
especially specifically Latin America,

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and I think he'd even mentioned Haiti.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think he was the first one to do that.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was like, look, I mean, how many times

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
has the United States overthrown elected governments of Haiti?

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How many times has the United States overthrown

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
democratically elected left-wing governments

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
around Latin America?

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I brought up, you know, some of the obvious examples,

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you know, about Salvador Yende and et cetera, et cetera.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And, you know, he always had something to say about it,

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but he didn't quite address the point.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know, it was like, oh, well, Salvador Yende

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
was a very Americanized cosmopolitan, you know,

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and Pinochet was like a real Chilean.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It was like, okay, let's say that this is an accurate

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
bit of cultural commentary.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So the fuck what?

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What is that to do with anything that we're arguing about?

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He loved his people enough to send 7,000 of them

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to an early grave in Chile's native solo ill, right?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, what else could the motherland want?

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And he kept telling me that I should be reading

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
more original sources on Google Books, which is, you know,

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
fine if you want to throw that at the end.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But it's also, you know, I mean, what?

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a horrible waste of time during debate.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Like, I thought we were there to, like,

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
make arguments to each other and respond to each other's points.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And if you say, instead of, like, actually responding

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to the specific things I say, you just say,

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
oh, you seem very entrapped by this worldview.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know, here are some books you should read.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know, it's like, well, that doesn't respond to the substance

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
of anything.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But also, you know, so this came out,

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
what Adnan's talking about, the slippage,

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think came out most vividly in the discussion about Haiti.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because my view, you know, look,

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
my view of why Haiti is as much of a mess as it is right now

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is that it has been constantly fucked over

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
by imperial powers going back to the inception of the country

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and the slave revolution that threw off the French

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and eventually to have the country be allowed to exist

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
for France to stop trying to intervene against them.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They had to make this treaty where they had to agree

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to pay back the French for the reverse reparations,

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
you know, for the lost property in the slave revolution.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So let me think about, like, the slave owners, right?

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Think about all the hard work that they put in to managing

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
those slave enterprises, getting the people into line.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Nobody ever thinks about them and their contribution.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why does it, yeah, Helen Lovejoy voice, why would anyone

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
do that?

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, and they didn't finish paying that off until, I think,

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
like 1947 is when it was finally, like, it ended up being

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
transferred during one of the U.S. occupations,

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think the one in the 30s, ended up being transferred

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to a U.S. bank, what they still owed, but they finished

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
paying it off in 1947, very shortly after that,

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
like within like 10 years of that, breathing room,

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
they were saddled with Papa Doc de Valier,

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
who was a really brutal, like kind of death squad dictator,

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
who was back to the hilt by the United States

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
for standard Cold War anti-communist reasons.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Poppy Doc was succeeded by Baby Doc,

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and who, you know, friend of Mother Teresa,

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but not particularly nice person,

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and then the de Valier regime was finally overthrown.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know, it's like the late 80s, they had the, you know,

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the very first democratically elected president of Haiti,

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Jean Bertrand, Aristide, you know, after the post-de Valiers,

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
not the first ever, but the first post-de Valiers was removed

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in a coup where it's an open question, you know,

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
it's not a matter of dispute that a lot of the military

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
officers involved were on the CIA payroll,

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
like everybody acknowledges that.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's an open question whether the company had any knowledge

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
of it, like beforehand, you know, that they,

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
or whether it was just that, you know,

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
they had a relationship with these guys,

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and, you know, coincidentally, there was a coup,

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but at any rate, you know, the United States did actually

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
intervene under Clinton to put him back,

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but then it intervened again under Bush to remove him

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
at this point directly by U.S. Marines.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Aristide's political party, Lavalas, is, like,

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
not allowed to participate in a bunch of future elections.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The current president of Haiti, who after the one just now,

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Moise, was assassinated by some guys who seem to have

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
a lot of connections to Miami, is the guy who came in after

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
who were and who nobody voted for and refuses to hold elections

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and is strongly supported by the United States,

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
all of which is just to say, I think it's not a great mystery

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
how Haiti got to be the way that it is.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think there's, like, a pretty straightforward material

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
explanation of this.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Jarvan's view, as far as I can tell, is he was coy

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
about whether it was cultural or genetic,

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but he seems to have some sort of racial explanation.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He said...

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, he does.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll quote from his book.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is his text, Muldbug on Carlisle, where he says,

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In Haiti, we see one aspect of life without promises made

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and kept, poverty, corruption, violence, and filth.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In a word, anarchy.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Haiti is the product of the persistence of human anarchy

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and an excellent symbol because it symbolizes exactly

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the same thing to Carlisle and Freud.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Haiti is far more anarchic now than was in 1888,

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
which, of course, whose port-a-prince is the paradise

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
next to today's.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The 19th century is Haiti is the 21st century's

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
whole third world, so it doesn't really take a genius

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to sit there and extract all these references to filth

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and garbage and trash.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And it's connections with the third world and Haiti

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and drawn association between that

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and all kinds of horrible racist views.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, he said, in the discussion with Bea,

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
he said that, well, when I think of a country,

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I think of a people, and then he did the exact slippage

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that Adnan was talking about, where he says,

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
well, you know, if you read, you know, go on Google Books,

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Google Scholar, you know, you read these old books.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Everybody in like the 19th, you know,

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
certainly the 18th century assumes that there are these

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
real things that are like national characters,

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that entire peoples have a certain character, whatever.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And the implications certainly seem to be that,

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
well, since they thought so, it must be true.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I just, you know, like, I mean, just crassly,

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean, my intuitive response to that is okay.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I mean, if you go back to like 1810, yeah, sure.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I mean, everybody more or less thought that,

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
but, you know, everybody thought all kinds

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
of other stupid shit, too.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I mean, like, why is it, you know,

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
why is like a view having been popular in 1810

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
a recommendation for...

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's be clear, you know, the normal reactionary,

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and I've met a lot of them, hasn't psychologically

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
come to terms with the French Revolution.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's still a store spot.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mulbug is so fucking old fashioned that he's still sore,

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
not just about the American Revolution,

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
although he's really sore about that.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He's pissed off about the English Civil War, right?

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's how fucking far back his grievances go.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's a special kind of reactionary, right?

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's like the point where even Joseph de Maestra

219
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
in the 18th century would have been like,

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
okay, man, you know, it's time to get over it,

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
you know, when things have happened, it'll be okay.

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Pat on the head, glass of wine, cigarette,

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you know, it'll be fine, right?

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Although I do have to say, Mulbug is entertaining

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in the way that he'll sometimes tattle on himself

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
about his more so-called advanced views.

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It kind of reminded me when I was reading him

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of what Kanye did during that interview with Alex Jones,

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
where Jones offered him that beautiful off-ramp,

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but he was like, you're not a Nazi,

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
they're trying to insult you,

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and Tony was like, whoa!

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You know, just decided to just avoid

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
the easiest off-ramp in history,

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
because at one point in his book,

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
a general introduction...

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, when Jones was like, you know,

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the Nazis did a lot of bad things, right?

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And Kanye was like, I think they did a lot of good things, too!

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I mean, at one point in his book,

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
a gentle introduction to unqualified reservations,

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mulbug is musing a little bit on fascism,

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and he's like, you know, it just occurred to me

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that Hitler reads a lot like me

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
if I were to lose 25 IQ points

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and contract a bad case of syphilis.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I'm like, did you just fucking tattle on yourself?

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And you're like, wow, it's kind of weird

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
how I sound an awful lot like Hitler.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Eh, what can you do about it, right?

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You know, a lesser man might take that as an opportunity

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to reflect on himself a little bit.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They would, yeah.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know, say,

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
is it good to sound like Hitler?

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But, oh yeah, I'm pleased.

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, I just wanted to come in there because I think, you know,

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Matt, what you said strikes a chord with me

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
because in trying to think of how to make sense

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to some of the absurd things he was saying in that discussion,

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it suddenly occurred to me that if he is a monarchist,

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if he is such a reactionary conservative,

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
he would look upon the American Revolution,

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the French Revolution, all of these things as horrible,

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you know, turns away from tradition.

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And as a result,

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I mean, there's two things going on.

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
One is that he's decrying any of these changes and developments

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
so that when he's saying that America

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is this liberal order that tries to globalize its system,

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
he, you know, there's a certain point from the perspective

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
of a monarchist that America, you know, supported and sponsored,

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you know, was in favor of Republican revolutions

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
in, say, the New World, you know, you have the Bolivarian,

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you know, transformation of South America.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like, so there are things that he could, you know,

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
fall back on in his analysis to think that this is all part

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
of a turn in history, you know, that has gone down the wrong path.

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And so it's the cathedral, you know, it's this new system,

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's this consensus, all these historians are operating

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
under the same, you know, terms and it's all illegitimate

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
as far as he's concerned.

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Everything, really, he can pick and choose

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and say it's all illegitimate if he doesn't like it

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because it's this departure from that historical moment.

287
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And the second thing is that he, when he, you know, articulates

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
his view on America, you know, being this liberal, globalizing,

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you know, he's against the Monroe doctrine, you know,

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
he's against Wilson's 14 points because he believes

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that America actually operates according to those documents

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and not according to actual historical, you know, evidence.

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, you're not, like, when Yorven talks about, you know,

294
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the United States policy towards Latin America,

295
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't think the expression United Fruit Company is going

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to come up very often.

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It is not, no, but also like, you know, Wilson, he thinks Wilson

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
is trying to promote democracy throughout the world.

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, you know, as it happens, you know, if you're a Middle East

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
historian, you know that Wilson completely betrayed this,

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you know, he meant fit for Europe and he was caught

302
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
by the contradiction, you know, at the Paris Peace Conference.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There were attempts to present new constitutional kind

304
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
of government, you know, they had a kind of constitutional

305
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
convention in Damascus in 1920, 1920, you know, 2021,

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and they proposed the probably the most progressive

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
constitution in the history of the Arab world.

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And of course, the powers did not accept that.

309
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They turned over the Middle East to the British and the French,

310
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
you know, which is what he would have wanted.

311
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So he doesn't even know and understand that the so-called

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
primary documents that he reads, you know, to understand,

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
you know, American political thought and so on, you know,

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
he doesn't know how to put them into any kind of context

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and how to read them in their context to really

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
understand what they meant.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You know, who would help with that would be historians.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Who would?

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You know, you could read some of those, you know,

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
some of those books by historians that, like, again,

321
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
yes, I could not, like, I could not emphasize enough

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
that that was his critique, that like, you know,

323
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that like what I thought about what had happened in history

324
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
is like what most, you know, like historians thought,

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
you know, is okay.

326
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I should point out, this is a man who said in one of his first

327
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
major pieces of writing, which has just led into an

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
open-minded progressive, that it wasn't the case that people

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
like Chomsky were dissident intellectuals.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In fact, Noam Chomsky and C. Wright Mills were the power

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
elites of the United States at their time.

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And apparently wielded more influence than the police that

333
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
were arresting people like Miller Chomsky, right,

334
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
which is just a staggering bit of historical imagination

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
if nothing else, right?

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, I mean, I remember actually an old documentary

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I saw about Noam Chomsky that his wife went to,

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
during this period of like anti-Vietnam War protests,

339
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you know, she went back to school, got to grad school

340
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
because she figured there was a good chance that Noam

341
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
was going to be in prison and she was going to have to

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
support the family when that happened, you know.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So I don't think the Chomsky family were under the

344
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
impression that they were part of the power elite and

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
making decisions, but this does actually get to

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
something really important in the art of it, right?

347
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So, and by the way, if anybody's watching this and

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
thinks, okay, why are you talking about this bizarre

349
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
reactionary crank who is, you know, like, you know,

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is mad about the American Revolution happening,

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
like, you know, why is this guy worth the breath?

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I would point out that J.D. Vance,

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
who was just elected to the Senate from Ohio,

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
has actually on the campaign trail and interviews.

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He referenced Yarvin as a friend and an influence on him.

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, so has Bannon and a bunch of the other fine people.

357
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Steve Bannon has done that.

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The Blake Masters was almost just elected at Arizona.

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The Senate has done the same thing, you know, this guy.

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Peter Thiel.

361
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

362
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I mean, Peter, of course, the reason we've all heard of him

363
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
in the first place is because Peter Thiel decided he was

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
he was interested and, you know,

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
him out of his obscurity.

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But now, unfortunately, he's not at all obscure.

367
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And he does probably need to be dealt with.

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But the thing something that just said, I mean,

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I wanted to go to, because I mean, I think this is a really

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
important point.

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In fact, in a weird way, goes back to what I was,

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Adnan and I were just talking about with Harvey,

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
about the theory of history, because, you know,

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
he has this like really deeply idealist view about all this

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
stuff that he like ideas are primary, which, which is why,

376
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
like, you know, like that bizarre comment about,

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
you know, I'm Chomsky and see right mills running the world,

378
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you know, like that, that's, that's, you know,

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
what he calls the cathedral is, is like academics and journalists.

380
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And, you know, but he thinks that well,

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
because those people set, you know, the, you know,

382
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
they produce the ideas that that, you know,

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that means that like what, you know,

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
literal decision makers do is just downstream of that.

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And so like really it's the, it's the idea of people,

386
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the academics and journalists who run the world.

387
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, I should say this pension for idealism as Mark

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
detected is always more common in reactionaries than it is

389
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in leftist thinkers.

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And it's very easy to see why, right?

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you blame any social discontent on the distribution of

392
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
bad ideas, then the fault lies with intellectuals,

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
journalists, that people are stirring up trouble.

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you're a materialist, then you have to say the problem lies

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
in relations of power, material conditions,

396
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
how people are actually doing, and that inevitably leads you

397
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to adopt at least a somewhat critical disposition since these

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
are things that you can't just chalk up to a bunch of

399
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
troublemakers spreading a bunch of gossip and propaganda.

400
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But I think that there is something that is actually pretty

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
unique about YARVEN.

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And I say this not with respect,

403
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
but actually with a lot of disdain.

404
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Because from an intellectual standpoint,

405
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
his arguments are really cheap and bad.

406
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And often, as Aiden said, historically really out there.

407
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Like trying to say that the biggest problem with the U.S.

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
foreign policy over the course of the 20th century is that

409
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
people were too soft on communism.

410
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The only thing you can kind of do is roll your eye and say,

411
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
oh, so you think that, eh?

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay, well, whatever.

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I know a few million peasants in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia

414
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
who'd like a word about that.

415
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

416
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But what's distinct about him is, again,

417
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
this attempt to reconcile libertarianism with this very

418
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
authoritarian political program.

419
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Now, he's not the first to accomplish this.

420
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And he's certainly not going to be the last.

421
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But what's really interesting that you can see over the course

422
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
of his writings is a transition from really believing in the

423
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
writings of people like Marie-Raphaard or Ludwig von

424
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Misa.

425
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then coming to the very Marxist, I should say,

426
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
conclusion that actually people will not be satisfied living

427
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
in this kind of libertarian universe.

428
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And that the freedoms that people like Raphard and

429
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Viennese want can't actually be secured without an extremely

430
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
strong state there to actually compel people to adhere to this

431
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
kind of program.

432
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And what's really interesting is he's sometimes very overt

433
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
about that, where he says most people suck, as I put it,

434
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
the masses suck.

435
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And they're not going to actually advance programs that are

436
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
good for them, which is precisely why it is that we need the

437
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
CEO and chief, this American Caesar, to create spaces for

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
freedom for the truly productive people who will go out

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
there and contribute everything that's meaningful in this

440
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
world.

441
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And that's been a consistent through line in his work from

442
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
the very beginning, and it's still the case now.

443
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
One of the stupidest papers that he's written,

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and that's a high threshold, let's put it that way,

445
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
came out very recently where he said, I'm bored with this

446
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
whole red pill metaphor.

447
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's get toking-pilled instead.

448
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And he actually condemns the conservative base for

449
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
imagining that in the future, they will get to share in any

450
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
kind of power once the left is defeated.

451
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He characterizes the left as high elves in this.

452
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He says that the job of the conservative base is to find

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
certain kinds of dark elves, that's the terminology he uses,

454
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
who will work on behalf of the Hobbits,

455
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that's just named for the conservative base,

456
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
seize power, implement conservative policies,

457
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and then the Hobbits will go back into their hold and let the

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
dark elves do their thing, which will include,

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
of course, banishing the high elves to god only fucking knows

460
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
where we're going, right?

461
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Some kind of Gestapo.

462
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And it's really, really, really, really disturbing when you

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
think that that's how much disdain he feels even for his

464
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
own base, right?

465
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Most of you, we are going to be in charge,

466
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
we'll implement policies for you, but don't ever fucking

467
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
think that you're going to be get to have any kind of say in

468
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
how it is that you're governed.

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's our job to figure these things out for you.

470
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's your job to appreciate it and accept the fact that we're

471
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
banishing all these people for you.

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Sounds like Hitler.

473
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I mean, no wonder he saw an affinity.

474
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, that's also fucking remarkable about this,

475
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
because if you would make one accusation against fascism,

476
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I would not say that that accusation would be that fascism

477
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
is too democratic.

478
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's the biggest problem with it, you know?

479
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
When I think fascism, I don't typically lean to,

480
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
God, you know, that really indicates a lot of these

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
platonic problems with democracy.

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But that's actually Jarvan's position, right?

483
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That there are a number of different reasons why the right

484
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
shouldn't go fascist any longer.

485
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Some of them are strategic and some of them are moral.

486
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll give them that.

487
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You know, he says Hitler did a few bad things here and there.

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He's exaggerated, so-called, but a few bad things.

489
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Wait, wait, wait a second.

490
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Does he actually say that's exaggerated?

491
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, yeah, I mean, at one point he characterizes,

492
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
he would have quite put it this way, right?

493
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The Axis powers as the rebellion and the allies as the actual

494
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
empire, because the Axis never aspired to world domination,

495
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
on his view.

496
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The allies already ruled the world.

497
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Cathedral dominates the globe.

498
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And so the Axis were just rebelling against this world order

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
by the cathedral.

500
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And he says, you know, I'm not making any kind of moral judgments

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
presenting it in this way, because yeah,

502
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
the Axis were still evil, but if you characterize something as

503
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the empire and the Axis as the rebellion,

504
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
it's not hard if anybody's seen Star Wars to kind of infer

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
what the moral lesson is supposed to be,

506
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
at least historically.

507
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Well, I mean, in the debate with me,

508
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
there's a point where he said, well,

509
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
it's, you know, yeah, people would say,

510
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
it's probably whatever.

511
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But like, why weren't we going to war with, you know,

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
with Germany? Why not with the Soviet Union?

513
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because, you know, they were like, you know,

514
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
that really shows that, you know,

515
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the sort of softness on communism, you know,

516
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
that like Roosevelt thought it was worth going to war with

517
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Germany and not with the Soviet Union.

518
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And, you know, I mean, my suggestion back to him was that

519
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the Red Army was, you know, not in fact bombing London at the

520
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
point when, you know, when U.S.

521
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
policy has been escalated, right?

522
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I mean, like this is, you know, the United States was not

523
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the only player, you know, making decisions and reacting

524
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
to the decisions made by others, you know,

525
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
in this series of events, right?

526
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I mean, like Germany, you know,

527
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Germany was actually doing stuff leading up to the

528
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
United States and Germany, you know,

529
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
being in a state of war with each other,

530
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ultimately, you know, declaring war on the U.S.

531
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
first after its ally, you know,

532
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
attacked it and, you know, whatever,

533
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
which is due to, you know, U.S., you know,

534
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
embargo and, you know, and demands against Japan,

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but still, like just this idea that, like, you know,

536
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't know, FDR and his advisors were just sitting around

537
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
with a map of the world, you know, deciding,

538
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
it's like, yeah, you know, who should we go to war with?

539
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's do Germany because they're, like,

540
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
ideologically further than from us.

541
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, I was babbling about that also.

542
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, what are you saying, Eddie?

543
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I was just going to say, one of my favorite quotes

544
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
from Harry Truman whenever he was still in the,

545
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
was he in the house before he was vice president?

546
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He actually said on the floor of whatever

547
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
a steer body he was in, let's back the winner

548
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
in the fight between Germany and Nazis,

549
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
you know, Nazi Germany and Russia.

550
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If the Russians are winning, we back the Nazis,

551
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and if the Nazis are winning, let's back Russia.

552
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I think that kind of sums up America's

553
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
foreign policy of that war.

554
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah, and what's also baffling about it that really frustrated me

555
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
is anybody who's been in high school knows about

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
the history of appeasement directed towards Germany

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and the fascist powers, right?

558
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And anybody who's actually looking to the matter

559
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
with any degree of sophistication,

560
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and I strongly encourage people to read Richard Evans'

561
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Third Reich Trilogy if they're interested,

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I still think it's someone to work on the subject,

563
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
well, no, one of the reasons why the Nazis were shown

564
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
a soft hand at many points is there were plenty of people,

565
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
conservatives, liberals, and even a few socialists

566
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
in Western countries that actually admired

567
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
what they were doing, right?

568
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
They characterized Hitler as engaging in non-aggressive actions

569
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
when he remotorized the line land,

570
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
when he decided to enact the union with Austria.

571
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
They even said, well, he says this is going to be

572
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
his last territorial demand when he claims this

573
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
to date land.

574
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Hitler can be a trustworthy figure, right?

575
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Why would he lie to us?

576
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You'd never see that kind of tolerant viewpoint

577
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
directed in the 20th century towards any communist power

578
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that was gobbling up its neighbors in that way.

579
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And the Western states would just be like,

580
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
oh, I guess Stalin is certainly a nice guy.

581
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We can trust him when he says it's the last territorial demand

582
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that he's going to make.

583
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Now, thank God we did eventually go to war with them,

584
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and if only we'd done it sooner, right?

585
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But this entire historical narrative is completely

586
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
bogus and extremely self-serving,

587
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and it does serve to whitewash

588
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
a lot of the history of the Second World War

589
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and the horrible things that happened there,

590
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
even if Curtis will sometimes try to apply

591
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
some politically correct language

592
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to imply that that's not what he's doing, right?

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
By saying, well, yeah, but of course the Nazis were evil.

594
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Even if they were the resistance to the world empire,

595
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
they're still evil, so we shouldn't support them, right?

596
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know, from what I've read by Yarevan

597
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and from the debate I had with him

598
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
from his debate with Jen Kueger, which I watched,

599
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it seems to me like he's very slippery

600
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
about exactly what he wants,

601
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
because he has this kind of provocative mode

602
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
where he'll describe himself as a monarchist.

603
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He'll say things like,

604
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
we want some Silicon Valley CEO

605
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
who says sometimes to become the American Augustus,

606
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
which, like...

607
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He has a long parable in his earliest book, actually,

608
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
where Steve Jobs literally becomes

609
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
the lord and ruler of California.

610
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Sure, why not?

611
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He has a bit of fan fiction.

612
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, so he'll say things like that,

613
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
which suggests that he, you know,

614
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
like taken literally would mean he's, like,

615
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
really seriously opposed to the American constitutional order,

616
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but that he's got this sort of, like,

617
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
when he's out, you know, when he's retreated to the mod,

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
you know, he'll say,

619
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
well, all I really mean by monarchist is that

620
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think we should have a really, really strong executive branch.

621
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And which, you know,

622
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
that would actually be more democratic,

623
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
because that's the only...

624
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That's the only election that he pays attention to anyway,

625
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
is the president.

626
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So, and really, you know,

627
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
because the Constitution uses the phrase chief executive,

628
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
so which he interprets,

629
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
like I'm not saying about context,

630
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you know, he interprets as, like,

631
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
meaning, like, you know, a CEO and a corporation,

632
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
which is obviously a metaphor

633
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
that would not have been available to anybody

634
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
who was writing the Constitution.

635
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But, you know, he says,

636
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
well, if you let, you know,

637
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
democratically elected presidents exercise

638
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
more or less absolute power,

639
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
then that would actually be the most democratic thing of all,

640
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
because who pays attention to congressional elections?

641
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And so, and then, like,

642
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
sometimes he'll even say, well, you know,

643
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
FDR was basically like a king,

644
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
because, you know,

645
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Congress was a rubber stamp,

646
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and he could do whatever he wants,

647
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
which, you know,

648
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
it seems to me there's a lot of...

649
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
There's this big gap, you know,

650
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
between those three proposals that is toggling

651
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
back and forth between,

652
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
which are, you should have FDR,

653
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
in other words, you should have, like,

654
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
a president who's so popular

655
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that, you know, congressmen feel pressured

656
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
to support his policies,

657
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
because they don't want their constituents to get mad at them,

658
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
which is, you know, fine.

659
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Between that and presidents

660
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
should basically have all the power

661
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and Congress should have none,

662
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
which, you know, makes me a little nervous,

663
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I think about George W. Bush

664
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and the ways that executive power

665
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
was expanded during the Bush administration,

666
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
to do things like, you know,

667
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
to entertain and torture people

668
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and, you know,

669
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
send troops all over the world and et cetera, et cetera.

670
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But even that

671
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
isn't an American Augustus.

672
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I mean, American Augustus would, like, you know,

673
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
like, again, take it literally,

674
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
that would mean that we just, you know,

675
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
that we just don't have

676
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
a republic anymore, right?

677
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean, that's what Augustus's

678
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
role was.

679
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So as far as you can tell,

680
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
what does he actually want,

681
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
or does he just, like,

682
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
or does he just enjoy the game

683
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
of keeping people guessing?

684
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh, I think it's very clear what he wants.

685
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But I will say just to your point,

686
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
this is one of the areas where I think he's a pioneer

687
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
of sort.

688
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And I wish I had read his work before I wrote my book

689
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
on postmodern conservatism, because I would have actually

690
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
just been, here's patient zero, right?

691
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Because the way that he writes, including using

692
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the pseudonym

693
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
writing on a blog, all these kind of pop culture

694
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
references that are intertwined

695
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
by a highfalutin kind of appeals

696
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
to any number of different figures,

697
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
esoteric figures in the reactionary tradition.

698
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It means that any time

699
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
where he's pressured in the way that you're talking about,

700
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
he can retreat into the argument that

701
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
he's just joking, or that this is just

702
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
irony, or that this isn't meant to be taken

703
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
literally, or sometimes we even just say,

704
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
of course this will never actually happen, so it's just

705
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
a thought experiment, right?

706
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And this is a very good defensive way

707
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
of guarding himself against

708
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
accusations of any kind of extremism,

709
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because if anybody sits there and says,

710
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
what you said is fucking horrifying,

711
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
he can just say, well you're not in on the joke,

712
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and that shows how unsophisticated you are,

713
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
because you don't actually get what I'm going for here.

714
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Whereas, you know, to the people

715
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
who do take him literally, he can

716
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
lean in a little bit more and inhabit

717
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
that identity without these layers

718
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
of irony and shading him.

719
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But, you know, in terms of what it is that

720
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
he's arguing for, there's been

721
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
a consistent through line that's extremely simple

722
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and really quite

723
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
horrifying, which is that he genuinely

724
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
believes that we should have a

725
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
libertarian society, by

726
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
what he means, maximal freedom for

727
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
a certain class of people,

728
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
those that he considers worthy,

729
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
dark owls or whoever it happens to be,

730
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and the broader

731
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
masses who suck, that was his term,

732
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
shouldn't be allowed

733
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
any significant input into

734
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
political processes, because

735
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
they're never going to accept giving

736
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
these kinds of rarefied individuals

737
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
the maximal freedom to make everything better.

738
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And this is where he differs from

739
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
conventional libertarianism, because he says

740
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
since they're going to try to use their freedom

741
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
to put limitations on these

742
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
rarefied bunches, this is why

743
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
people, this is why we need

744
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
a very strong state

745
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
with a very strong executive that's

746
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
going to essentially put them in their place.

747
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And maybe they'll be better

748
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
cared for, sometimes he does develop this

749
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
kind of patronizing attitude

750
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
towards the masses where he says,

751
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
you know, they'll be better off having someone

752
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
tend to them, but that doesn't mean that

753
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
get any kind of meaningful power

754
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
or certainly any kind of meaningful freedom

755
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
compared to the Peter Teals of the world,

756
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
the Steve Jobs of the world,

757
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
or Elon Musk, a recent obsession

758
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
who claims could be an American Caesar, right?

759
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And you can see

760
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
antecedents to this all

761
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
throughout the American libertarian tradition,

762
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
the right libertarian tradition, not the

763
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
left libertarian tradition, it's just never

764
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
been made as explicit

765
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
with Jarvan. And in some ways

766
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
reading this was actually kind of fucking refreshing

767
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
because I'm like, well, at long last

768
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
what we've been telling you is the inevitable

769
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
outcome of your theory

770
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
has been stated clearly because you've

771
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
reached the conclusion like, yeah, people don't want to

772
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
live in a right libertarian universe, so we're going to

773
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
have to fucking compel them to with the state.

774
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And it's like, bravo, you've reached the level of

775
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
19th century Marxism, it's quite an accomplishment.

776
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Music

777
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You have been watching free public content

778
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
from give them an argument

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
to access every single episode of the show,

780
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
debate breakdowns,

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Patriot exclusive post games on Monday nights,

785
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000

789
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I cannot resist

790
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
ending this with

791
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
don't be foolish.
