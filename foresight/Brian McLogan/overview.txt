1. **Reference Angles**: A reference angle is the acute angle (between 0 and 90 degrees or 0 and π/2 radians) which shares the same trigonometric values (sine, cosine, tangent) as the given angle in its quadrant.

2. **Coterminal Angles**: Coterminal angles are two angles that have the same initial side and terminal side; they differ by an integer multiple of 360 degrees (2π radians). The difference between coterminal angles is exactly 2π radians or -2π radians.

3. **Unit Circle**: The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system. It is used to visualize and determine the trigonometric values for any angle between 0 and 2π. The unit circle helps you find the coordinates (x, y) of a point on the circle given an angle in standard position.

4. **Quadrants**: The unit circle is divided into four quadrants by the lines y = x and y = -x. In the first quadrant (where both x and y are positive), the trigonometric functions yield positive values. In the second quadrant (x is negative, y is positive), cosine is negative, in the third quadrant (both x and y are negative), both sine and cosine are positive, and in the fourth quadrant (x is positive, y is negative), the sine function is negative.

5. **Tangent Function**: The tangent of an angle in the first quadrant is simply the y/x ratio of the corresponding point on the unit circle. For angles outside the first quadrant, you can find a coterminal angle within the first quadrant and use it to determine the tangent value.

6. **Example Problems**:
   - To find the coordinates for an angle (π/4) that is in the second quadrant, you would take the reference angle (which is 0 in the first quadrant), and because it's in the second quadrant, you would use the negative of the reference angle's x-coordinate. The sine of (π/4) is √2/2 and since it's in the second quadrant, the y-coordinate is negative, so the coordinates are (−√2/2, −√2/2).
   
   - For the tangent of an angle (15π/6), you first find a coterminal angle within the range 0 to 2π. The coterminal angle here is (2π + 3π/6) = (5π/6 + 3π/6) = (8π/6) = π. The tangent of π (which is a reference angle in the first quadrant) is undefined, so the tangent of 15π/6 is also undefined.

Remember, these are just examples to illustrate the concepts. When solving trigonometric problems, always refer back to the unit circle and use the appropriate reference or coterminal angles for the given angle's quadrant.
