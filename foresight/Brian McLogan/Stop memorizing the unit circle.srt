00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Welcome ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,360
So what I'd like to do is to show you why you should never have to memorize the unit

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
circle.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,800
So if you have a teacher or a friend or a parent that's saying you need to memorize the unit

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,600
circle please continue watching this video because I'm going to show you why you do not

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,640
need to memorize this unit circle as well as how you can actually solve some problems

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,860
without having it memorized just as quick or if not quicker than people that have the

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,420
unit circle memorized.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,060
So first of all I remember when I first had to learn the unit circle and people were like

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,820
hey memorize that's the only way you just have to memorize it that's it and it was confusing

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,340
that's just what I did and I kind of went through it and just what force memorized it based

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,140
on all the angles and all the points and so forth.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,460
Then I got into teaching and that's of course what I did I just reiterated you got to memorize

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,660
it you got to memorize it you got to know these points but the more and more I've taught

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,140
and the more and more I've worked through the problems I realized it's just a big waste

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,260
of time.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,980
Not only is memorizing unit circle confusing you might memorize it for a couple weeks and

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,940
then sure enough two weeks later you totally have forgot everything but there's just so

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,860
much information there and it's not even all required.

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,820
The really only piece of information that you need to know from the unit circle is the

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,940
first quadrant because if you know the first quadrant as well as knowing what a reference

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,380
angle is and a coterminal angle is then you can solve the or you can evaluate any trigonometric

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,600
function using the unit circle.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,300
It's much easier to memorize the first quadrant than to memorize the whole unit circle.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,820
So again if you don't know what the reference and coterminal angle I'll give you just a

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,860
quick little definition and then I'll kind of work through three problems showing you

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,940
how I'd be able to do this.

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,820
So on the reference angle is basically the angle the acute positive angle between the

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,460
terminal side of an angle and the x axis and the coterminal angle is an angle that

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,420
has the exact same initial and terminal side.

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,060
So usually if I give my students an angle like sine of 2 pi over 3 and they have the

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:10,100
unit circle memorized they can probably actually do this problem pretty quickly.

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,340
So they could probably do this problem really quickly but once I get to negative angles

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,140
or when I get to angles that are larger than 2 pi that's where my kind of strategy starts

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,420
beating them out and it gets a little quicker.

36
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,220
So again 2 pi over 3 if somebody had the unit circle memorized they would just simply find

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,780
2 pi over 3 which I had that erased 2 pi over 3 and they say the sine and they know that

38
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,820
that is going to be square root of 3 over 2 and they'd kind of get that one covered right.

39
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,380
However even using my system is not too bad especially once you get a little bit more

40
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
practice.

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,100
So here's the way that I kind of break it down so you can use it for future angles as well

42
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
as speed up the process.

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,260
But I'm going to take it really slow just so I can explain it.

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,340
So the first thing if I'm graphing 2 pi over 3 I need to know where exactly 2 pi over 3

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
is.

46
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,420
If I know that half way around the circle is pi well here's pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi

47
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
over 3.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,180
So I'm traveling 2 pi over 3 that is my theta that's my angle I'm given.

49
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,620
The reference angle is going to be the angle from the terminal side so actually let's see

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,620
here's my initial and there's my terminal side.

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,020
The reference angle is the angle to the x axis to my terminal side.

52
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,980
So if here's 2 pi over 3 half way around the circle is 3 pi over 3 that means this distance

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,180
is going to be pi over 3.

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,100
Now I'm just going to label I'm just going to write these out so we can just kind of

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,940
keep track of everything.

56
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,500
So that's pi over 3.

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,180
Now I go to my first quadrant what is the coordinate for pi over 3?

58
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,460
So I go to pi over 3 and I can see the coordinate is going to be 1 half comma square root of

59
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,980
3 over 2.

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,220
However that is the coordinate in the first quadrant.

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm not looking for the coordinate in the first quadrant I'm looking for the coordinate

62
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,820
in the second quadrant.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,660
So it's important for me to know what's positive and negative in the second quadrant and in

64
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,460
the second quadrant we know that the x is negative and the y is positive.

65
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,980
Now let's just write it like this negative positive.

66
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:17,020
So knowing all of this information I know that my point is so pi over 3 and 2 pi over

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,260
3 and you can see look at these two points they are exactly the same.

68
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,820
The only difference between the two points is the x coordinate is negative.

69
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,740
So I just say I'm going to use this point I'm going to use that value but I'm going

70
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,380
to use the value in the second quadrant which is still positive so my answer is square root

71
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,660
of 3 over 2.

72
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,900
And again I want to reiterate negative angles if you had this memorized usually the circle

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,860
that people memorize is from standard position going in the positive direction.

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,860
So all I need to do is give you a negative angle and a lot of students have trouble because

75
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,220
that's not the unit circle that they memorized.

76
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,220
But if you know how to graph an angle negative 5 pi over 4 again remember half way around

77
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,120
a circle is pi.

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,420
So if we were to break this up into force we would say that's 4 pi over 4 and again remember

79
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,020
going negative direction is that way right?

80
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,220
Going in the clockwise is negative counterclockwise is positive.

81
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,420
So if going half way around circle is pi that would be 4 pi over 4 if I was going to break

82
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,500
that into force but I want to go negative 5 pi over 4 so I need to go an extra pi over

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,980
4 up.

84
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,820
So that's where my angle so here's my initial side.

85
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,180
This is my terminal side.

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,780
However again what we're looking for is that reference angle.

87
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,700
What is going to be my reference angle?

88
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,300
How far is it from my terminal side back to the x-axis?

89
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,240
You can see here I passed the x-axis so I need to see how far is it to go back.

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,740
So if here's 4 pi over 4 I want an extra pi over 4 next that means all the reference

91
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,420
angle is just taking me pi over 4 back to the x-axis.

92
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,540
So I'll say my reference angle is going to equal pi over 4.

93
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,060
Because now I need to go to my unit, my first quadrant and say what is the coordinate for

94
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,380
pi over 4?

95
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,300
That's square root of 2 over 2.

96
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,660
However looking back at my angle I see that it's in the second quadrant well again what

97
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,740
is negative in the second quadrant?

98
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,380
The x-coordinate right?

99
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,300
So now the cosine negative positive.

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,500
So cosine again represents the x-coordinate but since my angle lies in the second quadrant

101
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,740
my answer is going to be a negative square root of 2 over 2.

102
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,020
Alright last but not least let's go ahead and do a tangent problem.

103
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,220
This tangent problem is 15 pi over 6.

104
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,980
Now one thing I want you to look at is when we have a coterminal angle, and I'll just

105
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,020
kind of give you an example here, here's an angle.

106
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,060
If I take an angle and I draw the angle in the opposite direction you can see that these

107
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,260
two angles start at the same side but they also end at the same side.

108
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,660
Same thing, I could draw another angle and do an extra loop around the circle and I would

109
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,340
still start at the same side and end at the same side.

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,820
So those angles are coterminal.

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,620
The difference is their measures right?

112
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,980
They have different measures even though they start and end at the same side they have different

113
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
measures.

114
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
Well what is the difference between their measures?

115
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,220
Well think about this, think about these two blue, think about original and the one

116
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,500
that I went around.

117
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,940
I basically did the exact same angle but then I did an extra revolution around the circle

118
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,860
which is basically adding 2 pi and to get this first one I'm basically subtracting 2

119
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
pi.

120
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,900
So coterminal angles, the difference between coterminal angles is just plus or minus 2 pi.

121
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,660
So if I had tangent of 15 pi over 6, the first thing I want to do is, well let me find a

122
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,820
coterminal angle then that's between 0 and 2 pi.

123
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:58,820
So what I could do is I could rewrite this as 12 pi over 6 plus 3 pi over 6.

124
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,100
Well 12 pi over 6 is just 2 pi, that's just an extra revolution around the circle.

125
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,900
So in reality and then 3 pi over 6 really just gets reduced to 2 pi halves.

126
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,580
So in reality I'm trying to find the tangent of pi over 2 because the tangent of pi over

127
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,660
2 and the tangent of 15 pi over 6 are going to be the same because they're coterminal

128
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
angles.

129
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,340
They start and end at the same side.

130
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,940
So again I go to pi over 2 and this one you're not going to need to know so much, you're

131
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,900
just going to need to look at the quadrant that it lies in, sorry the x axis, pi over

132
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,420
2 is at 0 comma 1.

133
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,540
So there is no reference angle in this case, so it would be 0 comma 1.

134
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,260
So the equation is going to be y over x so that would be 1 over 0 which is undefined.

135
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,420
So there it goes ladies and gentlemen please do not waste your time trying to memorize

136
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,580
the unit circle.

137
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,300
The best and easiest thing to do to evaluate trigonometric functions for given angles is

138
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,900
to make sure you know the first quadrant, memorize it, just do enough practice and you'll

139
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,460
know it and then use your reference and your coterminal angles to identify the point or

140
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:21,060
the angle in the first quadrant, then use your quadrants to identify if it's positive

141
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,460
or negative and then you're all set and use coterminal angles to find angles between 0

142
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,460
and 2 pi.

143
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,460
And again I just want you to notice that the unit circle all it is is a reproduction of

144
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,820
the first quadrant.

145
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,900
When you flip it over here the x is negative, when you flip it over here the y coordinates

146
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
are negative.

147
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,620
When you flip it into the third quadrant the x and y's are negative.

148
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,380
But the main important thing is don't memorize the angles because all I need to do is give

149
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,820
you negative or coterminal angles and it gets confusing.

150
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,860
Just make sure you know how to graph any angle as well as find the coterminal and the reference.

151
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,260
Thanks.
