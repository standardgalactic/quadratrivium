0	4760	Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
4760	9360	So what I'd like to do is to show you why you should never have to memorize the unit
9360	10360	circle.
10360	14800	So if you have a teacher or a friend or a parent that's saying you need to memorize the unit
14800	19600	circle please continue watching this video because I'm going to show you why you do not
19600	23640	need to memorize this unit circle as well as how you can actually solve some problems
23640	28860	without having it memorized just as quick or if not quicker than people that have the
28860	30420	unit circle memorized.
30420	35060	So first of all I remember when I first had to learn the unit circle and people were like
35060	39820	hey memorize that's the only way you just have to memorize it that's it and it was confusing
39820	44340	that's just what I did and I kind of went through it and just what force memorized it based
44340	47140	on all the angles and all the points and so forth.
47140	50460	Then I got into teaching and that's of course what I did I just reiterated you got to memorize
50460	54660	it you got to memorize it you got to know these points but the more and more I've taught
54660	58140	and the more and more I've worked through the problems I realized it's just a big waste
58140	59260	of time.
59260	62980	Not only is memorizing unit circle confusing you might memorize it for a couple weeks and
62980	67940	then sure enough two weeks later you totally have forgot everything but there's just so
67940	71860	much information there and it's not even all required.
71860	75820	The really only piece of information that you need to know from the unit circle is the
75820	80940	first quadrant because if you know the first quadrant as well as knowing what a reference
80940	86380	angle is and a coterminal angle is then you can solve the or you can evaluate any trigonometric
86380	88600	function using the unit circle.
88600	94300	It's much easier to memorize the first quadrant than to memorize the whole unit circle.
94300	97820	So again if you don't know what the reference and coterminal angle I'll give you just a
97820	101860	quick little definition and then I'll kind of work through three problems showing you
101860	103940	how I'd be able to do this.
103940	109820	So on the reference angle is basically the angle the acute positive angle between the
109820	114460	terminal side of an angle and the x axis and the coterminal angle is an angle that
114460	117420	has the exact same initial and terminal side.
117420	122060	So usually if I give my students an angle like sine of 2 pi over 3 and they have the
122060	130100	unit circle memorized they can probably actually do this problem pretty quickly.
130100	134340	So they could probably do this problem really quickly but once I get to negative angles
134340	139140	or when I get to angles that are larger than 2 pi that's where my kind of strategy starts
139140	142420	beating them out and it gets a little quicker.
142420	146220	So again 2 pi over 3 if somebody had the unit circle memorized they would just simply find
146220	150780	2 pi over 3 which I had that erased 2 pi over 3 and they say the sine and they know that
150780	156820	that is going to be square root of 3 over 2 and they'd kind of get that one covered right.
156820	160380	However even using my system is not too bad especially once you get a little bit more
160380	161380	practice.
161380	166100	So here's the way that I kind of break it down so you can use it for future angles as well
166100	167100	as speed up the process.
167100	170260	But I'm going to take it really slow just so I can explain it.
170260	174340	So the first thing if I'm graphing 2 pi over 3 I need to know where exactly 2 pi over 3
174340	175340	is.
175340	180420	If I know that half way around the circle is pi well here's pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi
180420	181420	over 3.
181420	186180	So I'm traveling 2 pi over 3 that is my theta that's my angle I'm given.
186180	191620	The reference angle is going to be the angle from the terminal side so actually let's see
191620	195620	here's my initial and there's my terminal side.
195620	200020	The reference angle is the angle to the x axis to my terminal side.
200020	204980	So if here's 2 pi over 3 half way around the circle is 3 pi over 3 that means this distance
204980	207180	is going to be pi over 3.
207180	210100	Now I'm just going to label I'm just going to write these out so we can just kind of
210100	211940	keep track of everything.
211940	213500	So that's pi over 3.
213500	218180	Now I go to my first quadrant what is the coordinate for pi over 3?
218180	224460	So I go to pi over 3 and I can see the coordinate is going to be 1 half comma square root of
224460	226980	3 over 2.
226980	229220	However that is the coordinate in the first quadrant.
229220	232500	I'm not looking for the coordinate in the first quadrant I'm looking for the coordinate
232500	234820	in the second quadrant.
234820	238660	So it's important for me to know what's positive and negative in the second quadrant and in
238660	244460	the second quadrant we know that the x is negative and the y is positive.
244460	249980	Now let's just write it like this negative positive.
249980	257020	So knowing all of this information I know that my point is so pi over 3 and 2 pi over
257020	261260	3 and you can see look at these two points they are exactly the same.
261260	265820	The only difference between the two points is the x coordinate is negative.
265820	269740	So I just say I'm going to use this point I'm going to use that value but I'm going
269740	273380	to use the value in the second quadrant which is still positive so my answer is square root
273380	275660	of 3 over 2.
275660	279900	And again I want to reiterate negative angles if you had this memorized usually the circle
279900	283860	that people memorize is from standard position going in the positive direction.
283860	288860	So all I need to do is give you a negative angle and a lot of students have trouble because
288860	291220	that's not the unit circle that they memorized.
291220	296220	But if you know how to graph an angle negative 5 pi over 4 again remember half way around
296220	299120	a circle is pi.
299120	305420	So if we were to break this up into force we would say that's 4 pi over 4 and again remember
305420	310020	going negative direction is that way right?
310020	316220	Going in the clockwise is negative counterclockwise is positive.
316220	321420	So if going half way around circle is pi that would be 4 pi over 4 if I was going to break
321420	327500	that into force but I want to go negative 5 pi over 4 so I need to go an extra pi over
327500	329980	4 up.
329980	334820	So that's where my angle so here's my initial side.
334820	337180	This is my terminal side.
337180	339780	However again what we're looking for is that reference angle.
339780	341700	What is going to be my reference angle?
341700	345300	How far is it from my terminal side back to the x-axis?
345300	350240	You can see here I passed the x-axis so I need to see how far is it to go back.
350240	354740	So if here's 4 pi over 4 I want an extra pi over 4 next that means all the reference
354740	358420	angle is just taking me pi over 4 back to the x-axis.
358420	363540	So I'll say my reference angle is going to equal pi over 4.
364300	368060	Because now I need to go to my unit, my first quadrant and say what is the coordinate for
368060	369380	pi over 4?
369380	374300	That's square root of 2 over 2.
374300	379660	However looking back at my angle I see that it's in the second quadrant well again what
379660	381740	is negative in the second quadrant?
381740	383380	The x-coordinate right?
383380	388300	So now the cosine negative positive.
388300	393500	So cosine again represents the x-coordinate but since my angle lies in the second quadrant
393740	398740	my answer is going to be a negative square root of 2 over 2.
398740	403020	Alright last but not least let's go ahead and do a tangent problem.
403020	405220	This tangent problem is 15 pi over 6.
405220	408980	Now one thing I want you to look at is when we have a coterminal angle, and I'll just
408980	412020	kind of give you an example here, here's an angle.
412020	418060	If I take an angle and I draw the angle in the opposite direction you can see that these
418060	422260	two angles start at the same side but they also end at the same side.
422260	426660	Same thing, I could draw another angle and do an extra loop around the circle and I would
426660	429340	still start at the same side and end at the same side.
429340	431820	So those angles are coterminal.
431820	433620	The difference is their measures right?
433620	436980	They have different measures even though they start and end at the same side they have different
436980	437980	measures.
437980	439980	Well what is the difference between their measures?
439980	444220	Well think about this, think about these two blue, think about original and the one
444220	445500	that I went around.
445500	450940	I basically did the exact same angle but then I did an extra revolution around the circle
451140	456860	which is basically adding 2 pi and to get this first one I'm basically subtracting 2
456860	457860	pi.
457860	463900	So coterminal angles, the difference between coterminal angles is just plus or minus 2 pi.
463900	468660	So if I had tangent of 15 pi over 6, the first thing I want to do is, well let me find a
468660	471820	coterminal angle then that's between 0 and 2 pi.
471820	478820	So what I could do is I could rewrite this as 12 pi over 6 plus 3 pi over 6.
484660	490100	Well 12 pi over 6 is just 2 pi, that's just an extra revolution around the circle.
490100	495900	So in reality and then 3 pi over 6 really just gets reduced to 2 pi halves.
495900	502580	So in reality I'm trying to find the tangent of pi over 2 because the tangent of pi over
502580	506660	2 and the tangent of 15 pi over 6 are going to be the same because they're coterminal
506660	507660	angles.
507660	509340	They start and end at the same side.
509340	513940	So again I go to pi over 2 and this one you're not going to need to know so much, you're
513940	517900	just going to need to look at the quadrant that it lies in, sorry the x axis, pi over
517900	520420	2 is at 0 comma 1.
520420	524540	So there is no reference angle in this case, so it would be 0 comma 1.
524580	531260	So the equation is going to be y over x so that would be 1 over 0 which is undefined.
531260	536420	So there it goes ladies and gentlemen please do not waste your time trying to memorize
536420	537580	the unit circle.
537580	543300	The best and easiest thing to do to evaluate trigonometric functions for given angles is
543300	547900	to make sure you know the first quadrant, memorize it, just do enough practice and you'll
547900	555460	know it and then use your reference and your coterminal angles to identify the point or
555460	561060	the angle in the first quadrant, then use your quadrants to identify if it's positive
561060	566460	or negative and then you're all set and use coterminal angles to find angles between 0
566460	567460	and 2 pi.
567460	571460	And again I just want you to notice that the unit circle all it is is a reproduction of
571460	572820	the first quadrant.
572820	576900	When you flip it over here the x is negative, when you flip it over here the y coordinates
576900	577900	are negative.
577900	580620	When you flip it into the third quadrant the x and y's are negative.
580620	585380	But the main important thing is don't memorize the angles because all I need to do is give
585380	588820	you negative or coterminal angles and it gets confusing.
588820	593860	Just make sure you know how to graph any angle as well as find the coterminal and the reference.
593860	594260	Thanks.
