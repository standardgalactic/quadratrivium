00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Welcome ladies and gentlemen.

00:04.760 --> 00:09.360
So what I'd like to do is to show you why you should never have to memorize the unit

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
circle.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.800
So if you have a teacher or a friend or a parent that's saying you need to memorize the unit

00:14.800 --> 00:19.600
circle please continue watching this video because I'm going to show you why you do not

00:19.600 --> 00:23.640
need to memorize this unit circle as well as how you can actually solve some problems

00:23.640 --> 00:28.860
without having it memorized just as quick or if not quicker than people that have the

00:28.860 --> 00:30.420
unit circle memorized.

00:30.420 --> 00:35.060
So first of all I remember when I first had to learn the unit circle and people were like

00:35.060 --> 00:39.820
hey memorize that's the only way you just have to memorize it that's it and it was confusing

00:39.820 --> 00:44.340
that's just what I did and I kind of went through it and just what force memorized it based

00:44.340 --> 00:47.140
on all the angles and all the points and so forth.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.460
Then I got into teaching and that's of course what I did I just reiterated you got to memorize

00:50.460 --> 00:54.660
it you got to memorize it you got to know these points but the more and more I've taught

00:54.660 --> 00:58.140
and the more and more I've worked through the problems I realized it's just a big waste

00:58.140 --> 00:59.260
of time.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.980
Not only is memorizing unit circle confusing you might memorize it for a couple weeks and

01:02.980 --> 01:07.940
then sure enough two weeks later you totally have forgot everything but there's just so

01:07.940 --> 01:11.860
much information there and it's not even all required.

01:11.860 --> 01:15.820
The really only piece of information that you need to know from the unit circle is the

01:15.820 --> 01:20.940
first quadrant because if you know the first quadrant as well as knowing what a reference

01:20.940 --> 01:26.380
angle is and a coterminal angle is then you can solve the or you can evaluate any trigonometric

01:26.380 --> 01:28.600
function using the unit circle.

01:28.600 --> 01:34.300
It's much easier to memorize the first quadrant than to memorize the whole unit circle.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.820
So again if you don't know what the reference and coterminal angle I'll give you just a

01:37.820 --> 01:41.860
quick little definition and then I'll kind of work through three problems showing you

01:41.860 --> 01:43.940
how I'd be able to do this.

01:43.940 --> 01:49.820
So on the reference angle is basically the angle the acute positive angle between the

01:49.820 --> 01:54.460
terminal side of an angle and the x axis and the coterminal angle is an angle that

01:54.460 --> 01:57.420
has the exact same initial and terminal side.

01:57.420 --> 02:02.060
So usually if I give my students an angle like sine of 2 pi over 3 and they have the

02:02.060 --> 02:10.100
unit circle memorized they can probably actually do this problem pretty quickly.

02:10.100 --> 02:14.340
So they could probably do this problem really quickly but once I get to negative angles

02:14.340 --> 02:19.140
or when I get to angles that are larger than 2 pi that's where my kind of strategy starts

02:19.140 --> 02:22.420
beating them out and it gets a little quicker.

02:22.420 --> 02:26.220
So again 2 pi over 3 if somebody had the unit circle memorized they would just simply find

02:26.220 --> 02:30.780
2 pi over 3 which I had that erased 2 pi over 3 and they say the sine and they know that

02:30.780 --> 02:36.820
that is going to be square root of 3 over 2 and they'd kind of get that one covered right.

02:36.820 --> 02:40.380
However even using my system is not too bad especially once you get a little bit more

02:40.380 --> 02:41.380
practice.

02:41.380 --> 02:46.100
So here's the way that I kind of break it down so you can use it for future angles as well

02:46.100 --> 02:47.100
as speed up the process.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.260
But I'm going to take it really slow just so I can explain it.

02:50.260 --> 02:54.340
So the first thing if I'm graphing 2 pi over 3 I need to know where exactly 2 pi over 3

02:54.340 --> 02:55.340
is.

02:55.340 --> 03:00.420
If I know that half way around the circle is pi well here's pi over 3 2 pi over 3 3 pi

03:00.420 --> 03:01.420
over 3.

03:01.420 --> 03:06.180
So I'm traveling 2 pi over 3 that is my theta that's my angle I'm given.

03:06.180 --> 03:11.620
The reference angle is going to be the angle from the terminal side so actually let's see

03:11.620 --> 03:15.620
here's my initial and there's my terminal side.

03:15.620 --> 03:20.020
The reference angle is the angle to the x axis to my terminal side.

03:20.020 --> 03:24.980
So if here's 2 pi over 3 half way around the circle is 3 pi over 3 that means this distance

03:24.980 --> 03:27.180
is going to be pi over 3.

03:27.180 --> 03:30.100
Now I'm just going to label I'm just going to write these out so we can just kind of

03:30.100 --> 03:31.940
keep track of everything.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.500
So that's pi over 3.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.180
Now I go to my first quadrant what is the coordinate for pi over 3?

03:38.180 --> 03:44.460
So I go to pi over 3 and I can see the coordinate is going to be 1 half comma square root of

03:44.460 --> 03:46.980
3 over 2.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.220
However that is the coordinate in the first quadrant.

03:49.220 --> 03:52.500
I'm not looking for the coordinate in the first quadrant I'm looking for the coordinate

03:52.500 --> 03:54.820
in the second quadrant.

03:54.820 --> 03:58.660
So it's important for me to know what's positive and negative in the second quadrant and in

03:58.660 --> 04:04.460
the second quadrant we know that the x is negative and the y is positive.

04:04.460 --> 04:09.980
Now let's just write it like this negative positive.

04:09.980 --> 04:17.020
So knowing all of this information I know that my point is so pi over 3 and 2 pi over

04:17.020 --> 04:21.260
3 and you can see look at these two points they are exactly the same.

04:21.260 --> 04:25.820
The only difference between the two points is the x coordinate is negative.

04:25.820 --> 04:29.740
So I just say I'm going to use this point I'm going to use that value but I'm going

04:29.740 --> 04:33.380
to use the value in the second quadrant which is still positive so my answer is square root

04:33.380 --> 04:35.660
of 3 over 2.

04:35.660 --> 04:39.900
And again I want to reiterate negative angles if you had this memorized usually the circle

04:39.900 --> 04:43.860
that people memorize is from standard position going in the positive direction.

04:43.860 --> 04:48.860
So all I need to do is give you a negative angle and a lot of students have trouble because

04:48.860 --> 04:51.220
that's not the unit circle that they memorized.

04:51.220 --> 04:56.220
But if you know how to graph an angle negative 5 pi over 4 again remember half way around

04:56.220 --> 04:59.120
a circle is pi.

04:59.120 --> 05:05.420
So if we were to break this up into force we would say that's 4 pi over 4 and again remember

05:05.420 --> 05:10.020
going negative direction is that way right?

05:10.020 --> 05:16.220
Going in the clockwise is negative counterclockwise is positive.

05:16.220 --> 05:21.420
So if going half way around circle is pi that would be 4 pi over 4 if I was going to break

05:21.420 --> 05:27.500
that into force but I want to go negative 5 pi over 4 so I need to go an extra pi over

05:27.500 --> 05:29.980
4 up.

05:29.980 --> 05:34.820
So that's where my angle so here's my initial side.

05:34.820 --> 05:37.180
This is my terminal side.

05:37.180 --> 05:39.780
However again what we're looking for is that reference angle.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.700
What is going to be my reference angle?

05:41.700 --> 05:45.300
How far is it from my terminal side back to the x-axis?

05:45.300 --> 05:50.240
You can see here I passed the x-axis so I need to see how far is it to go back.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.740
So if here's 4 pi over 4 I want an extra pi over 4 next that means all the reference

05:54.740 --> 05:58.420
angle is just taking me pi over 4 back to the x-axis.

05:58.420 --> 06:03.540
So I'll say my reference angle is going to equal pi over 4.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.060
Because now I need to go to my unit, my first quadrant and say what is the coordinate for

06:08.060 --> 06:09.380
pi over 4?

06:09.380 --> 06:14.300
That's square root of 2 over 2.

06:14.300 --> 06:19.660
However looking back at my angle I see that it's in the second quadrant well again what

06:19.660 --> 06:21.740
is negative in the second quadrant?

06:21.740 --> 06:23.380
The x-coordinate right?

06:23.380 --> 06:28.300
So now the cosine negative positive.

06:28.300 --> 06:33.500
So cosine again represents the x-coordinate but since my angle lies in the second quadrant

06:33.740 --> 06:38.740
my answer is going to be a negative square root of 2 over 2.

06:38.740 --> 06:43.020
Alright last but not least let's go ahead and do a tangent problem.

06:43.020 --> 06:45.220
This tangent problem is 15 pi over 6.

06:45.220 --> 06:48.980
Now one thing I want you to look at is when we have a coterminal angle, and I'll just

06:48.980 --> 06:52.020
kind of give you an example here, here's an angle.

06:52.020 --> 06:58.060
If I take an angle and I draw the angle in the opposite direction you can see that these

06:58.060 --> 07:02.260
two angles start at the same side but they also end at the same side.

07:02.260 --> 07:06.660
Same thing, I could draw another angle and do an extra loop around the circle and I would

07:06.660 --> 07:09.340
still start at the same side and end at the same side.

07:09.340 --> 07:11.820
So those angles are coterminal.

07:11.820 --> 07:13.620
The difference is their measures right?

07:13.620 --> 07:16.980
They have different measures even though they start and end at the same side they have different

07:16.980 --> 07:17.980
measures.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.980
Well what is the difference between their measures?

07:19.980 --> 07:24.220
Well think about this, think about these two blue, think about original and the one

07:24.220 --> 07:25.500
that I went around.

07:25.500 --> 07:30.940
I basically did the exact same angle but then I did an extra revolution around the circle

07:31.140 --> 07:36.860
which is basically adding 2 pi and to get this first one I'm basically subtracting 2

07:36.860 --> 07:37.860
pi.

07:37.860 --> 07:43.900
So coterminal angles, the difference between coterminal angles is just plus or minus 2 pi.

07:43.900 --> 07:48.660
So if I had tangent of 15 pi over 6, the first thing I want to do is, well let me find a

07:48.660 --> 07:51.820
coterminal angle then that's between 0 and 2 pi.

07:51.820 --> 07:58.820
So what I could do is I could rewrite this as 12 pi over 6 plus 3 pi over 6.

08:04.660 --> 08:10.100
Well 12 pi over 6 is just 2 pi, that's just an extra revolution around the circle.

08:10.100 --> 08:15.900
So in reality and then 3 pi over 6 really just gets reduced to 2 pi halves.

08:15.900 --> 08:22.580
So in reality I'm trying to find the tangent of pi over 2 because the tangent of pi over

08:22.580 --> 08:26.660
2 and the tangent of 15 pi over 6 are going to be the same because they're coterminal

08:26.660 --> 08:27.660
angles.

08:27.660 --> 08:29.340
They start and end at the same side.

08:29.340 --> 08:33.940
So again I go to pi over 2 and this one you're not going to need to know so much, you're

08:33.940 --> 08:37.900
just going to need to look at the quadrant that it lies in, sorry the x axis, pi over

08:37.900 --> 08:40.420
2 is at 0 comma 1.

08:40.420 --> 08:44.540
So there is no reference angle in this case, so it would be 0 comma 1.

08:44.580 --> 08:51.260
So the equation is going to be y over x so that would be 1 over 0 which is undefined.

08:51.260 --> 08:56.420
So there it goes ladies and gentlemen please do not waste your time trying to memorize

08:56.420 --> 08:57.580
the unit circle.

08:57.580 --> 09:03.300
The best and easiest thing to do to evaluate trigonometric functions for given angles is

09:03.300 --> 09:07.900
to make sure you know the first quadrant, memorize it, just do enough practice and you'll

09:07.900 --> 09:15.460
know it and then use your reference and your coterminal angles to identify the point or

09:15.460 --> 09:21.060
the angle in the first quadrant, then use your quadrants to identify if it's positive

09:21.060 --> 09:26.460
or negative and then you're all set and use coterminal angles to find angles between 0

09:26.460 --> 09:27.460
and 2 pi.

09:27.460 --> 09:31.460
And again I just want you to notice that the unit circle all it is is a reproduction of

09:31.460 --> 09:32.820
the first quadrant.

09:32.820 --> 09:36.900
When you flip it over here the x is negative, when you flip it over here the y coordinates

09:36.900 --> 09:37.900
are negative.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.620
When you flip it into the third quadrant the x and y's are negative.

09:40.620 --> 09:45.380
But the main important thing is don't memorize the angles because all I need to do is give

09:45.380 --> 09:48.820
you negative or coterminal angles and it gets confusing.

09:48.820 --> 09:53.860
Just make sure you know how to graph any angle as well as find the coterminal and the reference.

09:53.860 --> 09:54.260
Thanks.
