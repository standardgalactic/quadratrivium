1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have a good crowd for John's second talk.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's very exciting.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is the first year that John will be talking twice.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A couple of things to know.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
John will talk for about an hour or so,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then we'll have 30 minutes for questions.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The mic is right there.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's actually just right there.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So just line up when we get to the questions.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Try to keep your questions on what John talked about.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you get up and ask when Doom 4 is coming out,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going to kick you in the knee.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So right there.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I will not waste any more time,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but you guys in the back,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because John's going to write on the board,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and we have plenty of empty seats here,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you can file in.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't worry that there's reserve seats there.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just go ahead and sit in them.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All right, I will give you guys Mr. Carmichael.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, so I guess this is sort of going to be

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
like a school room session.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I had deluded myself for a little while

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that this would be the first talk

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
where I ever actually made slides to present,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but it didn't actually come to pass,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
so it's going to be notes and talking

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and some scribbling on the board again.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So almost all of what we do in game development

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is really more about artistry.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's about trying to appeal to people,

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but there's the small section of the small section

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
of what goes into the games

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that's drawing the pictures on the screen

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that you can at least make some ties

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to the hardest of hard sciences.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And while it's great that people are researching

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the psychology and the different ways

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that people think about compulsion loops

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and some of these other game design topics,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the raw physics that goes into rendering

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
just kind of goes through the heart of physics,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
where it goes through kind of the all-star list

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
of physics with Newton's optics

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and Maxwell's equations and Einstein's relativity,

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and it's kind of neat to think

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that this is sort of brought to bear

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in the techniques that go into

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
sort of making the games that we play.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So at the start, you think,

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
well, okay, we see light,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
so what actually is light?

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we've got a definition now

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that lights the sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that we can actually perceive,

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but that has a really long and complicated history

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for how we sort of reached that conclusion

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and how it's not really as clear-cut

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
as most people would like it to be.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Optical research started kind of all the way back

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
with a lot of the Greek philosophers,

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but Newton did a whole lot of work

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
with breaking light up with prisms,

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
seeing how white light was actually composed

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
of all the different colors of the spectrum,

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and they add together to make what we perceive as light.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then for, there was a centuries-long debate

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
about whether light was a particle,

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
like this little tiny billiard ball,

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
these photons that you shoot out,

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
or a wave effect, like all the things that you see

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
in waves in water and waves in matter,

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and so on.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And finally, we reached the conclusion that,

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
well, it's a wave particle duality

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that Quantum Mechanics talks about,

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and this is very unsatisfying

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
when you begin looking at this,

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but it's really pretty much irrefutable.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are these straightforward experiments

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that can be done to show that you look at it one way,

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it's a wave, you look at it another way,

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's a light, or it's a particle.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, luckily for computer graphics,

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
we hardly care at all about that,

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
only when you start looking at some aspects

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
of surface reflectance models,

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
do you start caring at all about

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
some of these Quantum Mechanical properties of light.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
For the most part, we can look at light

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
as zillions and zillions of little billiard balls

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
shot out from lights and bouncing off of things

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and eventually reaching our eyes

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so that we can perceive them.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's a lot of simplifications

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
that have to happen when you talk about simulating this.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's a lot of engineering disciplines

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
like thermal management, radio engineering

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that do simulations of the electromagnetic spectrum,

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
just other parts of it,

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
how they bounce around, interact with things,

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and this is done all the time,

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and it works, it really is science.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, you can say rendering an image

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
or deciding how much light reaches a particular area

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
is about as basic of a science as it comes.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's not any artistic measure in here.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There are tons of other aspects

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
when you get into perception

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that do become questions about,

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
well, maybe there is artistry that goes into producing something

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
when you've got an impression that you want,

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but when you're talking about simulating an environment,

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
which most of what we do in the hardcore FPS type games

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is we are pretending that we've got this virtual world

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and we're running a camera through it

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and we're trying to simulate what's happening in various ways.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And nowadays, we know what we would have to do

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to make that almost perfect.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We just have nowhere near the computing capacity

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to do really, really high-level simulations,

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
but we can trace it useful

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
even if you're not going to do the right thing

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to at least understand what the right thing is

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and then understand which trade-offs you're making

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and make them with sort of a clear head

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
rather than accidentally backing into trade-offs

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that may or may not be really the best way to go about things.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, so many that...

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It took a long time for people to realize

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
that these other phenomena, things like radio waves,

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and there's a lot of confusion in 19th and 20th century physics

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
about which things were particles and which things were rays,

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and we still have kind of mixed-up terminology

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
when you talk about cosmic rays that are actually particles

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and you talk about alpha radiation and beta radiation

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and these things that are particle-based

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
rather than being rays from the electromagnetic spectrum.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But we use this stuff all the time for radio waves.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Your Wi-Fi has two gigahertz frequencies.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The visible light rays are up in the terahertz range,

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
many terahertz.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But they're basically the same thing.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They just differ in how they interact with matter.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They're produced in somewhat similar ways,

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but the different things change.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They behave differently when they interact with other things

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
based on their wavelength,

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
which is why x-rays can shoot through things,

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
radio waves can go through some things

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that the visible light pretty much bounces off of.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, another important critical thing, really,

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is that photons, the little bundles of light that we talk about,

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
they are absolutely quantized.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's, again, part of the quantum weirdness

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that you can't send off this arbitrarily divisible amount,

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
there is an almost unbelievably large number of them.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Given light that's throwing out is, you know,

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can just say zillions with a straight face

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
because it's a very large scientific notation number.

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not trillions, it's not quadrillions,

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
it's even more than that that are coming out

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in terms of these bundled little quanta of energy.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Now, they do have characteristics to them.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If we treat them as little billiard balls in computer graphics,

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we are generally looking at only a few different spectrums

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
of a few different wavelengths in the spectrum of light,

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and that has to do with an aspect of the human visual system.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
While there are this incredibly divisible spectrum of light

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that goes out, we're only susceptible to three sort of styles of light,

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and they're not even individual frequencies.

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's why we can get by with red, green, and blue

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
for our monitor's emissive spectrums

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because we only have three types of color receptors in our eyes,

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and I often think how it would be really interesting

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
if you could look at all of these other spectrums bouncing around,

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and that's what thermal imaging and some of these other things

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
let you sort of get a peek into it,

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and that's only light that's very...

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that's EM radiation that's very close to the visible spectrum,

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the infrared.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It would be much more bizarre and interesting

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to be able to visualize radio waves in a real-time space

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
to, like, see all the multi-path that's causing your Wi-Fi

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to be weird in specific ways,

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
why, you know, moving something over here

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
causes the radiation to change so much at your antenna

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
to make a difference in your reception strength,

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and these are all things that have a bearing to what you do

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
with light transport, as well as other wave phenomena,

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
like audio, like really, really high-end audio processing

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
is the exact same thing as what we treat light processing.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You send out energy, it bounces off of all sorts of things in the world,

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and eventually arrives at something that's going to perceive it,

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
which would be your ears in that case versus your eyes.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So to kind of start with the path of a photon,

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
of what it would take,

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you've got something creates the photon,

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and for the longest time in our human existence

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
about the only thing that we saw creating photons

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
was a great deal of heat.

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You heat things up hot enough,

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and photons start coming off of them.

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You heat it up enough, it starts glowing a dull red,

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you heat it up more, it starts getting more yellowish,

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and towards white as more and more of the colors of the spectrum

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
are emitted from these hot things,

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and obviously the sun is a very hot thing

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
where you've got a fusion reactor going,

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and the light that comes off of that is all of these atoms

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
giving up some energy.

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So photons carry energy away from where they came from,

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and this is a radiative heat transfer where something gets hot.

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you leave it all by itself there,

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it glows and it eventually stops glowing.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It cools down, going down through the spectrum,

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
getting cooler and cooler until you don't see any visible light

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
because it's actually lost much of its heat.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
On Earth, radiative heat transfer is the least effective form of heat transfer.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You get much more from conduction

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
where it just kind of goes through the actual physical contact

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
into other areas as the heat spreads out,

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
or convection where moving currents of air or water take the heat away.

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But in space, radiation is the only way you lose heat,

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and in aerospace engineering this is extremely important.

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Things like the areas like the International Space Station and Spaceships,

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
they have to worry a whole lot about thermal management

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
because the only tool they've really got is radiation.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You see these enormous solar panels where they collect solar energy,

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but a lot of space vehicles have to have enormous radiators

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
where they actually let the energy go out from the vehicle,

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
otherwise they would get hotter and hotter.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's important to note that even if it's not glowing so that we can see it,

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
everything's still radiating,

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
so you don't see the space station glowing red hot,

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's just glowing at whatever its normal temperature is,

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
which can be perceived with infrared sensors,

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but it slowly loses energy and it eventually reaches a balance.

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's why something stuck out in the sun in space doesn't get hotter and hotter.

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Eventually it reaches the point where the light that's coming in and hitting it

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
is equal by the radiation that's leaving it,

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and there are, like you can make,

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
we've made rocket engines that are radiatively cooled

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
where they burn 5000 degrees or so inside

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and they get so blindingly white hot on the outside

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that all of the energy that's not going out the nozzle that's soaking into the walls

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
is radiated away as a whole lot of light.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And this is essentially what old-style incandescent light bulbs were.

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You had a tungsten filament, you made it really hot by pushing electrons through it,

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and it got hot enough and it started glowing.

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And if you watched closely, if it was a very, like a heavy filament,

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you could watch it warm up or especially shut down,

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
it would go through, kind of ramp through the temperatures, you would see it,

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
be red and get up to white hot, and then when you shut it down,

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
it would cool down through yellow and then back through red

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
before finally settling back to radiating in non-visible regions

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
at sort of room temperature eventually.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nowadays we have a lot more efficient ways to create photons

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
with fluorescence and LEDs, things that are tuned carefully

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
to just barely nudge the electrons in the atoms out to an excited state,

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
let them collapse back down and spit a photon out.

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
For the most part, photon emission is random in terms of which direction it goes.

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When you look at radio engineering, there's huge bodies of literature

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
for intended design that determine how you can make it slightly stronger

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
or weaker in different directions, but there's still a very fundamental nature of randomness,

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
which is, again, the quantum mechanics aspect of things.

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
At a very low level, natural events are completely random

270
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and you can't just say, I only want photons that are going to come out of the left side of this material.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So you get a photon that pops off in some random direction.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It may go straight for, if it's coming from a distant star,

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
it could go straight for trillions of miles, more or less just traveling through space.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There's little bits of general relativity with warping of light that can happen,

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but for the most part, it can continue on indefinitely.

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's a self-propagating wave, so it pops off of some atom somewhere,

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
maybe flies through space for a billion trillion miles or something,

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
comes in, finally hits our Earth's atmosphere,

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and then starts interacting with the atmosphere in some way.

280
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Every change in density that visible light goes through

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
will result in it bending its path somewhat.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is called refraction.

283
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The most obvious case when you look at it is things like prisms and lenses

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
where you can see the light really strongly warped,

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but it happens in any sort of density change,

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
going from the vacuum of space to the outer reaches of our atmosphere,

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and then every change in pressure or temperature changes the density,

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and that causes very slight and subtle movements of the changes in the direction of the light.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is actually why stars twinkle out at night.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're on a clear night and you see stars coming in from billions or trillions of miles away.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's going completely straight till it hits the upper atmosphere,

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and then it may slightly deviate, just tiny fractions of degrees,

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and this can cause the very small number of photons that you're seeing there

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to kind of come and go or move around in different ways.

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But the most important thing from a computer graphics standpoint

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
are the effects that happen when it hits more solid matter,

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
or solid surfaces, or even liquid surfaces,

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and that's where it has the opportunity to generally...

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, even gas, you can wind up having the case of absorbing the photon.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This happens rarely in gas.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can pass through hundreds of miles of atmosphere

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and not have too many of the photons absorbed,

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but it happens very rapidly in matter, in solid matter.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A typical photon, when it hits a surface, might penetrate a little bit into it.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
A surface like metal will bounce off of just the first several atoms.

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It doesn't take many molecules or many atoms of metal before you can reflect light out,

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which is why you can make these super enormous space mirrors

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that are just a very tiny sputtering of aluminum on some plastic film,

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and they can actually make solar sails or giant solar collectors and concentrators.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But for most other materials, the light can penetrate a little bit further into it.

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As it interacts with the molecules, it can either be absorbed,

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
raising the temperature a little bit, going into eventually making it hotter

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
so that it starts radiating out at some level,

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
or it can redirect the photon in some way.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You've got the minor redirections from the refraction

316
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and much stronger ones when it interacts and bounces off of a solid surface.

317
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's a ton of different names.

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's literally a couple dozen different names

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
for the different ways that light can interact with surfaces.

320
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There's all the different types of scattering.

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Of course, reflection, refraction, refraction can be split up into

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
specular reflection, diffuse reflection,

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and there's all sorts of different subcategories.

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Optics is a huge topic.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There are societies dedicated to every aspect of it,

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and there's huge terminologies for all of it.

327
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But for the most part, you can say,

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
photon comes in, if it's not absorbed,

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it's going to be kicked out some other direction,

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and then it can go and interact potentially with the atmosphere

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
or potentially with another surface.

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And eventually, it's either absorbed,

333
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
well, eventually it is absorbed somewhere,

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
but for the most part, they're absorbed into the surfaces around us,

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but a tiny, tiny fraction of all the photons that are bouncing around

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
eventually hits our eyes.

337
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And even when it gets to our eyes, which are mostly transparent,

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
there's this chance that the photon hits,

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and it specularly reflects off of our eye,

340
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and it made it all the way out of the billions of possible traces,

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
made it to my eye, and then decides to specularly reflect off some other direction.

342
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But most of it that hits the eye and hits the lens gets through,

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
propagates through the vitreous and aqueous humor

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and all the little biological parts of the eye,

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and hits receptors in the back of our eyeballs

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
that turn those eventually into neural impulses that our brain works with.

347
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Now, our eyes can actually be quite sensitive.

348
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The rods, the non-color sensitive part of our eyes,

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
when they're fully dark adapted,

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
if you've been staying outside in a dark area for 20, 30 minutes,

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
single photons can cause chemical reactions to happen inside the rod cells.

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It takes a handful of them, a couple dozen for it to turn into a neural impulse,

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
but it is possible for people that,

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
especially in the old days, people watching for things on ships

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
in moonless nights that might be out all night with nothing but faint starlight,

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you can have cases of just handfuls of photons coming off of something,

357
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
being registered and showing up and people acknowledging their existence,

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
which is pretty amazing when you think about these incredible subatomic particles,

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
not even particles, but incredible, the scope of that being detectable by us as biological entities.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There are limits to what you can wind up detecting with light.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The visible light that we see has a wavelength,

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and you can't really deal with things that are smaller than that,

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
which is why you're never going to have a real picture of an atom or a molecule,

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
because those are much, much smaller than the wavelengths of light.

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You eventually use electron microscopes and then scanning tunneling microscopes

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and these other things that don't deal with light at all to take those super tiny pictures,

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
like the boy in his atom movie that IBM Research did,

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
which was done with a little raster grid of atoms,

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
which is really in the fundamental sense of the word, deeply awesome,

370
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that we are dealing with matter, the very constituents of everything at that level,

371
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and we can make a little movie out of it,

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
but those pictures have nothing to do with light, nothing to do with rendering

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and basically the techniques that I'm talking about here,

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
that's a completely different way of sensing what's going on at that level.

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So to recap the basic pictures of this,

376
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
you've got something, a sun up here, spits out some light, travels through space,

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
gets to the atmosphere on the Earth, maybe bends a little bit,

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
maybe just goes straight through, comes down, hits the surface,

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
maybe gets absorbed, maybe hits something else,

380
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and you've got walls and rooms and bouncing around in there,

381
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and eventually, if we're seeing it, reaches somebody's eyeball inside,

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and that's the physics of what happens.

383
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's really well understood.

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It does come down to a lot of data acquisition and characterization.

385
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
When you talk about how the critical interactions with the surfaces,

386
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
when you've got your basic theoretical thing,

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
if you talk about a flat surface, you say,

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
light comes in, what happens to it?

389
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's the question of surface response.

390
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you have a perfect mirror,

391
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and it's worth noting that you don't have to be perfect on an atomic level

392
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
to be a perfect mirror, you only have to be perfect at the optical level,

393
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
which is somewhat larger.

394
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So people can make basically perfect mirrors, just highly, highly polished things.

395
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
A perfect mirror will have the photon reflect off in this exact reflection.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If you take the normal to the surface, you wind up with equal angles there.

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So highly polished surfaces act like this.

398
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
When you get a reflection off of something like the surface of water,

399
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
it'll behave like this.

400
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But most of the surfaces that we look around us do not behave like this.

401
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We have a spread of the energy where it comes in,

402
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and it bounces off to some degree in every direction.

403
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
No matter which way you look at most surfaces,

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
you see, again, zillions of photons coming in.

405
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Some of them go in every direction.

406
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They just go in a direction that's biased based on the type of surface that it is.

407
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
A surface that...

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
One of the easy things that a lot of times is approximated,

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
both in the engineering sciences and in computer graphics,

410
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
is to assume that the surface reflects perfectly diffusely,

411
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
or it's a Lambertian surface.

412
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And what that means is that no matter which way the light comes in,

413
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
if it hits it completely edge on, completely straight on,

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
it has an equal probability of going in every direction.

415
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And there are some materials that are close to this.

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
If you take something like a block of chalk, white chalk,

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that behaves almost as a perfect diffuse reflector.

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If you light it from one position,

419
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and you look at that like a little scribed out area on it from any different area around it,

420
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
it will appear to have about the same amount of energy coming out of it.

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But there are...

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
All surfaces are more complex than that, though.

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Most of them will say, if you've got light coming in here,

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
there will be more of it coming out around the reflection area,

425
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and some general amount coming out in all different directions.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But these can actually get quite complicated.

427
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And the simplifications that we use in graphics sort of approximate these,

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but you can measure these with specific tools

429
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
that go in and take lots of samples from moving the lights around,

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
because it depends...

431
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where it does get

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
not so great for computer graphics.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It depends both on the incoming direction and the upcoming direction.

434
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And those are two angles in each one,

435
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so it winds up being a four-dimensional equation to say how light comes in here,

436
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
how does it come out in some other direction.

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And in fact, it gets worse than that,

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
because very few things do reflect just off of this upper surface.

439
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Most of the time, the light will go in,

440
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
go below the surface, bounce around a little bit,

441
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and shoot out some other direction.

442
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So if you're saying, well, my photon comes in here,

443
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
not only do you have to say if you're being really, really accurate,

444
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
which angle does it come off of,

445
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but also how far away from the original point does it come off of?

446
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Or if it's a thin surface, how does it come out on the backside?

447
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You may have other setups coming there.

448
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
When you look at, like, a leaf in the sunshine,

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
you've got a lot of the energy,

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
bounces off the shiny top face,

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but a lot of it diffuses through and comes out on the backside.

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So these are not pleasantly analytically tractable things.

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They wind up being big tables of data.

454
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And one thing that's important to remember is,

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
when you see, like, tables of data that are collected for things,

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
don't necessarily capture all of the important characteristics of the surface,

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
where if you take one of these sensors that you can capture a table of data here,

458
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
if you did have your perfect mirror reflector,

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
it's almost certainly not going to have the exact sample exactly where you want.

460
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But eventually data does win,

461
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
just as we increase resolution on things,

462
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
we'll have higher and higher resolutions for our surface models,

463
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and we'll get closer and closer to reality for what we're simulating.

464
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So to go as kind of a capsule history of computer graphics rendering then,

465
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
when computer graphics started off,

466
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
look in the 60s, 60s and early 70s,

467
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
computer graphics research focused on the hidden line problem.

468
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You know, we had line-oriented displays,

469
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
either true vector displays where, like the old video game arcade games,

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
like I'm blanking out now,

471
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
like Asteroids is the best example,

472
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that are actually drawn by raster beams moving around

473
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
where they really are true line displays.

474
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
There's no raster, there's no edge aliasing,

475
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and all the different games like that were what the earliest computer graphics systems

476
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
were basically like that, where there were vector displays.

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And once people learned how to draw,

478
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
figured out all the basic projective math to say,

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
all right, I've got my cube here.

480
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You know, I want it to look like that,

481
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
but when I draw it, I've got that on there.

482
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How do we figure out which lines that we're going to erase?

483
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And that was, you know, that occupied research for a while

484
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
to figure out effective ways to do that

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
without spending at the time the scary divide costs for different things,

486
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and you'd have lots of interesting work being going on.

487
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But when we eventually got raster displays where we could fill them in,

488
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
of course, at that point people filled in the surfaces of the cube,

489
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
they're all grayscale at that time,

490
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
so you can draw a cube and say, well, this will be the light face,

491
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
this will be the dark face,

492
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
but that was neat at the time,

493
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
but that was not sort of what things look like in reality.

494
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So people started taking the steps that they could to try and say,

495
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
what do we need to do to make this more approximate what we see with our eyes?

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And this has been a path that's been driven probably more than half

497
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
by sort of ad hoc approaches about just,

498
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
well, what's reasonably easy for us to do that gets us somewhat closer to it

499
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
while there's also been sort of a parallel path of saying,

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
well, what's the physics actually doing?

501
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
How do we make an actual solution for it?

502
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So the earliest things that got added to the shading model for computer graphics

503
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
was if we assumed that there's going to be a light that's at some point,

504
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
in the beginning it wouldn't even be local,

505
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
you just say light is coming in from this direction.

506
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So we want to be able to say what color or what shade

507
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
should each individual surface be based on where that light is.

508
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So you've got the obvious things that if it's not facing the light,

509
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
no light hits it and you would draw it black.

510
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So the question about things that are directly facing the light,

511
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
so if you've got light coming in,

512
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
if you have a surface completely perpendicular to it,

513
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you make that your brightest color.

514
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
If you've got a surface that's completely parallel with it,

515
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it gets no light, you make that zero.

516
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So you've got some curve that goes between it

517
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
to say how bright something should be.

518
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And it turns out that that's a fairly straightforward bit of math to solve

519
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
where you have light coming in at a certain angle,

520
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
you've got the normal to the surface,

521
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the amount of light that would strike a little surface there

522
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
is proportional to the cosine of this angle.

523
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And that's actually, that's not an approximation,

524
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
that's actually a bit of ground truth.

525
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If you've got the light coming in

526
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and you've got something coming in at this angle,

527
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
a surface that's, let's see.

528
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
If you count the number of rays that go in

529
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
on something catching four of them directly, turning it down,

530
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
only covering two, two spaces there,

531
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
all that actually works out correct.

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And this is the basis for a lot of the,

533
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
a lot of the real calculations for light transport,

534
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
not a hack actually part of real proper physics measuring.

535
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So once you've got that basic approach,

536
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
you go back to your cube

537
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and you get your light coming in

538
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and you've got a brighter face, a brighter face, a darker face,

539
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and the faces away from it are completely black

540
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and then most people say,

541
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
well, we don't usually see things like that.

542
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So now we get into the fudging and you say,

543
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
well, let's just brighten everything up a little bit.

544
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We'll add an ambient term.

545
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So you sort of just add this minimum level

546
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
to everything on the back side.

547
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And that helps a little bit.

548
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
If you've got a cube, then everything looks pretty much great

549
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
because it's a constant color just on the side

550
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
that you might not see over there.

551
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But if you've got something more complex,

552
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
everything that's not facing away from the light

553
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
winds up being the same color.

554
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And it's clearly not correct.

555
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's not what you'd like,

556
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
but it was all that seemed reasonable to do at the time.

557
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The next step was to start looking at surfaces

558
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
that are more than these perfectly diffuse reflectors.

559
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If you model your cube like this,

560
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
it looks kind of like it was maybe carved out of chalk

561
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and it can be a decent representation of that.

562
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But very few of the surfaces that we see around us

563
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
are really that simple.

564
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Most things have some kind of a shine or highlight on them.

565
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
As we look around, you can see reflections

566
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and highlights on all sorts of things

567
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and the obvious bits of metal and plastic,

568
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
little things that you might hold in your hand.

569
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I can look at all these different shines and reflections

570
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
on the plastic that I'm holding here.

571
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Now, the observation was made

572
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that the highlights on most objects

573
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that weren't completely mirrors,

574
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
they tended to be something like a bright hot spot,

575
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
like if you had your sphere here,

576
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
you would have a bright hot spot

577
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
that kind of faded a little bit around there.

578
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And just by looking at that and saying,

579
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
well, what could we do that would be kind of like that?

580
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The observation was made that,

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
well, if you take this sort of cosine arrangement here,

582
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
this makes this nice broad fall off.

583
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It makes over the entire surface of the sphere coming from that.

584
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It'll fade off to halfway around the light.

585
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But if you wanted something that was really tight,

586
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the thought was, well, we can just take this value

587
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and raise it to a higher power.

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We can just take this and go, you know,

589
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
square it, cube it, take it to the 20th power,

590
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
which can be done effectively, mathematically, quite cheaply.

591
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This has no basis in physical reality at all.

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
This is a completely ad hoc approach.

593
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But it worked out okay.

594
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And this is what the fog lighting model was about,

595
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
where you separate it into your diffuse lighting,

596
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
which is more or less what color the surface is,

597
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and then your specular lighting,

598
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
which is what the highlights are going to look like.

599
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So you had this other value to play around with,

600
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and that was the specular power.

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And nowadays, I regret using that in my terminology,

602
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
where we have power maps,

603
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and nobody understands what those are.

604
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
They relate to the specular exponent,

605
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
what you're going to take something to a power of to tighten it.

606
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The better terminology that's used more often now

607
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
is a roughness map, where you have a mapping,

608
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and you also do it in logarithmic space rather than linear,

609
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but more or less, that's still today,

610
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
what a lot of graphics involves,

611
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
is you've got a roughness parameter,

612
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
which affects this exponent that you take this extra vector

613
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to generate your specular highlights for.

614
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And again, it would make so if you're rendering your cube

615
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and you get the light at the right angle,

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
like if I'm looking at this here and the light's over here,

617
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it hits that, if that's at that right reflection angle,

618
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
then you'll get a nice bright shade on there.

619
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That flat surface will catch the light and it will glint at you,

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and that would be looked at as a real advance for the rendering.

621
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So you've got something that looks diffused,

622
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
but when it moves into the light,

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
it kind of catches a flash of light and fades out.

624
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So the facets on these solid shaded models started looking better.

625
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Now, the next thing that people wanted to do is,

626
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
okay, we've got enough cubes and tetrahedrons

627
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and dodecahedrons and whatever.

628
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So we want to start making things that look more realistic.

629
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
We need to have a teapot.

630
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We need to have a curved surface in some way.

631
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So you make some curved surface like this.

632
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There was a lot of work in the early days

633
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
on directly rasterizing curved surfaces, drawing them directly,

634
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
but all the real-time graphics, almost all of it,

635
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
has been a matter of turning your curved surfaces

636
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
into approximations with flat surfaces.

637
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So you've got something that is theoretically a curve,

638
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
but really it's a bunch of facets.

639
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So if you apply the lighting model there to it,

640
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
you see all of these facets.

641
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It stands out as like, okay, you've just carved this out

642
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
with all these flat planes,

643
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and it doesn't fool you into thinking

644
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
that this is this smooth-curved object.

645
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So the next step in graphics that went on

646
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
was adding the interpolation across the vertexes,

647
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
where instead of calculating a value for a face,

648
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you calculate it for a given vertex, for one corner,

649
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and then you just average.

650
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You interpolate across there

651
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
so that a point here is going to be some average

652
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
between three or four of the points that make it up.

653
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And that works surprisingly well.

654
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you're looking again at a diffuse surface,

655
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
it works out just about as good as you'd like.

656
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There are some minor artifacts called mock bands

657
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that you get if it changes too much,

658
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
but if your tessellation's okay, that works out all right.

659
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It works out less well with the specular highlights,

660
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and the reason is that your specular highlight,

661
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
if you've got...

662
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It might show up like if you were supposed to have

663
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
some hot spot right here in the middle of a surface.

664
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If you calculate it at the outside,

665
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
this is going to be almost zero for the specular, almost zero.

666
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And when you interpolate across it, it's going to have nothing.

667
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You're just not going to see it.

668
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You'll only see a highlight when the specular comes up

669
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
at the very edges.

670
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And this is what's still to this day

671
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
sort of the standard open GL shading model is.

672
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's gross shading with calculations at the vertexes,

673
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
interpolating the colors or parameters across it.

674
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So this model is still with us to this day

675
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
for a lot of sort of quick stuff that's not

676
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
visual simulation oriented.

677
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
If you just write something using lighting with open GL,

678
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that's the model that you get

679
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
if you turn on specular highlights.

680
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
In graphics where they care more about visual quality,

681
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
what started happening was interpolating

682
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
not the color across it,

683
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
but interpolating the normal,

684
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
sort of the curvature across each point

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and then applying the lighting model at every pixel.

686
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And at the time, this was like a flagrant use of processing power

687
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
because we're like, okay, these calculations are expensive.

688
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
We have to do these distance calculations, dot products,

689
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
exponential power stuff.

690
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And when you just do it at each vertex on your cube,

691
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
okay, so you've got a handful of vertexes

692
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
that you need to calculate.

693
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But even on an old school display,

694
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
you would have hundreds of thousands of pixels.

695
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And so if you're drawing that there,

696
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
going from doing this maybe a few hundred times

697
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
or a few thousand times to hundreds of thousands of times

698
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
for a scene was a large use of additional processing power.

699
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But it got you the good looking areas

700
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
where you could have a highlight that looked about

701
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
like it should moving across the surface

702
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
or sitting on a floor looking stable there

703
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
as you moved around.

704
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
People that have been in following PC graphics

705
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
for the last couple of decades,

706
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
we've seen games that do not have interpolation

707
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in the different ways where the lighting would change dramatically.

708
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We always had the problem of densely-tesolated characters

709
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
or objects and then very low-tesolation on the world.

710
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And the problem that you'd run into with that

711
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
is that if you're applying one of these interpolation schemes to it,

712
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
you would have something that you could never have highlights

713
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
in the middle of the surface, only at the corners.

714
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And there were also issues with perspective math and clipping

715
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
that would mean that it would change as a really big polygon

716
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
clipped by the edge of the screen in almost all cases

717
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
the way people did it.

718
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And this was one of the big things that pushed me

719
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
during the Quake timeframe to use light maps for the first time

720
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
where instead of I had seen other games

721
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that were doing lighting at the vertexes

722
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and I didn't think it wasn't good enough,

723
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you couldn't get anything resembling a shadow,

724
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
you had all these swimming artifacts with the lighting

725
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and it just didn't give what I wanted to see.

726
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And while Quake didn't have any specular highlights,

727
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
it did have these...

728
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You had samples every 16 pixels in the light maps

729
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that we interpolated across those,

730
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and that gave us the look that was very important for it.

731
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And we didn't get to actually...

732
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It was only all the way up to Doom 3

733
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
where we would start doing per-pixel operations like this

734
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
to get the much better calculations.

735
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So even with this level of graphics at that time

736
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
where you've just got sort of these fog lighting,

737
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
simple models, hacks like the specular exponent

738
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and the ambient term,

739
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
we started to see some offline things being rendered

740
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
like some movies, you know, early work,

741
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
some of the early NASA promotional work that Jim Blinn did

742
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
were significant in the sort of growth of all of this.

743
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And then we finally saw some feature theatrical films

744
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
with like The Last Star Fighter and especially Tron

745
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
where you would see...

746
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You go back and you look at Tron

747
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and you have a lot of these sort of

748
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
gross-shaded, solid-modeled things on there

749
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
with your light cycles or recognizers and so on.

750
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And they were doing something...

751
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
They were intelligently picking a battle

752
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
that could be won at the time.

753
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If you said, well, we have to go ahead

754
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and render photo-realistic humans,

755
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
we were nowhere close to up to that task.

756
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But we could do geometric solid models

757
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that looked good enough to show on the big screen,

758
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and that was a pretty big breakthrough.

759
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And simultaneously with this,

760
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
there was an alternate approach to

761
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the way graphics were being drawn that...

762
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So most of the early graphics were done

763
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
with rasterization where if you've got

764
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
your computer screen and you've got

765
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
your quad on here,

766
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
you would draw this on a computer

767
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
by calculating these equations of the lines

768
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and then you would usually just kind of

769
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
walk across building up your rows of pixels.

770
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The whole process of hidden surface removal

771
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
is another step on top of this

772
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
where if you've got lots of cubes,

773
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
how do you know which one draws on top of the other one?

774
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And this was another thing, if you look back

775
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
in research from the 70s especially,

776
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
there was tons of work going on on hidden surface removal

777
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
of these clever different algorithmic ways.

778
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Today we just kill it with a depth buffer.

779
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We just throw megabytes and megabytes of memory

780
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and the problem gets solved much, much easier.

781
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But this path of rasterization is still with us today.

782
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
GPUs don't rasterize in scanline order like this.

783
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
They follow crazy winding paths

784
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
to maximize memory bandwidth to fill up tiles,

785
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
to rasterize them in different pieces,

786
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and they rasterize all quads at a time,

787
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
but it's still essentially a rasterization method

788
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
where we have shapes and we figure out how to rasterize them.

789
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
We figure out which pixels they're going to cover,

790
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and then we figure out what we want to do with them.

791
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
The alternate scheme which was also developed

792
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
in the later 70s is ray tracing

793
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
where instead of saying, alright,

794
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm starting with my object,

795
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm going to take these four vertexes

796
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
that are in space, I'm going to take my virtual camera

797
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and I'm going to transform them

798
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and find out where they are on the screen

799
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and then fill them in.

800
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Ray tracing goes the other way

801
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
where you start off with your camera in space somewhere,

802
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
your virtual viewing screen,

803
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and through that you send rays out into your world

804
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and you intersect them with your cube over here,

805
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and if it hits that cube first,

806
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
it knows it didn't hit anything behind that,

807
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
it's got a surface point there,

808
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and it can apply whatever shading model it needs to.

809
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The thing that ray tracing gave,

810
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I mean it's radically slower,

811
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
thousands of times slower than ray tracing

812
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
if you're doing just the most straightforward thing.

813
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If you just want to draw that cube,

814
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
you can draw the same thing with ray tracing,

815
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
it's just going to be a thousand times slower with ray tracing,

816
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
but it allowed a couple things

817
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
that were either very difficult or impossible

818
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
to do properly with ray tracing,

819
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and the thing that you would always see

820
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
in ray tracing demos is your shiny reflective spheres.

821
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So you've got a little chrome ball

822
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and the fact that you could see the world reflected into it,

823
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and then back into your eye

824
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
was the thing that ray tracing could do

825
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
that rasterization couldn't do really worth a damn at all.

826
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You would approximate it with environment maps

827
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and different things,

828
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
but for reflections and for refraction

829
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
doing those things properly,

830
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
ray tracing was really the only good solution,

831
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
but it wasn't practical even for most offline work.

832
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I can remember looking at old research papers

833
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
of things that are run on deck vax computers,

834
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and they talk about the number of hours

835
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
to render these really trivial scenes,

836
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
just a few boxes in the eye,

837
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
maybe a sphere sitting there,

838
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and the idea of rendering complete worlds with it

839
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
was fantasy at the time,

840
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
but it did address some of those problems

841
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
for the first time with reflection and refraction,

842
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and it also much more elegantly solved shadows,

843
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
which all of this stuff talking about surface interactions

844
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
and finding out what you hit with the light,

845
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that kind of dodges one of the really hard problems,

846
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
which is saying that, well,

847
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
the light obviously doesn't reach through things.

848
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you transform something up here

849
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and you transform another surface down here,

850
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and the light's up here,

851
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
this should be in shadow because it's blocked by this,

852
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
but that turns out to not be a particularly trivial thing to resolve.

853
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's basically the same problem

854
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
of how you view something from your point of view,

855
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but viewed from the light's point of view,

856
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and that can mean that,

857
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
well, if every light in your scene

858
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
has to do a similar rendering process

859
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
to what your view does,

860
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
possibly harder because there are omnidirectional lights

861
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
in many different cases,

862
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and it's just a tough problem,

863
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and as with so many things,

864
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
there's a lot of wonderful research in the 70s and 80s

865
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
going through about how you do shadows effectively

866
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
with these different analytic solutions.

867
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
In the end, we had a brief period

868
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
where stencil volumes were an effective way to do things,

869
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
but now it's essentially all shadow buffers,

870
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
where we really do take every light,

871
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
render an image from their scene,

872
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and use that to back project onto there to figure things out.

873
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But that was one thing that ray tracing

874
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
had an elegant solution for.

875
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Again, if you're already a thousand times slower,

876
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
who cares if you're another factor of two or three slower?

877
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
For every point you hit, you go ahead and say,

878
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I've got my light up here,

879
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'll trace to the light or to however many lights I've got,

880
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and if there's something that blocks it,

881
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
then that's going to be shadowed and I can take it out.

882
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So ray tracing always had this much clearer abstraction

883
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
of what you're doing.

884
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's easy to tell that you're sending out a little array,

885
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
you hit something, you determine whether you hit all the other lights,

886
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
or if you bounce or refract into something else.

887
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So it's always been easy and clear.

888
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's just had this thousand times slower problem to deal with.

889
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So the advances that were being made on graphics,

890
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
kind of after this early age,

891
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
focused on the changes in what you can do with the surfaces

892
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
as the first obvious thing.

893
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And a lot of these were driven by

894
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
sort of artistic and aesthetic concerns,

895
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
where we got, if you pull up a 3D rendering program

896
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and you look at their material stuff,

897
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
there's a whole page full of options,

898
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
things that you can tweak, knobs you can turn,

899
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
checkboxes you can set,

900
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and each of these had some use case where somebody wanted this

901
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
because it made their image generally look a certain way that they wanted.

902
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Very rarely were these things driven by

903
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
sort of physically correct rendering.

904
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And there was a huge plethora of these things that came out.

905
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Every different program had a different set of options.

906
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You always had this fallback of you've got your diffuse colors,

907
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
your specular color, your roughness,

908
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
this basic fog shading model persists to this day.

909
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But now we have a ton of other things that we can tag on there,

910
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
things that are subsurface approximate,

911
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
scattering approximations, Fresnel lighting,

912
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
different frequency response on surfaces.

913
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's like some of the things do have physical basis to them.

914
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Like one obvious thing,

915
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
the Fresnel effect is the effect that as you get more and more glancing to something,

916
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
the reflection gets stronger and stronger.

917
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And you see this, this is what makes water and glass look like water and glass.

918
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
If you look straight at them,

919
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
you pretty much see straight through them without a whole lot of reflection.

920
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But as you get more and more edge on,

921
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
even a surface like this,

922
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
where when I'm looking at this at this angle here,

923
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I've got a very, very strong clear sense of the slightly wavy reflection

924
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
of that white line there,

925
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
while if I look at it right here, it's barely visible.

926
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So that's a physical effect in reality

927
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
that you can work through the real physics equations of why this happens.

928
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But people, again, sort of called up the trustee,

929
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
raise a cosine to a power,

930
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
and it sort of looks like what we want when we're dotting a couple vectors together.

931
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So that has, that's something that's based off plausible physics,

932
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
but generally only roughly approximated.

933
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And there are other things like that with,

934
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
like the change in some metals get their metallic look

935
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
because they slightly change colors as they get towards grazing angles.

936
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So again, you can calculate the real physics for that,

937
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
or you can just sign it, kind of say,

938
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
well, this color sort of changes to this color at the edges

939
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and start interpolating between them.

940
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But lots and lots of good work and lots of high-budget movies and so on

941
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
were built with these sort of very ad hoc techniques.

942
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But sort of in parallel with this,

943
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
the other big revolution that was happening was global light transport,

944
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
global illumination.

945
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It comes back to that whole hack of the ambient term,

946
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
this sense that obviously where, okay, if I'm right here,

947
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
the lights are only directly hitting the outside.

948
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The back of my hand has no direct view to any light,

949
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
but it's still quite bright and clearly illuminated.

950
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It's bright because all those lights hit this white board,

951
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
bounce off of that, and wind up lighting my hand from the back.

952
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And you can see, like, color changes,

953
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
like if I move up here where it's mostly covered by the blue marker on there,

954
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the blue tints to it.

955
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And this recognition that so much of what we consider important

956
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
in the visual field is actually indirect.

957
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's not just a matter of, here's the light,

958
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
here's the surface, what's the reaction.

959
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Because we come back to how much of the light gets bounced around.

960
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And there's a term called the albedo of a surface,

961
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
which is what fraction of the light gets reflected versus absorbed.

962
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And there's some tricky terminology with this

963
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
because you can have either the total solar albedo

964
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
where you talk about how much energy comes off of the sun.

965
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And this is used for climate modeling

966
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and some remote imaging and things like this where you matter.

967
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But you've also then got the visible albedo,

968
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
which for rendering is what we care about.

969
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And the point is that the best reflectors,

970
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
your chrome sphere that's mirrored or your white piece of chalk

971
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
or your freshly driven snow,

972
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
those can reflect 90-ish percent of the light.

973
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
While your darkest surfaces, your lump of black coal

974
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
or asphalt in some cases, might only reflect 5%.

975
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But when you're reflecting 90% of the light,

976
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
what that means is that if you're in a room

977
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
that has mostly white surfaces,

978
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
a single bit of light coming out of your light emitter

979
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
might bounce around a dozen times before it finally gets absorbed.

980
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So it could take a very complex path

981
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
before it winds up getting to your eye.

982
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And this is why we could have cases like a dark room

983
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
illuminated only through the crack under the door.

984
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
But you can still wind up looking even around corners.

985
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You can go into the closet in the dark room

986
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
illuminated under the keyhole and still find things somewhat lit.

987
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And that's because of this many bouncing path that light can take

988
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
from the light emitter coming around

989
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
until it actually gets to your eye.

990
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And this turns out to be a really frighteningly complex

991
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and expensive problem to solve properly.

992
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The first sets of attempts at this dealt with

993
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
radiosity approaches.

994
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And a lot of this was driven by

995
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
engineering things beyond just making pictures

996
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
because you would talk about things like heat management.

997
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
If you have a certain amount of energy coming in here,

998
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
how hot is something going to get

999
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and what's the hottest part going to be

1000
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
because that matters for a lot of engineering terms.

1001
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So you can do things like, you know,

1002
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
make a complex surface here

1003
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and say energy is coming in here.

1004
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
How much of this energy makes its way to here,

1005
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to here, here, here.

1006
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And it's not just a matter of what,

1007
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that's basic geometry calculations to say

1008
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
how much of this is directly impinging on that surface.

1009
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
What gets complicated then is you say,

1010
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
well, this reflects 50% of its light

1011
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
and that 50% goes to all of these different ones here.

1012
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And this one reflects 50% and that goes to all the ones here.

1013
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And, you know, in theory, you go,

1014
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
if you're doing everything floating point math,

1015
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
you can keep saying you can bounce it 100 times

1016
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and say you get, well, 0.0001% winds up coming back to another spot.

1017
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
At some point you just say it's converged well enough,

1018
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
this solution is not going to change much

1019
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
no matter how many more bounces that you do.

1020
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So the radiosity solutions work by creating

1021
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
this giant linear algebra matrix of coefficients

1022
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
where you say you identify all of your surfaces

1023
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
and you say how much can, what form factor,

1024
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
what fraction of the energy goes

1025
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
to all of the other different surfaces.

1026
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And then you may be solving this 10,000 by 10,000 matrix

1027
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and there was a lot of work on the optimizations

1028
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
that go into solving this more effectively.

1029
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But there are two reasons why radiosity

1030
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
is not a particularly relevant technique

1031
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
for computer graphics anymore.

1032
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
One aspect that it sort of glossed over

1033
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
was the notion of occlusion,

1034
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
where if you've got a surface,

1035
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
if this goes out here

1036
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and you go around the dark corner,

1037
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
we've got this surface here,

1038
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
it's clear that it can't see this surface at all.

1039
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It can see this surface, this surface,

1040
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
it can see part of this surface,

1041
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
a fraction of it, and it can see

1042
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
an even smaller part of this surface over here.

1043
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So you have to calculate these occlusion terms

1044
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
where you're saying each surface,

1045
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
unless you're in your deformed, stretched icosahedron

1046
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
or some solid that has no convex,

1047
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
no concavities inside it,

1048
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
you're going to have these aspects of occlusion.

1049
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And this becomes a very, very difficult thing

1050
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
to solve completely analytically.

1051
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
If you're trying to stay in just analytic world

1052
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and you try to solve, well, okay,

1053
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
we have this surface, including this surface,

1054
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and then another surface here and another surface here,

1055
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
it's the potentially visible set problem

1056
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
on every polygon, and it's an analytic nightmare.

1057
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So you wind up solving this by approximating.

1058
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You just say, all right, I've got a surface here,

1059
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I'll throw a bunch of rays to test out here,

1060
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and I'll throw 20 rays out,

1061
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and if 10 of them get through, I'll say I'm 50% occluded.

1062
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Now, a purist will start blanching and saying,

1063
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
yeah, but that's random, there's this randomness,

1064
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
you might be misestimating, there could be pathological cases,

1065
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and there's some truth to that.

1066
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Anytime that you're sampling things,

1067
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
there are sampling cases that can turn out pathological.

1068
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But the other side of that then goes,

1069
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
it's like, well, we're tracing rays.

1070
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
We have another technique that involves lots of tracing rays

1071
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
and come about it from a different route,

1072
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
which is to say, well, let's start with ray tracing,

1073
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and let's try and solve the global illumination problem

1074
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
using nothing but ray tracing,

1075
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
which leads to path tracing.

1076
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So you could make a rendering solution,

1077
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
a rendering program where you start with your light emitter,

1078
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
you throw photons out in all directions,

1079
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
you have your cube here,

1080
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and somewhere you have your eye.

1081
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You will get a physically accurate image

1082
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
if you throw random rays, pick a random direction,

1083
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
it goes down, some of them go off here, some of them go up here,

1084
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
but eventually some of them wind up hitting a surface.

1085
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And then based on what that surface is,

1086
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
you determine which direction the light goes out.

1087
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's going to be random.

1088
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Again, your perfect reflector would not be random,

1089
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
it would go off in exactly the perfect reflection direction.

1090
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
All other materials will throw light in essentially all directions,

1091
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
but with different distributions,

1092
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
there will be more bias towards the reflection direction,

1093
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
there will be a chance that they go everywhere.

1094
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So one of your billions of light rays goes out, hits there,

1095
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
it decides it's going to reflect up, another one goes out, hits here,

1096
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
it's going to reflect over,

1097
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
but eventually some ray is going to come down, hit a point here,

1098
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and then reflect at exactly the direction that goes over

1099
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and hits the surface of your eye,

1100
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
which the lens can then focus into something that you can perceive.

1101
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And this has an interesting biological side to it.

1102
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
The larger an eye is, the more light it can collect,

1103
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
which is why animals that will generally hunt at night

1104
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
can have larger eyes, larger openings into their eye,

1105
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
and why telescopes get bigger to see more.

1106
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This is what's happening in reality.

1107
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Zillions and zillions of photons come off, they bounce around,

1108
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and eventually some tiny fraction of them hit the lens of your eye

1109
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
or your detector or whatever you're using,

1110
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and can be resolved into an image.

1111
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So you can make an image like this.

1112
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
People have done it.

1113
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
It is extraordinarily inefficient,

1114
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but you can solve everything with it.

1115
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
This is a complete and accurate solution.

1116
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
As accurate as your analysis of what the light's distribution is

1117
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and what the surface's distributions are,

1118
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
this can be as good as that.

1119
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You can have your extra surface up here

1120
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
where you hit the ceiling, you bounce back,

1121
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
you hit a wall over here, you bounce back over,

1122
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and then eventually make your way to the eye.

1123
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And you start thinking,

1124
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
well, you can have 10 bounces going in a random direction.

1125
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Your eye is only some handful of millimeters across,

1126
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
but you're projecting an area this size.

1127
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
How many traces do you have to do?

1128
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Well, you have to do billions and billions,

1129
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and you wind up with a very noisy image at that.

1130
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But if you did enough of them,

1131
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
this would come out with the right solution.

1132
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Trace array, it either gets absorbed

1133
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
or it reflects into a different way or transmits through it.

1134
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You've got this whole, the model that you use,

1135
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
the bidirectional subsurface scattering distribution function.

1136
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So as accurate as that is, determines what happens to the lights.

1137
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You could have models of the lights.

1138
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
There are these standards like IES light tables that have,

1139
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you know, those particular lights,

1140
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
you could look up what's the distribution of photons

1141
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
that come off of them.

1142
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You could look it up for all the different ones.

1143
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And as good as the data is, your simulation can be

1144
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
as good as what you feed it.

1145
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But it's hopelessly, hopelessly inefficient.

1146
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
What we wind up doing in different ways

1147
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
that can be reasonable approximations

1148
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
are instead of tracing, throwing rays out from the light,

1149
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
which are mostly going to go nowhere near what you want,

1150
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
you can reverse the trace and go from your eyes

1151
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
like in the kind of classic ray tracing.

1152
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Go to the surface.

1153
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And then you start getting into the cases where one of the key,

1154
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
one of the sort of buzzwords in high-end rendering

1155
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
is whether a renderer is biased or unbiased.

1156
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
A biased renderer is not necessarily perfect physics,

1157
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but it's almost, they do it because it's going to be a lot faster.

1158
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Like the standard thing that you do,

1159
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
if you don't mind being a biased renderer,

1160
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
you say, well, I have all these directions

1161
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
that I could go to the world.

1162
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I could go up to the ceiling.

1163
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I could go down to the floor.

1164
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
But I know I've got all of these lights up here,

1165
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
so I'm going to send most of my rays towards the lights

1166
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
because those are almost certainly going to be the things

1167
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
that really make a difference.

1168
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So you go, you hit your point,

1169
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and you say trace against every light.

1170
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You've got three lights going here.

1171
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Let's run a trace up against them,

1172
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
check for occluders, solid things blocking it off.

1173
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And then you start throwing random amounts of rays

1174
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
in different directions.

1175
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You can be smart and base it on what the character

1176
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
of the surface is.

1177
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It again comes down to these distribution functions

1178
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
where you could have rays where it's more likely

1179
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
that if light comes in this way,

1180
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
it's more likely that it's going to make it out towards your eye,

1181
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
so it makes sense to sample that more often.

1182
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And there is tons of work going on to this day.

1183
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
This is sort of where the active state of the art

1184
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
of graphics rendering is,

1185
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
where you, how you optimize this path tracing

1186
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
to be more efficient in different cases.

1187
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
But it is always then you're making your approximations

1188
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
on what you want to do.

1189
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Because you can make, like the problem with this

1190
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
is if you have, if you're biased

1191
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and you trace specifically to certain lights,

1192
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
there could be combinations of surfaces here,

1193
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
like you might have a surface here which is slightly emissive,

1194
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and if you wind up hitting that because you were tracing

1195
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
towards the light, that's going to get overrepresented

1196
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
based on, you know, versus something that's over here

1197
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
that wasn't in the direction of one of the lights.

1198
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But this approach, you know, it pretty much works.

1199
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
We do, like for the baking in idTech 5,

1200
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
we have a very primitive lighting solution

1201
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
because even though we do it offline,

1202
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
we have to, the surface area of one of the maps in Rage

1203
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
is about as much as the pixels that go into a feature film

1204
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and we have turnaround time.

1205
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So clearly we can't do these billions of ray traces

1206
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
for every, what would be a frame of that.

1207
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
We, you know, we have to keep these down

1208
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
to some credible amount of time.

1209
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So what we do is when we're rasterizing a surface,

1210
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
we don't even have the viewer at all.

1211
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
We're doing a view-independent approach

1212
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
for the global illumination.

1213
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And again, the terminology is problematic

1214
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
because we have radiosity as terminology

1215
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
in a lot of places as a synonym for global illumination

1216
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and technically it's not, it shouldn't be that way.

1217
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I mean, we have a visualizer called Rad Preview

1218
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
even though it does not do a matrix calculation

1219
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
for radiosity at all.

1220
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It's, you know, it is based on this more of a tracing approach.

1221
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So we get our surfaces, we look at all the lights

1222
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
that we think should be affecting us,

1223
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
we trace to them together,

1224
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
we're affecting us.

1225
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
We trace to them to get our shadows

1226
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
and sample them to make soft shadows.

1227
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
In fact, that's another important thing.

1228
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The way you get a soft shadow

1229
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
is if you've got a surface

1230
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and you've got an object that's going to cast a shadow,

1231
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
if you have, if you had a point light source,

1232
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
so it was nothing but a teeny tiny point

1233
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
that all the energy came out of,

1234
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
then you would have a hard shadow edge.

1235
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It would look like Doom 3

1236
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
where you've got fully illuminated

1237
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
and then fully shadowed.

1238
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
In reality, there's no such thing as a point light source

1239
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and this is an important thing to realize.

1240
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Everything, even if you look at a light bulb,

1241
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
a dangling incandescent light bulb,

1242
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the photons are actually coming out

1243
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
not off of a point,

1244
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
but off of a little zigzaggy filament

1245
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
that's inside that.

1246
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It has an area and the photons come off

1247
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
distributed from that area.

1248
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Now, the sharpness of a shadow

1249
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
depends on the ratio of the area of that emitter

1250
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
to the distance that it's going across.

1251
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
When you have a great big, broad fluorescent light assembly

1252
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and you've got a small occluder here,

1253
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
everything is going to be lit to some degree.

1254
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You have...

1255
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah, so in this case,

1256
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you might have only the very smallest area there

1257
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
that would be solid, completely shadowed,

1258
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
but as you move over,

1259
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
you start to be able to see part of the light.

1260
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So it gets brighter and brighter

1261
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
until you get to the point over here

1262
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
where you can see the entire light emitter.

1263
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So we have...

1264
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
To get the soft shadows in rages,

1265
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I'm...

1266
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Well, so if you looked at the original, the earlier quakes,

1267
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
there were soft shadows in there,

1268
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
but they weren't a matter of calculating soft shadows.

1269
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
They were because we made a hard shadow calculation

1270
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and then we interpolated between it,

1271
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
which is why you've got kind of the blurry,

1272
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
stair-steppy edges there.

1273
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
For Tech 5, we actually send a number of shadow samples,

1274
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and this is one of those things

1275
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
that gets into performance trade-offs

1276
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
where if a designer sets a very large area for a light source,

1277
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
then it will have...

1278
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You'll have a very broad area of changing shadow resolutions,

1279
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and if you only put 16 tests to it,

1280
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
that means you only have the possibility

1281
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
of 16 bands of different lighting,

1282
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
and that's in the best case if it comes out

1283
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
exactly for your samples where they do their best good.

1284
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And it's completely possible to have,

1285
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
if you've got a broad area light source,

1286
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
to need hundreds of samples for every pixel

1287
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
to determine how bright that should be.

1288
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And it can get worse in a lot of cases.

1289
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
A lot of offline rendering may use thousands of samples

1290
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
per fragment when you get into the global illumination.

1291
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
So what we do from the direct lighting,

1292
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
obviously it's a biased lighting approach there

1293
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
because we sample directly to the lights,

1294
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
but then we send out random rays from the surface

1295
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
to see what else it hits,

1296
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and when it goes out and hits this surface up here,

1297
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
then we apply a simplified version of the lighting to that.

1298
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
We don't do all the full soft shadows,

1299
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
but we do basic lighting approaches.

1300
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
We've had options to do multiple additional bounces,

1301
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
but this is what we live with

1302
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
is some approach of sampling the global environment,

1303
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
and we don't do it lots for each pixel.

1304
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
What we wind up doing is

1305
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
each point throws one or a few samples into different directions,

1306
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
and then when we average them for this pixel,

1307
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
we average over a broader range of pixels.

1308
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And these are the types of trade-offs

1309
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
that everybody doing rendering makes different trades like this,

1310
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
where you decide what you think is most important,

1311
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
how much time you can afford to spend on things,

1312
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and you make your choices and you live with them after that.

1313
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But we know doing it right

1314
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
is just a matter of throwing billions of rays in an ideal case.

1315
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
You have to throw lots and lots into the environment.

1316
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
We can make decent approximations now,

1317
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
but we're going to soak up all the additional computing power

1318
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
that can be given.

1319
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
One of the saws in the offline rendering world

1320
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
is that the frames will always take a half hour to render in most studios.

1321
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
The more power they get, just the more things that they add to it.

1322
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
There's hope that that's not a law of nature

1323
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
that we are getting to faster turnarounds,

1324
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
kind of like the pace of hard drive size versus usage.

1325
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But it does seem likely that the path forward is lots and lots of rays,

1326
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
physically accurate material definitions,

1327
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and approaches that are approximations of the sampling of path tracing.

1328
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We can do...

1329
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
There are some neat demos going around today,

1330
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
like the Brigade Path Tracing demo, which is real-time,

1331
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and it's doing simple path tracing from sort of a parallel outdoor light,

1332
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and it's noisy and fizzly as it comes in,

1333
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
but you can stop and watch it kind of come in more crisply.

1334
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And eventually, this is going to be the way things go.

1335
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
This is the way we're going to be rendering,

1336
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
but we still have maybe a couple orders of magnitude before it's really competitive.

1337
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I think one more order of magnitude in performance,

1338
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and you'll start seeing it used for some real things,

1339
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
but you have to have a good reason to step away from rasterization.

1340
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But probably when we get two orders of magnitude,

1341
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
then you start seeing it as one of the more general tools.

1342
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And the reason that it's winning in the offline world,

1343
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
even though it's still slower,

1344
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
people still care about how long their renderings take,

1345
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
even if you're making a feature film or a TV commercial.

1346
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It matters for your iteration time.

1347
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
The sense is that you get more out of this being understandable

1348
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
with rasterization, environment maps, shadow maps.

1349
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
There are all these knobs that people just...

1350
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
The best people know what they mean,

1351
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
but 90% of the people working in visual and computer graphics,

1352
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
they have these things that they know push this this way,

1353
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and it kind of does something,

1354
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
but it's a lot of black magic

1355
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
and a lot of things that are just not at all physically plausible.

1356
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And this is one of the things that I've been working with the artists at IID

1357
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
in the last several months

1358
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
to start moving us towards this more physically-based sense of things,

1359
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
where if you just use your standard diffuse specular roughness,

1360
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
you can have materials just make no sense at all in the real world.

1361
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You can have things that reflect more energy than come in

1362
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
when you've got a bright diffuse and a bright specular.

1363
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And there's...

1364
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
The real step that we've had to make education-wise

1365
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
is treating these maps not just as something that you paint in Photoshop,

1366
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but how you define the materials that are there,

1367
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
where it shouldn't be that...

1368
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
If you're looking at something that's a belt buckle, you say,

1369
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
okay, this is metal, it's going to have a high specular,

1370
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
it's going to have a low diffuse, the specular may have color in it,

1371
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
it's going to have a high power or a low roughness,

1372
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
depending on how you're formulating it,

1373
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
because that's what it is.

1374
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But far too often in, you know,

1375
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
for the past decade in computer games, especially,

1376
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
the maps that have been fed into these things,

1377
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
the diffuse maps, specular maps,

1378
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
whether they're gloss or roughness or whatever you term it,

1379
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
they're things that are painted in,

1380
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
where a lot of times you'd see a specular map where,

1381
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
yeah, you take your diffuse map and you kind of monochromize

1382
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and maybe color shift it and you stick it into the specular,

1383
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and you wind up with things that...

1384
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yes, it makes parts of it shiny and parts of it not shiny,

1385
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
but some of these things, like,

1386
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I don't actually think that there is a physical material that exists

1387
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
in the red specular reflection color.

1388
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I mean, maybe there is, but it's certainly not common.

1389
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
You know, specular colors are generally white except for metals,

1390
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
which can be the color of the base surface.

1391
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So there's...

1392
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
The biggest thing that's going to be happening for making games look better

1393
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
is really not advancing the graphics technologies,

1394
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
at least for our studio.

1395
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
It's the matter of getting materials that actually make sense.

1396
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And once you're there, then you can start improving,

1397
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
the things that you do with adding your better global light transport,

1398
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
all the other cases there.

1399
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
One more thing before I cut out from the time warning here.

1400
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So the cost of all of this, billions and billions of rays,

1401
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
one technique that's gotten a lot of currency in recent years

1402
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
is ambient occlusion.

1403
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Now, to explain what ambient occlusion is,

1404
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
it's another one of those great big hacks,

1405
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but it works, you know, usefully,

1406
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and it's kind of standard fare and a lot of offline work.

1407
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So if you have an object that's got some concavity here,

1408
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and you've got the light shining on it from here,

1409
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
so you light it all up.

1410
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
In an ideal world, you'd be doing all of this path tracing,

1411
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and you would say that, okay, some of the rays hit here,

1412
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
they bounce here, they bounce around into here,

1413
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
some of them go up here, hit here, and get into that.

1414
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So the path, the tortuous path that light can take to get into there,

1415
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
that's what you really want to deal with.

1416
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
If you've got your white surface there,

1417
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
you might need to trace 10 bounces from thousands and thousands of things.

1418
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
The observation that ambient occlusion is based on

1419
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
is that when something has other things very close to it,

1420
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
it is very likely to be not as bright as things that...

1421
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
but do not have things next to it.

1422
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
If you've got a flat surface and you're lit,

1423
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
you know, there's nothing that's going to be braided

1424
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
that's taking anything away from it,

1425
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
but if you have a flat surface that, you know, has an occluder here,

1426
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
this area right here, it might be directly seeing the light,

1427
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
and it might be seeing everything in this part of the hemisphere,

1428
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
but part of it's going to be hitting this,

1429
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and some of that may be going and seeing the light,

1430
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
some of it may be bouncing in different directions.

1431
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So ambient occlusion, all it does is instead of sampling the whole world,

1432
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
it samples just a small area around the point that you're working with.

1433
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And, importantly, perhaps even more importantly than the scope of what it's sampling,

1434
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
when it hits things, it doesn't worry about the surface model.

1435
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It doesn't run, you know, BRDF or BRSSD or whatever.

1436
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
All it does is say, either I hit something close or I didn't hit something,

1437
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and maybe keep track of how far away it is.

1438
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And if you get something like this where, okay, there's some light coming in here,

1439
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I can see this, but I trace out,

1440
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
and 90% of everything around me is hitting something else sort of close.

1441
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So based on that, I'm going to darken it down,

1442
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
just on the assumption that if I did run a global illumination trace through all of this,

1443
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
that it would come out and say that I'm not as bright as something that's next to me that's open.

1444
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So something out here, that'll get the full value of whatever it calculates,

1445
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and as you move towards here, some of it's starting to get darker,

1446
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
until you move all the way in here, we're almost all of it.

1447
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And it's a very, very crude approximation of just assuming that whatever it hits isn't going to be bright.

1448
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And you can break that by having cases where, you know, if you had,

1449
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
if the light was coming in right here, where it's directly illuminating all of that,

1450
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and if that was a white surface, you could have more light coming down onto there rather than less.

1451
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Ambient occlusion would say, it's got nearby things, it should always be less,

1452
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
but you could actually be getting more light from the global illumination in those cases.

1453
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's just one in a long line of all of these approximations that we do.

1454
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But the takeaway point is, we know what we should do,

1455
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
we know what we would do if we had infinite computing power to go with it.

1456
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
So all of the things now are approximations onto it, ways that we can model our data,

1457
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
ways that we can reduce our number of traces, and optimizations in the code paths to make things go faster.

1458
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And there's lots of work going on with GPU accelerated ray tracing,

1459
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
again, some of the caustic graphics work for optimizing it in some other ways.

1460
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And there's lots of active research going on about what corners can you cut.

1461
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And it's interesting because, again, we know what the right way,

1462
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
zillions of photons coming out, collect them all at the lens of your eye,

1463
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and sort of make an image from that.

1464
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
But it's going to be research for the coming decade or more,

1465
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
as we kind of work out what the very best approximations for this are.

1466
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So I ran a little bit over my one hour, but I can start taking questions now.

1467
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So we've got the microphone there.

1468
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Up until about maybe five to seven years ago,

1469
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:03,000
there was every year an obvious increase in realism in offline rendering for especially movies.

1470
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,000
And I'm wondering, since a lot of the things that you've mentioned here have been around

1471
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
for as long as I can remember, I mean, Povre and all that decades ago,

1472
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:23,000
what is the main driver of that increase in visual fidelity or realism in the more recent years?

1473
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
So a couple of factors.

1474
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
One is actually getting smarter about the materials,

1475
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
where you can throw in all of this light transport stuff,

1476
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and if you don't have good materials for it, it won't matter.

1477
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You'll still get non-realistic images.

1478
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So better data collection, some of the laser scanning,

1479
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
and the different things that let us get really good material qualities,

1480
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
that's been one factor.

1481
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But probably the biggest factor has just been people being willing to throw that much more processing power at things.

1482
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I had to go ahead and, instead of letting these early cases where it could take days to render an image,

1483
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
that's never going to get used in production,

1484
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and all you do is see some of the images in academic research.

1485
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And the problem with that is while some of the academic research would get the formulas right,

1486
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
they wouldn't have the data right to go with it,

1487
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
where if you've got, it's kind of like programmer art.

1488
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,000
If you wind up with the programmer or the graphics researcher building the test scene for it,

1489
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
it's probably not going to be a particularly good model of the world.

1490
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It's going to have too many spherical cow simplifications in it,

1491
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and it just won't be like what you go to a movie studio,

1492
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and they'll get all the grime and the nicks and the dings and everything

1493
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
that will make it feel like a real lived-in world.

1494
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So I think those are really the two things, materials,

1495
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
and then largely getting it into the hands,

1496
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
making it reasonable for the people that are going to put the level of craft and detail

1497
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
that it needs to represent the world,

1498
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
making it feasible for them to use.

1499
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Is that your motivation for educating the artists at IID?

1500
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Well, I actually think it's necessary.

1501
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I think that if you're not getting with physical rendering now,

1502
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
you're going to be left behind as an industry.

1503
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It's been interesting watching the offline world,

1504
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
where you had the masters of their domain at Pixar.

1505
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Because they had the very best in process and technology for a long time,

1506
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
they were sort of stragglers to adopt many of the things with ray tracing

1507
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and physically-based rendering,

1508
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
but they've come around for the most part now,

1509
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
still using the right tool at the right time.

1510
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But I can't think of many good arguments for not using physically plausible materials.

1511
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I don't think that there are artistic gains to be had by not doing it,

1512
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and there's all sorts of minefields where you can mess yourself up.

1513
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Thank you.

1514
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
The very latest versions of OpenGL support pixel and fragment shaders.

1515
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And one of the things that I'm curious about is why you don't use procedural graphics

1516
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and procedural geometry more than you do.

1517
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Okay, so procedural graphics has been the wave of the future for the last 20 years.

1518
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And I think that I actually have a fairly strong and sound argument,

1519
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
philosophical stance against this,

1520
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:12,000
where in the end procedural data is quirky, hard to deal with data compression.

1521
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And one of the things that we are continuing to get more and more of is space,

1522
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
the storage that we can get for things.

1523
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So while you can always pick out some niche market where you are going to be extremely constrained on your space,

1524
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and you think, well, mobile should have been maybe the space where procedural stuff comes into its own,

1525
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
but that's ramping through all of the storage spaces for everything that it's really not.

1526
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
All the standard methods are going on.

1527
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So it's a good tool for making programmer hours,

1528
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
but when you want to put it into the hands of the people that are going to...

1529
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
If you're modeling the real world, you laser scan everything.

1530
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You go in and say, I'm going to scan this room and I'm going to have a terabyte of data,

1531
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and I'll just render that as an enormous point cloud.

1532
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And that's credible even.

1533
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's not, we can't ship a game like that yet,

1534
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
but that's still within sight of something that we can do.

1535
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And if you want to give it to an artist to create something,

1536
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
then they're largely going to be compositing together different things.

1537
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And procedural sources, yeah, you use them for your clouds and your smoke and particle, things like that.

1538
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But this was Pixar's camp for a long time about doing...

1539
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
They would create with procedures, analytic procedures rather than textures,

1540
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and that way lost.

1541
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It was really pretty conclusive that nobody wants to do that.

1542
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
They want to throw 20 layers of effective painting on top of things,

1543
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
and you can still come up with use cases for it,

1544
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:47,000
but it adds a lot of complexity for a win that outside of poster child cases really isn't there.

1545
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So for your offline rendering, have you ever considered using progressive photon mapping techniques?

1546
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And have you ever had a chance to talk with Henrik Von Jensen about any of that?

1547
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So I wrote a photon mapping version for our system,

1548
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and there's a really interesting aspect to this where...

1549
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
So a fundamental aspect of global illumination is that there's no difference between a light emitter and a light reflector,

1550
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
where you have to look at saying the photons that come off of this surface are just as good as the photons that come off of that light.

1551
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And when you calculate through, when you make a photon map for something,

1552
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
you figure out how many photons you're going to send into the world,

1553
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:35,000
you create a map of them, and you use that as an accelerator for determining your global illumination solution for each point.

1554
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:42,000
The problem that I ran into was while that works fine for a single sort of character of a scene,

1555
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
for an indoor scene, I found photon mapping to be pretty effective in a lot of ways.

1556
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I mean, you still have all the problems of where you wind up setting things, bleed-throughs in some cases,

1557
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
but they're manageable problems.

1558
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But when I ran some numbers and I realized that if you're calculating an outdoor area,

1559
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
the amount of light that falls on like one 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper,

1560
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
just holding it out in the sun, all of a sudden that surface has all of the photons,

1561
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
the same amount of photons that come out of a 100-watt incandescent light bulb,

1562
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and you start saying, well, we have acres and acres of surfaces out here.

1563
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And of course, we're scaling everything down, so it still fits with...

1564
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I completely did not get to any of my output monitors, gamma correction, all that stuff.

1565
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So, I mean, we have all these hacks to kind of normalize it,

1566
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,000
but I found it to be in a situation where you had a bright outdoor area and then a dimmer indoor area,

1567
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
you had to have so many photons in the outside to make the dim one come out reasonably

1568
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
that it became pretty prohibitive.

1569
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:50,000
The other reason that we don't do photon maps is that it requires a sequencing

1570
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
where the nice thing about distributed ray tracing and the path tracing,

1571
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
in its purest form, it's completely embarrassingly parallel.

1572
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Any surface can be done at any time because we run on multi-threads,

1573
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
multi-core processors and multiple systems in a cluster,

1574
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and if you want to do something with an intermediate step like a photon map,

1575
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
you have to build the photon map in some hopefully parallel way

1576
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and then transfer it to everything else.

1577
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And my very first global illumination solution in the early days of RAGE was GPU accelerated

1578
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and I rendered little hemispheres on the GPU and built up a low-resolution mega-texture of the world

1579
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:35,000
and used that global illumination, which was reminiscent of a photon map.

1580
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And it was just one of those things that in practice turned out to really be kind of a pain,

1581
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
and when we went to a completely separable solution, a lot of problems stopped happening.

1582
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
But it was interesting implementing the photon map stuff, going through a few of the cases.

1583
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It's certainly a valid direction right now,

1584
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,000
but I think that in a lot of cases that the necessity to generate that ahead of time

1585
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
is a little bit of a hazard for implementation in a lot of parallel cases.

1586
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
For running on a single system, if you know you're going to just plow through it all there,

1587
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
it's got a lot of benefits. It just hurts a little more in a cluster.

1588
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Hi, so you talked a lot about the geometry and the RAGE tracing, all that sort of stuff.

1589
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I was just curious if you could talk about how you managed the light representations,

1590
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
specifically things like fluorescence and that sort of stuff.

1591
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I'm getting another one of my topics that was on my list that I didn't have time to go through.

1592
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So again, the classical computer graphics light is you wind up with three models of lights.

1593
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
You've got a point light, a spotlight, and a parallel light,

1594
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
and those are our sort of baseline lights in the editor.

1595
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
We augment the point lights by giving them an area radius

1596
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
so we can get the soft shadows and so we can add the distributed RAGE tracing to that.

1597
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The biggest problem though is that all of our lights are completely physically implausible

1598
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
because they're physically bounded, with the exception of the parallel light.

1599
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Some of this is history. When we go from Quake 1 all the way up through, especially Doom 3,

1600
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
we built all of our lights out of textures because Doom 3 was all dynamic,

1601
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
so we multiplied two textures together where you would have a projection texture and a fall-off texture,

1602
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
so they occupied this physical space in the world,

1603
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
which is great for culling reasons where you can say,

1604
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
alright, in Doom 3 we tried to say no more than three lights hitting a surface

1605
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
because it was a linear cost, every light cost more on that surface.

1606
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
We wound up with these lights that were very physically implausible.

1607
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
If you're doing this multiplying two textures together, you can make a Gaussian fall-off light,

1608
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
which is a pleasant light to work with that is radially symmetric,

1609
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
but most of the lights in the game wound up being our square light,

1610
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
which is a light that goes almost to the outside edges of this texture,

1611
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
just fading a little bit and then fading a little bit in the other direction,

1612
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
so we could get about as much light as we could into the world for minimal fragment cost.

1613
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Unfortunately, we kept those through rage as our primary light style.

1614
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
We had some of our very best artists love this because it gave them total control.

1615
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
They would call it painting with light, so they would be able to say,

1616
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I want this area a little bit brighter here, so I'll use this different texture instead of the standard one.

1617
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'll move this or I'll stretch it so it just barely goes below the floor,

1618
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
but it has no fall-off, so it's going to throw all the light into it.

1619
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,000
That is largely the type of artistic wizardry that we need to evolve past

1620
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
because you will never be able to take light emitters like that and make the world feel real

1621
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
because the light's not real.

1622
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You can even have completely real materials and you could be doing it with path tracing,

1623
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but if your light is only coming from these things that do not resemble real lights,

1624
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
then it's never going to be bought off as real.

1625
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Several years ago, I made a premature evidently push towards physically-based lighting

1626
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
where I was trying to set all of our lights up with using IES light profiles,

1627
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
which are these actual light profiles that the people that make light bulbs go and measure all of these things.

1628
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
You can get the light that's coming at all of these different areas,

1629
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
different sample points coming out of it.

1630
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
That's really useful, although it's important to note that there are simplifications in here.

1631
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Just because you see an equation doesn't mean it's true.

1632
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Just because you see a table of data doesn't mean it's true either

1633
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:38,000
because you have simplifications like an IES spec for three fluorescent bulbs in a fixture.

1634
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Yes, you are sampling what the light is at all of these points,

1635
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:47,000
but really you should be getting three shadows from it rather than one from an area light source.

1636
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
There's simplifications built into that,

1637
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
but we are not currently using that.

1638
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,000
The main reason why it fell through when I pushed for it originally was it comes back to the performance.

1639
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
To keep the build times at a certain level that they were familiar with,

1640
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
you wound up with these lights now are extending infinitely.

1641
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
They're proper inverse-square fall-off lights,

1642
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
so if you've got a level with 1,000 lights in it,

1643
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
then in theory you're tracing 1,000 traces out at a minimum to just see whether any light gets there.

1644
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
You cut this down to some rational number of samples,

1645
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
and what that means is there's lots of noise in the images.

1646
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
One of the battles that's been particularly hard for all of the Tech 5 stuff

1647
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
is trying to have a situation where the designers and artists are willing to work with

1648
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
an approximation of what the final output is.

1649
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It is just very tempting to say,

1650
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
well, I always want to look at what the final output is,

1651
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
which means that everything is always a production quality render,

1652
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
which means it always takes forever.

1653
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I keep hoping that there will be more of an acceptance of,

1654
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
well, this is roughly what it's like.

1655
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I can still figure out what my gameplay and rough lighting and everything is,

1656
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
but that's a battle that we fight daily on this.

1657
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Hi, John.

1658
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Taking quality materials data for granted,

1659
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I'm curious what additional visual fidelity you gain by ray tracing box lock trees

1660
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
and then what visual sacrifices you make

1661
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and what sacrifices you have to make in terms of performance.

1662
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Or to gain performance.

1663
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So the question of what you're ray tracing against is sort of orthogonal to the method.

1664
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I mean, you can rasterize or ray trace lots of different representations,

1665
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and there was lots of work that went into directly ray tracing against curved surfaces

1666
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
and certainly spheres in some of the easy cases.

1667
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And for years, I did think that ray tracing into some form of voxel space

1668
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
would be an obvious thing to do,

1669
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
because it seems that there's winds, it's certainly far simpler.

1670
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You can make a more regular data structure.

1671
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
There's all these things, but it doesn't seem to be panning out that way.

1672
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It does seem to be that all ray tracing will be against triangle meshes

1673
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
that you will decimate to it.

1674
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And there's certainly advantages to the comfortable toolpaths, everything there.

1675
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It seems that's the way that history is flowing,

1676
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
and that's probably the way it's going to work out when we are ray tracing everything.

1677
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You talked a little bit yesterday on the motion blur that happens

1678
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
on the LCD screens as you're moving your head very quickly.

1679
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Do you have any more thoughts on if that's a solvable problem for this generation of VRs

1680
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
that's going to take a little longer?

1681
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So we have an existence proof of something that's good enough.

1682
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I mean, what Valve put together by packing up the Samsung displays is good enough.

1683
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
If we can get 90 hertz displays that are low persistence, that will do.

1684
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
120 would probably be better,

1685
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
but like my interlace scheme, maybe a good thing to kind of add on top of that if it can be done.

1686
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
But I think there's a good prospect.

1687
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
The fallback plan is LCD backlight flashing.

1688
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So it's important, and I think that I'm betting that it will be solved

1689
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
for sort of consumer grade VR in the not too distant future,

1690
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
but it's not there right now outside of Valve's prototype.

1691
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Hi, John. Thanks for the talk.

1692
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
A few years ago I read an MIT paper explaining how to compute saw shadows,

1693
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
and what they did was they interpolated linearly between the parts that were lit

1694
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
and the parts that were not lit.

1695
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Is that the approach it takes?

1696
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Is that a linear map or nonlinear map between the umbra and the penumbra?

1697
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And I was just hoping you could explain in detail how you calculate the intermediate levels.

1698
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Okay, so that does fall into the category of large body of work of approximations

1699
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
that is pretty much gone and forgotten right now.

1700
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Our saw shadows are done by sending a certain number of samples,

1701
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
like it's 16 by default.

1702
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So you send 16 samples to different points on the light that are randomly distributed,

1703
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
and the density of the shadow is just the fraction of them to get through.

1704
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
So you can crank that number up in some cases for some of the really broad area emitters.

1705
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
In theory you'd want it to be 256 samples, so you could get a full range of,

1706
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
or even more on a very bright light, but we get by with 16.

1707
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
There's an approximation that I did on that

1708
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
that instead of randomly sending to all points in the center of the,

1709
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
all points across the area of the light source,

1710
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
by default we send them across the circumference of the light,

1711
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
which gives you, in theory can sometimes make it look a square factor better,

1712
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
but it looks bad at edges.

1713
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So we're still tracing different things on there,

1714
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
but in the bottom line it's just however many samples you throw.

1715
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
That's the fraction that comes out.

1716
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Things like that are going back through the history of graphics for 40 years.

1717
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
There's a ton of things that were somewhat complicated analytics solutions

1718
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
that have just over and over fallen to raw brute force,

1719
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and I think that all of these things will as well.

1720
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
You know, when we are tracing billions of rays per frame,

1721
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
that's when we'll be using ray tracing.

1722
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I don't think there's going to be too many intermediate steps to that.

1723
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Thank you.

1724
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Hello.

1725
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So I know that in AutoCAD and other engineering programs,

1726
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
there are catalogs of different types of materials

1727
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:26,000
that you can test the effects of different things on the structure,

1728
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
so on and so forth, just the different kinds of materials.

1729
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,000
And my question is for you is that with trying to make your artists use more accurate materials,

1730
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
are you trying to create a catalog of textures?

1731
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Yeah, so right now we are very much trying to have our master swatch list of,

1732
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
you know, if we need, there's the clear things about,

1733
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
okay, if you're metal, you're in this range, if you're paint, you're in this range,

1734
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
if you're wood, you're in this range, asphalt,

1735
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
having all of this represented as these are the valid ranges

1736
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
of diffuse specular roughness and maps that you're going to have.

1737
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So we're still working through all of that.

1738
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And in terms of material libraries, it's a little frustrating when you look at,

1739
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
whether it's 3D Studio or Modo or V-Ray, whatever,

1740
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
the materialists are usually the ad hoc collection that's accreted

1741
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
over a couple decades of company lifespan,

1742
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
and they're usually not a complete, consistent, cohesive,

1743
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
physically-based set of materials.

1744
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
We spent a little bit of time trying to backtrack values

1745
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
from one of the material library sets into the things that we could use,

1746
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
and it wasn't completely clear that they were coming out in the right ranges,

1747
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
so we're building up our own set, and there's lots of studios doing that.

1748
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Online, there are sets of BRDF measurements for a lot of materials

1749
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
that would be good to start drawing some of the materials from,

1750
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
but we're still looking for, okay, what's the diffuse specular and roughness values going

1751
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
rather than this full table of data,

1752
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
but eventually, I expect that we all will be using,

1753
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
this is data scanned in from the real world,

1754
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
because over and over, that's what eventually wins in the end.

1755
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Thank you.

1756
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
All right.

1757
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
That looks like it. John, thank you.

1758
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Thanks. On time.

1759
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Thank you.
