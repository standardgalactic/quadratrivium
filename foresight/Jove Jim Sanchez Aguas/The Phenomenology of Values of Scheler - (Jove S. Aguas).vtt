00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
So, this is the philosophy of Max Scheller, introduction to the life of Max Scheller.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
He was a German social and ethical philosopher.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
He was born in Munich on August 22, 1874.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
His mother was Jewish and his father a Lutheran.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
However, he joined the Roman Catholic Church maybe because of its concept of love,

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
one of the concepts that Max Scheller developed in his philosophy.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
He studied medicine and philosophy in Munich and in Berlin

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
and he received his doctorate at Vienna University in 1897.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Or he taught from 900, the year 900 up to 1906.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
In 1901, Scheller became a lecturer at the University of Vienna

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
and stayed there until that particular year 1906.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
So, from 1907 to 1910, he was professor at Munich

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
and met some of the disciples of Kusser.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
And with their influence, his thinking turned to phenomenology.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
He became acquainted with expanding phenomenological movement

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
but he kept a notably independent position from phenomenology.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
In 1910, he retired from teaching and retired to Berlin

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
and wrote his major works.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
In 1917, he joined the German Foreign Office

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
as a diplomat in Geneva and at the Hague.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
And in 1919, he became professor and chair of philosophy

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
and sociology at the University of Cologne.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
During this period of productivity, which ended around 1921,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
he became renowned in Germany and elsewhere

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
for an unusual amount of publications.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Perhaps one of the most prolific writers

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
of the phenomenological movement is Max Scheller,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
second to Edmund Musser.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
After that, his favorite worldwide proportion

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
documented by the many invitations extended to him

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
to lecture in Paris, in Japan, in Russia,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
and in the United States.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
In 1920, he became a pacifist

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
and repudiated the horrors of war

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
and was converted to Roman Catholicism.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
But about 1924,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
he turned to a more pantheistic view of man in the world

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
and left Catholicism.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
In early 1928, he went to the University of Frankfurt

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
where he also lectured there.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
And he died on May 1928.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
His widow was the devoted curator

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
of thousands of post-humans manuscripts

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
until she passed away in 1969.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
As a phenomenologist, Scheller sought to discover

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
the essence of mental attitudes

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
and the relation to their objects,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
ating that he will develop

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
in his major work, therefore, Malismus.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
He differed from Musser in his readiness to assign

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
an independently real status to the objects.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Remember that Musser

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
took objects to be

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
the intentional objects

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
of our consciousness.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
At the development of his thought,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
the first period of Scheller's thought

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
centered on the incontrovertible value

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
of the individual person and value ethics

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
centered on the non-formal or material ethics

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
which is opposed to the formal ethics proposed

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
by Immanuel Kant.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
This position of Max Scheller

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
is founded in his major work

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
on formalism

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
or formalism in ethics

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
and non-formal ethics of values

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
a new attempt toward the foundation

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
of ethical personalism.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
That's the entire title of his work.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
In the first part of his value ethics

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
he established the values,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
he established that values are correlates

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
of three types of feelings.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Feelings in the body, feelings of life

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and personal feelings.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Moral experience cannot be divorced

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
from feeling values as such.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And in the second part

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
he showed that each person was a unique

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
self-value.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Personal self-value must be accounted for

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
in all variable moral situations.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So here in the first part of his

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
ethics and his formalismos

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
established the notion of values.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Values as objects of our emotions

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
of our feelings.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But in doing that

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
he also criticized the formal ethics

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
of Immanuel Kant.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And we're going to discuss that later.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So in the second part

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
of this value ethics

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
was on the nature of the person.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The exemplary persons.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
The nature or the theory

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
of the nature of the person

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
is a new and most interesting analysis.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
The series was also developing

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
a kind of ethical personalism.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
He showed that our being a person

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
is the form of our mind

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
and our consciousness.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
No matter whether the mind

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
or the consciousness

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
are understood to be human,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
divine, or just fictional.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
We developed his idea

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
of the ideal moral person.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
However, in the second period

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
of his career

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
after writing the formalismos

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Sheller developed a more comprehensive

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
anthropology

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
that works on the vitalism

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
and pantheism.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So he figured out

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
to determine what he called

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
the meta-anthropological status

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
of humanity.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And this he developed

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
in his work,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Man's Place in the Cosmos

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
or Man's Place in the Universe

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
which was published

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
in 1928

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
after his death.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So it was published

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
mostly. Remember that he died

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
of that year.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Sheller in that book

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
which is actually a very,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
just a very thin book

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
offered a graduate

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
view of being.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
In his view, man, God,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
and the world

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
are one self-becoming cosmic process

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
in absolute time.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And this process of self-becoming

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
has two poles.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
The guys and the drunk.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Guys meaning spirit

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
and the drunk meaning the life-hearts.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
The guys according to Sheller

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
is powerless

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
unless it can,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
its ideas can functionalize

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
with life factors

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
meaning with material conditions

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
that realize their actual,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
their actualities.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And the one that

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
can provide the guys

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
with power,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
with vitality

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
is the drunk.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So the drunk is

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
the source of life,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
the source of vitality.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
But the drunk does not have any direction.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So it is the guys

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
that provides direction.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So the guys is the

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
source of direction,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
source of

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
the ideas,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
source of reason,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
but it is powerless.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Does not have any vitality at all.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
The drunk on the other hand

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
is the source of vitality

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
but it does not have any direction at all.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So when you combine it to

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
then you have both vitality

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
and direction.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
now Sheller for a particular

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
kinship to

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
introspective and intuitive philosophers

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
like Blaise Pascal.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And it was also

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
was actually from Blaise Pascal

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
that he borrowed the notion

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
of reason of the heart

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
or logic decor

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
which would

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
be very prominent

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
in his articulation of

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
our understanding

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
or feeling of the values.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
So he preferred

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
these introspective and intuitive philosophers

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
more than the abstract theories

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
about morality and God.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
These tendencies

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
become the basis of criticisms

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
against Sheller's emotive philosophy

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
that his ethics

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
is emotive.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
It's based on

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
the emotions

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
on the feelings.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And no less than Karol Vitiva

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
was critical of

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
the philosophy of Max Sheller

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
although Max Sheller influenced a lot

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
the phenomenology

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
or the way Vitiva understands

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
phenomenology.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Of course, there are other

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
philosophers who also influence

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
its view about this

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
about the intuitive

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
about

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
introspective power.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Philosophers like

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Nietzsche, Briggson and

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Delphi.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So these philosophers also influence

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
this orientation

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Max Sheller.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Of course, the other philosopher

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
who influenced Max Sheller

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
was Edmund Pusser

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
and Immanuel Kant

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
because she studied Immanuel Kant

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
although he was critical

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
of the ethics of Immanuel Kant.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
The other philosophers

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
or thinkers who have Sheller's

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
thinking includes

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
those thinkers in the history of philosophy

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
who demonstrated their

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
phenomenological orientation like

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
philosophy and other oriental

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
philosophers.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
His other works also

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
showed the result of Kantian

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
and post Kantian influence.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
As I mentioned here, their

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
formalismos, although it was

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
a critique of Kant's formal ethics

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
he nevertheless agreed

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
with Kant on certain points

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
and we are going to discuss

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
that later. The influence

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
of phenomenology

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
especially

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Brusser account for Sheller's

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
interest on empirical research

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
and in metaphysics.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
So those are

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
the important

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
influences in the philosophy

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
of Max Sheller. Now let's

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
go to his methodology.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Of course

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
he strongly emphasized

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
the phenomenological method

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
which at a time

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
was being formally developed

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
by Brusser

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
and he also actually

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
acclaimed this in his door formalismos.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
He first came

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
in contact with the movement

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
when he moved to the University of

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Beauty in 1907 as we have already mentioned

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
and there he met

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
some of the students of

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Brusser.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
So he was

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
attracted to this

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
movement or to this approach

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
of philosophy. Although

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
he

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
applied the phenomenological method

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
not on

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
epistemology the way

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Brusser applied

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
phenomenology

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
but applied it to

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
actualogy, to ethics

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
or to values

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
and to his notion of

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
the human person.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Sheller is firmly convinced

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
that phenomenology would bring about

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
basic transformation

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
in our way of conceiving the world

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and ourselves.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Although some consider it

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
thought to be quite unsystematic

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Sheller was one of the most

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
insightful and acutely

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
intuitive and brilliant thinkers

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and writers of the early 20th century.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And his works

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
abound with

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
detailed description of the

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
sample states of consciousness

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
like sympathy which he has a

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
book on

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
resentment

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
love

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and joy.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
So here are some of the

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
important works of

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Max Sheller

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
on resentment and moral

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
value judgment

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
published in 1912.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
And then contributions

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
to the phenomenology and theory

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
of sympathy and of love in 8

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
the following year 1913.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And then he's there formalismus

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and non-formal ethics of values.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
1913

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
and then man's place in nature

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
or man's place in the cosmos

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
posumously published in 1928

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and man in the age of

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
equalization

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
published in 1929.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
So these last two are

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
posumously published.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Now let's go to his theory

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
of values.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And here we are going to

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
zero in on the

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
formalismus.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And it would be nice

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
it would help if you're going

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
to read at least the first

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
chapter of the

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
formalismus for you to better understand

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
his theory

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
of values.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Now in that book the formalismus

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Sheller explained that one

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
ought to do

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
what one ought to do

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
presupposes a feeling

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
of the value of what ought

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
to be done.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Now this ought

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
is actually

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
the concept of duty

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
of Immanuel Kant.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
So he's referring to

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
the concept of duty

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
the categorical imperative

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
of Immanuel Kant.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And according to Sheller

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
what we ought to do

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
our understanding of what

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
of duty

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
presupposes a feeling

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
of the value of what ought

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
to be done. In other words

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
the feeling is more primordial

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
than the understanding

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
of

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
the duty.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Because for Sheller

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
even if you know

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
that we ought to do

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
our duties

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
we have the feeling of the value

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
of that duty

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
we will never do it.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
So it presupposes

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
that we already have

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
a feeling of the duty.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
That feeling of

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
the duty is based on our

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
values.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Now he divided the values

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
into five ranks which are given

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
a priori.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
So for him the values

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
must be a priori meaning

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
they don't pass to experience

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
that fulfill

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
the requirement of Kant

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
that for something to be universal

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
it must be a priori.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So if you apply

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
the idea of

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
a priori

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
that the universal must be a priori

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
by saying

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
that values are given a priori

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
then that means

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
the values are universal.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And these values

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
are anchored

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
in our

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
ordo amoris

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
or the order or logic of the heart

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
logic decor.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
And this

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
logic of the heart

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
is not congruent to the logic

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
based on reason.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
So aside from

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
the logic of reason

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Sheller adds

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
another thing the logic

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
of the heart.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And the reason

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
of the heart cannot be

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
understood by reason

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
by pure reason

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
by the intellect.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And in this

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
view Sheller follow the idea of

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
the French philosopher

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Blaise Pascal and of course

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
oppose himself to the ideas

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
or to the position of

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Immanuel Kant.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
According to this view

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
moral acts and deeds

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
are individual

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and they originate

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
in an individual's

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
pre-rational

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
preferring of values.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Meaning before

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
we can rationalize

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
about values

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
we already prefer

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
the values before we can even

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
understand before we can

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
even reason out about

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
values. We already have

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
preference

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
tendency

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
for values.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
So we will

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
explain that in details

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
in the later part.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So moral experience lies in the

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
what he calls the call of the hour

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
of the moment

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
in which the a priori ranking

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
among

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
values become individually

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
transparent.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
In a particular moment

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
we're going

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
how we value things will become

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
transparent it will manifest

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
itself.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
No matter how much the order

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
may be distorted by the

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
feelings of the sentiment

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
of hate and other passions

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
we will go back to this later.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Now let's go to the

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
first part of the therefore

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
balismos.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Because in the first part of the

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
it is where

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Scheller presented

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
this criticism of Kant's

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
formal ethics.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
By the way when you say

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
non-formal ethics

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
it means material ethics.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Material here

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
pertains to

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
the non-rational.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
The non-rational.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
So the formal is rational

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
that's the

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
position of

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
reason

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
pure reason practical reason

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
so it's formal.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
the non-formal

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
the non-rational

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
is

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
regarded by Kant as

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
empirical

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
or material.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Scheller

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
develops his theory of values

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
in the realm of the material

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
in the realm of the

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
non-formal.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
What is that material

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
non-formal in the realm of the emotions.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
So Scheller's theory of values

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
and ethics would be in fact

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
incomprehensible

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
without taking into consideration

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
his criticisms of Kant's

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
view of ethics.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Because in the first part of the

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
therefore balismos

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
he was commenting

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
and criticking

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
the formalism of Immanuel Kant

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
although he agreed with Kant

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
on certain points.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
And therefore the non-formalismos

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
in the non-formalismos

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Scheller

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
preoccupied himself with a lengthy criticism

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
of Kant's formal ethics

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
and built much of his

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
own ideas on these

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
or from these criticisms.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
He said

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
in the early pages of the non-formalismos

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
in this work

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I can accomplish my task

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
only through revealing Kant's

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
erroneous presuppositions

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
and by replacing

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
them with correct

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
ones. That's how

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
ambitious the project

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
of Scheller is

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
in this

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
work that are formalismos.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Scheller though agreed

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
with Kant on certain points.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
First he agreed with Kant

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
when Kant rejected

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
all ethics of goods and purposes.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
What is an ethic

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
of goods and purposes?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Well, it's a kind of ethics

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
that bases the morality

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
of action or morality itself

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
on purposes.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Remember

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
the teleological theories on ethics.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
So

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Kant rejected all teleological

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
theories

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
of ethics.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Because these ethics base morality

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
on purposes

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
on uncertain goods.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
For example, you want to be happy

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
if what you're doing

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
will make you happy, happiness

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
is something good, then

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
your action

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
is ethical.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
But Kant rejected

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
that kind of ethics.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
He rejected that kind of ethics.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And Scheller agreed with Kant

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
in his rejection

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
of this kind of ethics

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
of goods and purposes.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So according to Scheller

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Kant was correct

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
when he refuted all ethics

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
starting with a question

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
what is the highest good

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
or what is the final purpose

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
of all our

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
volitional connection.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
So he agreed with

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Kant on that point.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Kant he said was correct

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
in dismissing them

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
as having false basis.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
So Scheller wrote

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
in the Der Formalismus

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and I'm quoting him here

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I quote

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Kant maintained

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
that whenever

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
we make the goodness

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
or moral depravity

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
of a person

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
and act will

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
indeed, etc.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Dependent on their relation to

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
the realm of existing goods

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
or evils,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
posited as real

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
we make the goodness or the

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
privacy of the will

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
dependent on the particular

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
contingent existence

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
of the realm of goods

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
as well as on its experiential

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
noability.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
So he agreed with Kant

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
that we cannot base our

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
the moral goodness

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
or the moral

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
depravity of a particular

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
act on the basis

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
of a realm of goods

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
because this realm

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
of goods

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
is based on experience

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
and

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
anything that is based on experience

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
or empirical cannot

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
be permanent it will be changing

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and therefore you cannot base

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
your morality on that. So he agreed

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
with Kant on that point.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Kant further added

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
that the moral value of the will

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
would always depend

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
on the way in which

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
it intervened in the

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
maintenance or promotion of this

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
realm of goods.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
However,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
since this realm of goods

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
is continually changing in

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
history

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
because this realm of goods

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
is contingent

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
it's

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
empirical

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
the moral value of the will

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
would also be changing

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
so like for example

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
let us say

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
God yet

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
belong to this realm of good

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
so if we are going to base our

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
or fame for example

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
or power for example

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
but this realm of goods

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
they keeps on changing

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
in history.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
So that means that the value

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
of the will would also be changing

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
the destruction of this

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
realm of goods would also

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
mean the dissolution of the idea

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
of the moral

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
value.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So with these presuppositions

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
ethics would be based on sensible

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
experience and therefore

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
it would only be empirical

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
and it will only have

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
inductive validity

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and remember that for

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Kant

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
morality should be universal

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
a knowledge

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
should be universal

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
that's why he said

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
that morality should be

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
based on the moral law

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
the moral law is something

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
that is universal the moral law

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
is law is a priori

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
so the

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
a priori is that which is

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
universal

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
so if we base our morality

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
on a realm of goods

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
that will be changing

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
continuously

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
in history then

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
morality will also be changing

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
the same holds true if ethics will be

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
based on purposes

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
on the end, the loss

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
any ethics which measures

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
the moral value of the will

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
against the final purpose

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
like you want to be happy

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
or you want to be

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
say

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
useful

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
that would necessarily

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
degrade the values of the goods and evil

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
to mere technical values

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
subordinated to that purpose

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
so Scheller echoes Kant

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
when he wrote and again echoed

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
ethics must reject

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
all talk of good and bad purposes

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
for purposes

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
as such are never

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
good nor bad

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
when considered apart from the value

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
that are to be realized

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
in positing them

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
and apart from the values of the act

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
that posits them

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
remember that for Kant

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
there is only one thing that is good

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
without any qualification

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
and that is the good will

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
so therefore we cannot base ethics

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
on any purpose

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
because these purposes

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
may change

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
it may be good

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
under certain condition

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
but remember

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
for Kant

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
the good must be good

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
without any condition

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
and the only thing that is good

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
without any condition

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
is the good will

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
so on this point Scheller agreed

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
with Immanuel Kant

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
purposes are justifiable

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
only when they will posit

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
when the will posits

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
or has posited them is good

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
and the only way that can posit

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
it to be good

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
is the good will

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
what makes a purpose good or bad

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
is not the particular realization of that purpose

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
but the very positing

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
or the manner

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
or phases in which the purpose

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
has come about

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
so he agreed

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
with Kant on those points

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
however

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
he refuted Kant

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
when Kant assume

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
that the material

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
or non formal ethics

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
which is also an ethic

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
of goods and purposes

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
when Kant assume

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
that

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
non formal ethics

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
is also an ethic

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
of goods and purposes

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
because Kant

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
distinguish only

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
formal

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
or non formal

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
he included

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
the non formal ethics

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
to ethics of goods and purposes

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
so for Kant

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
the only thing

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
the only ethics

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
that is

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
viable and acceptable

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
is a formal ethics

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
he dismissed

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
the material

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
non formal ethics

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Kant believe

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
that an ethic preceded by correct methods

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
must exclude

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
improsipositions

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
of the concept of good and bad

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
and the constitution

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
not only goods and purposes

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
but also all

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
values of non formal

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
nature

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
so

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Jose

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
in general

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
can't reject

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
all kinds of

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
values

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
of non formal nature

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
meaning the values

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
that are not

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
rational

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
and again he called

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
all practical principles

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
which presuppose an object

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
meaning a material

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
of the faculty of desire

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
the desire is emotion

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
at the determining ground

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
of the will are without exception

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
empirical

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
and can furnace as no practical

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
loss

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
and by practical

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
by material of the

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
faculty of desire I mean

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
an object whose reality is

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
desired

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
that's from practical reason

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
so it's

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
in practical reason

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
so here

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
according to Scheller

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Kant eroniously

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
assume that any material

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
or non formal ethics

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
must necessarily be an

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
ethics of goods and purposes

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
in that such ethics

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
is empirically inductive

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
and aposteriori

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
an ethics of

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
success

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
it's an ethics that is hedonistic

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
it's eronus and it is an ethics

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
that is incapable of determining

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
the moral foundation

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
of action and is

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
incapable of furnishing insight

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
into the dignity

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
of the person

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
so

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
that's the position of Kant

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and that is the position

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
that Scheller rejected

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
so on the contrary

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
according to Scheller

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
the rejection

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
of an ethics of goods or purposes

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
does not imply

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
a rejection of concrete values

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Kant thought that we can

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
or he can exclude

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
from consideration the value

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
which represent themselves in goods

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
but this would be correct

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
if instead of finding

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
their fulfillment

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
in autonomous phenomena

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
the value concepts

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
were to be obstructed

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
from the goods

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
or if one could derive them

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
only from actual effects

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
an ethics

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
of material values

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
does not necessarily

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
presuppose

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
empirical knowledge

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
because as

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Scheller would show

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
how the material values

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
are not

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
known

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
through empirical knowledge

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
they are also a priori

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
meaning they are also universal

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
so

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Scheller elevated material values

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
in the same level

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
as ideas

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
as formal concepts

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
because for Kant

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
you have the concepts, you have the laws

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
the formal laws, the moral law

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
universal

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
and the material values

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
they are empirical

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
but according to Scheller

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
no, the material values

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
are also a priori

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
they are not empirical

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
so Scheller also rejected

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Kant's identification

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
of the a prioristic

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
with the rational

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
in the material or non formal

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
with the sensual or

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
a posteriori

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
because for Kant

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
is the rational, this is the formal

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
and it is a priori

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
the material

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
or non formal is

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
a posteriori

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
empirical

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
okay, that's the position

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
of Kant and Scheller

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
rejected that position

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
so why can't believe

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
that a material ethic must

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
refer to the organization

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
of the egotistic

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
crimes of human nature

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
in all ethical

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
valuation

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Scheller believed

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
otherwise

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
so he refuted the claim

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
of Kant that only formal

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
ethics

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
avoids the fallacies

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
committed by non formal

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
or material ethics

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
so Scheller believed

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
that

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
this fallacies

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
can also be avoided

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
this egotistic

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
this egotistic valuation

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
can also be

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
avoided by

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
non formal

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
or material ethics

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
so now the main purpose now

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
of Scheller

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
is to show that an ethic

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
of material values

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
which Kant rejected

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
by no means

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
leads to the conclusion

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
rich rich rich

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
by Kant

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
he developed an ethical

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
theory based on the inside

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
that material values

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and their hierarchical

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
order

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
form a realm

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
of material

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
aprioristic data

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
which is disclosed to us

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
by emotional intuition

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
so if the formal

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
if the concepts

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
ideas

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
are revealed to us by reason

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
the values

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
are revealed to us

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
by way of emotional intuition

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
and Scheller also wanted

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
to show

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
that the dichotomy between the sensible

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
and the intelligible

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
or between the intelligible

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
and the emotional

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
when it comes to knowledge

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
is not exhaustive

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
because

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
there is a separate realm

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
between the senses and the intellect

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
there is something

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
between what is perceived

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
by the senses

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
and what is taught by reason

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
and this separate realm

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
is the realm of feelings

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
that which is

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
felt

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
the realm of the emotion

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
so senses

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
thought

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
or intellect

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
thinks

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
the emotions

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
feel

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
so

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
he develop his ethics based on the

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
emotions

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
based on what is felt

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
and what is felt is the value

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
so the value

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
is

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
the intentional object of our

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
emotion

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
or of our feelings

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
and this is where phenomenology

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
would come in

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
because just like Pusser

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
who develop the idea

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
that the intentional

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
objects

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
are the intentional

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
objects

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
the ados

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
are the essential

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
or the intentional objects of our consciousness

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
for Scheller

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
the values are the intentional objects

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
of our emotions

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
so now let's discuss

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
the nature of values

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
so through the phenomenological

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
approach to ethics into values in general

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Scheller

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
hope to make the theory of values

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
impervious

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
in the criticisms

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
of relativism

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
in of the behavioral sciences

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
he wanted this theory

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
this

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
theory of values

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
immune

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
from the criticisms

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
of Kant

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
so according to him

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
many emotions have objective

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
referents

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
meaning intentional objects

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
he stressed that the belief

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
that emotions are purely subjective

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
states of consciousness

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
is based on an

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
erroneous description

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
or misanalysis

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
or misunderstanding

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
of their structure

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
people believe that emotion

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
is just a subjective

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
emotional state

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
or states of consciousness

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
now according to Scheller

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
although some moods

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
do not go beyond themselves

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
the experience of a value

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
is usually an intentional

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
act

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
which is parallel to perception

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and conception of ideas

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
so in perception

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
we have the material object

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
in conception we have the ideas

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
in the emotion

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
we have the values

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
so the object

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
like for example

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
the feeling of joy

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
about a good news

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
is an experience which have

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
subjective and objective points

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
so joy is not just a subjective

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
state of consciousness

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
because there is an objective point

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
to this emotion

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
the object

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
of that experience is seen

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
as a good thing

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
which insensates a value

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
so for example

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
we have the feeling of joy

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
because

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
of the good news

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
what is the good news

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
why is it a good news

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
so the news is something good

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
because it insensates

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
a value

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
and the value

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
is the objective point

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
of your emotional or subjective state

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
so

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
the emotion

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
or the feeling of joy insensates

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
a value

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
so it's not only the good news

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
that will

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
insensate that particular value

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
so therefore according to Scheller

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
there is no such a thing as

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
a cognitive emotions

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
in that point to certain real objects

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
cognitive emotions

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and of course

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
this cognitive emotion

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
is not something that is congruent

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
to the cognitive reason

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
going back to

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
the order amoris or logic of the heart

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
that he borrowed from Blaise Pascal

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
so again in the Darformalismos

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
he disagreed with Kant's

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
identification of the

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
a priori with reason

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
for Scheller

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
the a priori

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
extends far beyond

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
the uses of reason

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
and therefore included

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
feeling

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
the feeling nature of mind

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
within the constitution

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
of the mind

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and posited what he called

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
emotional a priori

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
so the mind

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
is not only

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
formal or rational

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the mind

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
emotional component

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
so that's where he said

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
it's connected to what

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
we have already mentioned

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
that what one ought to do

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
which is

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
the a priori

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
of reason

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
presupposes the feeling

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
of the value of one ought to be

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
done that's the emotional

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
a priori

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
so there is the formal a priori

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
of duty

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and there is the emotional

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
a priori of the value

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
of that duty

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
alright now let's move

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
on to the order amoris

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
because this is one

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
very important concept

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
of Mark Scheller

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
and this is where he

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
described how we

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
recognize

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
the value

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
as a priori

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
so values are a priori

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
and these are

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
anchored on our

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
our order amoris

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
or the order

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
or logic of the heart

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
and again as we've said

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
this is not something that is

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
congruent to the order

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
of reason to the formal

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
part

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
of our mind

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
and again as we've said

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
this is what he

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
borrowed from

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
according to this view

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
moral acts

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
or deeds

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
are individual

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
and they originate

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
in our own pre-rational

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
prefering of values

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
now what is this

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
pre-rational prefering of values

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
in the ordinary sense

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
when we say prefering

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
or preference

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
using something

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
over something else

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
but in Scheller's

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
terminology

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
when you say prefering

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
it pertains to

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
a pre-rational act

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
it's an act

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
that happens

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
prior to making a rational

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
or deliberate

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
choice

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
between one

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
between two or more

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
different things

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
so

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
when we make a decision

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
or a rational decision

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
we analyze

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
which one will I choose

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
we deliberate

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
we enumerate

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
we think of several reasons

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
why choose this

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
but in pre-rational

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
prefering before you can

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
even think of

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
these things

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
before you can even deliberate

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
you already have certain tendency

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
you already

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
lean towards something

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
before you can even make a choice

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
so this leaning towards

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
something

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
has already taken place

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
in us even before

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
we make a choice

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
so we may

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
for example lean towards

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
contemporary music

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
over classical music

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
before we can even think of

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
why do we like

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
contemporary music

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
over classical music

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
or we may prefer

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
a particular color

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
we prefer say

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
color blue

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
over some other colors

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
why is that

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
well

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
you can think later on

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
we deliberate

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
choice

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I want blue because

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
because of this and that

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
or I want red because of this and that

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
but even before you do that

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
you already have some leaning towards something

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
so in such cases

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
we inadvertently

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
experience a drift

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
or propensity towards something

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
rather than something else

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
so there is

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
pre-rational preferring of

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
contemporary music over

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
classical music

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
or pre-rational preferring

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
of certain colors

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
over other colors

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
now

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
this leaning towards something

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
may accompany us for a long time

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
or even for our entire life

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
or it may take

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
different directions during

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
our middle age

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
when we grow old

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
now another parallelism

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
in our

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
visual perception

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
we do not choose to see it alive

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
that makes

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
things visible to us

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
rather our sense of sight

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
possesses a pre-visual

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
tendency

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
or trend towards life

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
towards

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
what is lit up or bright

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
there is

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
a pre-visual preference

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
to light

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
rather than darkness

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
that's pre-visual

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
and there is also

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
pre-rational

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
so love is in the sense

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
analogous to light

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
love has an intrinsic

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
bent towards

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
other higher values

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
than those that were merely given to us

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
no matter whether

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
or not love will realize them

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
so we prefer

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
certain values over other values

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
now

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
the more experience lies

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
in the call of the hour

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
in which the a priori ranking

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
of values becomes

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
individually apparent

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
no matter how much the order of more

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
may be distorted by feelings

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
or other passions

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
in other words

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
there is already a

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
pre or an a priori ranking

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
of values

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
meaning

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
it is not the person

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
who ranks these values

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
but values themselves are already

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
ranked

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
there is an objective ranking

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
of values

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
and these values

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
are as follows

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
value of the senses

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
meaning the value of

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
what is pleasant or unpleasant

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
or maybe

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
what is enjoyable or not enjoyable

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
in the physical

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
or bodily sense

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
the value of life

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
whether something is noble

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
or common

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
the value of the spirit

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
which is divided into two

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
the aesthetic values of ugly and beautiful

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
or the value of knowledge

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
and then

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
the value of

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
religion or the religious values

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
the value of the holy and unholy

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
so if you are going to rank them

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
in ascending order

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
it will follow this

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
the lowest would be the value

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
of bodily comfort

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
or the pleasure values

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and then higher

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
than the bodily comfort

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
the value of the senses

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
would be the pragmatic values of usefulness

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
these two lower ranks of values

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
are either manageable

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
or calculable and divisible

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
it's as if cultivation of them

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
as happens in modern society

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
this unites people

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
so this is the lower value

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
the higher value is

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
the value

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
that contains life values

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
they belong to what is noble

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
and life values

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
but

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
life values pertain at the power

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
only with persons

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
and then the highest

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
values

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
the two highest value ranks

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
are experienced exclusively

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
in human personal feelings

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
the value of

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
the spirit and the religious

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
values

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
so here the rank of

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
mental values of

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
justice, beauty

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
and the cognition of truth

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
so ranking of values

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
and then the highest of the value

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
would be

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
the value of

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
the religious feelings

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
the holy or the unholy

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
so fourth seller

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
the values are already

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
ranked

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
there is an objective

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
ranking of values

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
no matter how

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
our feelings

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
or our resentment

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
or hate

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
may distort them

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
some people who are resentful

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
may think

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
of the value of beauty

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
as lower

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
as lower than

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
for example the value of

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
say

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
usefulness

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
or

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
pleasurable

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
we may say

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
justice

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
is one of the highest

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
values but some people will say

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
well the value of justice is

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
lower than the value

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
for example of

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
pleasure or comfort

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
now i will stop there

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
if you have some questions

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
yes Alexis go ahead

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Doc may randin po ba siyang concept

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
ng

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
parang kai-kant na logiver

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
kasi po di ba sabi po ninyo

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
nakarank na po yung

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
mga values

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
si na po yung nag rank po ng mga values

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
noyan doc

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
if you think of the logiver

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
in the context or same

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
as Kant

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
there is this logiver

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
it's simply that

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
in reality there is this

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
values

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
so even Kant does not say

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
that the values are rank accordingly

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
based on the logiver

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Kant only say that there is the moral law

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and this moral law

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
is the highest of the laws

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
but as to the lower values

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
does not say where it came from

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
it's part of reality

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
the values

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
values are

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
we just not say that

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
values are created

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
values are there

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
they are part of our human experience

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
you can only stress that as far as well

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
because humans

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
are created

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and part of his existence are the values

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
then the values must also be created

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
by a higher being

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
but cellar would not say that

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
it's part of our experience

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
it's part of the human reality

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
okay, any questions?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
oh, let me pull out it

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
since there is already a pre-establish

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
of values and values

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
as already rank

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
because it means values are not

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
no

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
it's not about

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
immoral or being moral

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
this is not

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
this is not an ethics

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
this is not an ethics that talks about

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
what is moral or immoral

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
okay

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
na

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
na

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
you are mixing things

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
please up

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
it's not talking of

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
moral or immoral here

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
of course

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
it talks about evil

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
when later on you're going to see

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
that if you

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
evil would be the preference

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
for a lower value

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
okay

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
but it's not talking of the

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
of immoral

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
in the

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
in the Christian sense of being immoral

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
that it's a sin

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
it's evil

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
meaning if there is

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
no congruence

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
if our

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
if our ranking of values

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
is not congruent, is not in conformity

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
with

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
with the ranking of values

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
then there's something evil in it

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
there's something negative in it

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
but not in the

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
in the Christian sense of being a sin

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
okay, other questions?

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
okay

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
okay, no more

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
okay

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
na you have one minute to answer

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
if you are listening to my lecture

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
okay

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
you have one minute to reply

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
if you don't reply, you have one minute

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
that means you are not following my discussion

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
okay

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
may

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
may kindly take note

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
take note of those who replied

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
okay, thank you

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
alright, so

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
that's my way of checking

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
if you are listening to my discussion

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
if you are still here or you just

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
plug in

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
we know some people are dais

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
okay

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
but 37

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
alright, let's continue

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
values as intentional objects

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
of feelings

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
so again, we recall

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
the notion

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
of intentional objects of consciousness

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
of who's heart

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
okay

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
consciousness is always consciousness of something

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
the consciousness

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
has intentional objects

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
now, Sheller adopted this thesis

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
of

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
who's heart

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
okay, that the ideal objects

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
of knowledge

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
are independent of the knowing subject

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
so the ideal objects

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
of knowledge, these are the intentional

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
objects of our consciousness

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
so

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Sheller adopted this idea

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
and he applied this

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
to his

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
disclosure of the realm of values

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
just as there are

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
intentional objects of knowledge

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
the ideal objects of knowledge

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
he contended

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
that there are also intentional objects

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
of feelings

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and what are these intentional objects of feelings

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
the values

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
right

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
so the

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
ideal objects of knowledge are a priori

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
and the values are also

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
a priori

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
so what are values

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
these are particular class of ideal

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
objects

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
which are objective, eternal

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
and immutable

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
so values are

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
given to us as intentional

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
objects of our feelings

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
just as colors

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
are

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
the objects of our

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
visual perception

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
so concepts

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
are objects of our thoughts

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
colors and the other

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
material qualities

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
are the objects of our senses

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
values

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
are the objects of our feelings

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and just like

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
the concepts

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
they are objective

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
eternal

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and immutable

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
so

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
the modes in which

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
values are knowable to us

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
are beyond the grasp

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
of the intellect

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
so the intellect grasp

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
our grasp

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
as the

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
the essence

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
for example

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
the ideas

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
the values

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
are grasped by our feelings

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
how our feelings are grasped

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
by our emotion

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
is beyond

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
the understanding

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
of the intellect or reason

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
it has its own reason

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
that reason cannot understand

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
so according to Scheller

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
just as

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
the ear

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
is blind

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
to color

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
so the intellect

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
is blind to

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
the values

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
so the emotional aspects of the mind

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
feelings

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
preferring

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
loving, hating, willing

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
because these are

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
the emotional acts

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
the mind has its own acts

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
the intellect rather

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
the intellect has its own acts

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
apprehension, judgment

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
analyzing, critiquing

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
disputing, et cetera

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
the emotional aspects of our minds

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
have also its own acts

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
feeling, preparing, loving

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
hating, willing

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and so on

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and they are not founded upon cognition

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
but are of an

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
apprehensive character

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
in our emotional feeling

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
we feel something

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
for example

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
this or that particular value quality

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
why do we prefer this

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
why do we feel for this

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
for Scheller

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
we prefer

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
our emotion has its own reason

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
but

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
reason, the intellect

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
cannot explain why we prefer this

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
of course later on you can have

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
your own rational

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
deliberation why you prefer

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
contemporary music

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
over classical music

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
so according to Scheller

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
there is a very rational preferring of this

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
that cannot be explained by reason

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
so intentional objects

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
intentional

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
feeling functions

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
do not need the intermediary

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
of the objectifying acts of the intellect

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
like representing

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and judging or analysis

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
in order to come into immediate contact

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
with their objects

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
values for example as agreeable

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
charming

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
lovely, friendly, et cetera

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
in principle

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
are accessible to me

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
without my having

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
to represent them

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
as properties belonging to

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
things or men

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
values are not conceptual terms

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
which find their fulfillment

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
in the common properties

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
of things which are the

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
bearers of these values

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
for example when you say

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
what is

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
a house

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
what is your idea of

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
an institution

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
what is your idea

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
of beauty

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
now when you think of

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
your idea of beauty then you are going to

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
come up with certain common characteristics

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
but why do you

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
find this thing beautiful

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
can you give

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
an enumerable common properties

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
of things according to Scheller when you do that

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
sometimes you end up

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
empty-handed

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
because when you say

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I find this charming

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
and then I also find this thing charming

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and then I also find this charming

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
but when you look at these things

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
they have nothing in common

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
why do you consider this

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
to be agreeable

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
and this is agreeable also

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
why do you have that feeling

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
you cannot

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
give a reason because

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
it is beyond

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
reason

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
beyond reason

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
meaning it is not

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
within the realm of

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
reason

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
so according to Scheller

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
this is shown by the simple

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
fact that it's time we attempt

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
to determine such common

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
properties

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
of what is charming to us

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
or lovely or friendly to us

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
we always end up empty

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
and dead

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
even the habitual

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
or even the ethical values

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
or aesthetic values like normal, courageous

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
and as beautiful

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
becomes accessible

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
not through a number of defined characteristics

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I find this

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I find this beautiful

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I find this accessible

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
this is normal

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
so that's the point of Scheller

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
of course other philosophers

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
are critical of this position

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
but

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
here's a point here also

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
so values are independent

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
of our subjective emotional states

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
what is our subjective emotional states

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
like for example when you are sad

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
sadness

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
is an emotional state

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
but the sadness I feel may involve

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
in me various emotional sentiments

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
so being brokenhearted, being defiant

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
being composed, jatra

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
these are our subjective emotional states

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
now the feeling of sadness remains

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
while my subjective emotional state

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
may change

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
at one point I'm sad so I become brokenhearted

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
or I am defiant

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
or yeah I may be sad

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
but I'm sad composed

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
moreover the causes

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
must not be confused with emotional

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
with intentional object

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the question for example

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
why am I angry

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
is entirely different

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
from what do I feel

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
so what do I feel

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
is your subjective states

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
why am I angry

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
my anger

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
anger is the emotion

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and what is the object of this anger

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
it may be something else

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
that represents

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
a particular value

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
so I am angry because

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I was defiant

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
okay

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
my instructions were not followed

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
okay

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
so not following instruction causes me to be angry

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
but what is it in

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
this not following

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
following my order that made me angry

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
so not obeying instruction

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
not following represents a particular value

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
that makes me angry

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
that becomes the object of my anger

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
okay

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
because

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I am going to be angry

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
not only because somebody

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
defied me

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
or somebody did not follow

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
my instruction

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I may also be angry because somebody betrayed me

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
so betrayal

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
this obedience

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
they represent a particular value

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
which is the object of my anger

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
so a value phenomena

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
as a value phenomena

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
values are true objects

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and they are different from all states

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
of feelings

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
there is a difference between

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
feeling of sadness

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
feeling of anger

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and the values

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
that are the objects of my

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
anger or of my sadness

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
now

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
values are independent

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
of their bearers or carriers

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
what is this bearer or carriers

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
these are things or relations

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
that shell are collectively called the goods

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
the goods are units

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
of value qualities

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
which instantiates

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
objectifies

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
the value in the real world

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
the value qualities do not change

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
when these goods

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
when these bearers

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
change

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
so for example

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
let's use an analogy

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
let's talk about the color

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
this is the color blue

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
now thus the color blue

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
turns red

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
when

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
an object that is blue

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
becomes red

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
like for example

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
a dress

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
so dress

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
bears

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
or carries

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
the value bears the color

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
so

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
if this dress

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
which instantiates

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
the color blue

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
becomes red

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
so it's now a red dress

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
thus the color blue

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
change into red

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
no

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the color blue

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
remains blue

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
the color red

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
remains red

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
but the dress which instantiates

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
which is the carrier

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
or the bearer

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
of the colors

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
have changed

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
it now carries a different color

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
so it's not true

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that values are affected

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
by their order

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
when their bearers

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
change in value

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
food is still food

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
poison is still poison

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
the value of friendship does not change

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
even when your friend

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
changes

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
so this person

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
who carries the value of friendship

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
becomes your enemy

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
he now instantiates

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
not the value of friendship

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
he now instantiates the value of an enemy

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
friendship

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
did not turn into

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
being unfriendly

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
so goods are value

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
things

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
they are bearers of value

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
for example

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
when you go

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
go inside the church

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
see the altar

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
the altar may carry

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
or may bear certain values

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
may have

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
aesthetic value

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
because it's very beautiful

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
or it may also bear

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
the value of the holy

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
so the altar is just a bearer of value

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
it can instantiate

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
the value of

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
beautiful

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
for the value of the holy

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
so it's like saying

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
the absence of light

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
is not

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
saying darkness

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
para pang ganun

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
what do you mean?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
parang

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
mayapuban, ayusin kumunayin tanong

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
ok

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
other questions?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
ok, let's read

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
the a prioristic structure of values

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
so

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
sheller made a distinction between

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
the realm of values

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and the realm of goods

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
and his assertion that values are independent

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
of the bearers of values

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
affirmed the correctness of Kant's view

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
that a philosophical theory of values

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
or ethics or even aesthetics

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
must not presuppose things

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
or goods

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
they agree on this

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
they agree on this sense

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
on this point

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
that there is a distinction

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
between the realm of values

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
and the realm of goods

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that instantiate them

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
so for example a particular person

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
may instantiate several values

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
the values of friendship

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
the values of courage

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
the values of health

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
the values of holy

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
the values of intelligence

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
so there is some

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
independence between the realm of values

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and the realm of goods that instantiate them

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
so it does not mean that for example

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
the value of the holy

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
turns to be unholy when

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
a holy person becomes unholy

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
it's just that

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
that person no longer instantates

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
the value of the holy

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
so that's the a priori

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
thing about

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
this realm of values

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
now

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
the a prioristic relation

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
of values

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
all values are

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
either positive or negative

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
okay

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
there's no such thing as

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
a neutral

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
value

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
okay

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
there's always a value

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
there's always a quality

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
of worth

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
positive or negative

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
the existence

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
of a positive value

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
is in itself

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
positive

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
the existence of holiness is positive

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
the nonexistence

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
of a negative value

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
is also positive

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
so if

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
for example chaos

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
chaos is a negative value

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
there's no chaos

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
that's something positive

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
the nonexistence of positive value

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
and the existence of a negative value

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
is a negative value

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
so

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
nobody's holy

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
there's no holiness

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
that's a negative value

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
it's impossible to evaluate

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
the same value simultaneously

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
as both negative and positive

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
a barrier of value

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
at object

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
may instantiate two values

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
okay

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
like for example a person

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
may instantiate both

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
friendship

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
okay

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
or love or instantiate hate

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
but love and hate

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
cannot be

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
simultaneous

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
as a value

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
good is the value attached

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
to the realization of a positive or a higher value

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
evil

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
the value attached to the realization

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
of a negative or a lower value

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
now we're not saying that

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
that is immoral in the Christian sense

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
so this is in the actual logical

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
sense

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
now

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
we've already mentioned about the hierarchical

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
order of values

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
values constitute

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
a special domain

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
with their own distinct relation

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and correlation

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and among these

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
there is an order or rank

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
independent of the realm

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
of values

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
so we have already talked about

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
the hierarchy of these values

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
all values are

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
non-formal qualities of contents

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
possessing a determined order

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
of ranks

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
with respect to higher or lower

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
in this order

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
independent

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
of the form of being into its values

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and terminating

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
the carriers of their

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
the carriers or bearers of these values

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
or the goods that instantiate this value

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
so again

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
this value model

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
those values reveal by

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
sensory feeling, by vital feeling

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
by the spirit

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and by the holy

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
or holy order religious

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
so this is the ranking

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
of values of shallow

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
well, some people may criticize

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
these ranking of values

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
but that's how shallow

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
ordered

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
rank

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
these values

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
the next topic will be the exemplar persons

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
as shallow said

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
we need to

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
attain

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
a higher moral status

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and the vehicle

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
for attaining a higher moral status

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
is an exemplar

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
meaning a model

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
so an exemplar

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
is an ideal

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
but a non-existent

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
model of one of the value ranks

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
so every value

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
there is

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
an exemplar

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
an ideal model

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
that manifest

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
this value

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
these ideal

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
exemplars manifest themselves

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
in historical role models

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
like for example

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
in Buddha, Christ

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Muhammad, Hannibal

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Ronaldo, Joan of Arc

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
et cetera

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
they are our

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
they are the historical

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
role models

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
they manifest the exemplars

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
the nature of an exemplary person

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
is authentic

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
in being exemplary

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
the moral effectiveness

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
of exemplary persons

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
reaches all people directly

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
regardless

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
of occupation, vocation

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
or interest or even culture

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
so the origin

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
of becoming good

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
in concrete practice

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
lies in the genuine exemplarity

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that a particular person

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
exercises

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
on others

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
without deliberately wanting to do so

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
so for example

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
consider Christ

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
we consider

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
him to be exemplary

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and he exercises

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
or he exercises a particular

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
influence on us

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
without really wanting to

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
be exemplary

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
such exemplarity occurs

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
in living persons

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
so the living persons are the

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
concrete manifestations

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
of the ideal

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
nonexistent exemplars

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
meaning nonexistent

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
well

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
in the same way that values are out there

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
a priori

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
they belong to a different realm

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
the exemplars also belong to a different realm

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
but they are manifested

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
in historic

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
in history so there are also

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
living persons

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
who manifest them

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
okay

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
but of course

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
only outlines of ideal persons

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
which are embedded in our

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
value feelings so in the words

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
for example you have your own

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
ideal

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
boyfriend or ideal

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
girlfriend

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
we exist in that

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
in that ideal world of yours

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
but that will be

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
some living

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
concrete people who would

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
somehow manifest

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
this ideal boyfriend or girlfriend

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
okay

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
so

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
there are empirical model persons

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
meaning

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
these are concrete living persons

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
so manifest our ideal

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and the first concrete

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
empirical model persons

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
are our parents

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
so they become

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
the models for us

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
and then of course

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
our models

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
they grow meaning

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
okay so parents

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
okay

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
and some other people can also have

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
a strong exemplary effect

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
on us

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
a teacher

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
a president

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
a prince, sex man, artist

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
performer

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
an actor perhaps

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
depending on the particular

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
culture

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
it could be the chief of a tribe

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
or our ancestors

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
or our wise men

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
masters

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
in different cultures

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
but according to him

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
it is the exemplary holy man

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
who exercises

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
the strongest moral influence

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
in history

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
like for example Jesus

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Muhammad

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Buddha and only other

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
holy men in history

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
and what is common

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
among them is that they did not

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
choose

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
or explicitly willed

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
to be exemplary

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
nor were they chosen

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
by those who freely follow them

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
genuine role models

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
or model persons

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
almost automatically set up

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
moral standards for other people to follow

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
so people are drawn

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
towards them

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and are motivated by their exemplaryity

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
no matter how deeply

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
or silently

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
they follow

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
these role models

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
or the holy

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
or moral persons

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
in contrast to the empirical model persons

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
an ideal model person

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
is only an exemplary

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
outline in our mind

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
so like your

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
ideal boyfriend or girlfriend

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
it's just there in our mind

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
in the same way

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
as values do exist

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
at least they are realized

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
in materials

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
or by persons

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
so all these absolute value types

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
do not exist

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
unless their ideal value

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
is realized

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
with concrete persons

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
okay

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
so your ideal boyfriend or girlfriend

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
is just there

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
but it will functionalize

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
if they are

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
you have some concrete person

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
to embody them

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
so according to Scheller

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
these ideal outlines should functionalize themselves

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
with concrete person

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
now

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
based on the

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
values there are five

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
ideal moral person types

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
the ideal personifications

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
of the aforementioned

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
value ranks

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
so they are the highest

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
would be the ideal saint

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
then the ideal genius

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
then lower the ideal hero

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
then the ideal

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
leader of a society

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
or of a civilization

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and then the absolute master

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
of enjoying sensible

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
pleasures

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
so these are the ideal

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
moral person types

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
and you can think of

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
of course of

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
empirical

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
concrete persons

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
who may functionalize

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
these ideal

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
moral

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
person types

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
now in the same sense

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
as values are experienced relative

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
to the individual's natures

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
historical manifestations

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
of ideal person types may vary

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
so for example

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
the ideal hero

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
would have different appearances

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
like for example in Joan of Arc

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
or in Alexander the Great

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
the ideal artist

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
may vary

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
in a bit hoven

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
or in a Michael Angelo

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
and even the ideal saints

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
may vary

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
subject to the choices

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
between

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
them since one can make choices

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
only among the lower

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
sorry

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
but it vary

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
depending on the religion

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
but in the latter

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
the founders of religion

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
are not subject to choices

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
between them because

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
one can make choices

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
only among the lower types of

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
exemplars

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
so if a person converts to

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
or otherwise begins to abandon

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
the original fate

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
now there may be some defection

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
or even betrayal

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
something that does not occur when one

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
makes a choice among the lower

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
exemplars

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
okay so there are many

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
different

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
personifications

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
of these

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
ideal types

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
okay

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
now let's go to the last

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
topic here

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
the moral person

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
what is the moral person

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Sheller

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
retains Kant's understanding of person

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
as having an absolute

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
value and end in

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
itself remember

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
the

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
second articulation of the

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
categorical imperative

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
treat the person whether

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
in you or in others to be

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
not only as a means

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
but as an end in itself

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
so Sheller

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
as we have said it was influence

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
by Kant retain that

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
idea of a person

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
as having

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
an absolute value

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
however he is critical of Kant

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
as Kant grounds the absolute value of the person

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
in the universal category

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
of reason that's understandable

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
after discussing his criticism

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
of the

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
formalism of Kant

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
now Sheller describes the person

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
as the concrete unity of acts

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
of

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
different types of nature

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
concrete unity of acts

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
so the person is present in each

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
and every act

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
my person

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
is present in its

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
in every act that I perform

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
but the person

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
is not reducible to any

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
of one act

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
okay so I am present

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
in all my action but my person

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
cannot be reduced in one particular

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
act that I perform

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
unity here means

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
a particular style

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
particular style of acting

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
style of

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
executing my action

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
or of being

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
so every individual

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
will have his or her unique

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
style of loving

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
of assigning meaning

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
of

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
willing

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
of choosing

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and necessarily has his own

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
or her own access to the world

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and when a person dies

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
not only

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
is that the style of loving

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
of assigning or choosing

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
thinking is lost

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
but so is that

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
world

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
is own access to that world

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
it is also lost

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
now

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
for Sheller

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
our being a person

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
is the form of our mind

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and of our consciousness

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
no matter whether

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
mind and consciousness are understood

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
to be human, divine

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
or just fictional

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Sheller rejected the notion

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
of a pure consciousness

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
or mind

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
similar like

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
what Husserl

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
stressed or affirmed

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
so the person is just

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
the form of our mind

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
okay

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
so

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
the form of a person

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
is indifferent

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
to gender, culture

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
race and social station

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
so the person manifests itself

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
without reference

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
among men and women

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
culture, race, social station

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
et cetera

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
among Asian or European

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
ancient people's culture

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
American or Asian

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
et cetera et cetera

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
whether it's or poor it doesn't matter

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
okay

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
the person is different to all this

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
the existence of the form

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
of our mind the person

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
is not also comparable

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
to the existence of a thing

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
when we ask the existence

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
of a thing

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
is it's being an object to us

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
personal existence

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
consists only in the

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
execution of mental

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
volitional

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
and emotive acts

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
so as persons we execute

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
mental acts, volitional acts

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
emotive acts

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
so we cannot be reduced

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
to a thing or an object

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
because objects and

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
things do not act

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
mentally, volitionally

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
or emotionally

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
so such acts are for example

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
that the person is capable

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
of loving, of feeling

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
thinking, willing

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
remembering, expecting, hoping

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
despairing, choosing

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
et cetera et cetera

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
now also

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
share other content that

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
the word person cannot be applied to

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
to a being

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
where we assume animation

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
eagleness

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
consciousness of existence

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
or value of the ego

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
it cannot be applied to man

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
in general

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
the phenomenological essence

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
of person reveals that although

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
there are scenes of personhood

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
in still and developed

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
levels of human beingness

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
like for example in the case

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
of children, in the case of

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
it cannot be applied

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
or it can only be applied

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
to a specific level of human existence

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
or a certain kind of man

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
where certain characteristics

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
are already there

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
so for example babies

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
or share other babies

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
who are not be

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
they already have

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
the scenes of personhood

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
but they cannot be considered

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
to be person yet because

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
they are not capable of

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
this unity

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
of acts

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
of course there are persons

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
because they are already

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
they have the scenes of personhood

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
but they cannot be considered person

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
in the full sense of

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
moral personhood

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
okay?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
it's like

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
it's like our notion of the age of

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
maturity

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
or age of, for example

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
at this particular age

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
18 years old then you are

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
already a full citizen

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
because you already have

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
attained a certain degree of maturity

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
so something similar to that

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
now

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
the imperative that is given

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
in the value a priori

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
in the objective ranks of values

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
is only felt by person

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
so consequently persons

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
are the only beings

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
who are ethically responsible

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
and because every experience

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
is evaluated

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
a person

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
is responsible

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
to love the object

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
or a being of that experience

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
most fully

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
so for example in relation to other persons

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
it's the responsibility

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
and ethical responsibility

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
of the person to love

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
so in loving another person

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
one is called

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
ethically to love

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
even more

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
fully and deeply because

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
the object of that love

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
is a person

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
who has the highest

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
or the absolute value

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
now finally

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
let's talk about what are the characteristics

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
of a person

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
for shellar

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
the person possesses

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
a holy sound mind

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
so the person

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
is somebody

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
who executes intentional acts

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
that are bound

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
by a unity of sense

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
not the unity that we talked about

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
a while ago

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
person is subscribed only to a certain level

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
of development

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
so eagerness

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
possession of a soul

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
consciousness of self

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
do not make a man

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
a person in the moral

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
sense

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
because you have to perform

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
actions

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
the emotive

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
the volitional and the mental acts

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
a child

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
or a person coming

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
of age

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
has the ability to experience

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
inside difference

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
between one act and other acts

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
so if a child can already

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
experience this

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
then he can consider to be

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
a moral person

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
so he is able to

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
in a different shape

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
and conscious of his ability

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
conscious of his ability

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
defines a person

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
so the question is

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
what about the embassy

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
for the embassy

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
the men retarded

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
while they have the seeds of personhood

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
they cannot be considered to be

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
moral persons

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
so person is restricted

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
to those in whom

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
domination over the live

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
body appears immediately

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
he is a master

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
a mastery of his live body

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
and

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
lastly the concrete subject

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
of all acts of the essence

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
of inner intuition

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
and therefore for Scheller

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
the person is

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
only

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
as the concrete unity of acts

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
executed by the person

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
and only

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
in the execution of these

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
acts

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
can a person be considered to be

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
a moral

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
person

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
but just to clarify

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
man

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
all men whether it's

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
a baby or an embassy

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
they contain the seeds

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
of personhood

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
only that because

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
they have not attained a certain degree

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
of moral maturity

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
then they cannot be considered to be

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
a moral person

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
ok so that concludes

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
my presentation on this topic

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
this is not the whole of Scheller

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
we have only discussed

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
what is

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
what he discussed in the

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
their formalism was not even whole of it

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
not even whole of it

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
and I already mentioned

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
many of some of the

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
important works of Max Scheller

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
but I hope that this presentation

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
will give you

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
you know

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
you may introduce

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
give you an overview

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
of the

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
philosophy or at least the philosophy

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
of values of Max Scheller
