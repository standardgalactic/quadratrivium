0	18000	So, this is the philosophy of Max Scheller, introduction to the life of Max Scheller.
18000	21000	He was a German social and ethical philosopher.
21000	27000	He was born in Munich on August 22, 1874.
27000	32000	His mother was Jewish and his father a Lutheran.
32000	38000	However, he joined the Roman Catholic Church maybe because of its concept of love,
38000	44000	one of the concepts that Max Scheller developed in his philosophy.
44000	48000	He studied medicine and philosophy in Munich and in Berlin
48000	54000	and he received his doctorate at Vienna University in 1897.
54000	61000	Or he taught from 900, the year 900 up to 1906.
61000	66000	In 1901, Scheller became a lecturer at the University of Vienna
66000	71000	and stayed there until that particular year 1906.
71000	78000	So, from 1907 to 1910, he was professor at Munich
78000	81000	and met some of the disciples of Kusser.
82000	87000	And with their influence, his thinking turned to phenomenology.
87000	91000	He became acquainted with expanding phenomenological movement
91000	97000	but he kept a notably independent position from phenomenology.
97000	102000	In 1910, he retired from teaching and retired to Berlin
102000	105000	and wrote his major works.
105000	108000	In 1917, he joined the German Foreign Office
108000	112000	as a diplomat in Geneva and at the Hague.
112000	116000	And in 1919, he became professor and chair of philosophy
116000	121000	and sociology at the University of Cologne.
121000	127000	During this period of productivity, which ended around 1921,
127000	130000	he became renowned in Germany and elsewhere
130000	134000	for an unusual amount of publications.
134000	137000	Perhaps one of the most prolific writers
137000	143000	of the phenomenological movement is Max Scheller,
143000	147000	second to Edmund Musser.
147000	151000	After that, his favorite worldwide proportion
151000	154000	documented by the many invitations extended to him
154000	158000	to lecture in Paris, in Japan, in Russia,
158000	161000	and in the United States.
161000	164000	In 1920, he became a pacifist
164000	167000	and repudiated the horrors of war
167000	171000	and was converted to Roman Catholicism.
171000	174000	But about 1924,
174000	177000	he turned to a more pantheistic view of man in the world
177000	181000	and left Catholicism.
181000	185000	In early 1928, he went to the University of Frankfurt
185000	188000	where he also lectured there.
188000	194000	And he died on May 1928.
194000	197000	His widow was the devoted curator
197000	200000	of thousands of post-humans manuscripts
200000	205000	until she passed away in 1969.
205000	209000	As a phenomenologist, Scheller sought to discover
209000	212000	the essence of mental attitudes
212000	215000	and the relation to their objects,
215000	217000	ating that he will develop
217000	221000	in his major work, therefore, Malismus.
221000	224000	He differed from Musser in his readiness to assign
224000	229000	an independently real status to the objects.
229000	232000	Remember that Musser
232000	236000	took objects to be
236000	239000	the intentional objects
239000	242000	of our consciousness.
242000	245000	At the development of his thought,
245000	248000	the first period of Scheller's thought
248000	251000	centered on the incontrovertible value
251000	255000	of the individual person and value ethics
255000	259000	centered on the non-formal or material ethics
259000	262000	which is opposed to the formal ethics proposed
262000	264000	by Immanuel Kant.
264000	267000	This position of Max Scheller
267000	270000	is founded in his major work
270000	272000	on formalism
272000	274000	or formalism in ethics
274000	277000	and non-formal ethics of values
277000	279000	a new attempt toward the foundation
279000	281000	of ethical personalism.
281000	286000	That's the entire title of his work.
286000	289000	In the first part of his value ethics
289000	291000	he established the values,
291000	294000	he established that values are correlates
294000	297000	of three types of feelings.
297000	300000	Feelings in the body, feelings of life
300000	302000	and personal feelings.
302000	305000	Moral experience cannot be divorced
305000	308000	from feeling values as such.
308000	310000	And in the second part
310000	313000	he showed that each person was a unique
313000	315000	self-value.
315000	318000	Personal self-value must be accounted for
318000	323000	in all variable moral situations.
323000	326000	So here in the first part of his
326000	329000	ethics and his formalismos
329000	332000	established the notion of values.
332000	336000	Values as objects of our emotions
336000	338000	of our feelings.
338000	340000	But in doing that
340000	343000	he also criticized the formal ethics
343000	345000	of Immanuel Kant.
345000	348000	And we're going to discuss that later.
348000	351000	So in the second part
351000	353000	of this value ethics
353000	356000	was on the nature of the person.
356000	358000	The exemplary persons.
358000	360000	The nature or the theory
360000	362000	of the nature of the person
362000	365000	is a new and most interesting analysis.
365000	367000	The series was also developing
367000	372000	a kind of ethical personalism.
372000	374000	He showed that our being a person
374000	377000	is the form of our mind
377000	379000	and our consciousness.
379000	381000	No matter whether the mind
381000	383000	or the consciousness
383000	385000	are understood to be human,
385000	388000	divine, or just fictional.
388000	390000	We developed his idea
390000	394000	of the ideal moral person.
394000	396000	However, in the second period
396000	398000	of his career
398000	401000	after writing the formalismos
401000	404000	Sheller developed a more comprehensive
404000	406000	anthropology
406000	408000	that works on the vitalism
408000	410000	and pantheism.
410000	412000	So he figured out
412000	414000	to determine what he called
414000	416000	the meta-anthropological status
416000	418000	of humanity.
418000	420000	And this he developed
420000	422000	in his work,
422000	424000	Man's Place in the Cosmos
424000	427000	or Man's Place in the Universe
427000	429000	which was published
429000	431000	in 1928
431000	433000	after his death.
433000	435000	So it was published
435000	437000	mostly. Remember that he died
437000	439000	of that year.
439000	441000	Sheller in that book
441000	443000	which is actually a very,
443000	445000	just a very thin book
445000	447000	offered a graduate
447000	449000	view of being.
449000	452000	In his view, man, God,
452000	454000	and the world
454000	457000	are one self-becoming cosmic process
457000	460000	in absolute time.
460000	462000	And this process of self-becoming
462000	464000	has two poles.
464000	466000	The guys and the drunk.
466000	468000	Guys meaning spirit
468000	471000	and the drunk meaning the life-hearts.
471000	473000	The guys according to Sheller
473000	476000	is powerless
476000	478000	unless it can,
478000	480000	its ideas can functionalize
480000	482000	with life factors
482000	485000	meaning with material conditions
485000	488000	that realize their actual,
488000	490000	their actualities.
490000	492000	And the one that
492000	494000	can provide the guys
494000	496000	with power,
496000	498000	with vitality
498000	500000	is the drunk.
500000	502000	So the drunk is
502000	504000	the source of life,
504000	506000	the source of vitality.
506000	509000	But the drunk does not have any direction.
509000	511000	So it is the guys
511000	513000	that provides direction.
514000	516000	So the guys is the
516000	518000	source of direction,
518000	520000	source of
520000	522000	the ideas,
523000	525000	source of reason,
525000	527000	but it is powerless.
527000	529000	Does not have any vitality at all.
529000	531000	The drunk on the other hand
531000	533000	is the source of vitality
533000	535000	but it does not have any direction at all.
535000	537000	So when you combine it to
537000	539000	then you have both vitality
539000	541000	and direction.
543000	545000	So,
545000	547000	now Sheller for a particular
547000	549000	kinship to
549000	552000	introspective and intuitive philosophers
552000	554000	like Blaise Pascal.
554000	556000	And it was also
556000	558000	was actually from Blaise Pascal
558000	560000	that he borrowed the notion
560000	562000	of reason of the heart
562000	564000	or logic decor
564000	566000	which would
566000	568000	be very prominent
568000	570000	in his articulation of
570000	572000	our understanding
572000	574000	or feeling of the values.
574000	576000	So he preferred
576000	578000	these introspective and intuitive philosophers
579000	581000	more than the abstract theories
581000	583000	about morality and God.
583000	585000	These tendencies
585000	587000	become the basis of criticisms
587000	589000	against Sheller's emotive philosophy
589000	591000	that his ethics
591000	593000	is emotive.
593000	595000	It's based on
595000	597000	the emotions
597000	599000	on the feelings.
599000	601000	And no less than Karol Vitiva
601000	603000	was critical of
603000	605000	the philosophy of Max Sheller
605000	607000	although Max Sheller influenced a lot
607000	609000	the phenomenology
609000	611000	or the way Vitiva understands
611000	613000	phenomenology.
613000	615000	Of course, there are other
615000	617000	philosophers who also influence
617000	619000	its view about this
619000	621000	about the intuitive
621000	623000	about
623000	625000	introspective power.
625000	627000	Philosophers like
627000	629000	Nietzsche, Briggson and
629000	631000	Delphi.
631000	633000	So these philosophers also influence
633000	635000	this orientation
635000	637000	Max Sheller.
637000	639000	Of course, the other philosopher
639000	641000	who influenced Max Sheller
641000	643000	was Edmund Pusser
643000	645000	and Immanuel Kant
645000	647000	because she studied Immanuel Kant
647000	649000	although he was critical
649000	651000	of the ethics of Immanuel Kant.
651000	653000	The other philosophers
653000	655000	or thinkers who have Sheller's
655000	657000	thinking includes
657000	659000	those thinkers in the history of philosophy
659000	661000	who demonstrated their
661000	663000	phenomenological orientation like
663000	665000	philosophy and other oriental
665000	667000	philosophers.
667000	669000	His other works also
669000	671000	showed the result of Kantian
671000	673000	and post Kantian influence.
673000	675000	As I mentioned here, their
675000	677000	formalismos, although it was
677000	679000	a critique of Kant's formal ethics
679000	681000	he nevertheless agreed
681000	683000	with Kant on certain points
683000	685000	and we are going to discuss
685000	687000	that later. The influence
687000	689000	of phenomenology
689000	691000	especially
691000	693000	Brusser account for Sheller's
693000	695000	interest on empirical research
695000	697000	and in metaphysics.
697000	699000	So those are
699000	701000	the important
701000	703000	influences in the philosophy
703000	705000	of Max Sheller. Now let's
705000	707000	go to his methodology.
707000	709000	Of course
709000	711000	he strongly emphasized
711000	713000	the phenomenological method
713000	715000	which at a time
715000	717000	was being formally developed
717000	719000	by Brusser
719000	721000	and he also actually
721000	723000	acclaimed this in his door formalismos.
723000	725000	He first came
725000	727000	in contact with the movement
727000	729000	when he moved to the University of
729000	731000	Beauty in 1907 as we have already mentioned
731000	733000	and there he met
733000	735000	some of the students of
735000	737000	Brusser.
737000	739000	So he was
739000	741000	attracted to this
741000	743000	movement or to this approach
743000	745000	of philosophy. Although
745000	747000	he
747000	749000	applied the phenomenological method
749000	751000	not on
751000	753000	epistemology the way
753000	755000	Brusser applied
755000	757000	phenomenology
757000	759000	but applied it to
759000	761000	actualogy, to ethics
761000	763000	or to values
763000	765000	and to his notion of
765000	767000	the human person.
767000	769000	Sheller is firmly convinced
769000	771000	that phenomenology would bring about
771000	773000	basic transformation
773000	775000	in our way of conceiving the world
775000	777000	and ourselves.
777000	779000	Although some consider it
779000	781000	thought to be quite unsystematic
781000	783000	Sheller was one of the most
783000	785000	insightful and acutely
785000	787000	intuitive and brilliant thinkers
787000	789000	and writers of the early 20th century.
789000	791000	And his works
791000	793000	abound with
793000	795000	detailed description of the
795000	797000	sample states of consciousness
797000	799000	like sympathy which he has a
799000	801000	book on
801000	803000	resentment
803000	805000	love
805000	807000	and joy.
807000	809000	So here are some of the
809000	811000	important works of
811000	813000	Max Sheller
813000	815000	on resentment and moral
815000	817000	value judgment
817000	819000	published in 1912.
819000	821000	And then contributions
821000	823000	to the phenomenology and theory
823000	825000	of sympathy and of love in 8
825000	827000	the following year 1913.
829000	831000	And then he's there formalismus
831000	833000	and non-formal ethics of values.
835000	837000	1913
839000	841000	and then man's place in nature
841000	843000	or man's place in the cosmos
843000	845000	posumously published in 1928
845000	847000	and man in the age of
847000	849000	equalization
849000	851000	published in 1929.
851000	853000	So these last two are
853000	855000	posumously published.
857000	859000	Now let's go to his theory
859000	861000	of values.
861000	863000	And here we are going to
863000	865000	zero in on the
865000	867000	formalismus.
867000	869000	And it would be nice
869000	871000	it would help if you're going
871000	873000	to read at least the first
873000	875000	chapter of the
875000	877000	formalismus for you to better understand
877000	879000	his theory
879000	881000	of values.
883000	885000	Now in that book the formalismus
885000	887000	Sheller explained that one
887000	889000	ought to do
889000	891000	what one ought to do
891000	893000	presupposes a feeling
893000	895000	of the value of what ought
895000	897000	to be done.
897000	899000	Now this ought
899000	901000	is actually
901000	903000	the concept of duty
903000	905000	of Immanuel Kant.
905000	907000	So he's referring to
907000	909000	the concept of duty
909000	911000	the categorical imperative
911000	913000	of Immanuel Kant.
913000	915000	And according to Sheller
915000	917000	what we ought to do
917000	919000	our understanding of what
919000	921000	of duty
921000	923000	presupposes a feeling
923000	925000	of the value of what ought
925000	927000	to be done. In other words
927000	929000	the feeling is more primordial
929000	931000	than the understanding
931000	933000	of
933000	935000	the duty.
935000	937000	Because for Sheller
937000	939000	even if you know
939000	941000	that we ought to do
941000	943000	our duties
943000	945000	we have the feeling of the value
945000	947000	of that duty
947000	949000	we will never do it.
949000	951000	So it presupposes
951000	953000	that we already have
953000	955000	a feeling of the duty.
957000	959000	That feeling of
959000	961000	the duty is based on our
961000	963000	values.
963000	965000	Now he divided the values
965000	967000	into five ranks which are given
967000	969000	a priori.
969000	971000	So for him the values
971000	973000	must be a priori meaning
973000	975000	they don't pass to experience
975000	977000	that fulfill
977000	979000	the requirement of Kant
979000	981000	that for something to be universal
981000	983000	it must be a priori.
983000	985000	So if you apply
985000	987000	the idea of
987000	989000	a priori
989000	991000	that the universal must be a priori
991000	993000	by saying
993000	995000	that values are given a priori
995000	997000	then that means
997000	999000	the values are universal.
999000	1001000	And these values
1001000	1003000	are anchored
1003000	1005000	in our
1005000	1007000	ordo amoris
1007000	1009000	or the order or logic of the heart
1009000	1011000	logic decor.
1011000	1013000	And this
1013000	1015000	logic of the heart
1015000	1017000	is not congruent to the logic
1017000	1019000	based on reason.
1019000	1021000	So aside from
1021000	1023000	the logic of reason
1023000	1025000	Sheller adds
1025000	1027000	another thing the logic
1027000	1029000	of the heart.
1029000	1031000	And the reason
1031000	1033000	of the heart cannot be
1033000	1035000	understood by reason
1035000	1037000	by pure reason
1037000	1039000	by the intellect.
1039000	1041000	And in this
1041000	1043000	view Sheller follow the idea of
1043000	1045000	the French philosopher
1045000	1047000	Blaise Pascal and of course
1047000	1049000	oppose himself to the ideas
1049000	1051000	or to the position of
1051000	1053000	Immanuel Kant.
1053000	1055000	According to this view
1055000	1057000	moral acts and deeds
1057000	1059000	are individual
1059000	1061000	and they originate
1061000	1063000	in an individual's
1063000	1065000	pre-rational
1065000	1067000	preferring of values.
1067000	1069000	Meaning before
1069000	1071000	we can rationalize
1071000	1073000	about values
1073000	1075000	we already prefer
1075000	1077000	the values before we can even
1077000	1079000	understand before we can
1079000	1081000	even reason out about
1081000	1083000	values. We already have
1083000	1085000	preference
1085000	1087000	tendency
1087000	1089000	for values.
1091000	1093000	So we will
1093000	1095000	explain that in details
1095000	1097000	in the later part.
1097000	1099000	So moral experience lies in the
1099000	1101000	what he calls the call of the hour
1101000	1103000	of the moment
1103000	1105000	in which the a priori ranking
1105000	1107000	among
1107000	1109000	values become individually
1109000	1111000	transparent.
1111000	1113000	In a particular moment
1113000	1115000	we're going
1115000	1117000	how we value things will become
1117000	1119000	transparent it will manifest
1119000	1121000	itself.
1121000	1123000	No matter how much the order
1123000	1125000	may be distorted by the
1125000	1127000	feelings of the sentiment
1127000	1129000	of hate and other passions
1129000	1131000	we will go back to this later.
1131000	1133000	Now let's go to the
1133000	1135000	first part of the therefore
1135000	1137000	balismos.
1137000	1139000	Because in the first part of the
1139000	1141000	it is where
1141000	1143000	Scheller presented
1143000	1145000	this criticism of Kant's
1145000	1147000	formal ethics.
1147000	1149000	By the way when you say
1149000	1151000	non-formal ethics
1151000	1153000	it means material ethics.
1153000	1155000	Material here
1155000	1157000	pertains to
1157000	1159000	the non-rational.
1159000	1161000	The non-rational.
1161000	1163000	So the formal is rational
1163000	1165000	that's the
1165000	1167000	position of
1167000	1169000	reason
1169000	1171000	pure reason practical reason
1171000	1173000	so it's formal.
1173000	1175000	And
1175000	1177000	the non-formal
1177000	1179000	the non-rational
1179000	1181000	is
1181000	1183000	regarded by Kant as
1183000	1185000	empirical
1185000	1187000	or material.
1187000	1189000	So
1189000	1191000	Scheller
1191000	1193000	develops his theory of values
1193000	1195000	in the realm of the material
1195000	1197000	in the realm of the
1197000	1199000	non-formal.
1199000	1201000	What is that material
1201000	1203000	non-formal in the realm of the emotions.
1205000	1207000	So Scheller's theory of values
1207000	1209000	and ethics would be in fact
1209000	1211000	incomprehensible
1211000	1213000	without taking into consideration
1213000	1215000	his criticisms of Kant's
1215000	1217000	view of ethics.
1217000	1219000	Because in the first part of the
1219000	1221000	therefore balismos
1221000	1223000	he was commenting
1223000	1225000	and criticking
1225000	1227000	the formalism of Immanuel Kant
1227000	1229000	although he agreed with Kant
1229000	1231000	on certain points.
1231000	1233000	And therefore the non-formalismos
1233000	1235000	in the non-formalismos
1235000	1237000	Scheller
1237000	1239000	preoccupied himself with a lengthy criticism
1239000	1241000	of Kant's formal ethics
1241000	1243000	and built much of his
1243000	1245000	own ideas on these
1245000	1247000	or from these criticisms.
1247000	1249000	He said
1249000	1251000	in the early pages of the non-formalismos
1251000	1253000	in this work
1253000	1255000	I can accomplish my task
1255000	1257000	only through revealing Kant's
1257000	1259000	erroneous presuppositions
1259000	1261000	and by replacing
1261000	1263000	them with correct
1263000	1265000	ones. That's how
1265000	1267000	ambitious the project
1267000	1269000	of Scheller is
1269000	1271000	in this
1271000	1273000	work that are formalismos.
1273000	1275000	Scheller though agreed
1275000	1277000	with Kant on certain points.
1277000	1279000	First he agreed with Kant
1279000	1281000	when Kant rejected
1281000	1283000	all ethics of goods and purposes.
1283000	1285000	What is an ethic
1285000	1287000	of goods and purposes?
1287000	1289000	Well, it's a kind of ethics
1289000	1291000	that bases the morality
1291000	1293000	of action or morality itself
1293000	1295000	on purposes.
1295000	1297000	Remember
1297000	1299000	the teleological theories on ethics.
1299000	1301000	So
1301000	1303000	Kant rejected all teleological
1303000	1305000	theories
1305000	1307000	of ethics.
1307000	1309000	Because these ethics base morality
1309000	1311000	on purposes
1311000	1313000	on uncertain goods.
1313000	1315000	For example, you want to be happy
1315000	1317000	if what you're doing
1317000	1319000	will make you happy, happiness
1319000	1321000	is something good, then
1321000	1323000	your action
1323000	1325000	is ethical.
1325000	1327000	But Kant rejected
1327000	1329000	that kind of ethics.
1331000	1333000	He rejected that kind of ethics.
1333000	1335000	And Scheller agreed with Kant
1335000	1337000	in his rejection
1337000	1339000	of this kind of ethics
1339000	1341000	of goods and purposes.
1341000	1343000	So according to Scheller
1343000	1345000	Kant was correct
1345000	1347000	when he refuted all ethics
1347000	1349000	starting with a question
1349000	1351000	what is the highest good
1351000	1353000	or what is the final purpose
1353000	1355000	of all our
1355000	1357000	volitional connection.
1357000	1359000	So he agreed with
1359000	1361000	Kant on that point.
1361000	1363000	Kant he said was correct
1363000	1365000	in dismissing them
1365000	1367000	as having false basis.
1367000	1369000	So Scheller wrote
1369000	1371000	in the Der Formalismus
1371000	1373000	and I'm quoting him here
1373000	1375000	I quote
1375000	1377000	Kant maintained
1377000	1379000	that whenever
1379000	1381000	we make the goodness
1381000	1383000	or moral depravity
1383000	1385000	of a person
1385000	1387000	and act will
1387000	1389000	indeed, etc.
1389000	1391000	Dependent on their relation to
1391000	1393000	the realm of existing goods
1393000	1395000	or evils,
1395000	1397000	posited as real
1397000	1399000	we make the goodness or the
1399000	1401000	privacy of the will
1401000	1403000	dependent on the particular
1403000	1405000	contingent existence
1405000	1407000	of the realm of goods
1407000	1409000	as well as on its experiential
1409000	1411000	noability.
1411000	1413000	So he agreed with Kant
1413000	1415000	that we cannot base our
1415000	1417000	the moral goodness
1417000	1419000	or the moral
1419000	1421000	depravity of a particular
1421000	1423000	act on the basis
1423000	1425000	of a realm of goods
1425000	1427000	because this realm
1427000	1429000	of goods
1429000	1431000	is based on experience
1431000	1433000	and
1433000	1435000	anything that is based on experience
1435000	1437000	or empirical cannot
1437000	1439000	be permanent it will be changing
1439000	1441000	and therefore you cannot base
1441000	1443000	your morality on that. So he agreed
1443000	1445000	with Kant on that point.
1445000	1447000	Kant further added
1447000	1449000	that the moral value of the will
1449000	1451000	would always depend
1451000	1453000	on the way in which
1453000	1455000	it intervened in the
1455000	1457000	maintenance or promotion of this
1457000	1459000	realm of goods.
1459000	1461000	However,
1461000	1463000	since this realm of goods
1463000	1465000	is continually changing in
1465000	1467000	history
1467000	1469000	because this realm of goods
1469000	1471000	is contingent
1471000	1473000	it's
1473000	1475000	empirical
1475000	1477000	the moral value of the will
1477000	1479000	would also be changing
1479000	1481000	so like for example
1481000	1483000	let us say
1483000	1485000	God yet
1485000	1487000	belong to this realm of good
1487000	1489000	so if we are going to base our
1489000	1491000	or fame for example
1491000	1493000	or power for example
1493000	1495000	but this realm of goods
1495000	1497000	they keeps on changing
1497000	1499000	in history.
1499000	1501000	So that means that the value
1501000	1503000	of the will would also be changing
1503000	1505000	the destruction of this
1505000	1507000	realm of goods would also
1507000	1509000	mean the dissolution of the idea
1509000	1511000	of the moral
1511000	1513000	value.
1515000	1517000	So with these presuppositions
1517000	1519000	ethics would be based on sensible
1519000	1521000	experience and therefore
1521000	1523000	it would only be empirical
1523000	1525000	and it will only have
1525000	1527000	inductive validity
1527000	1529000	and remember that for
1529000	1531000	Kant
1531000	1533000	morality should be universal
1533000	1535000	a knowledge
1535000	1537000	should be universal
1537000	1539000	that's why he said
1539000	1541000	that morality should be
1541000	1543000	based on the moral law
1543000	1545000	the moral law is something
1545000	1547000	that is universal the moral law
1547000	1549000	is law is a priori
1549000	1551000	so the
1551000	1553000	a priori is that which is
1553000	1555000	universal
1555000	1557000	so if we base our morality
1557000	1559000	on a realm of goods
1559000	1561000	that will be changing
1561000	1563000	continuously
1563000	1565000	in history then
1565000	1567000	morality will also be changing
1569000	1571000	the same holds true if ethics will be
1571000	1573000	based on purposes
1573000	1575000	on the end, the loss
1575000	1577000	any ethics which measures
1577000	1579000	the moral value of the will
1579000	1581000	against the final purpose
1581000	1583000	like you want to be happy
1585000	1587000	or you want to be
1587000	1589000	say
1589000	1591000	useful
1591000	1593000	that would necessarily
1593000	1595000	degrade the values of the goods and evil
1595000	1597000	to mere technical values
1597000	1599000	subordinated to that purpose
1601000	1603000	so Scheller echoes Kant
1603000	1605000	when he wrote and again echoed
1605000	1607000	ethics must reject
1607000	1609000	all talk of good and bad purposes
1609000	1611000	for purposes
1611000	1613000	as such are never
1613000	1615000	good nor bad
1615000	1617000	when considered apart from the value
1617000	1619000	that are to be realized
1619000	1621000	in positing them
1621000	1623000	and apart from the values of the act
1623000	1625000	that posits them
1625000	1627000	remember that for Kant
1627000	1629000	there is only one thing that is good
1629000	1631000	without any qualification
1631000	1633000	and that is the good will
1635000	1637000	so therefore we cannot base ethics
1637000	1639000	on any purpose
1639000	1641000	because these purposes
1641000	1643000	may change
1643000	1645000	it may be good
1645000	1647000	under certain condition
1647000	1649000	but remember
1649000	1651000	for Kant
1651000	1653000	the good must be good
1653000	1655000	without any condition
1655000	1657000	and the only thing that is good
1657000	1659000	without any condition
1659000	1661000	is the good will
1661000	1663000	so on this point Scheller agreed
1663000	1665000	with Immanuel Kant
1665000	1667000	purposes are justifiable
1667000	1669000	only when they will posit
1669000	1671000	when the will posits
1671000	1673000	or has posited them is good
1673000	1675000	and the only way that can posit
1675000	1677000	it to be good
1677000	1679000	is the good will
1679000	1681000	what makes a purpose good or bad
1681000	1683000	is not the particular realization of that purpose
1683000	1685000	but the very positing
1685000	1687000	or the manner
1687000	1689000	or phases in which the purpose
1689000	1691000	has come about
1691000	1693000	so he agreed
1693000	1695000	with Kant on those points
1695000	1697000	however
1697000	1699000	he refuted Kant
1699000	1701000	when Kant assume
1701000	1703000	that the material
1703000	1705000	or non formal ethics
1705000	1707000	which is also an ethic
1707000	1709000	of goods and purposes
1709000	1711000	when Kant assume
1711000	1713000	that
1713000	1715000	non formal ethics
1715000	1717000	is also an ethic
1717000	1719000	of goods and purposes
1719000	1721000	because Kant
1723000	1725000	distinguish only
1725000	1727000	formal
1727000	1729000	or non formal
1729000	1731000	and
1731000	1733000	he included
1733000	1735000	the non formal ethics
1735000	1737000	to ethics of goods and purposes
1737000	1739000	so for Kant
1739000	1741000	the only thing
1741000	1743000	the only ethics
1743000	1745000	that is
1745000	1747000	viable and acceptable
1747000	1749000	is a formal ethics
1749000	1751000	he dismissed
1751000	1753000	the material
1753000	1755000	non formal ethics
1755000	1757000	Kant believe
1757000	1759000	that an ethic preceded by correct methods
1759000	1761000	must exclude
1761000	1763000	improsipositions
1763000	1765000	of the concept of good and bad
1765000	1767000	and the constitution
1767000	1769000	not only goods and purposes
1769000	1771000	but also all
1771000	1773000	values of non formal
1773000	1775000	nature
1775000	1777000	so
1777000	1779000	Jose
1779000	1781000	in general
1781000	1783000	can't reject
1783000	1785000	all kinds of
1785000	1787000	values
1787000	1789000	of non formal nature
1789000	1791000	meaning the values
1791000	1793000	that are not
1793000	1795000	rational
1795000	1797000	and again he called
1797000	1799000	all practical principles
1799000	1801000	which presuppose an object
1801000	1803000	meaning a material
1803000	1805000	of the faculty of desire
1805000	1807000	the desire is emotion
1807000	1809000	at the determining ground
1809000	1811000	of the will are without exception
1811000	1813000	empirical
1813000	1815000	and can furnace as no practical
1815000	1817000	loss
1817000	1819000	and by practical
1819000	1821000	by material of the
1821000	1823000	faculty of desire I mean
1823000	1825000	an object whose reality is
1825000	1827000	desired
1827000	1829000	that's from practical reason
1829000	1831000	so it's
1833000	1835000	in practical reason
1835000	1837000	so here
1837000	1839000	according to Scheller
1839000	1841000	Kant eroniously
1841000	1843000	assume that any material
1843000	1845000	or non formal ethics
1845000	1847000	must necessarily be an
1847000	1849000	ethics of goods and purposes
1849000	1851000	in that such ethics
1851000	1853000	is empirically inductive
1853000	1855000	and aposteriori
1855000	1857000	an ethics of
1857000	1859000	success
1859000	1861000	it's an ethics that is hedonistic
1861000	1863000	it's eronus and it is an ethics
1863000	1865000	that is incapable of determining
1865000	1867000	the moral foundation
1867000	1869000	of action and is
1869000	1871000	incapable of furnishing insight
1871000	1873000	into the dignity
1873000	1875000	of the person
1875000	1877000	so
1877000	1879000	that's the position of Kant
1879000	1881000	and that is the position
1881000	1883000	that Scheller rejected
1885000	1887000	so on the contrary
1887000	1889000	according to Scheller
1889000	1891000	the rejection
1891000	1893000	of an ethics of goods or purposes
1893000	1895000	does not imply
1895000	1897000	a rejection of concrete values
1899000	1901000	Kant thought that we can
1901000	1903000	or he can exclude
1903000	1905000	from consideration the value
1905000	1907000	which represent themselves in goods
1907000	1909000	but this would be correct
1909000	1911000	if instead of finding
1911000	1913000	their fulfillment
1913000	1915000	in autonomous phenomena
1915000	1917000	the value concepts
1917000	1919000	were to be obstructed
1919000	1921000	from the goods
1921000	1923000	or if one could derive them
1923000	1925000	only from actual effects
1925000	1927000	an ethics
1927000	1929000	of material values
1929000	1931000	does not necessarily
1931000	1933000	presuppose
1933000	1935000	empirical knowledge
1935000	1937000	because as
1937000	1939000	Scheller would show
1939000	1941000	how the material values
1941000	1943000	are not
1943000	1945000	known
1945000	1947000	through empirical knowledge
1947000	1949000	they are also a priori
1949000	1951000	meaning they are also universal
1953000	1955000	so
1955000	1957000	Scheller elevated material values
1957000	1959000	in the same level
1959000	1961000	as ideas
1961000	1963000	as formal concepts
1965000	1967000	because for Kant
1967000	1969000	you have the concepts, you have the laws
1969000	1971000	the formal laws, the moral law
1971000	1973000	universal
1973000	1975000	and the material values
1975000	1977000	they are empirical
1977000	1979000	but according to Scheller
1979000	1981000	no, the material values
1981000	1983000	are also a priori
1985000	1987000	they are not empirical
1989000	1991000	so Scheller also rejected
1991000	1993000	Kant's identification
1993000	1995000	of the a prioristic
1995000	1997000	with the rational
1997000	1999000	in the material or non formal
1999000	2001000	with the sensual or
2001000	2003000	a posteriori
2003000	2005000	because for Kant
2005000	2007000	is the rational, this is the formal
2007000	2009000	and it is a priori
2009000	2011000	the material
2011000	2013000	or non formal is
2013000	2015000	a posteriori
2015000	2017000	empirical
2017000	2019000	okay, that's the position
2019000	2021000	of Kant and Scheller
2021000	2023000	rejected that position
2023000	2025000	so why can't believe
2025000	2027000	that a material ethic must
2027000	2029000	refer to the organization
2029000	2031000	of the egotistic
2031000	2033000	crimes of human nature
2033000	2035000	in all ethical
2035000	2037000	valuation
2037000	2039000	Scheller believed
2039000	2041000	otherwise
2041000	2043000	so he refuted the claim
2043000	2045000	of Kant that only formal
2045000	2047000	ethics
2047000	2049000	avoids the fallacies
2049000	2051000	committed by non formal
2051000	2053000	or material ethics
2053000	2055000	so Scheller believed
2055000	2057000	that
2057000	2059000	this fallacies
2059000	2061000	can also be avoided
2061000	2063000	this egotistic
2063000	2065000	this egotistic valuation
2065000	2067000	can also be
2067000	2069000	avoided by
2069000	2071000	non formal
2071000	2073000	or material ethics
2073000	2075000	so now the main purpose now
2075000	2077000	of Scheller
2077000	2079000	is to show that an ethic
2079000	2081000	of material values
2081000	2083000	which Kant rejected
2083000	2085000	by no means
2085000	2087000	leads to the conclusion
2087000	2089000	rich rich rich
2089000	2091000	by Kant
2091000	2093000	he developed an ethical
2093000	2095000	theory based on the inside
2095000	2097000	that material values
2097000	2099000	and their hierarchical
2099000	2101000	order
2101000	2103000	form a realm
2103000	2105000	of material
2105000	2107000	aprioristic data
2107000	2109000	which is disclosed to us
2109000	2111000	by emotional intuition
2115000	2117000	so if the formal
2117000	2119000	if the concepts
2119000	2121000	ideas
2121000	2123000	are revealed to us by reason
2123000	2125000	the values
2125000	2127000	are revealed to us
2127000	2129000	by way of emotional intuition
2129000	2131000	and Scheller also wanted
2131000	2133000	to show
2133000	2135000	that the dichotomy between the sensible
2135000	2137000	and the intelligible
2137000	2139000	or between the intelligible
2139000	2141000	and the emotional
2141000	2143000	when it comes to knowledge
2143000	2145000	is not exhaustive
2145000	2147000	because
2147000	2149000	there is a separate realm
2149000	2151000	between the senses and the intellect
2151000	2153000	there is something
2153000	2155000	between what is perceived
2155000	2157000	by the senses
2157000	2159000	and what is taught by reason
2161000	2163000	and this separate realm
2163000	2165000	is the realm of feelings
2165000	2167000	that which is
2167000	2169000	felt
2169000	2171000	the realm of the emotion
2171000	2173000	so senses
2173000	2175000	thought
2175000	2177000	or intellect
2177000	2179000	thinks
2179000	2181000	the emotions
2181000	2183000	feel
2185000	2187000	so
2187000	2189000	he develop his ethics based on the
2189000	2191000	emotions
2191000	2193000	based on what is felt
2193000	2195000	and what is felt is the value
2195000	2197000	so the value
2197000	2199000	is
2199000	2201000	the intentional object of our
2201000	2203000	emotion
2203000	2205000	or of our feelings
2205000	2207000	and this is where phenomenology
2207000	2209000	would come in
2209000	2211000	because just like Pusser
2211000	2213000	who develop the idea
2213000	2215000	that the intentional
2215000	2217000	objects
2217000	2219000	are the intentional
2219000	2221000	objects
2221000	2223000	the ados
2223000	2225000	are the essential
2225000	2227000	or the intentional objects of our consciousness
2227000	2229000	for Scheller
2229000	2231000	the values are the intentional objects
2231000	2233000	of our emotions
2233000	2235000	so now let's discuss
2235000	2237000	the nature of values
2239000	2241000	so through the phenomenological
2241000	2243000	approach to ethics into values in general
2243000	2245000	Scheller
2245000	2247000	hope to make the theory of values
2247000	2249000	impervious
2249000	2251000	in the criticisms
2251000	2253000	of relativism
2253000	2255000	in of the behavioral sciences
2255000	2257000	he wanted this theory
2257000	2259000	this
2259000	2261000	theory of values
2261000	2263000	immune
2263000	2265000	from the criticisms
2265000	2267000	of Kant
2267000	2269000	so according to him
2269000	2271000	many emotions have objective
2271000	2273000	referents
2273000	2275000	meaning intentional objects
2275000	2277000	he stressed that the belief
2277000	2279000	that emotions are purely subjective
2279000	2281000	states of consciousness
2281000	2283000	is based on an
2283000	2285000	erroneous description
2285000	2287000	or misanalysis
2287000	2289000	or misunderstanding
2289000	2291000	of their structure
2291000	2293000	people believe that emotion
2293000	2295000	is just a subjective
2297000	2299000	emotional state
2299000	2301000	or states of consciousness
2301000	2303000	now according to Scheller
2303000	2305000	although some moods
2305000	2307000	do not go beyond themselves
2309000	2311000	the experience of a value
2311000	2313000	is usually an intentional
2313000	2315000	act
2315000	2317000	which is parallel to perception
2317000	2319000	and conception of ideas
2321000	2323000	so in perception
2323000	2325000	we have the material object
2327000	2329000	in conception we have the ideas
2329000	2331000	in the emotion
2331000	2333000	we have the values
2333000	2335000	so the object
2335000	2337000	like for example
2337000	2339000	the feeling of joy
2339000	2341000	about a good news
2341000	2343000	is an experience which have
2343000	2345000	subjective and objective points
2347000	2349000	so joy is not just a subjective
2349000	2351000	state of consciousness
2351000	2353000	because there is an objective point
2353000	2355000	to this emotion
2357000	2359000	the object
2359000	2361000	of that experience is seen
2361000	2363000	as a good thing
2363000	2365000	which insensates a value
2367000	2369000	so for example
2369000	2371000	we have the feeling of joy
2371000	2373000	because
2373000	2375000	of the good news
2375000	2377000	what is the good news
2377000	2379000	why is it a good news
2381000	2383000	so the news is something good
2383000	2385000	because it insensates
2385000	2387000	a value
2387000	2389000	and the value
2389000	2391000	is the objective point
2391000	2393000	of your emotional or subjective state
2393000	2395000	so
2397000	2399000	the emotion
2399000	2401000	or the feeling of joy insensates
2401000	2403000	a value
2403000	2405000	so it's not only the good news
2405000	2407000	that will
2407000	2409000	insensate that particular value
2413000	2415000	so therefore according to Scheller
2415000	2417000	there is no such a thing as
2417000	2419000	a cognitive emotions
2419000	2421000	in that point to certain real objects
2421000	2423000	cognitive emotions
2423000	2425000	and of course
2425000	2427000	this cognitive emotion
2427000	2429000	is not something that is congruent
2429000	2431000	to the cognitive reason
2431000	2433000	going back to
2433000	2435000	the order amoris or logic of the heart
2435000	2437000	that he borrowed from Blaise Pascal
2439000	2441000	so again in the Darformalismos
2441000	2443000	he disagreed with Kant's
2443000	2445000	identification of the
2445000	2447000	a priori with reason
2447000	2449000	for Scheller
2449000	2451000	the a priori
2451000	2453000	extends far beyond
2453000	2455000	the uses of reason
2455000	2457000	and therefore included
2457000	2459000	feeling
2459000	2461000	the feeling nature of mind
2461000	2463000	within the constitution
2463000	2465000	of the mind
2465000	2467000	and posited what he called
2467000	2469000	emotional a priori
2469000	2471000	so the mind
2471000	2473000	is not only
2473000	2475000	formal or rational
2475000	2477000	the mind
2477000	2479000	emotional component
2481000	2483000	so that's where he said
2483000	2485000	it's connected to what
2485000	2487000	we have already mentioned
2487000	2489000	that what one ought to do
2489000	2491000	which is
2491000	2493000	the a priori
2493000	2495000	of reason
2495000	2497000	presupposes the feeling
2497000	2499000	of the value of one ought to be
2499000	2501000	done that's the emotional
2501000	2503000	a priori
2503000	2505000	so there is the formal a priori
2505000	2507000	of duty
2507000	2509000	and there is the emotional
2509000	2511000	a priori of the value
2511000	2513000	of that duty
2515000	2517000	alright now let's move
2517000	2519000	on to the order amoris
2519000	2521000	because this is one
2521000	2523000	very important concept
2523000	2525000	of Mark Scheller
2525000	2527000	and this is where he
2527000	2529000	described how we
2529000	2531000	recognize
2531000	2533000	the value
2533000	2535000	as a priori
2535000	2537000	so values are a priori
2537000	2539000	and these are
2539000	2541000	anchored on our
2541000	2543000	our order amoris
2543000	2545000	or the order
2545000	2547000	or logic of the heart
2547000	2549000	and again as we've said
2549000	2551000	this is not something that is
2551000	2553000	congruent to the order
2553000	2555000	of reason to the formal
2555000	2557000	part
2557000	2559000	of our mind
2559000	2561000	and again as we've said
2561000	2563000	this is what he
2563000	2565000	borrowed from
2565000	2567000	according to this view
2567000	2569000	moral acts
2569000	2571000	or deeds
2571000	2573000	are individual
2573000	2575000	and they originate
2575000	2577000	in our own pre-rational
2577000	2579000	prefering of values
2579000	2581000	now what is this
2581000	2583000	pre-rational prefering of values
2583000	2585000	in the ordinary sense
2585000	2587000	when we say prefering
2587000	2589000	or preference
2589000	2591000	using something
2591000	2593000	over something else
2593000	2595000	but in Scheller's
2595000	2597000	terminology
2597000	2599000	when you say prefering
2599000	2601000	it pertains to
2601000	2603000	a pre-rational act
2603000	2605000	it's an act
2605000	2607000	that happens
2607000	2609000	prior to making a rational
2609000	2611000	or deliberate
2611000	2613000	choice
2613000	2615000	between one
2615000	2617000	between two or more
2617000	2619000	different things
2619000	2621000	so
2621000	2623000	when we make a decision
2623000	2625000	or a rational decision
2625000	2627000	we analyze
2627000	2629000	which one will I choose
2629000	2631000	we deliberate
2633000	2635000	we enumerate
2635000	2637000	we think of several reasons
2637000	2639000	why choose this
2639000	2641000	but in pre-rational
2641000	2643000	prefering before you can
2643000	2645000	even think of
2645000	2647000	these things
2647000	2649000	before you can even deliberate
2649000	2651000	you already have certain tendency
2651000	2653000	you already
2653000	2655000	lean towards something
2655000	2657000	before you can even make a choice
2659000	2661000	so this leaning towards
2661000	2663000	something
2663000	2665000	has already taken place
2665000	2667000	in us even before
2667000	2669000	we make a choice
2669000	2671000	so we may
2671000	2673000	for example lean towards
2673000	2675000	contemporary music
2675000	2677000	over classical music
2677000	2679000	before we can even think of
2679000	2681000	why do we like
2681000	2683000	contemporary music
2683000	2685000	over classical music
2685000	2687000	or we may prefer
2687000	2689000	a particular color
2689000	2691000	we prefer say
2691000	2693000	color blue
2693000	2695000	over some other colors
2695000	2697000	why is that
2697000	2699000	well
2699000	2701000	you can think later on
2701000	2703000	we deliberate
2703000	2705000	choice
2705000	2707000	I want blue because
2707000	2709000	because of this and that
2709000	2711000	or I want red because of this and that
2711000	2713000	but even before you do that
2713000	2715000	you already have some leaning towards something
2717000	2719000	so in such cases
2719000	2721000	we inadvertently
2721000	2723000	experience a drift
2723000	2725000	or propensity towards something
2725000	2727000	rather than something else
2727000	2729000	so there is
2729000	2731000	pre-rational preferring of
2731000	2733000	contemporary music over
2733000	2735000	classical music
2735000	2737000	or pre-rational preferring
2737000	2739000	of certain colors
2739000	2741000	over other colors
2741000	2743000	now
2743000	2745000	this leaning towards something
2745000	2747000	may accompany us for a long time
2747000	2749000	or even for our entire life
2749000	2751000	or it may take
2751000	2753000	different directions during
2753000	2755000	our middle age
2755000	2757000	when we grow old
2757000	2759000	now another parallelism
2759000	2761000	in our
2761000	2763000	visual perception
2763000	2765000	we do not choose to see it alive
2765000	2767000	that makes
2767000	2769000	things visible to us
2769000	2771000	rather our sense of sight
2773000	2775000	possesses a pre-visual
2775000	2777000	tendency
2777000	2779000	or trend towards life
2779000	2781000	towards
2781000	2783000	what is lit up or bright
2783000	2785000	there is
2785000	2787000	a pre-visual preference
2787000	2789000	to light
2789000	2791000	rather than darkness
2793000	2795000	that's pre-visual
2795000	2797000	and there is also
2797000	2799000	pre-rational
2799000	2801000	so love is in the sense
2801000	2803000	analogous to light
2803000	2805000	love has an intrinsic
2805000	2807000	bent towards
2807000	2809000	other higher values
2809000	2811000	than those that were merely given to us
2811000	2813000	no matter whether
2813000	2815000	or not love will realize them
2819000	2821000	so we prefer
2821000	2823000	certain values over other values
2825000	2827000	now
2827000	2829000	the more experience lies
2829000	2831000	in the call of the hour
2831000	2833000	in which the a priori ranking
2833000	2835000	of values becomes
2835000	2837000	individually apparent
2837000	2839000	no matter how much the order of more
2839000	2841000	may be distorted by feelings
2841000	2843000	or other passions
2843000	2845000	in other words
2845000	2847000	there is already a
2847000	2849000	pre or an a priori ranking
2849000	2851000	of values
2851000	2853000	meaning
2853000	2855000	it is not the person
2855000	2857000	who ranks these values
2857000	2859000	but values themselves are already
2859000	2861000	ranked
2861000	2863000	there is an objective ranking
2863000	2865000	of values
2865000	2867000	and these values
2867000	2869000	are as follows
2869000	2871000	value of the senses
2871000	2873000	meaning the value of
2873000	2875000	what is pleasant or unpleasant
2875000	2877000	or maybe
2877000	2879000	what is enjoyable or not enjoyable
2879000	2881000	in the physical
2881000	2883000	or bodily sense
2883000	2885000	the value of life
2885000	2887000	whether something is noble
2887000	2889000	or common
2889000	2891000	the value of the spirit
2891000	2893000	which is divided into two
2893000	2895000	the aesthetic values of ugly and beautiful
2895000	2897000	or the value of knowledge
2897000	2899000	and then
2899000	2901000	the value of
2901000	2903000	religion or the religious values
2903000	2905000	the value of the holy and unholy
2907000	2909000	so if you are going to rank them
2909000	2911000	in ascending order
2911000	2913000	it will follow this
2913000	2915000	the lowest would be the value
2915000	2917000	of bodily comfort
2917000	2919000	or the pleasure values
2919000	2921000	and then higher
2921000	2923000	than the bodily comfort
2923000	2925000	the value of the senses
2925000	2927000	would be the pragmatic values of usefulness
2929000	2931000	these two lower ranks of values
2931000	2933000	are either manageable
2933000	2935000	or calculable and divisible
2935000	2937000	it's as if cultivation of them
2937000	2939000	as happens in modern society
2939000	2941000	this unites people
2941000	2943000	so this is the lower value
2943000	2945000	the higher value is
2945000	2947000	the value
2947000	2949000	that contains life values
2951000	2953000	they belong to what is noble
2953000	2955000	and life values
2955000	2957000	but
2957000	2959000	life values pertain at the power
2959000	2961000	only with persons
2961000	2963000	and then the highest
2963000	2965000	values
2965000	2967000	the two highest value ranks
2967000	2969000	are experienced exclusively
2969000	2971000	in human personal feelings
2971000	2973000	the value of
2973000	2975000	the spirit and the religious
2975000	2977000	values
2977000	2979000	so here the rank of
2979000	2981000	mental values of
2981000	2983000	justice, beauty
2983000	2985000	and the cognition of truth
2985000	2987000	so ranking of values
2987000	2989000	and then the highest of the value
2989000	2991000	would be
2991000	2993000	the value of
2993000	2995000	the religious feelings
2995000	2997000	the holy or the unholy
2997000	2999000	so fourth seller
2999000	3001000	the values are already
3001000	3003000	ranked
3003000	3005000	there is an objective
3005000	3007000	ranking of values
3007000	3009000	no matter how
3009000	3011000	our feelings
3011000	3013000	or our resentment
3013000	3015000	or hate
3015000	3017000	may distort them
3017000	3019000	some people who are resentful
3019000	3021000	may think
3021000	3023000	of the value of beauty
3023000	3025000	as lower
3025000	3027000	as lower than
3027000	3029000	for example the value of
3031000	3033000	say
3033000	3035000	usefulness
3035000	3037000	or
3037000	3039000	pleasurable
3039000	3041000	we may say
3041000	3043000	justice
3043000	3045000	is one of the highest
3045000	3047000	values but some people will say
3047000	3049000	well the value of justice is
3049000	3051000	lower than the value
3051000	3053000	for example of
3053000	3055000	pleasure or comfort
3057000	3059000	now i will stop there
3059000	3061000	if you have some questions
3066000	3068000	yes Alexis go ahead
3068000	3070000	Doc may randin po ba siyang concept
3070000	3072000	ng
3072000	3074000	parang kai-kant na logiver
3074000	3075000	kasi po di ba sabi po ninyo
3075000	3077000	nakarank na po yung
3077000	3079000	mga values
3079000	3081000	si na po yung nag rank po ng mga values
3081000	3083000	noyan doc
3087000	3089000	if you think of the logiver
3089000	3091000	in the context or same
3091000	3093000	as Kant
3093000	3095000	there is this logiver
3095000	3097000	it's simply that
3097000	3099000	in reality there is this
3099000	3101000	values
3103000	3105000	so even Kant does not say
3105000	3107000	that the values are rank accordingly
3107000	3109000	based on the logiver
3109000	3111000	Kant only say that there is the moral law
3111000	3113000	and this moral law
3113000	3115000	is the highest of the laws
3115000	3117000	but as to the lower values
3117000	3119000	does not say where it came from
3119000	3121000	it's part of reality
3124000	3126000	the values
3126000	3128000	values are
3128000	3130000	we just not say that
3130000	3132000	values are created
3132000	3134000	values are there
3134000	3136000	they are part of our human experience
3138000	3140000	you can only stress that as far as well
3140000	3142000	because humans
3142000	3144000	are created
3144000	3146000	and part of his existence are the values
3146000	3148000	then the values must also be created
3148000	3150000	by a higher being
3150000	3152000	but cellar would not say that
3153000	3155000	it's part of our experience
3155000	3157000	it's part of the human reality
3162000	3164000	okay, any questions?
3166000	3168000	oh, let me pull out it
3170000	3172000	since there is already a pre-establish
3172000	3174000	of values and values
3174000	3176000	as already rank
3176000	3178000	because it means values are not
3179000	3181000	no
3182000	3184000	it's not about
3184000	3186000	immoral or being moral
3188000	3190000	this is not
3190000	3192000	this is not an ethics
3192000	3194000	this is not an ethics that talks about
3194000	3196000	what is moral or immoral
3196000	3198000	okay
3198000	3200000	na
3206000	3208000	na
3208000	3210000	you are mixing things
3210000	3212000	please up
3216000	3218000	it's not talking of
3218000	3220000	moral or immoral here
3220000	3222000	of course
3222000	3224000	it talks about evil
3224000	3226000	when later on you're going to see
3226000	3228000	that if you
3228000	3230000	evil would be the preference
3230000	3232000	for a lower value
3232000	3234000	okay
3234000	3236000	but it's not talking of the
3236000	3238000	of immoral
3238000	3240000	in the
3242000	3244000	in the Christian sense of being immoral
3244000	3246000	that it's a sin
3246000	3248000	it's evil
3248000	3250000	meaning if there is
3250000	3252000	no congruence
3256000	3258000	if our
3260000	3262000	if our ranking of values
3262000	3264000	is not congruent, is not in conformity
3264000	3266000	with
3268000	3270000	with the ranking of values
3270000	3272000	then there's something evil in it
3272000	3274000	there's something negative in it
3274000	3276000	but not in the
3276000	3278000	in the Christian sense of being a sin
3280000	3282000	okay, other questions?
3286000	3288000	okay
3290000	3292000	okay, no more
3292000	3294000	okay
3316000	3318000	na you have one minute to answer
3318000	3320000	if you are listening to my lecture
3322000	3324000	okay
3338000	3340000	you have one minute to reply
3340000	3342000	if you don't reply, you have one minute
3342000	3344000	that means you are not following my discussion
3352000	3354000	okay
3382000	3384000	may
3386000	3388000	may kindly take note
3388000	3390000	take note of those who replied
3392000	3394000	okay, thank you
3394000	3396000	alright, so
3396000	3398000	that's my way of checking
3398000	3400000	if you are listening to my discussion
3400000	3402000	if you are still here or you just
3402000	3404000	plug in
3404000	3406000	we know some people are dais
3406000	3408000	okay
3410000	3412000	but 37
3416000	3418000	alright, let's continue
3420000	3422000	values as intentional objects
3422000	3424000	of feelings
3424000	3426000	so again, we recall
3426000	3428000	the notion
3428000	3430000	of intentional objects of consciousness
3430000	3432000	of who's heart
3432000	3434000	okay
3434000	3436000	consciousness is always consciousness of something
3436000	3438000	and
3440000	3442000	the consciousness
3442000	3444000	has intentional objects
3446000	3448000	now, Sheller adopted this thesis
3448000	3450000	of
3450000	3452000	who's heart
3452000	3454000	okay, that the ideal objects
3454000	3456000	of knowledge
3456000	3458000	are independent of the knowing subject
3458000	3460000	so the ideal objects
3460000	3462000	of knowledge, these are the intentional
3462000	3464000	objects of our consciousness
3464000	3466000	so
3466000	3468000	Sheller adopted this idea
3468000	3470000	and he applied this
3470000	3472000	to his
3472000	3474000	disclosure of the realm of values
3474000	3476000	just as there are
3476000	3478000	intentional objects of knowledge
3478000	3480000	the ideal objects of knowledge
3480000	3482000	he contended
3482000	3484000	that there are also intentional objects
3484000	3486000	of feelings
3486000	3488000	and what are these intentional objects of feelings
3488000	3490000	the values
3490000	3492000	right
3492000	3494000	so the
3494000	3496000	ideal objects of knowledge are a priori
3498000	3500000	and the values are also
3500000	3502000	a priori
3502000	3504000	so what are values
3504000	3506000	these are particular class of ideal
3506000	3508000	objects
3508000	3510000	which are objective, eternal
3510000	3512000	and immutable
3512000	3514000	so values are
3514000	3516000	given to us as intentional
3516000	3518000	objects of our feelings
3518000	3520000	just as colors
3520000	3522000	are
3522000	3524000	the objects of our
3524000	3526000	visual perception
3528000	3530000	so concepts
3530000	3532000	are objects of our thoughts
3536000	3538000	colors and the other
3538000	3540000	material qualities
3540000	3542000	are the objects of our senses
3544000	3546000	values
3546000	3548000	are the objects of our feelings
3550000	3552000	and just like
3552000	3554000	the concepts
3554000	3556000	they are objective
3556000	3558000	eternal
3558000	3560000	and immutable
3560000	3562000	so
3562000	3564000	the modes in which
3564000	3566000	values are knowable to us
3566000	3568000	are beyond the grasp
3568000	3570000	of the intellect
3570000	3572000	so the intellect grasp
3572000	3574000	our grasp
3574000	3576000	as the
3576000	3578000	the essence
3578000	3580000	for example
3580000	3582000	the ideas
3584000	3586000	the values
3586000	3588000	are grasped by our feelings
3590000	3592000	how our feelings are grasped
3592000	3594000	by our emotion
3594000	3596000	is beyond
3596000	3598000	the understanding
3598000	3600000	of the intellect or reason
3600000	3602000	it has its own reason
3602000	3604000	that reason cannot understand
3606000	3608000	so according to Scheller
3608000	3610000	just as
3610000	3612000	the ear
3612000	3614000	is blind
3614000	3616000	to color
3618000	3620000	so the intellect
3620000	3622000	is blind to
3622000	3624000	the values
3626000	3628000	so the emotional aspects of the mind
3628000	3630000	feelings
3630000	3632000	preferring
3632000	3634000	loving, hating, willing
3634000	3636000	because these are
3636000	3638000	the emotional acts
3640000	3642000	the mind has its own acts
3642000	3644000	the intellect rather
3644000	3646000	the intellect has its own acts
3646000	3648000	apprehension, judgment
3648000	3650000	analyzing, critiquing
3650000	3652000	disputing, et cetera
3652000	3654000	the emotional aspects of our minds
3654000	3656000	have also its own acts
3656000	3658000	feeling, preparing, loving
3658000	3660000	hating, willing
3660000	3662000	and so on
3662000	3664000	and they are not founded upon cognition
3664000	3666000	but are of an
3666000	3668000	apprehensive character
3668000	3670000	in our emotional feeling
3670000	3672000	we feel something
3672000	3674000	for example
3674000	3676000	this or that particular value quality
3678000	3680000	why do we prefer this
3680000	3682000	why do we feel for this
3682000	3684000	for Scheller
3684000	3686000	we prefer
3686000	3688000	our emotion has its own reason
3688000	3690000	but
3690000	3692000	reason, the intellect
3692000	3694000	cannot explain why we prefer this
3696000	3698000	of course later on you can have
3698000	3700000	your own rational
3700000	3702000	deliberation why you prefer
3702000	3704000	contemporary music
3704000	3706000	over classical music
3708000	3710000	so according to Scheller
3710000	3712000	there is a very rational preferring of this
3712000	3714000	that cannot be explained by reason
3716000	3718000	so intentional objects
3718000	3720000	intentional
3720000	3722000	feeling functions
3722000	3724000	do not need the intermediary
3724000	3726000	of the objectifying acts of the intellect
3726000	3728000	like representing
3728000	3730000	and judging or analysis
3732000	3734000	in order to come into immediate contact
3734000	3736000	with their objects
3736000	3738000	values for example as agreeable
3738000	3740000	charming
3740000	3742000	lovely, friendly, et cetera
3742000	3744000	in principle
3744000	3746000	are accessible to me
3746000	3748000	without my having
3748000	3750000	to represent them
3750000	3752000	as properties belonging to
3752000	3754000	things or men
3754000	3756000	values are not conceptual terms
3756000	3758000	which find their fulfillment
3758000	3760000	in the common properties
3760000	3762000	of things which are the
3762000	3764000	bearers of these values
3764000	3766000	for example when you say
3766000	3768000	what is
3768000	3770000	a house
3770000	3772000	what is your idea of
3772000	3774000	an institution
3774000	3776000	what is your idea
3776000	3778000	of beauty
3778000	3780000	now when you think of
3780000	3782000	your idea of beauty then you are going to
3782000	3784000	come up with certain common characteristics
3786000	3788000	but why do you
3788000	3790000	find this thing beautiful
3792000	3794000	can you give
3794000	3796000	an enumerable common properties
3796000	3798000	of things according to Scheller when you do that
3798000	3800000	sometimes you end up
3800000	3802000	empty-handed
3802000	3804000	because when you say
3804000	3806000	I find this charming
3808000	3810000	and then I also find this thing charming
3810000	3812000	and then I also find this charming
3812000	3814000	but when you look at these things
3814000	3816000	they have nothing in common
3820000	3822000	why do you consider this
3822000	3824000	to be agreeable
3824000	3826000	and this is agreeable also
3826000	3828000	why do you have that feeling
3828000	3830000	you cannot
3830000	3832000	give a reason because
3832000	3834000	it is beyond
3834000	3836000	reason
3836000	3838000	beyond reason
3838000	3840000	meaning it is not
3840000	3842000	within the realm of
3842000	3844000	reason
3844000	3846000	so according to Scheller
3846000	3848000	this is shown by the simple
3848000	3850000	fact that it's time we attempt
3850000	3852000	to determine such common
3852000	3854000	properties
3854000	3856000	of what is charming to us
3856000	3858000	or lovely or friendly to us
3858000	3860000	we always end up empty
3860000	3862000	and dead
3862000	3864000	even the habitual
3864000	3866000	or even the ethical values
3866000	3868000	or aesthetic values like normal, courageous
3868000	3870000	and as beautiful
3870000	3872000	becomes accessible
3872000	3874000	not through a number of defined characteristics
3876000	3878000	I find this
3878000	3880000	I find this beautiful
3880000	3882000	I find this accessible
3882000	3884000	this is normal
3886000	3888000	so that's the point of Scheller
3888000	3890000	of course other philosophers
3890000	3892000	are critical of this position
3892000	3894000	but
3894000	3896000	here's a point here also
3896000	3898000	so values are independent
3898000	3900000	of our subjective emotional states
3900000	3902000	what is our subjective emotional states
3904000	3906000	like for example when you are sad
3906000	3908000	sadness
3908000	3910000	is an emotional state
3912000	3914000	but the sadness I feel may involve
3914000	3916000	in me various emotional sentiments
3918000	3920000	so being brokenhearted, being defiant
3920000	3922000	being composed, jatra
3922000	3924000	these are our subjective emotional states
3926000	3928000	now the feeling of sadness remains
3930000	3932000	while my subjective emotional state
3932000	3934000	may change
3934000	3936000	at one point I'm sad so I become brokenhearted
3936000	3938000	or I am defiant
3938000	3940000	or yeah I may be sad
3940000	3942000	but I'm sad composed
3944000	3946000	moreover the causes
3946000	3948000	must not be confused with emotional
3948000	3950000	with intentional object
3950000	3952000	the question for example
3952000	3954000	why am I angry
3954000	3956000	is entirely different
3956000	3958000	from what do I feel
3960000	3962000	so what do I feel
3962000	3964000	is your subjective states
3966000	3968000	why am I angry
3968000	3970000	my anger
3970000	3972000	anger is the emotion
3972000	3974000	and what is the object of this anger
3976000	3978000	it may be something else
3980000	3982000	that represents
3982000	3984000	a particular value
3986000	3988000	so I am angry because
3990000	3992000	I was defiant
3994000	3996000	okay
3996000	3998000	my instructions were not followed
4002000	4004000	okay
4004000	4006000	so not following instruction causes me to be angry
4006000	4008000	but what is it in
4008000	4010000	this not following
4010000	4012000	following my order that made me angry
4016000	4018000	so not obeying instruction
4018000	4020000	not following represents a particular value
4020000	4022000	that makes me angry
4022000	4024000	that becomes the object of my anger
4026000	4028000	okay
4028000	4030000	because
4030000	4032000	I am going to be angry
4032000	4034000	not only because somebody
4034000	4036000	defied me
4036000	4038000	or somebody did not follow
4038000	4040000	my instruction
4042000	4044000	I may also be angry because somebody betrayed me
4046000	4048000	so betrayal
4050000	4052000	this obedience
4052000	4054000	they represent a particular value
4054000	4056000	which is the object of my anger
4060000	4062000	so a value phenomena
4062000	4064000	as a value phenomena
4064000	4066000	values are true objects
4066000	4068000	and they are different from all states
4068000	4070000	of feelings
4070000	4072000	there is a difference between
4072000	4074000	feeling of sadness
4074000	4076000	feeling of anger
4078000	4080000	and the values
4080000	4082000	that are the objects of my
4082000	4084000	anger or of my sadness
4086000	4088000	now
4088000	4090000	values are independent
4090000	4092000	of their bearers or carriers
4092000	4094000	what is this bearer or carriers
4094000	4096000	these are things or relations
4098000	4100000	that shell are collectively called the goods
4102000	4104000	the goods are units
4104000	4106000	of value qualities
4108000	4110000	which instantiates
4110000	4112000	objectifies
4112000	4114000	the value in the real world
4116000	4118000	the value qualities do not change
4118000	4120000	when these goods
4120000	4122000	when these bearers
4122000	4124000	change
4124000	4126000	so for example
4126000	4128000	let's use an analogy
4128000	4130000	let's talk about the color
4130000	4132000	this is the color blue
4136000	4138000	now thus the color blue
4138000	4140000	turns red
4140000	4142000	when
4142000	4144000	an object that is blue
4144000	4146000	becomes red
4146000	4148000	like for example
4150000	4152000	a dress
4154000	4156000	so dress
4156000	4158000	bears
4158000	4160000	or carries
4160000	4162000	the value bears the color
4162000	4164000	so
4166000	4168000	if this dress
4168000	4170000	which instantiates
4170000	4172000	the color blue
4172000	4174000	becomes red
4174000	4176000	so it's now a red dress
4176000	4178000	thus the color blue
4178000	4180000	change into red
4180000	4182000	no
4182000	4184000	the color blue
4184000	4186000	remains blue
4186000	4188000	the color red
4188000	4190000	remains red
4190000	4192000	but the dress which instantiates
4192000	4194000	which is the carrier
4194000	4196000	or the bearer
4196000	4198000	of the colors
4198000	4200000	have changed
4200000	4202000	it now carries a different color
4204000	4206000	so it's not true
4206000	4208000	that values are affected
4208000	4210000	by their order
4210000	4212000	when their bearers
4212000	4214000	change in value
4214000	4216000	food is still food
4216000	4218000	poison is still poison
4218000	4220000	the value of friendship does not change
4220000	4222000	even when your friend
4222000	4224000	changes
4228000	4230000	so this person
4230000	4232000	who carries the value of friendship
4232000	4234000	becomes your enemy
4234000	4236000	he now instantiates
4236000	4238000	not the value of friendship
4240000	4242000	he now instantiates the value of an enemy
4242000	4244000	friendship
4244000	4246000	did not turn into
4247000	4249000	being unfriendly
4253000	4255000	so goods are value
4255000	4257000	things
4257000	4259000	they are bearers of value
4260000	4262000	for example
4262000	4264000	when you go
4264000	4266000	go inside the church
4267000	4269000	see the altar
4270000	4272000	the altar may carry
4272000	4274000	or may bear certain values
4274000	4276000	may have
4276000	4278000	aesthetic value
4278000	4280000	because it's very beautiful
4280000	4282000	or it may also bear
4282000	4284000	the value of the holy
4286000	4288000	so the altar is just a bearer of value
4290000	4292000	it can instantiate
4292000	4294000	the value of
4294000	4296000	beautiful
4296000	4298000	for the value of the holy
4300000	4302000	so it's like saying
4302000	4304000	the absence of light
4304000	4306000	is not
4306000	4308000	saying darkness
4308000	4310000	para pang ganun
4310000	4312000	what do you mean?
4312000	4314000	parang
4314000	4316000	mayapuban, ayusin kumunayin tanong
4316000	4318000	ok
4318000	4320000	other questions?
4332000	4334000	ok, let's read
4336000	4338000	the a prioristic structure of values
4340000	4342000	so
4342000	4344000	sheller made a distinction between
4344000	4346000	the realm of values
4346000	4348000	and the realm of goods
4350000	4352000	and his assertion that values are independent
4352000	4354000	of the bearers of values
4354000	4356000	affirmed the correctness of Kant's view
4356000	4358000	that a philosophical theory of values
4358000	4360000	or ethics or even aesthetics
4360000	4362000	must not presuppose things
4362000	4364000	or goods
4364000	4366000	they agree on this
4366000	4368000	they agree on this sense
4368000	4370000	on this point
4370000	4372000	that there is a distinction
4372000	4374000	between the realm of values
4374000	4376000	and the realm of goods
4376000	4378000	that instantiate them
4380000	4382000	so for example a particular person
4382000	4384000	may instantiate several values
4384000	4386000	the values of friendship
4386000	4388000	the values of courage
4388000	4390000	the values of health
4390000	4392000	the values of holy
4392000	4394000	the values of intelligence
4394000	4396000	so there is some
4396000	4398000	independence between the realm of values
4398000	4400000	and the realm of goods that instantiate them
4404000	4406000	so it does not mean that for example
4406000	4408000	the value of the holy
4408000	4410000	turns to be unholy when
4410000	4412000	a holy person becomes unholy
4412000	4414000	it's just that
4414000	4416000	that person no longer instantates
4416000	4418000	the value of the holy
4420000	4422000	so that's the a priori
4422000	4424000	thing about
4424000	4426000	this realm of values
4432000	4434000	now
4434000	4436000	the a prioristic relation
4436000	4438000	of values
4438000	4440000	all values are
4440000	4442000	either positive or negative
4442000	4444000	okay
4444000	4446000	there's no such thing as
4446000	4448000	a neutral
4448000	4450000	value
4450000	4452000	okay
4452000	4454000	there's always a value
4454000	4456000	there's always a quality
4456000	4458000	of worth
4458000	4460000	positive or negative
4460000	4462000	the existence
4462000	4464000	of a positive value
4464000	4466000	is in itself
4466000	4468000	positive
4468000	4470000	the existence of holiness is positive
4470000	4472000	the nonexistence
4472000	4474000	of a negative value
4474000	4476000	is also positive
4478000	4480000	so if
4480000	4482000	for example chaos
4482000	4484000	chaos is a negative value
4484000	4486000	there's no chaos
4486000	4488000	that's something positive
4490000	4492000	the nonexistence of positive value
4492000	4494000	and the existence of a negative value
4494000	4496000	is a negative value
4500000	4502000	so
4502000	4504000	nobody's holy
4504000	4506000	there's no holiness
4508000	4510000	that's a negative value
4512000	4514000	it's impossible to evaluate
4514000	4516000	the same value simultaneously
4516000	4518000	as both negative and positive
4520000	4522000	a barrier of value
4522000	4524000	at object
4524000	4526000	may instantiate two values
4526000	4528000	okay
4528000	4530000	like for example a person
4530000	4532000	may instantiate both
4532000	4534000	friendship
4534000	4536000	okay
4536000	4538000	or love or instantiate hate
4538000	4540000	but love and hate
4540000	4542000	cannot be
4542000	4544000	simultaneous
4544000	4546000	as a value
4546000	4548000	good is the value attached
4548000	4550000	to the realization of a positive or a higher value
4552000	4554000	evil
4554000	4556000	the value attached to the realization
4556000	4558000	of a negative or a lower value
4562000	4564000	now we're not saying that
4564000	4566000	that is immoral in the Christian sense
4568000	4570000	so this is in the actual logical
4570000	4572000	sense
4572000	4574000	now
4574000	4576000	we've already mentioned about the hierarchical
4576000	4578000	order of values
4578000	4580000	values constitute
4580000	4582000	a special domain
4582000	4584000	with their own distinct relation
4584000	4586000	and correlation
4586000	4588000	and among these
4588000	4590000	there is an order or rank
4590000	4592000	independent of the realm
4592000	4594000	of values
4594000	4596000	so we have already talked about
4596000	4598000	the hierarchy of these values
4598000	4600000	all values are
4600000	4602000	non-formal qualities of contents
4602000	4604000	possessing a determined order
4604000	4606000	of ranks
4606000	4608000	with respect to higher or lower
4608000	4610000	in this order
4610000	4612000	independent
4612000	4614000	of the form of being into its values
4614000	4616000	and terminating
4616000	4618000	the carriers of their
4618000	4620000	the carriers or bearers of these values
4620000	4622000	or the goods that instantiate this value
4622000	4624000	so again
4624000	4626000	this value model
4626000	4628000	those values reveal by
4628000	4630000	sensory feeling, by vital feeling
4630000	4632000	by the spirit
4632000	4634000	and by the holy
4634000	4636000	or holy order religious
4636000	4638000	so this is the ranking
4638000	4640000	of values of shallow
4640000	4642000	well, some people may criticize
4642000	4644000	these ranking of values
4644000	4646000	but that's how shallow
4646000	4648000	ordered
4648000	4650000	rank
4650000	4652000	these values
4652000	4654000	the next topic will be the exemplar persons
4654000	4656000	as shallow said
4656000	4658000	we need to
4658000	4660000	attain
4660000	4662000	a higher moral status
4662000	4664000	and the vehicle
4664000	4666000	for attaining a higher moral status
4666000	4668000	is an exemplar
4668000	4670000	meaning a model
4670000	4672000	so an exemplar
4672000	4674000	is an ideal
4674000	4676000	but a non-existent
4676000	4678000	model of one of the value ranks
4678000	4680000	so every value
4680000	4682000	there is
4682000	4684000	an exemplar
4684000	4686000	an ideal model
4686000	4688000	that manifest
4688000	4690000	this value
4690000	4692000	these ideal
4692000	4694000	exemplars manifest themselves
4694000	4696000	in historical role models
4696000	4698000	like for example
4698000	4700000	in Buddha, Christ
4700000	4702000	Muhammad, Hannibal
4702000	4704000	Ronaldo, Joan of Arc
4704000	4706000	et cetera
4706000	4708000	they are our
4708000	4710000	they are the historical
4710000	4712000	role models
4712000	4714000	they manifest the exemplars
4714000	4716000	the nature of an exemplary person
4716000	4718000	is authentic
4718000	4720000	in being exemplary
4720000	4722000	the moral effectiveness
4722000	4724000	of exemplary persons
4724000	4726000	reaches all people directly
4726000	4728000	regardless
4728000	4730000	of occupation, vocation
4730000	4732000	or interest or even culture
4732000	4734000	so the origin
4734000	4736000	of becoming good
4736000	4738000	in concrete practice
4738000	4740000	lies in the genuine exemplarity
4740000	4742000	that a particular person
4742000	4744000	exercises
4744000	4746000	on others
4746000	4748000	without deliberately wanting to do so
4748000	4750000	so for example
4750000	4752000	consider Christ
4752000	4754000	we consider
4754000	4756000	him to be exemplary
4756000	4758000	and he exercises
4758000	4760000	or he exercises a particular
4760000	4762000	influence on us
4762000	4764000	without really wanting to
4764000	4766000	be exemplary
4766000	4768000	such exemplarity occurs
4768000	4770000	in living persons
4770000	4772000	so the living persons are the
4772000	4774000	concrete manifestations
4774000	4776000	of the ideal
4776000	4778000	nonexistent exemplars
4778000	4780000	meaning nonexistent
4780000	4782000	well
4782000	4784000	in the same way that values are out there
4784000	4786000	a priori
4786000	4788000	they belong to a different realm
4788000	4790000	the exemplars also belong to a different realm
4790000	4792000	but they are manifested
4792000	4794000	in historic
4794000	4796000	in history so there are also
4796000	4798000	living persons
4798000	4800000	who manifest them
4800000	4802000	okay
4802000	4804000	but of course
4804000	4806000	only outlines of ideal persons
4806000	4808000	which are embedded in our
4808000	4810000	value feelings so in the words
4810000	4812000	for example you have your own
4812000	4814000	ideal
4814000	4816000	boyfriend or ideal
4816000	4818000	girlfriend
4818000	4820000	we exist in that
4820000	4822000	in that ideal world of yours
4822000	4824000	but that will be
4824000	4826000	some living
4826000	4828000	concrete people who would
4828000	4830000	somehow manifest
4830000	4832000	this ideal boyfriend or girlfriend
4832000	4834000	okay
4834000	4836000	so
4836000	4838000	there are empirical model persons
4838000	4840000	meaning
4840000	4842000	these are concrete living persons
4842000	4844000	so manifest our ideal
4844000	4846000	and the first concrete
4846000	4848000	empirical model persons
4848000	4850000	are our parents
4850000	4852000	so they become
4852000	4854000	the models for us
4854000	4856000	and then of course
4856000	4858000	our models
4858000	4860000	they grow meaning
4860000	4862000	okay so parents
4862000	4864000	okay
4864000	4866000	and some other people can also have
4866000	4868000	a strong exemplary effect
4868000	4870000	on us
4870000	4872000	a teacher
4872000	4874000	a president
4874000	4876000	a prince, sex man, artist
4876000	4878000	performer
4878000	4880000	an actor perhaps
4880000	4882000	depending on the particular
4882000	4884000	culture
4884000	4886000	it could be the chief of a tribe
4886000	4888000	or our ancestors
4888000	4890000	or our wise men
4890000	4892000	masters
4892000	4894000	in different cultures
4894000	4896000	but according to him
4896000	4898000	it is the exemplary holy man
4898000	4900000	who exercises
4900000	4902000	the strongest moral influence
4902000	4904000	in history
4904000	4906000	like for example Jesus
4906000	4908000	Muhammad
4908000	4910000	Buddha and only other
4910000	4912000	holy men in history
4912000	4914000	and what is common
4914000	4916000	among them is that they did not
4916000	4918000	choose
4918000	4920000	or explicitly willed
4920000	4922000	to be exemplary
4922000	4924000	nor were they chosen
4924000	4926000	by those who freely follow them
4926000	4928000	genuine role models
4928000	4930000	or model persons
4930000	4932000	almost automatically set up
4932000	4934000	moral standards for other people to follow
4934000	4936000	so people are drawn
4936000	4938000	towards them
4938000	4940000	and are motivated by their exemplaryity
4940000	4942000	no matter how deeply
4942000	4944000	or silently
4944000	4946000	they follow
4946000	4948000	these role models
4948000	4950000	or the holy
4950000	4952000	or moral persons
4952000	4954000	in contrast to the empirical model persons
4954000	4956000	an ideal model person
4956000	4958000	is only an exemplary
4958000	4960000	outline in our mind
4960000	4962000	so like your
4962000	4964000	ideal boyfriend or girlfriend
4964000	4966000	it's just there in our mind
4966000	4968000	in the same way
4968000	4970000	as values do exist
4970000	4972000	at least they are realized
4972000	4974000	in materials
4974000	4976000	or by persons
4976000	4978000	so all these absolute value types
4978000	4980000	do not exist
4980000	4982000	unless their ideal value
4982000	4984000	is realized
4984000	4986000	with concrete persons
4986000	4988000	okay
4988000	4990000	so your ideal boyfriend or girlfriend
4990000	4992000	is just there
4992000	4994000	but it will functionalize
4994000	4996000	if they are
4996000	4998000	you have some concrete person
4998000	5000000	to embody them
5000000	5002000	so according to Scheller
5002000	5004000	these ideal outlines should functionalize themselves
5004000	5006000	with concrete person
5006000	5008000	now
5008000	5010000	based on the
5010000	5012000	values there are five
5012000	5014000	ideal moral person types
5016000	5018000	the ideal personifications
5018000	5020000	of the aforementioned
5020000	5022000	value ranks
5022000	5024000	so they are the highest
5024000	5026000	would be the ideal saint
5026000	5028000	then the ideal genius
5028000	5030000	then lower the ideal hero
5030000	5032000	then the ideal
5032000	5034000	leader of a society
5034000	5036000	or of a civilization
5036000	5038000	and then the absolute master
5038000	5040000	of enjoying sensible
5040000	5042000	pleasures
5042000	5044000	so these are the ideal
5044000	5046000	moral person types
5046000	5048000	and you can think of
5048000	5050000	of course of
5050000	5052000	empirical
5052000	5054000	concrete persons
5054000	5056000	who may functionalize
5056000	5058000	these ideal
5058000	5060000	moral
5060000	5062000	person types
5062000	5064000	now in the same sense
5064000	5066000	as values are experienced relative
5066000	5068000	to the individual's natures
5068000	5070000	historical manifestations
5070000	5072000	of ideal person types may vary
5072000	5074000	so for example
5074000	5076000	the ideal hero
5076000	5078000	would have different appearances
5078000	5080000	like for example in Joan of Arc
5080000	5082000	or in Alexander the Great
5082000	5084000	the ideal artist
5084000	5086000	may vary
5086000	5088000	in a bit hoven
5088000	5090000	or in a Michael Angelo
5090000	5092000	and even the ideal saints
5092000	5094000	may vary
5094000	5096000	subject to the choices
5096000	5098000	between
5098000	5100000	them since one can make choices
5100000	5102000	only among the lower
5102000	5104000	sorry
5104000	5106000	but it vary
5106000	5108000	depending on the religion
5108000	5110000	but in the latter
5110000	5112000	the founders of religion
5112000	5114000	are not subject to choices
5114000	5116000	between them because
5116000	5118000	one can make choices
5118000	5120000	only among the lower types of
5120000	5122000	exemplars
5122000	5124000	so if a person converts to
5124000	5126000	or otherwise begins to abandon
5126000	5128000	the original fate
5128000	5130000	now there may be some defection
5130000	5132000	or even betrayal
5132000	5134000	something that does not occur when one
5134000	5136000	makes a choice among the lower
5136000	5138000	exemplars
5138000	5140000	okay so there are many
5140000	5142000	different
5142000	5144000	personifications
5144000	5146000	of these
5146000	5148000	ideal types
5148000	5150000	okay
5150000	5152000	now let's go to the last
5152000	5154000	topic here
5154000	5156000	the moral person
5156000	5158000	what is the moral person
5158000	5160000	Sheller
5160000	5162000	retains Kant's understanding of person
5162000	5164000	as having an absolute
5164000	5166000	value and end in
5166000	5168000	itself remember
5168000	5170000	the
5170000	5172000	second articulation of the
5172000	5174000	categorical imperative
5174000	5176000	treat the person whether
5176000	5178000	in you or in others to be
5178000	5180000	not only as a means
5180000	5182000	but as an end in itself
5182000	5184000	so Sheller
5184000	5186000	as we have said it was influence
5186000	5188000	by Kant retain that
5188000	5190000	idea of a person
5190000	5192000	as having
5192000	5194000	an absolute value
5194000	5196000	however he is critical of Kant
5196000	5198000	as Kant grounds the absolute value of the person
5198000	5200000	in the universal category
5200000	5202000	of reason that's understandable
5202000	5204000	after discussing his criticism
5204000	5206000	of the
5206000	5208000	formalism of Kant
5208000	5210000	now Sheller describes the person
5210000	5212000	as the concrete unity of acts
5212000	5214000	of
5214000	5216000	different types of nature
5216000	5218000	concrete unity of acts
5218000	5220000	so the person is present in each
5220000	5222000	and every act
5222000	5224000	my person
5224000	5226000	is present in its
5226000	5228000	in every act that I perform
5228000	5230000	but the person
5230000	5232000	is not reducible to any
5232000	5234000	of one act
5234000	5236000	okay so I am present
5236000	5238000	in all my action but my person
5238000	5240000	cannot be reduced in one particular
5240000	5242000	act that I perform
5242000	5244000	unity here means
5244000	5246000	a particular style
5246000	5248000	particular style of acting
5248000	5250000	style of
5250000	5252000	executing my action
5252000	5254000	or of being
5254000	5256000	so every individual
5256000	5258000	will have his or her unique
5258000	5260000	style of loving
5260000	5262000	of assigning meaning
5262000	5264000	of
5264000	5266000	willing
5266000	5268000	of choosing
5268000	5270000	and necessarily has his own
5270000	5272000	or her own access to the world
5272000	5274000	and when a person dies
5274000	5276000	not only
5276000	5278000	is that the style of loving
5278000	5280000	of assigning or choosing
5280000	5282000	thinking is lost
5282000	5284000	but so is that
5284000	5286000	world
5286000	5288000	is own access to that world
5288000	5290000	it is also lost
5290000	5292000	now
5292000	5294000	for Sheller
5294000	5296000	our being a person
5296000	5298000	is the form of our mind
5298000	5300000	and of our consciousness
5300000	5302000	no matter whether
5302000	5304000	mind and consciousness are understood
5304000	5306000	to be human, divine
5306000	5308000	or just fictional
5308000	5310000	Sheller rejected the notion
5310000	5312000	of a pure consciousness
5312000	5314000	or mind
5314000	5316000	similar like
5316000	5318000	what Husserl
5318000	5320000	stressed or affirmed
5320000	5322000	so the person is just
5322000	5324000	the form of our mind
5324000	5326000	okay
5326000	5328000	so
5328000	5330000	the form of a person
5330000	5332000	is indifferent
5332000	5334000	to gender, culture
5334000	5336000	race and social station
5337000	5339000	so the person manifests itself
5339000	5341000	without reference
5341000	5343000	among men and women
5343000	5345000	culture, race, social station
5345000	5346000	et cetera
5346000	5348000	among Asian or European
5348000	5350000	ancient people's culture
5350000	5352000	American or Asian
5352000	5353000	et cetera et cetera
5353000	5355000	whether it's or poor it doesn't matter
5355000	5357000	okay
5357000	5359000	the person is different to all this
5359000	5361000	the existence of the form
5361000	5363000	of our mind the person
5363000	5365000	is not also comparable
5365000	5367000	to the existence of a thing
5367000	5369000	when we ask the existence
5369000	5371000	of a thing
5371000	5373000	is it's being an object to us
5373000	5375000	personal existence
5375000	5377000	consists only in the
5377000	5379000	execution of mental
5379000	5381000	volitional
5381000	5383000	and emotive acts
5383000	5385000	so as persons we execute
5385000	5387000	mental acts, volitional acts
5387000	5389000	emotive acts
5389000	5391000	so we cannot be reduced
5391000	5393000	to a thing or an object
5393000	5395000	because objects and
5395000	5397000	things do not act
5397000	5399000	mentally, volitionally
5399000	5401000	or emotionally
5401000	5403000	so such acts are for example
5403000	5405000	that the person is capable
5405000	5407000	of loving, of feeling
5407000	5409000	thinking, willing
5409000	5411000	remembering, expecting, hoping
5411000	5413000	despairing, choosing
5413000	5415000	et cetera et cetera
5415000	5417000	now also
5417000	5419000	share other content that
5419000	5421000	the word person cannot be applied to
5421000	5423000	to a being
5423000	5425000	where we assume animation
5425000	5427000	eagleness
5427000	5429000	consciousness of existence
5429000	5431000	or value of the ego
5431000	5433000	it cannot be applied to man
5433000	5435000	in general
5435000	5437000	the phenomenological essence
5437000	5439000	of person reveals that although
5439000	5441000	there are scenes of personhood
5441000	5443000	in still and developed
5443000	5445000	levels of human beingness
5445000	5447000	like for example in the case
5447000	5449000	of children, in the case of
5450000	5452000	it cannot be applied
5452000	5454000	or it can only be applied
5454000	5457000	to a specific level of human existence
5457000	5459000	or a certain kind of man
5459000	5461000	where certain characteristics
5461000	5463000	are already there
5463000	5465000	so for example babies
5465000	5467000	or share other babies
5467000	5469000	who are not be
5469000	5471000	they already have
5471000	5473000	the scenes of personhood
5473000	5475000	but they cannot be considered
5475000	5477000	to be person yet because
5477000	5479000	they are not capable of
5479000	5481000	this unity
5481000	5483000	of acts
5483000	5485000	of course there are persons
5485000	5487000	because they are already
5487000	5489000	they have the scenes of personhood
5489000	5491000	but they cannot be considered person
5491000	5493000	in the full sense of
5493000	5495000	moral personhood
5495000	5497000	okay?
5497000	5499000	it's like
5499000	5501000	it's like our notion of the age of
5501000	5503000	maturity
5503000	5505000	or age of, for example
5505000	5507000	at this particular age
5507000	5509000	18 years old then you are
5509000	5511000	already a full citizen
5511000	5513000	because you already have
5513000	5515000	attained a certain degree of maturity
5515000	5517000	so something similar to that
5517000	5519000	now
5519000	5521000	the imperative that is given
5521000	5523000	in the value a priori
5523000	5525000	in the objective ranks of values
5525000	5527000	is only felt by person
5527000	5529000	so consequently persons
5529000	5531000	are the only beings
5531000	5533000	who are ethically responsible
5533000	5535000	and because every experience
5535000	5537000	is evaluated
5537000	5539000	a person
5539000	5541000	is responsible
5541000	5543000	to love the object
5543000	5545000	or a being of that experience
5545000	5547000	most fully
5547000	5549000	so for example in relation to other persons
5549000	5551000	it's the responsibility
5551000	5553000	and ethical responsibility
5553000	5555000	of the person to love
5555000	5557000	so in loving another person
5557000	5559000	one is called
5559000	5561000	ethically to love
5561000	5563000	even more
5563000	5565000	fully and deeply because
5565000	5567000	the object of that love
5567000	5569000	is a person
5569000	5571000	who has the highest
5571000	5573000	or the absolute value
5573000	5575000	now finally
5575000	5577000	let's talk about what are the characteristics
5577000	5579000	of a person
5579000	5581000	for shellar
5581000	5583000	the person possesses
5583000	5585000	a holy sound mind
5585000	5587000	so the person
5587000	5589000	is somebody
5589000	5591000	who executes intentional acts
5591000	5593000	that are bound
5593000	5595000	by a unity of sense
5595000	5597000	not the unity that we talked about
5597000	5599000	a while ago
5599000	5601000	person is subscribed only to a certain level
5601000	5603000	of development
5603000	5605000	so eagerness
5605000	5607000	possession of a soul
5607000	5609000	consciousness of self
5609000	5611000	do not make a man
5611000	5613000	a person in the moral
5613000	5615000	sense
5615000	5617000	because you have to perform
5617000	5619000	actions
5619000	5621000	the emotive
5621000	5623000	the volitional and the mental acts
5623000	5625000	a child
5625000	5627000	or a person coming
5627000	5629000	of age
5629000	5631000	has the ability to experience
5631000	5633000	inside difference
5633000	5635000	between one act and other acts
5635000	5637000	so if a child can already
5637000	5639000	experience this
5639000	5641000	then he can consider to be
5641000	5643000	a moral person
5643000	5645000	so he is able to
5645000	5647000	in a different shape
5647000	5649000	and conscious of his ability
5649000	5651000	conscious of his ability
5651000	5653000	defines a person
5653000	5655000	so the question is
5655000	5657000	what about the embassy
5657000	5659000	for the embassy
5659000	5661000	the men retarded
5661000	5663000	while they have the seeds of personhood
5663000	5665000	they cannot be considered to be
5665000	5667000	moral persons
5667000	5669000	so person is restricted
5669000	5671000	to those in whom
5671000	5673000	domination over the live
5673000	5675000	body appears immediately
5675000	5677000	he is a master
5677000	5679000	a mastery of his live body
5679000	5681000	and
5681000	5683000	lastly the concrete subject
5683000	5685000	of all acts of the essence
5685000	5687000	of inner intuition
5687000	5689000	and therefore for Scheller
5689000	5691000	the person is
5691000	5693000	only
5693000	5695000	as the concrete unity of acts
5695000	5697000	executed by the person
5697000	5699000	and only
5699000	5701000	in the execution of these
5701000	5703000	acts
5703000	5705000	can a person be considered to be
5705000	5707000	a moral
5707000	5709000	person
5709000	5711000	but just to clarify
5711000	5713000	man
5713000	5715000	all men whether it's
5715000	5717000	a baby or an embassy
5717000	5719000	they contain the seeds
5719000	5721000	of personhood
5721000	5723000	only that because
5723000	5725000	they have not attained a certain degree
5725000	5727000	of moral maturity
5727000	5729000	then they cannot be considered to be
5729000	5731000	a moral person
5733000	5735000	ok so that concludes
5735000	5737000	my presentation on this topic
5737000	5739000	this is not the whole of Scheller
5739000	5741000	we have only discussed
5741000	5743000	what is
5743000	5745000	what he discussed in the
5745000	5747000	their formalism was not even whole of it
5747000	5749000	not even whole of it
5749000	5751000	and I already mentioned
5751000	5753000	many of some of the
5753000	5755000	important works of Max Scheller
5755000	5757000	but I hope that this presentation
5757000	5759000	will give you
5759000	5761000	you know
5761000	5763000	you may introduce
5763000	5765000	give you an overview
5765000	5767000	of the
5767000	5769000	philosophy or at least the philosophy
5769000	5771000	of values of Max Scheller
