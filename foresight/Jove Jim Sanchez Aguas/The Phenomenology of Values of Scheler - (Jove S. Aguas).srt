1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, this is the philosophy of Max Scheller, introduction to the life of Max Scheller.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He was a German social and ethical philosopher.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He was born in Munich on August 22, 1874.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
His mother was Jewish and his father a Lutheran.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
However, he joined the Roman Catholic Church maybe because of its concept of love,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
one of the concepts that Max Scheller developed in his philosophy.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He studied medicine and philosophy in Munich and in Berlin

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and he received his doctorate at Vienna University in 1897.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or he taught from 900, the year 900 up to 1906.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In 1901, Scheller became a lecturer at the University of Vienna

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and stayed there until that particular year 1906.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, from 1907 to 1910, he was professor at Munich

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and met some of the disciples of Kusser.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And with their influence, his thinking turned to phenomenology.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He became acquainted with expanding phenomenological movement

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but he kept a notably independent position from phenomenology.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In 1910, he retired from teaching and retired to Berlin

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and wrote his major works.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In 1917, he joined the German Foreign Office

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as a diplomat in Geneva and at the Hague.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And in 1919, he became professor and chair of philosophy

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and sociology at the University of Cologne.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
During this period of productivity, which ended around 1921,

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
he became renowned in Germany and elsewhere

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for an unusual amount of publications.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Perhaps one of the most prolific writers

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
of the phenomenological movement is Max Scheller,

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
second to Edmund Musser.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
After that, his favorite worldwide proportion

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
documented by the many invitations extended to him

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to lecture in Paris, in Japan, in Russia,

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and in the United States.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In 1920, he became a pacifist

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and repudiated the horrors of war

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and was converted to Roman Catholicism.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But about 1924,

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
he turned to a more pantheistic view of man in the world

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and left Catholicism.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In early 1928, he went to the University of Frankfurt

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
where he also lectured there.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And he died on May 1928.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
His widow was the devoted curator

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
of thousands of post-humans manuscripts

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
until she passed away in 1969.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
As a phenomenologist, Scheller sought to discover

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the essence of mental attitudes

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and the relation to their objects,

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ating that he will develop

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in his major work, therefore, Malismus.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He differed from Musser in his readiness to assign

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
an independently real status to the objects.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Remember that Musser

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
took objects to be

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the intentional objects

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of our consciousness.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
At the development of his thought,

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the first period of Scheller's thought

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
centered on the incontrovertible value

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
of the individual person and value ethics

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
centered on the non-formal or material ethics

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
which is opposed to the formal ethics proposed

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
by Immanuel Kant.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This position of Max Scheller

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is founded in his major work

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
on formalism

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
or formalism in ethics

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and non-formal ethics of values

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
a new attempt toward the foundation

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
of ethical personalism.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's the entire title of his work.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
In the first part of his value ethics

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
he established the values,

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
he established that values are correlates

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
of three types of feelings.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Feelings in the body, feelings of life

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and personal feelings.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Moral experience cannot be divorced

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
from feeling values as such.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And in the second part

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
he showed that each person was a unique

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
self-value.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Personal self-value must be accounted for

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in all variable moral situations.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So here in the first part of his

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ethics and his formalismos

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
established the notion of values.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Values as objects of our emotions

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
of our feelings.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But in doing that

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
he also criticized the formal ethics

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
of Immanuel Kant.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And we're going to discuss that later.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So in the second part

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
of this value ethics

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
was on the nature of the person.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The exemplary persons.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The nature or the theory

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
of the nature of the person

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
is a new and most interesting analysis.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The series was also developing

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
a kind of ethical personalism.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He showed that our being a person

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
is the form of our mind

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and our consciousness.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No matter whether the mind

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or the consciousness

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
are understood to be human,

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
divine, or just fictional.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We developed his idea

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
of the ideal moral person.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
However, in the second period

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
of his career

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
after writing the formalismos

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sheller developed a more comprehensive

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
anthropology

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that works on the vitalism

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and pantheism.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So he figured out

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to determine what he called

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the meta-anthropological status

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
of humanity.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And this he developed

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in his work,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Man's Place in the Cosmos

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
or Man's Place in the Universe

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
which was published

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
in 1928

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
after his death.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So it was published

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
mostly. Remember that he died

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
of that year.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sheller in that book

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
which is actually a very,

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
just a very thin book

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
offered a graduate

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
view of being.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In his view, man, God,

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and the world

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
are one self-becoming cosmic process

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
in absolute time.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And this process of self-becoming

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
has two poles.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The guys and the drunk.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Guys meaning spirit

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and the drunk meaning the life-hearts.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The guys according to Sheller

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is powerless

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
unless it can,

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
its ideas can functionalize

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
with life factors

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
meaning with material conditions

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that realize their actual,

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
their actualities.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the one that

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
can provide the guys

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
with power,

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
with vitality

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
is the drunk.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So the drunk is

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the source of life,

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the source of vitality.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But the drunk does not have any direction.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So it is the guys

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that provides direction.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So the guys is the

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
source of direction,

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
source of

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the ideas,

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
source of reason,

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but it is powerless.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Does not have any vitality at all.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The drunk on the other hand

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is the source of vitality

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
but it does not have any direction at all.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So when you combine it to

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
then you have both vitality

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and direction.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So,

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
now Sheller for a particular

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
kinship to

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
introspective and intuitive philosophers

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
like Blaise Pascal.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it was also

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
was actually from Blaise Pascal

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that he borrowed the notion

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
of reason of the heart

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
or logic decor

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
which would

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
be very prominent

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
in his articulation of

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
our understanding

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
or feeling of the values.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So he preferred

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
these introspective and intuitive philosophers

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
more than the abstract theories

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
about morality and God.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
These tendencies

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
become the basis of criticisms

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
against Sheller's emotive philosophy

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that his ethics

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
is emotive.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's based on

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the emotions

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
on the feelings.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And no less than Karol Vitiva

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
was critical of

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the philosophy of Max Sheller

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
although Max Sheller influenced a lot

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the phenomenology

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
or the way Vitiva understands

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
phenomenology.

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Of course, there are other

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
philosophers who also influence

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
its view about this

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
about the intuitive

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
about

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
introspective power.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Philosophers like

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Nietzsche, Briggson and

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Delphi.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So these philosophers also influence

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
this orientation

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Max Sheller.

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Of course, the other philosopher

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
who influenced Max Sheller

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
was Edmund Pusser

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and Immanuel Kant

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
because she studied Immanuel Kant

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
although he was critical

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
of the ethics of Immanuel Kant.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The other philosophers

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
or thinkers who have Sheller's

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
thinking includes

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
those thinkers in the history of philosophy

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
who demonstrated their

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
phenomenological orientation like

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
philosophy and other oriental

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
philosophers.

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
His other works also

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
showed the result of Kantian

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and post Kantian influence.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
As I mentioned here, their

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
formalismos, although it was

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
a critique of Kant's formal ethics

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
he nevertheless agreed

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
with Kant on certain points

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and we are going to discuss

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that later. The influence

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
of phenomenology

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
especially

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Brusser account for Sheller's

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
interest on empirical research

253
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and in metaphysics.

254
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So those are

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the important

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
influences in the philosophy

257
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
of Max Sheller. Now let's

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
go to his methodology.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Of course

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
he strongly emphasized

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the phenomenological method

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which at a time

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
was being formally developed

264
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
by Brusser

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and he also actually

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
acclaimed this in his door formalismos.

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He first came

268
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
in contact with the movement

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
when he moved to the University of

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Beauty in 1907 as we have already mentioned

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and there he met

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
some of the students of

273
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Brusser.

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So he was

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
attracted to this

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
movement or to this approach

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
of philosophy. Although

278
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
he

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
applied the phenomenological method

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
not on

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
epistemology the way

282
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Brusser applied

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
phenomenology

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but applied it to

285
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
actualogy, to ethics

286
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
or to values

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and to his notion of

288
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the human person.

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sheller is firmly convinced

290
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that phenomenology would bring about

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
basic transformation

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
in our way of conceiving the world

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and ourselves.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Although some consider it

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
thought to be quite unsystematic

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Sheller was one of the most

297
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
insightful and acutely

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
intuitive and brilliant thinkers

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and writers of the early 20th century.

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And his works

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
abound with

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
detailed description of the

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
sample states of consciousness

304
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
like sympathy which he has a

305
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
book on

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
resentment

307
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
love

308
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and joy.

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So here are some of the

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
important works of

311
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Max Sheller

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
on resentment and moral

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
value judgment

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
published in 1912.

315
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And then contributions

316
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to the phenomenology and theory

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
of sympathy and of love in 8

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the following year 1913.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And then he's there formalismus

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and non-formal ethics of values.

321
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
1913

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and then man's place in nature

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
or man's place in the cosmos

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
posumously published in 1928

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and man in the age of

326
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
equalization

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
published in 1929.

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So these last two are

329
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
posumously published.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Now let's go to his theory

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
of values.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And here we are going to

333
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
zero in on the

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
formalismus.

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And it would be nice

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
it would help if you're going

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
to read at least the first

338
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
chapter of the

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
formalismus for you to better understand

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
his theory

341
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
of values.

342
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Now in that book the formalismus

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sheller explained that one

344
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
ought to do

345
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
what one ought to do

346
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
presupposes a feeling

347
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
of the value of what ought

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to be done.

349
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now this ought

350
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
is actually

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the concept of duty

352
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
of Immanuel Kant.

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So he's referring to

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the concept of duty

355
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the categorical imperative

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
of Immanuel Kant.

357
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And according to Sheller

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
what we ought to do

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
our understanding of what

360
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
of duty

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
presupposes a feeling

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
of the value of what ought

363
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
to be done. In other words

364
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the feeling is more primordial

365
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
than the understanding

366
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
the duty.

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because for Sheller

369
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
even if you know

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that we ought to do

371
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
our duties

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
we have the feeling of the value

373
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
of that duty

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
we will never do it.

375
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So it presupposes

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that we already have

377
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
a feeling of the duty.

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That feeling of

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the duty is based on our

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
values.

381
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Now he divided the values

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
into five ranks which are given

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
a priori.

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So for him the values

385
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
must be a priori meaning

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
they don't pass to experience

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
that fulfill

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
the requirement of Kant

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that for something to be universal

390
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
it must be a priori.

391
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So if you apply

392
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the idea of

393
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
a priori

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that the universal must be a priori

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
by saying

396
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that values are given a priori

397
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
then that means

398
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
the values are universal.

399
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And these values

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
are anchored

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in our

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
ordo amoris

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
or the order or logic of the heart

404
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
logic decor.

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And this

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
logic of the heart

407
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is not congruent to the logic

408
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
based on reason.

409
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So aside from

410
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
the logic of reason

411
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Sheller adds

412
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
another thing the logic

413
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
of the heart.

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And the reason

415
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
of the heart cannot be

416
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
understood by reason

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
by pure reason

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
by the intellect.

419
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And in this

420
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
view Sheller follow the idea of

421
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
the French philosopher

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Blaise Pascal and of course

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
oppose himself to the ideas

424
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
or to the position of

425
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Immanuel Kant.

426
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
According to this view

427
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
moral acts and deeds

428
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
are individual

429
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and they originate

430
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
in an individual's

431
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
pre-rational

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
preferring of values.

433
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Meaning before

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
we can rationalize

435
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
about values

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
we already prefer

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the values before we can even

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
understand before we can

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
even reason out about

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
values. We already have

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
preference

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
tendency

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
for values.

444
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So we will

445
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
explain that in details

446
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
in the later part.

447
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So moral experience lies in the

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
what he calls the call of the hour

449
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
of the moment

450
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
in which the a priori ranking

451
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
among

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
values become individually

453
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
transparent.

454
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
In a particular moment

455
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
we're going

456
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
how we value things will become

457
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
transparent it will manifest

458
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
itself.

459
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No matter how much the order

460
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
may be distorted by the

461
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
feelings of the sentiment

462
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
of hate and other passions

463
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
we will go back to this later.

464
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Now let's go to the

465
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
first part of the therefore

466
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
balismos.

467
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because in the first part of the

468
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
it is where

469
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Scheller presented

470
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
this criticism of Kant's

471
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
formal ethics.

472
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
By the way when you say

473
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
non-formal ethics

474
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
it means material ethics.

475
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Material here

476
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
pertains to

477
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
the non-rational.

478
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The non-rational.

479
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So the formal is rational

480
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that's the

481
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
position of

482
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
reason

483
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
pure reason practical reason

484
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
so it's formal.

485
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And

486
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the non-formal

487
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the non-rational

488
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
is

489
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
regarded by Kant as

490
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
empirical

491
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
or material.

492
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So

493
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Scheller

494
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
develops his theory of values

495
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
in the realm of the material

496
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
in the realm of the

497
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
non-formal.

498
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is that material

499
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
non-formal in the realm of the emotions.

500
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So Scheller's theory of values

501
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and ethics would be in fact

502
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
incomprehensible

503
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
without taking into consideration

504
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
his criticisms of Kant's

505
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
view of ethics.

506
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because in the first part of the

507
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
therefore balismos

508
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
he was commenting

509
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and criticking

510
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
the formalism of Immanuel Kant

511
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
although he agreed with Kant

512
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
on certain points.

513
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And therefore the non-formalismos

514
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
in the non-formalismos

515
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Scheller

516
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
preoccupied himself with a lengthy criticism

517
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
of Kant's formal ethics

518
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and built much of his

519
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
own ideas on these

520
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
or from these criticisms.

521
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He said

522
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
in the early pages of the non-formalismos

523
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in this work

524
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can accomplish my task

525
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
only through revealing Kant's

526
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
erroneous presuppositions

527
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and by replacing

528
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
them with correct

529
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
ones. That's how

530
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
ambitious the project

531
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
of Scheller is

532
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
in this

533
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
work that are formalismos.

534
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Scheller though agreed

535
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
with Kant on certain points.

536
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
First he agreed with Kant

537
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
when Kant rejected

538
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
all ethics of goods and purposes.

539
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What is an ethic

540
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
of goods and purposes?

541
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, it's a kind of ethics

542
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
that bases the morality

543
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
of action or morality itself

544
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
on purposes.

545
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Remember

546
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the teleological theories on ethics.

547
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So

548
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Kant rejected all teleological

549
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
theories

550
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
of ethics.

551
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Because these ethics base morality

552
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
on purposes

553
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
on uncertain goods.

554
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For example, you want to be happy

555
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
if what you're doing

556
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
will make you happy, happiness

557
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
is something good, then

558
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
your action

559
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
is ethical.

560
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But Kant rejected

561
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
that kind of ethics.

562
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He rejected that kind of ethics.

563
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And Scheller agreed with Kant

564
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
in his rejection

565
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
of this kind of ethics

566
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
of goods and purposes.

567
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So according to Scheller

568
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Kant was correct

569
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
when he refuted all ethics

570
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
starting with a question

571
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
what is the highest good

572
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
or what is the final purpose

573
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
of all our

574
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
volitional connection.

575
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So he agreed with

576
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Kant on that point.

577
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Kant he said was correct

578
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in dismissing them

579
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
as having false basis.

580
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So Scheller wrote

581
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
in the Der Formalismus

582
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and I'm quoting him here

583
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I quote

584
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Kant maintained

585
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that whenever

586
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
we make the goodness

587
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
or moral depravity

588
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
of a person

589
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and act will

590
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
indeed, etc.

591
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Dependent on their relation to

592
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the realm of existing goods

593
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
or evils,

594
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
posited as real

595
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
we make the goodness or the

596
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
privacy of the will

597
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
dependent on the particular

598
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
contingent existence

599
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
of the realm of goods

600
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
as well as on its experiential

601
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
noability.

602
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So he agreed with Kant

603
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
that we cannot base our

604
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
the moral goodness

605
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
or the moral

606
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
depravity of a particular

607
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
act on the basis

608
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
of a realm of goods

609
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
because this realm

610
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
of goods

611
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
is based on experience

612
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and

613
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
anything that is based on experience

614
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
or empirical cannot

615
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
be permanent it will be changing

616
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and therefore you cannot base

617
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
your morality on that. So he agreed

618
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
with Kant on that point.

619
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Kant further added

620
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that the moral value of the will

621
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
would always depend

622
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
on the way in which

623
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it intervened in the

624
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
maintenance or promotion of this

625
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
realm of goods.

626
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
However,

627
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
since this realm of goods

628
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
is continually changing in

629
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
history

630
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
because this realm of goods

631
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
is contingent

632
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
it's

633
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
empirical

634
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
the moral value of the will

635
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
would also be changing

636
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
so like for example

637
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
let us say

638
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
God yet

639
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
belong to this realm of good

640
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
so if we are going to base our

641
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
or fame for example

642
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
or power for example

643
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but this realm of goods

644
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
they keeps on changing

645
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
in history.

646
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So that means that the value

647
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
of the will would also be changing

648
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the destruction of this

649
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
realm of goods would also

650
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
mean the dissolution of the idea

651
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
of the moral

652
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
value.

653
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So with these presuppositions

654
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ethics would be based on sensible

655
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
experience and therefore

656
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
it would only be empirical

657
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and it will only have

658
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
inductive validity

659
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and remember that for

660
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Kant

661
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
morality should be universal

662
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
a knowledge

663
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
should be universal

664
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
that's why he said

665
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that morality should be

666
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
based on the moral law

667
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the moral law is something

668
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
that is universal the moral law

669
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is law is a priori

670
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
so the

671
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
a priori is that which is

672
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
universal

673
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
so if we base our morality

674
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
on a realm of goods

675
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
that will be changing

676
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
continuously

677
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
in history then

678
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
morality will also be changing

679
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the same holds true if ethics will be

680
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
based on purposes

681
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
on the end, the loss

682
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
any ethics which measures

683
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the moral value of the will

684
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
against the final purpose

685
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
like you want to be happy

686
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
or you want to be

687
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
say

688
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
useful

689
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
that would necessarily

690
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
degrade the values of the goods and evil

691
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
to mere technical values

692
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
subordinated to that purpose

693
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
so Scheller echoes Kant

694
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
when he wrote and again echoed

695
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
ethics must reject

696
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
all talk of good and bad purposes

697
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
for purposes

698
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
as such are never

699
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
good nor bad

700
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
when considered apart from the value

701
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
that are to be realized

702
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
in positing them

703
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and apart from the values of the act

704
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that posits them

705
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
remember that for Kant

706
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
there is only one thing that is good

707
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
without any qualification

708
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and that is the good will

709
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
so therefore we cannot base ethics

710
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
on any purpose

711
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
because these purposes

712
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
may change

713
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
it may be good

714
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
under certain condition

715
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but remember

716
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
for Kant

717
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
the good must be good

718
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
without any condition

719
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and the only thing that is good

720
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
without any condition

721
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
is the good will

722
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
so on this point Scheller agreed

723
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
with Immanuel Kant

724
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
purposes are justifiable

725
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
only when they will posit

726
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
when the will posits

727
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
or has posited them is good

728
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and the only way that can posit

729
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
it to be good

730
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
is the good will

731
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
what makes a purpose good or bad

732
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is not the particular realization of that purpose

733
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
but the very positing

734
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
or the manner

735
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
or phases in which the purpose

736
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
has come about

737
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
so he agreed

738
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
with Kant on those points

739
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
however

740
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
he refuted Kant

741
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
when Kant assume

742
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
that the material

743
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
or non formal ethics

744
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
which is also an ethic

745
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
of goods and purposes

746
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
when Kant assume

747
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
that

748
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
non formal ethics

749
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
is also an ethic

750
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
of goods and purposes

751
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
because Kant

752
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
distinguish only

753
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
formal

754
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
or non formal

755
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and

756
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
he included

757
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the non formal ethics

758
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
to ethics of goods and purposes

759
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
so for Kant

760
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
the only thing

761
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the only ethics

762
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that is

763
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
viable and acceptable

764
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
is a formal ethics

765
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
he dismissed

766
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
the material

767
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
non formal ethics

768
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Kant believe

769
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
that an ethic preceded by correct methods

770
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
must exclude

771
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
improsipositions

772
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
of the concept of good and bad

773
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and the constitution

774
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
not only goods and purposes

775
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
but also all

776
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
values of non formal

777
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
nature

778
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
so

779
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Jose

780
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
in general

781
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
can't reject

782
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
all kinds of

783
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
values

784
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
of non formal nature

785
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
meaning the values

786
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that are not

787
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
rational

788
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and again he called

789
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
all practical principles

790
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
which presuppose an object

791
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
meaning a material

792
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
of the faculty of desire

793
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the desire is emotion

794
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
at the determining ground

795
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
of the will are without exception

796
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
empirical

797
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and can furnace as no practical

798
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
loss

799
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and by practical

800
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
by material of the

801
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
faculty of desire I mean

802
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
an object whose reality is

803
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
desired

804
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
that's from practical reason

805
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
so it's

806
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
in practical reason

807
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
so here

808
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
according to Scheller

809
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Kant eroniously

810
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
assume that any material

811
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
or non formal ethics

812
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
must necessarily be an

813
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
ethics of goods and purposes

814
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
in that such ethics

815
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
is empirically inductive

816
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and aposteriori

817
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
an ethics of

818
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
success

819
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
it's an ethics that is hedonistic

820
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
it's eronus and it is an ethics

821
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that is incapable of determining

822
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
the moral foundation

823
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
of action and is

824
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
incapable of furnishing insight

825
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
into the dignity

826
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
of the person

827
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
so

828
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
that's the position of Kant

829
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and that is the position

830
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
that Scheller rejected

831
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
so on the contrary

832
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
according to Scheller

833
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
the rejection

834
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
of an ethics of goods or purposes

835
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
does not imply

836
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
a rejection of concrete values

837
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Kant thought that we can

838
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
or he can exclude

839
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
from consideration the value

840
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
which represent themselves in goods

841
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
but this would be correct

842
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
if instead of finding

843
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
their fulfillment

844
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
in autonomous phenomena

845
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
the value concepts

846
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
were to be obstructed

847
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
from the goods

848
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
or if one could derive them

849
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
only from actual effects

850
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
an ethics

851
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
of material values

852
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
does not necessarily

853
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
presuppose

854
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
empirical knowledge

855
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
because as

856
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Scheller would show

857
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
how the material values

858
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
are not

859
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
known

860
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
through empirical knowledge

861
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
they are also a priori

862
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
meaning they are also universal

863
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
so

864
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Scheller elevated material values

865
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
in the same level

866
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
as ideas

867
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
as formal concepts

868
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
because for Kant

869
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
you have the concepts, you have the laws

870
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
the formal laws, the moral law

871
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
universal

872
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and the material values

873
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
they are empirical

874
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
but according to Scheller

875
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
no, the material values

876
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
are also a priori

877
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
they are not empirical

878
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
so Scheller also rejected

879
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Kant's identification

880
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
of the a prioristic

881
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
with the rational

882
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
in the material or non formal

883
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
with the sensual or

884
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
a posteriori

885
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
because for Kant

886
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
is the rational, this is the formal

887
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and it is a priori

888
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
the material

889
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
or non formal is

890
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
a posteriori

891
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
empirical

892
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
okay, that's the position

893
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
of Kant and Scheller

894
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
rejected that position

895
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
so why can't believe

896
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that a material ethic must

897
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
refer to the organization

898
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
of the egotistic

899
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
crimes of human nature

900
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
in all ethical

901
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
valuation

902
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Scheller believed

903
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
otherwise

904
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
so he refuted the claim

905
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
of Kant that only formal

906
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
ethics

907
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
avoids the fallacies

908
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
committed by non formal

909
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
or material ethics

910
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
so Scheller believed

911
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that

912
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
this fallacies

913
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
can also be avoided

914
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
this egotistic

915
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
this egotistic valuation

916
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
can also be

917
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
avoided by

918
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
non formal

919
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
or material ethics

920
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
so now the main purpose now

921
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of Scheller

922
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
is to show that an ethic

923
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
of material values

924
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
which Kant rejected

925
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
by no means

926
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
leads to the conclusion

927
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
rich rich rich

928
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
by Kant

929
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
he developed an ethical

930
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
theory based on the inside

931
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that material values

932
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and their hierarchical

933
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
order

934
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
form a realm

935
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
of material

936
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
aprioristic data

937
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
which is disclosed to us

938
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
by emotional intuition

939
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
so if the formal

940
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
if the concepts

941
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
ideas

942
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
are revealed to us by reason

943
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
the values

944
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
are revealed to us

945
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
by way of emotional intuition

946
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and Scheller also wanted

947
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to show

948
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
that the dichotomy between the sensible

949
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and the intelligible

950
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
or between the intelligible

951
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and the emotional

952
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
when it comes to knowledge

953
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
is not exhaustive

954
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
because

955
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
there is a separate realm

956
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
between the senses and the intellect

957
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
there is something

958
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
between what is perceived

959
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
by the senses

960
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and what is taught by reason

961
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and this separate realm

962
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
is the realm of feelings

963
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that which is

964
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
felt

965
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
the realm of the emotion

966
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
so senses

967
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
thought

968
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
or intellect

969
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
thinks

970
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the emotions

971
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
feel

972
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
so

973
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
he develop his ethics based on the

974
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
emotions

975
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
based on what is felt

976
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and what is felt is the value

977
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
so the value

978
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
is

979
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
the intentional object of our

980
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
emotion

981
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
or of our feelings

982
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and this is where phenomenology

983
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
would come in

984
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
because just like Pusser

985
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
who develop the idea

986
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
that the intentional

987
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
objects

988
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
are the intentional

989
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
objects

990
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the ados

991
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
are the essential

992
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
or the intentional objects of our consciousness

993
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
for Scheller

994
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
the values are the intentional objects

995
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
of our emotions

996
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
so now let's discuss

997
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
the nature of values

998
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
so through the phenomenological

999
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
approach to ethics into values in general

1000
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Scheller

1001
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
hope to make the theory of values

1002
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
impervious

1003
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
in the criticisms

1004
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
of relativism

1005
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
in of the behavioral sciences

1006
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
he wanted this theory

1007
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
this

1008
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
theory of values

1009
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
immune

1010
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
from the criticisms

1011
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
of Kant

1012
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
so according to him

1013
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
many emotions have objective

1014
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
referents

1015
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
meaning intentional objects

1016
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
he stressed that the belief

1017
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that emotions are purely subjective

1018
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
states of consciousness

1019
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
is based on an

1020
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
erroneous description

1021
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
or misanalysis

1022
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
or misunderstanding

1023
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
of their structure

1024
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
people believe that emotion

1025
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
is just a subjective

1026
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
emotional state

1027
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
or states of consciousness

1028
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
now according to Scheller

1029
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
although some moods

1030
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
do not go beyond themselves

1031
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
the experience of a value

1032
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is usually an intentional

1033
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
act

1034
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
which is parallel to perception

1035
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and conception of ideas

1036
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
so in perception

1037
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
we have the material object

1038
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
in conception we have the ideas

1039
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
in the emotion

1040
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
we have the values

1041
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
so the object

1042
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
like for example

1043
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
the feeling of joy

1044
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
about a good news

1045
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
is an experience which have

1046
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
subjective and objective points

1047
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
so joy is not just a subjective

1048
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
state of consciousness

1049
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
because there is an objective point

1050
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
to this emotion

1051
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
the object

1052
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
of that experience is seen

1053
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
as a good thing

1054
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
which insensates a value

1055
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
so for example

1056
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
we have the feeling of joy

1057
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
because

1058
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
of the good news

1059
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
what is the good news

1060
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
why is it a good news

1061
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
so the news is something good

1062
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
because it insensates

1063
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
a value

1064
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and the value

1065
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
is the objective point

1066
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
of your emotional or subjective state

1067
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
so

1068
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the emotion

1069
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
or the feeling of joy insensates

1070
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
a value

1071
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
so it's not only the good news

1072
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
that will

1073
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
insensate that particular value

1074
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so therefore according to Scheller

1075
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
there is no such a thing as

1076
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
a cognitive emotions

1077
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
in that point to certain real objects

1078
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
cognitive emotions

1079
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and of course

1080
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
this cognitive emotion

1081
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
is not something that is congruent

1082
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
to the cognitive reason

1083
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
going back to

1084
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the order amoris or logic of the heart

1085
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
that he borrowed from Blaise Pascal

1086
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
so again in the Darformalismos

1087
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
he disagreed with Kant's

1088
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
identification of the

1089
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
a priori with reason

1090
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
for Scheller

1091
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
the a priori

1092
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
extends far beyond

1093
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
the uses of reason

1094
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and therefore included

1095
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
feeling

1096
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the feeling nature of mind

1097
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
within the constitution

1098
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
of the mind

1099
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and posited what he called

1100
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
emotional a priori

1101
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
so the mind

1102
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is not only

1103
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
formal or rational

1104
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the mind

1105
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
emotional component

1106
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
so that's where he said

1107
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
it's connected to what

1108
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
we have already mentioned

1109
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that what one ought to do

1110
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
which is

1111
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
the a priori

1112
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
of reason

1113
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
presupposes the feeling

1114
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
of the value of one ought to be

1115
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
done that's the emotional

1116
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
a priori

1117
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
so there is the formal a priori

1118
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
of duty

1119
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and there is the emotional

1120
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a priori of the value

1121
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
of that duty

1122
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
alright now let's move

1123
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
on to the order amoris

1124
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
because this is one

1125
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
very important concept

1126
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
of Mark Scheller

1127
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and this is where he

1128
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
described how we

1129
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
recognize

1130
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
the value

1131
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
as a priori

1132
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
so values are a priori

1133
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and these are

1134
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
anchored on our

1135
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
our order amoris

1136
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
or the order

1137
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
or logic of the heart

1138
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and again as we've said

1139
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
this is not something that is

1140
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
congruent to the order

1141
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
of reason to the formal

1142
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
part

1143
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
of our mind

1144
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and again as we've said

1145
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
this is what he

1146
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
borrowed from

1147
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
according to this view

1148
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
moral acts

1149
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
or deeds

1150
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
are individual

1151
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and they originate

1152
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
in our own pre-rational

1153
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
prefering of values

1154
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
now what is this

1155
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
pre-rational prefering of values

1156
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
in the ordinary sense

1157
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
when we say prefering

1158
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
or preference

1159
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
using something

1160
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
over something else

1161
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but in Scheller's

1162
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
terminology

1163
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
when you say prefering

1164
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
it pertains to

1165
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
a pre-rational act

1166
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
it's an act

1167
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
that happens

1168
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
prior to making a rational

1169
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
or deliberate

1170
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
choice

1171
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
between one

1172
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
between two or more

1173
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
different things

1174
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
so

1175
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
when we make a decision

1176
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
or a rational decision

1177
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
we analyze

1178
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
which one will I choose

1179
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
we deliberate

1180
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
we enumerate

1181
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
we think of several reasons

1182
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
why choose this

1183
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but in pre-rational

1184
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
prefering before you can

1185
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
even think of

1186
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
these things

1187
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
before you can even deliberate

1188
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
you already have certain tendency

1189
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
you already

1190
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
lean towards something

1191
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
before you can even make a choice

1192
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
so this leaning towards

1193
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
something

1194
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
has already taken place

1195
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
in us even before

1196
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
we make a choice

1197
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
so we may

1198
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
for example lean towards

1199
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
contemporary music

1200
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
over classical music

1201
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
before we can even think of

1202
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
why do we like

1203
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
contemporary music

1204
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
over classical music

1205
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
or we may prefer

1206
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
a particular color

1207
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
we prefer say

1208
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
color blue

1209
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
over some other colors

1210
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
why is that

1211
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
well

1212
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you can think later on

1213
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
we deliberate

1214
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
choice

1215
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I want blue because

1216
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
because of this and that

1217
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
or I want red because of this and that

1218
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
but even before you do that

1219
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
you already have some leaning towards something

1220
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
so in such cases

1221
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
we inadvertently

1222
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
experience a drift

1223
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
or propensity towards something

1224
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
rather than something else

1225
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
so there is

1226
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
pre-rational preferring of

1227
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
contemporary music over

1228
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
classical music

1229
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
or pre-rational preferring

1230
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
of certain colors

1231
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
over other colors

1232
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
now

1233
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
this leaning towards something

1234
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
may accompany us for a long time

1235
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
or even for our entire life

1236
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
or it may take

1237
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
different directions during

1238
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
our middle age

1239
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
when we grow old

1240
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
now another parallelism

1241
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
in our

1242
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
visual perception

1243
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
we do not choose to see it alive

1244
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that makes

1245
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
things visible to us

1246
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
rather our sense of sight

1247
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
possesses a pre-visual

1248
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
tendency

1249
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
or trend towards life

1250
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
towards

1251
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
what is lit up or bright

1252
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
there is

1253
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
a pre-visual preference

1254
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
to light

1255
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
rather than darkness

1256
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
that's pre-visual

1257
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and there is also

1258
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
pre-rational

1259
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
so love is in the sense

1260
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
analogous to light

1261
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
love has an intrinsic

1262
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
bent towards

1263
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
other higher values

1264
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
than those that were merely given to us

1265
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
no matter whether

1266
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
or not love will realize them

1267
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
so we prefer

1268
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
certain values over other values

1269
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
now

1270
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
the more experience lies

1271
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
in the call of the hour

1272
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
in which the a priori ranking

1273
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
of values becomes

1274
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
individually apparent

1275
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
no matter how much the order of more

1276
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
may be distorted by feelings

1277
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
or other passions

1278
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
in other words

1279
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
there is already a

1280
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
pre or an a priori ranking

1281
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
of values

1282
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
meaning

1283
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
it is not the person

1284
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
who ranks these values

1285
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
but values themselves are already

1286
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
ranked

1287
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
there is an objective ranking

1288
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
of values

1289
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and these values

1290
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
are as follows

1291
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
value of the senses

1292
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
meaning the value of

1293
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
what is pleasant or unpleasant

1294
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
or maybe

1295
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
what is enjoyable or not enjoyable

1296
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
in the physical

1297
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
or bodily sense

1298
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
the value of life

1299
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
whether something is noble

1300
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
or common

1301
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
the value of the spirit

1302
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
which is divided into two

1303
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
the aesthetic values of ugly and beautiful

1304
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
or the value of knowledge

1305
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and then

1306
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
the value of

1307
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
religion or the religious values

1308
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
the value of the holy and unholy

1309
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
so if you are going to rank them

1310
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
in ascending order

1311
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
it will follow this

1312
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
the lowest would be the value

1313
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
of bodily comfort

1314
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
or the pleasure values

1315
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and then higher

1316
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
than the bodily comfort

1317
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
the value of the senses

1318
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
would be the pragmatic values of usefulness

1319
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
these two lower ranks of values

1320
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
are either manageable

1321
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
or calculable and divisible

1322
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
it's as if cultivation of them

1323
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
as happens in modern society

1324
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
this unites people

1325
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
so this is the lower value

1326
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the higher value is

1327
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
the value

1328
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
that contains life values

1329
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
they belong to what is noble

1330
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and life values

1331
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
but

1332
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
life values pertain at the power

1333
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
only with persons

1334
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and then the highest

1335
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
values

1336
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
the two highest value ranks

1337
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
are experienced exclusively

1338
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
in human personal feelings

1339
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
the value of

1340
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
the spirit and the religious

1341
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
values

1342
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
so here the rank of

1343
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
mental values of

1344
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
justice, beauty

1345
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and the cognition of truth

1346
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
so ranking of values

1347
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and then the highest of the value

1348
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
would be

1349
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
the value of

1350
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
the religious feelings

1351
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
the holy or the unholy

1352
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
so fourth seller

1353
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
the values are already

1354
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
ranked

1355
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
there is an objective

1356
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
ranking of values

1357
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
no matter how

1358
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
our feelings

1359
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
or our resentment

1360
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
or hate

1361
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
may distort them

1362
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
some people who are resentful

1363
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
may think

1364
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
of the value of beauty

1365
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
as lower

1366
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
as lower than

1367
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
for example the value of

1368
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
say

1369
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
usefulness

1370
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
or

1371
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
pleasurable

1372
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
we may say

1373
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
justice

1374
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
is one of the highest

1375
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
values but some people will say

1376
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
well the value of justice is

1377
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
lower than the value

1378
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
for example of

1379
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
pleasure or comfort

1380
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
now i will stop there

1381
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
if you have some questions

1382
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
yes Alexis go ahead

1383
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Doc may randin po ba siyang concept

1384
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
ng

1385
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
parang kai-kant na logiver

1386
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
kasi po di ba sabi po ninyo

1387
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
nakarank na po yung

1388
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
mga values

1389
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
si na po yung nag rank po ng mga values

1390
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
noyan doc

1391
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
if you think of the logiver

1392
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
in the context or same

1393
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
as Kant

1394
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
there is this logiver

1395
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
it's simply that

1396
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
in reality there is this

1397
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
values

1398
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
so even Kant does not say

1399
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
that the values are rank accordingly

1400
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
based on the logiver

1401
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Kant only say that there is the moral law

1402
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and this moral law

1403
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
is the highest of the laws

1404
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
but as to the lower values

1405
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
does not say where it came from

1406
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
it's part of reality

1407
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
the values

1408
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
values are

1409
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
we just not say that

1410
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
values are created

1411
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
values are there

1412
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
they are part of our human experience

1413
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
you can only stress that as far as well

1414
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
because humans

1415
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
are created

1416
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and part of his existence are the values

1417
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
then the values must also be created

1418
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
by a higher being

1419
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
but cellar would not say that

1420
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
it's part of our experience

1421
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
it's part of the human reality

1422
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
okay, any questions?

1423
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
oh, let me pull out it

1424
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
since there is already a pre-establish

1425
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
of values and values

1426
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
as already rank

1427
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
because it means values are not

1428
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
no

1429
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
it's not about

1430
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
immoral or being moral

1431
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
this is not

1432
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
this is not an ethics

1433
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
this is not an ethics that talks about

1434
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
what is moral or immoral

1435
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
okay

1436
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
na

1437
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
na

1438
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
you are mixing things

1439
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
please up

1440
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
it's not talking of

1441
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
moral or immoral here

1442
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
of course

1443
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
it talks about evil

1444
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
when later on you're going to see

1445
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
that if you

1446
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
evil would be the preference

1447
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
for a lower value

1448
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
okay

1449
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
but it's not talking of the

1450
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
of immoral

1451
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
in the

1452
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
in the Christian sense of being immoral

1453
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
that it's a sin

1454
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
it's evil

1455
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
meaning if there is

1456
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
no congruence

1457
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
if our

1458
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
if our ranking of values

1459
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
is not congruent, is not in conformity

1460
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
with

1461
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
with the ranking of values

1462
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
then there's something evil in it

1463
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
there's something negative in it

1464
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
but not in the

1465
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
in the Christian sense of being a sin

1466
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
okay, other questions?

1467
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
okay

1468
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
okay, no more

1469
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
okay

1470
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
na you have one minute to answer

1471
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
if you are listening to my lecture

1472
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
okay

1473
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
you have one minute to reply

1474
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
if you don't reply, you have one minute

1475
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
that means you are not following my discussion

1476
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
okay

1477
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
may

1478
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
may kindly take note

1479
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
take note of those who replied

1480
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
okay, thank you

1481
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
alright, so

1482
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
that's my way of checking

1483
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
if you are listening to my discussion

1484
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
if you are still here or you just

1485
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
plug in

1486
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
we know some people are dais

1487
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
okay

1488
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but 37

1489
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
alright, let's continue

1490
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
values as intentional objects

1491
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
of feelings

1492
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
so again, we recall

1493
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
the notion

1494
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
of intentional objects of consciousness

1495
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
of who's heart

1496
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
okay

1497
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
consciousness is always consciousness of something

1498
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and

1499
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
the consciousness

1500
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
has intentional objects

1501
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
now, Sheller adopted this thesis

1502
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
of

1503
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
who's heart

1504
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
okay, that the ideal objects

1505
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
of knowledge

1506
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
are independent of the knowing subject

1507
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
so the ideal objects

1508
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
of knowledge, these are the intentional

1509
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
objects of our consciousness

1510
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
so

1511
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Sheller adopted this idea

1512
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and he applied this

1513
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
to his

1514
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
disclosure of the realm of values

1515
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
just as there are

1516
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
intentional objects of knowledge

1517
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
the ideal objects of knowledge

1518
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
he contended

1519
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
that there are also intentional objects

1520
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
of feelings

1521
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and what are these intentional objects of feelings

1522
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
the values

1523
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
right

1524
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
so the

1525
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
ideal objects of knowledge are a priori

1526
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and the values are also

1527
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
a priori

1528
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
so what are values

1529
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
these are particular class of ideal

1530
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
objects

1531
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
which are objective, eternal

1532
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
and immutable

1533
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
so values are

1534
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
given to us as intentional

1535
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
objects of our feelings

1536
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
just as colors

1537
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
are

1538
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
the objects of our

1539
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
visual perception

1540
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
so concepts

1541
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
are objects of our thoughts

1542
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
colors and the other

1543
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
material qualities

1544
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
are the objects of our senses

1545
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
values

1546
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
are the objects of our feelings

1547
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and just like

1548
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
the concepts

1549
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
they are objective

1550
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
eternal

1551
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and immutable

1552
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
so

1553
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
the modes in which

1554
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
values are knowable to us

1555
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
are beyond the grasp

1556
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
of the intellect

1557
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
so the intellect grasp

1558
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
our grasp

1559
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
as the

1560
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
the essence

1561
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
for example

1562
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
the ideas

1563
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
the values

1564
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
are grasped by our feelings

1565
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
how our feelings are grasped

1566
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
by our emotion

1567
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
is beyond

1568
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
the understanding

1569
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
of the intellect or reason

1570
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
it has its own reason

1571
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
that reason cannot understand

1572
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
so according to Scheller

1573
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
just as

1574
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
the ear

1575
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
is blind

1576
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
to color

1577
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
so the intellect

1578
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
is blind to

1579
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the values

1580
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
so the emotional aspects of the mind

1581
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
feelings

1582
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
preferring

1583
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
loving, hating, willing

1584
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
because these are

1585
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
the emotional acts

1586
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the mind has its own acts

1587
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
the intellect rather

1588
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
the intellect has its own acts

1589
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
apprehension, judgment

1590
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
analyzing, critiquing

1591
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
disputing, et cetera

1592
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
the emotional aspects of our minds

1593
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
have also its own acts

1594
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
feeling, preparing, loving

1595
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
hating, willing

1596
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and so on

1597
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and they are not founded upon cognition

1598
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
but are of an

1599
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
apprehensive character

1600
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
in our emotional feeling

1601
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
we feel something

1602
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
for example

1603
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
this or that particular value quality

1604
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
why do we prefer this

1605
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
why do we feel for this

1606
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
for Scheller

1607
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
we prefer

1608
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
our emotion has its own reason

1609
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
but

1610
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
reason, the intellect

1611
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
cannot explain why we prefer this

1612
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
of course later on you can have

1613
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
your own rational

1614
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
deliberation why you prefer

1615
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
contemporary music

1616
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
over classical music

1617
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
so according to Scheller

1618
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
there is a very rational preferring of this

1619
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
that cannot be explained by reason

1620
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
so intentional objects

1621
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
intentional

1622
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
feeling functions

1623
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
do not need the intermediary

1624
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
of the objectifying acts of the intellect

1625
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
like representing

1626
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and judging or analysis

1627
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
in order to come into immediate contact

1628
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
with their objects

1629
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
values for example as agreeable

1630
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
charming

1631
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
lovely, friendly, et cetera

1632
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
in principle

1633
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
are accessible to me

1634
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
without my having

1635
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
to represent them

1636
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
as properties belonging to

1637
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
things or men

1638
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
values are not conceptual terms

1639
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
which find their fulfillment

1640
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
in the common properties

1641
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
of things which are the

1642
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
bearers of these values

1643
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
for example when you say

1644
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
what is

1645
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
a house

1646
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
what is your idea of

1647
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
an institution

1648
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
what is your idea

1649
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
of beauty

1650
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
now when you think of

1651
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
your idea of beauty then you are going to

1652
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
come up with certain common characteristics

1653
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
but why do you

1654
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
find this thing beautiful

1655
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
can you give

1656
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
an enumerable common properties

1657
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
of things according to Scheller when you do that

1658
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
sometimes you end up

1659
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
empty-handed

1660
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
because when you say

1661
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I find this charming

1662
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and then I also find this thing charming

1663
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and then I also find this charming

1664
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
but when you look at these things

1665
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
they have nothing in common

1666
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
why do you consider this

1667
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
to be agreeable

1668
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and this is agreeable also

1669
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
why do you have that feeling

1670
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
you cannot

1671
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
give a reason because

1672
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
it is beyond

1673
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
reason

1674
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
beyond reason

1675
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
meaning it is not

1676
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
within the realm of

1677
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
reason

1678
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
so according to Scheller

1679
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
this is shown by the simple

1680
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
fact that it's time we attempt

1681
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
to determine such common

1682
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
properties

1683
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
of what is charming to us

1684
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
or lovely or friendly to us

1685
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
we always end up empty

1686
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and dead

1687
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
even the habitual

1688
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
or even the ethical values

1689
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
or aesthetic values like normal, courageous

1690
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
and as beautiful

1691
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
becomes accessible

1692
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
not through a number of defined characteristics

1693
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I find this

1694
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I find this beautiful

1695
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I find this accessible

1696
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
this is normal

1697
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
so that's the point of Scheller

1698
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
of course other philosophers

1699
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
are critical of this position

1700
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
but

1701
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
here's a point here also

1702
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
so values are independent

1703
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
of our subjective emotional states

1704
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
what is our subjective emotional states

1705
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
like for example when you are sad

1706
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
sadness

1707
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
is an emotional state

1708
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
but the sadness I feel may involve

1709
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
in me various emotional sentiments

1710
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
so being brokenhearted, being defiant

1711
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
being composed, jatra

1712
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
these are our subjective emotional states

1713
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
now the feeling of sadness remains

1714
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
while my subjective emotional state

1715
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
may change

1716
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
at one point I'm sad so I become brokenhearted

1717
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
or I am defiant

1718
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
or yeah I may be sad

1719
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
but I'm sad composed

1720
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
moreover the causes

1721
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
must not be confused with emotional

1722
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
with intentional object

1723
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the question for example

1724
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
why am I angry

1725
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
is entirely different

1726
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
from what do I feel

1727
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
so what do I feel

1728
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
is your subjective states

1729
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
why am I angry

1730
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
my anger

1731
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
anger is the emotion

1732
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and what is the object of this anger

1733
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
it may be something else

1734
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
that represents

1735
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
a particular value

1736
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
so I am angry because

1737
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I was defiant

1738
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
okay

1739
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
my instructions were not followed

1740
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
okay

1741
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
so not following instruction causes me to be angry

1742
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
but what is it in

1743
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
this not following

1744
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
following my order that made me angry

1745
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
so not obeying instruction

1746
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
not following represents a particular value

1747
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
that makes me angry

1748
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
that becomes the object of my anger

1749
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
okay

1750
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
because

1751
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I am going to be angry

1752
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
not only because somebody

1753
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
defied me

1754
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
or somebody did not follow

1755
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
my instruction

1756
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I may also be angry because somebody betrayed me

1757
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
so betrayal

1758
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
this obedience

1759
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
they represent a particular value

1760
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
which is the object of my anger

1761
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
so a value phenomena

1762
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
as a value phenomena

1763
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
values are true objects

1764
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and they are different from all states

1765
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
of feelings

1766
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
there is a difference between

1767
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
feeling of sadness

1768
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
feeling of anger

1769
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and the values

1770
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that are the objects of my

1771
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
anger or of my sadness

1772
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
now

1773
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
values are independent

1774
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
of their bearers or carriers

1775
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
what is this bearer or carriers

1776
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
these are things or relations

1777
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
that shell are collectively called the goods

1778
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
the goods are units

1779
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
of value qualities

1780
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
which instantiates

1781
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
objectifies

1782
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
the value in the real world

1783
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
the value qualities do not change

1784
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
when these goods

1785
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
when these bearers

1786
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
change

1787
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
so for example

1788
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
let's use an analogy

1789
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
let's talk about the color

1790
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
this is the color blue

1791
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
now thus the color blue

1792
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
turns red

1793
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
when

1794
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
an object that is blue

1795
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
becomes red

1796
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
like for example

1797
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
a dress

1798
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
so dress

1799
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
bears

1800
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
or carries

1801
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
the value bears the color

1802
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
so

1803
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
if this dress

1804
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
which instantiates

1805
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
the color blue

1806
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
becomes red

1807
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
so it's now a red dress

1808
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
thus the color blue

1809
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
change into red

1810
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
no

1811
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
the color blue

1812
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
remains blue

1813
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
the color red

1814
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
remains red

1815
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
but the dress which instantiates

1816
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
which is the carrier

1817
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
or the bearer

1818
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
of the colors

1819
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
have changed

1820
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
it now carries a different color

1821
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
so it's not true

1822
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that values are affected

1823
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
by their order

1824
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
when their bearers

1825
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
change in value

1826
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
food is still food

1827
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
poison is still poison

1828
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
the value of friendship does not change

1829
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
even when your friend

1830
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
changes

1831
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
so this person

1832
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
who carries the value of friendship

1833
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
becomes your enemy

1834
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
he now instantiates

1835
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
not the value of friendship

1836
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
he now instantiates the value of an enemy

1837
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
friendship

1838
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
did not turn into

1839
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
being unfriendly

1840
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
so goods are value

1841
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
things

1842
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
they are bearers of value

1843
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
for example

1844
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
when you go

1845
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
go inside the church

1846
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
see the altar

1847
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
the altar may carry

1848
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
or may bear certain values

1849
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
may have

1850
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
aesthetic value

1851
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
because it's very beautiful

1852
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
or it may also bear

1853
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
the value of the holy

1854
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
so the altar is just a bearer of value

1855
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
it can instantiate

1856
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
the value of

1857
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
beautiful

1858
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
for the value of the holy

1859
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
so it's like saying

1860
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
the absence of light

1861
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
is not

1862
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
saying darkness

1863
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
para pang ganun

1864
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
what do you mean?

1865
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
parang

1866
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
mayapuban, ayusin kumunayin tanong

1867
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
ok

1868
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
other questions?

1869
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
ok, let's read

1870
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
the a prioristic structure of values

1871
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
so

1872
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
sheller made a distinction between

1873
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
the realm of values

1874
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and the realm of goods

1875
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
and his assertion that values are independent

1876
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
of the bearers of values

1877
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
affirmed the correctness of Kant's view

1878
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
that a philosophical theory of values

1879
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
or ethics or even aesthetics

1880
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
must not presuppose things

1881
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
or goods

1882
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
they agree on this

1883
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
they agree on this sense

1884
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
on this point

1885
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
that there is a distinction

1886
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
between the realm of values

1887
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and the realm of goods

1888
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
that instantiate them

1889
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
so for example a particular person

1890
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
may instantiate several values

1891
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
the values of friendship

1892
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
the values of courage

1893
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
the values of health

1894
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the values of holy

1895
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
the values of intelligence

1896
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
so there is some

1897
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
independence between the realm of values

1898
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and the realm of goods that instantiate them

1899
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
so it does not mean that for example

1900
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
the value of the holy

1901
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
turns to be unholy when

1902
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
a holy person becomes unholy

1903
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
it's just that

1904
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
that person no longer instantates

1905
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the value of the holy

1906
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
so that's the a priori

1907
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
thing about

1908
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
this realm of values

1909
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
now

1910
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
the a prioristic relation

1911
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
of values

1912
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
all values are

1913
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
either positive or negative

1914
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
okay

1915
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
there's no such thing as

1916
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
a neutral

1917
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
value

1918
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
okay

1919
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
there's always a value

1920
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
there's always a quality

1921
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
of worth

1922
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
positive or negative

1923
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
the existence

1924
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
of a positive value

1925
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
is in itself

1926
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
positive

1927
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
the existence of holiness is positive

1928
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
the nonexistence

1929
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
of a negative value

1930
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
is also positive

1931
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
so if

1932
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
for example chaos

1933
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
chaos is a negative value

1934
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
there's no chaos

1935
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
that's something positive

1936
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
the nonexistence of positive value

1937
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and the existence of a negative value

1938
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
is a negative value

1939
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
so

1940
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
nobody's holy

1941
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
there's no holiness

1942
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
that's a negative value

1943
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
it's impossible to evaluate

1944
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
the same value simultaneously

1945
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
as both negative and positive

1946
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
a barrier of value

1947
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
at object

1948
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
may instantiate two values

1949
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
okay

1950
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
like for example a person

1951
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
may instantiate both

1952
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
friendship

1953
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
okay

1954
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
or love or instantiate hate

1955
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
but love and hate

1956
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
cannot be

1957
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
simultaneous

1958
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
as a value

1959
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
good is the value attached

1960
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
to the realization of a positive or a higher value

1961
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
evil

1962
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
the value attached to the realization

1963
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
of a negative or a lower value

1964
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
now we're not saying that

1965
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that is immoral in the Christian sense

1966
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
so this is in the actual logical

1967
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
sense

1968
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
now

1969
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
we've already mentioned about the hierarchical

1970
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
order of values

1971
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
values constitute

1972
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
a special domain

1973
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
with their own distinct relation

1974
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and correlation

1975
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and among these

1976
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
there is an order or rank

1977
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
independent of the realm

1978
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
of values

1979
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
so we have already talked about

1980
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
the hierarchy of these values

1981
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
all values are

1982
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
non-formal qualities of contents

1983
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
possessing a determined order

1984
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
of ranks

1985
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
with respect to higher or lower

1986
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
in this order

1987
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
independent

1988
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
of the form of being into its values

1989
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
and terminating

1990
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
the carriers of their

1991
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
the carriers or bearers of these values

1992
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
or the goods that instantiate this value

1993
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
so again

1994
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
this value model

1995
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
those values reveal by

1996
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
sensory feeling, by vital feeling

1997
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
by the spirit

1998
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
and by the holy

1999
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
or holy order religious

2000
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
so this is the ranking

2001
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
of values of shallow

2002
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
well, some people may criticize

2003
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
these ranking of values

2004
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
but that's how shallow

2005
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
ordered

2006
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
rank

2007
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
these values

2008
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
the next topic will be the exemplar persons

2009
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
as shallow said

2010
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
we need to

2011
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
attain

2012
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
a higher moral status

2013
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and the vehicle

2014
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
for attaining a higher moral status

2015
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
is an exemplar

2016
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
meaning a model

2017
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
so an exemplar

2018
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
is an ideal

2019
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
but a non-existent

2020
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
model of one of the value ranks

2021
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
so every value

2022
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
there is

2023
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
an exemplar

2024
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
an ideal model

2025
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that manifest

2026
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
this value

2027
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
these ideal

2028
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
exemplars manifest themselves

2029
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
in historical role models

2030
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
like for example

2031
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
in Buddha, Christ

2032
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Muhammad, Hannibal

2033
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Ronaldo, Joan of Arc

2034
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
et cetera

2035
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
they are our

2036
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
they are the historical

2037
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
role models

2038
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
they manifest the exemplars

2039
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
the nature of an exemplary person

2040
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
is authentic

2041
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
in being exemplary

2042
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
the moral effectiveness

2043
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
of exemplary persons

2044
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
reaches all people directly

2045
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
regardless

2046
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
of occupation, vocation

2047
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
or interest or even culture

2048
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
so the origin

2049
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
of becoming good

2050
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
in concrete practice

2051
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
lies in the genuine exemplarity

2052
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
that a particular person

2053
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
exercises

2054
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
on others

2055
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
without deliberately wanting to do so

2056
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
so for example

2057
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
consider Christ

2058
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
we consider

2059
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
him to be exemplary

2060
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and he exercises

2061
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
or he exercises a particular

2062
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
influence on us

2063
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
without really wanting to

2064
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
be exemplary

2065
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
such exemplarity occurs

2066
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
in living persons

2067
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
so the living persons are the

2068
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
concrete manifestations

2069
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
of the ideal

2070
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
nonexistent exemplars

2071
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
meaning nonexistent

2072
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
well

2073
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
in the same way that values are out there

2074
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
a priori

2075
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
they belong to a different realm

2076
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
the exemplars also belong to a different realm

2077
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
but they are manifested

2078
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
in historic

2079
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
in history so there are also

2080
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
living persons

2081
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
who manifest them

2082
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
okay

2083
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
but of course

2084
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
only outlines of ideal persons

2085
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
which are embedded in our

2086
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
value feelings so in the words

2087
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
for example you have your own

2088
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
ideal

2089
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
boyfriend or ideal

2090
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
girlfriend

2091
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
we exist in that

2092
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
in that ideal world of yours

2093
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
but that will be

2094
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
some living

2095
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
concrete people who would

2096
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
somehow manifest

2097
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
this ideal boyfriend or girlfriend

2098
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
okay

2099
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
so

2100
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
there are empirical model persons

2101
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
meaning

2102
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
these are concrete living persons

2103
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
so manifest our ideal

2104
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
and the first concrete

2105
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
empirical model persons

2106
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
are our parents

2107
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
so they become

2108
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
the models for us

2109
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
and then of course

2110
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
our models

2111
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
they grow meaning

2112
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
okay so parents

2113
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
okay

2114
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
and some other people can also have

2115
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
a strong exemplary effect

2116
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
on us

2117
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
a teacher

2118
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
a president

2119
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
a prince, sex man, artist

2120
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
performer

2121
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
an actor perhaps

2122
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
depending on the particular

2123
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
culture

2124
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
it could be the chief of a tribe

2125
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
or our ancestors

2126
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
or our wise men

2127
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
masters

2128
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
in different cultures

2129
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
but according to him

2130
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
it is the exemplary holy man

2131
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
who exercises

2132
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
the strongest moral influence

2133
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
in history

2134
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
like for example Jesus

2135
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Muhammad

2136
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Buddha and only other

2137
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
holy men in history

2138
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and what is common

2139
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
among them is that they did not

2140
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
choose

2141
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
or explicitly willed

2142
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
to be exemplary

2143
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
nor were they chosen

2144
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
by those who freely follow them

2145
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
genuine role models

2146
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
or model persons

2147
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
almost automatically set up

2148
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
moral standards for other people to follow

2149
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
so people are drawn

2150
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
towards them

2151
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and are motivated by their exemplaryity

2152
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
no matter how deeply

2153
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
or silently

2154
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
they follow

2155
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
these role models

2156
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
or the holy

2157
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
or moral persons

2158
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in contrast to the empirical model persons

2159
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
an ideal model person

2160
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
is only an exemplary

2161
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
outline in our mind

2162
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
so like your

2163
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
ideal boyfriend or girlfriend

2164
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
it's just there in our mind

2165
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
in the same way

2166
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
as values do exist

2167
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
at least they are realized

2168
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
in materials

2169
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
or by persons

2170
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
so all these absolute value types

2171
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
do not exist

2172
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
unless their ideal value

2173
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
is realized

2174
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
with concrete persons

2175
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
okay

2176
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
so your ideal boyfriend or girlfriend

2177
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
is just there

2178
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
but it will functionalize

2179
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
if they are

2180
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
you have some concrete person

2181
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
to embody them

2182
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
so according to Scheller

2183
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
these ideal outlines should functionalize themselves

2184
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
with concrete person

2185
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
now

2186
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
based on the

2187
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
values there are five

2188
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
ideal moral person types

2189
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the ideal personifications

2190
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
of the aforementioned

2191
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
value ranks

2192
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
so they are the highest

2193
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
would be the ideal saint

2194
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
then the ideal genius

2195
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
then lower the ideal hero

2196
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
then the ideal

2197
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
leader of a society

2198
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
or of a civilization

2199
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and then the absolute master

2200
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
of enjoying sensible

2201
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
pleasures

2202
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
so these are the ideal

2203
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
moral person types

2204
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and you can think of

2205
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
of course of

2206
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
empirical

2207
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
concrete persons

2208
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
who may functionalize

2209
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
these ideal

2210
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
moral

2211
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
person types

2212
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
now in the same sense

2213
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
as values are experienced relative

2214
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
to the individual's natures

2215
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
historical manifestations

2216
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
of ideal person types may vary

2217
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
so for example

2218
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
the ideal hero

2219
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
would have different appearances

2220
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
like for example in Joan of Arc

2221
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
or in Alexander the Great

2222
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
the ideal artist

2223
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
may vary

2224
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
in a bit hoven

2225
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
or in a Michael Angelo

2226
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
and even the ideal saints

2227
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
may vary

2228
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
subject to the choices

2229
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
between

2230
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
them since one can make choices

2231
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
only among the lower

2232
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
sorry

2233
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
but it vary

2234
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
depending on the religion

2235
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
but in the latter

2236
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
the founders of religion

2237
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
are not subject to choices

2238
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
between them because

2239
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
one can make choices

2240
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
only among the lower types of

2241
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
exemplars

2242
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
so if a person converts to

2243
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
or otherwise begins to abandon

2244
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
the original fate

2245
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
now there may be some defection

2246
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
or even betrayal

2247
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
something that does not occur when one

2248
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
makes a choice among the lower

2249
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
exemplars

2250
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
okay so there are many

2251
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
different

2252
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
personifications

2253
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
of these

2254
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
ideal types

2255
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
okay

2256
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
now let's go to the last

2257
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
topic here

2258
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
the moral person

2259
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
what is the moral person

2260
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Sheller

2261
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
retains Kant's understanding of person

2262
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
as having an absolute

2263
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
value and end in

2264
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
itself remember

2265
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
the

2266
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
second articulation of the

2267
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
categorical imperative

2268
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
treat the person whether

2269
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
in you or in others to be

2270
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
not only as a means

2271
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
but as an end in itself

2272
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
so Sheller

2273
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
as we have said it was influence

2274
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
by Kant retain that

2275
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
idea of a person

2276
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
as having

2277
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
an absolute value

2278
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
however he is critical of Kant

2279
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
as Kant grounds the absolute value of the person

2280
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
in the universal category

2281
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
of reason that's understandable

2282
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
after discussing his criticism

2283
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
of the

2284
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
formalism of Kant

2285
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
now Sheller describes the person

2286
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
as the concrete unity of acts

2287
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
of

2288
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
different types of nature

2289
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
concrete unity of acts

2290
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
so the person is present in each

2291
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
and every act

2292
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
my person

2293
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
is present in its

2294
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
in every act that I perform

2295
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
but the person

2296
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
is not reducible to any

2297
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
of one act

2298
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
okay so I am present

2299
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
in all my action but my person

2300
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
cannot be reduced in one particular

2301
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
act that I perform

2302
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
unity here means

2303
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
a particular style

2304
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
particular style of acting

2305
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
style of

2306
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
executing my action

2307
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
or of being

2308
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
so every individual

2309
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
will have his or her unique

2310
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
style of loving

2311
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
of assigning meaning

2312
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
of

2313
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
willing

2314
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
of choosing

2315
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
and necessarily has his own

2316
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
or her own access to the world

2317
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and when a person dies

2318
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
not only

2319
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
is that the style of loving

2320
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
of assigning or choosing

2321
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
thinking is lost

2322
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
but so is that

2323
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
world

2324
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
is own access to that world

2325
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
it is also lost

2326
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
now

2327
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
for Sheller

2328
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
our being a person

2329
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
is the form of our mind

2330
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and of our consciousness

2331
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
no matter whether

2332
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
mind and consciousness are understood

2333
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
to be human, divine

2334
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
or just fictional

2335
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Sheller rejected the notion

2336
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
of a pure consciousness

2337
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
or mind

2338
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
similar like

2339
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
what Husserl

2340
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
stressed or affirmed

2341
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
so the person is just

2342
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
the form of our mind

2343
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
okay

2344
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
so

2345
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
the form of a person

2346
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
is indifferent

2347
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
to gender, culture

2348
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
race and social station

2349
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
so the person manifests itself

2350
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
without reference

2351
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
among men and women

2352
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
culture, race, social station

2353
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
et cetera

2354
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
among Asian or European

2355
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
ancient people's culture

2356
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
American or Asian

2357
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
et cetera et cetera

2358
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
whether it's or poor it doesn't matter

2359
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
okay

2360
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
the person is different to all this

2361
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
the existence of the form

2362
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
of our mind the person

2363
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
is not also comparable

2364
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
to the existence of a thing

2365
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
when we ask the existence

2366
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
of a thing

2367
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
is it's being an object to us

2368
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
personal existence

2369
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
consists only in the

2370
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
execution of mental

2371
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
volitional

2372
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
and emotive acts

2373
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
so as persons we execute

2374
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
mental acts, volitional acts

2375
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
emotive acts

2376
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
so we cannot be reduced

2377
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
to a thing or an object

2378
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
because objects and

2379
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
things do not act

2380
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
mentally, volitionally

2381
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
or emotionally

2382
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
so such acts are for example

2383
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
that the person is capable

2384
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
of loving, of feeling

2385
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
thinking, willing

2386
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
remembering, expecting, hoping

2387
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
despairing, choosing

2388
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
et cetera et cetera

2389
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
now also

2390
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
share other content that

2391
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
the word person cannot be applied to

2392
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
to a being

2393
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
where we assume animation

2394
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
eagleness

2395
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
consciousness of existence

2396
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
or value of the ego

2397
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
it cannot be applied to man

2398
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
in general

2399
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
the phenomenological essence

2400
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
of person reveals that although

2401
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
there are scenes of personhood

2402
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
in still and developed

2403
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
levels of human beingness

2404
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
like for example in the case

2405
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
of children, in the case of

2406
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
it cannot be applied

2407
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
or it can only be applied

2408
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
to a specific level of human existence

2409
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
or a certain kind of man

2410
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
where certain characteristics

2411
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
are already there

2412
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
so for example babies

2413
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
or share other babies

2414
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
who are not be

2415
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
they already have

2416
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
the scenes of personhood

2417
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
but they cannot be considered

2418
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
to be person yet because

2419
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
they are not capable of

2420
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
this unity

2421
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
of acts

2422
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
of course there are persons

2423
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
because they are already

2424
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
they have the scenes of personhood

2425
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
but they cannot be considered person

2426
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
in the full sense of

2427
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
moral personhood

2428
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
okay?

2429
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
it's like

2430
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
it's like our notion of the age of

2431
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
maturity

2432
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
or age of, for example

2433
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
at this particular age

2434
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
18 years old then you are

2435
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
already a full citizen

2436
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
because you already have

2437
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
attained a certain degree of maturity

2438
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
so something similar to that

2439
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
now

2440
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
the imperative that is given

2441
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
in the value a priori

2442
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
in the objective ranks of values

2443
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
is only felt by person

2444
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
so consequently persons

2445
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
are the only beings

2446
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
who are ethically responsible

2447
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
and because every experience

2448
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
is evaluated

2449
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
a person

2450
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
is responsible

2451
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
to love the object

2452
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
or a being of that experience

2453
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
most fully

2454
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
so for example in relation to other persons

2455
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
it's the responsibility

2456
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
and ethical responsibility

2457
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
of the person to love

2458
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
so in loving another person

2459
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
one is called

2460
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
ethically to love

2461
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
even more

2462
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
fully and deeply because

2463
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
the object of that love

2464
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
is a person

2465
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
who has the highest

2466
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
or the absolute value

2467
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
now finally

2468
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
let's talk about what are the characteristics

2469
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
of a person

2470
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
for shellar

2471
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
the person possesses

2472
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
a holy sound mind

2473
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
so the person

2474
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
is somebody

2475
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
who executes intentional acts

2476
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
that are bound

2477
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
by a unity of sense

2478
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
not the unity that we talked about

2479
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
a while ago

2480
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
person is subscribed only to a certain level

2481
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
of development

2482
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
so eagerness

2483
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
possession of a soul

2484
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
consciousness of self

2485
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
do not make a man

2486
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
a person in the moral

2487
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
sense

2488
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
because you have to perform

2489
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
actions

2490
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
the emotive

2491
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
the volitional and the mental acts

2492
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
a child

2493
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
or a person coming

2494
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
of age

2495
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
has the ability to experience

2496
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
inside difference

2497
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
between one act and other acts

2498
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
so if a child can already

2499
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
experience this

2500
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
then he can consider to be

2501
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
a moral person

2502
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
so he is able to

2503
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
in a different shape

2504
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
and conscious of his ability

2505
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
conscious of his ability

2506
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
defines a person

2507
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
so the question is

2508
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
what about the embassy

2509
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
for the embassy

2510
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
the men retarded

2511
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
while they have the seeds of personhood

2512
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
they cannot be considered to be

2513
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
moral persons

2514
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
so person is restricted

2515
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
to those in whom

2516
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
domination over the live

2517
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
body appears immediately

2518
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
he is a master

2519
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
a mastery of his live body

2520
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and

2521
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
lastly the concrete subject

2522
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
of all acts of the essence

2523
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
of inner intuition

2524
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
and therefore for Scheller

2525
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
the person is

2526
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
only

2527
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
as the concrete unity of acts

2528
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
executed by the person

2529
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
and only

2530
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
in the execution of these

2531
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
acts

2532
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
can a person be considered to be

2533
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
a moral

2534
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
person

2535
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
but just to clarify

2536
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
man

2537
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
all men whether it's

2538
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
a baby or an embassy

2539
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
they contain the seeds

2540
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
of personhood

2541
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
only that because

2542
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
they have not attained a certain degree

2543
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
of moral maturity

2544
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
then they cannot be considered to be

2545
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
a moral person

2546
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
ok so that concludes

2547
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
my presentation on this topic

2548
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
this is not the whole of Scheller

2549
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
we have only discussed

2550
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
what is

2551
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
what he discussed in the

2552
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
their formalism was not even whole of it

2553
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
not even whole of it

2554
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
and I already mentioned

2555
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
many of some of the

2556
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
important works of Max Scheller

2557
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
but I hope that this presentation

2558
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
will give you

2559
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
you know

2560
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
you may introduce

2561
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
give you an overview

2562
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
of the

2563
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
philosophy or at least the philosophy

2564
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
of values of Max Scheller
