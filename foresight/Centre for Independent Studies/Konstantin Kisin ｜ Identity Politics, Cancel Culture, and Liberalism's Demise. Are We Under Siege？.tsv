0	13160	I lead our education program at the CIS, which is a great privilege and a great privilege
13160	17040	to be with you all tonight and also to have Konstantin here with us.
17040	21920	Konstantin, I'm very mindful about your safety and the safety of everybody.
21920	26040	So with that in mind, I do want to respect your preferred pronouns.
26040	28400	I understand that.
28400	33280	You do identify as a Bay-Them politically non-binary.
33280	35240	What does that mean?
35240	40080	I think it's very important to think for yourself on everything.
40080	47320	And my experience is that whenever you buy into a political ideology wholesale,
47320	50520	you inevitably end up in positions where you're having to think stupid things
50520	52920	because other people think them.
52920	58160	I don't see that as a healthy way to run your brain, first and foremost.
58160	63480	Now, of course, when your ideas begin to translate into political decisions,
63480	66480	you have a binary choice quite frequently at an election,
66480	71200	although I now understand in this country you have a non-binary system for voting to some extent.
71200	76160	So my primary interest is in trying to understand the world
76160	78560	and get as close to the truth as I possibly can,
78560	81960	which of course all of us are inevitably unsuccessful in.
81960	87960	And therefore, to buy a prepackaged set of ideas just seems to me a little bit naive.
87960	92600	I think left, right, up, down, liberal, conservative, whatever,
92600	94880	they all have flaws in their thinking.
94880	98560	And I'm interested in finding the distinctions and trying to understand,
98560	104480	well, I think, for example, the inequality in our society is a massive problem.
104480	106520	Intergenerational inequality is a massive problem.
106520	110960	And to the extent that the left used to care about that, I agree with the left.
110960	115360	There are also issues that I agree with, you know, conservatives and classical liberals on as well.
115360	120080	So mainly it's about insisting on the ability to think for myself.
120080	124040	And so at the moment, you flag the sort of left, right binary
124040	128400	and the way that you're straddling that, I suppose.
128400	131760	Why is it the left and right labels?
131760	134480	Why do they not mean what they used to mean?
134480	139680	Well, they're both breaking down because what I used to think of as the left,
139680	145760	which I used to be on, due to a combination of ignorance and cowardice,
145760	150240	mostly cowardice, to be honest, have allowed themselves to be derailed
150240	153080	by the people who call themselves progressive.
153080	159040	And my good friend in the UK, Morris Glassman, who's a member of the House of Lords,
159040	164000	he always says this, you know, if you go to the doctor and they say to you, it's progressive.
164000	168800	It's not good news, usually.
168840	176040	So the left has allowed itself to be derailed from its core purpose by the people who are.
176040	180280	And I mean, I mean, absolutely no bones about saying this.
180280	185320	The people who we talk about when we mean the woke left, these are these, you know,
185320	190400	race Marxist or cultural Marxist, these people are the enemy of Western civilization.
190400	192240	There's no discussion. There's no debate.
192240	197520	It's not these people want to destroy the foundations of Western civilization.
197560	201360	That's what they want.
201360	206880	And so if you are the sensible left, which is the majority of people on the left,
206880	210240	and you allow these people to be the tail that wags your dog,
210240	213320	well, then the whole meaning of these words starts to break down.
213320	217520	And by the way, you give ammunition to people on the right who are going to say,
217520	218720	oh, the left are all like this.
218720	221320	Well, if you don't speak up, then that's all happened.
221320	224840	Or if you do speak up as as I found out and many other people find out,
224840	226160	then you become right wing.
226200	228320	So there we go.
228320	231280	So it's well trodden that the the flaws of the left,
231280	235360	when it comes to the aversion around Western civilization,
235360	237840	but the left are on the loan in some of those criticisms.
237840	241200	So just as the left might complain that, you know, big corporations,
241200	244720	for instance, have destroyed society or hollowed it out and so on.
244720	249440	It's also true, is it not that the right have also got this tinge about complaining
249440	250760	about society increasingly?
250760	254360	It's the issues of, I guess, an elite of sorts as well,
254360	256560	that particularly around bureaucracy and so on,
256560	260280	that undermines the true society itself.
260280	264240	But does the right have as much to blame in the current debate?
264240	266440	I see it as a little bit of cause and effect.
266440	270320	I think that many of the policies that progressives have pursued
270320	272080	have created a society.
272080	274320	You're fortunate in this country that you don't have this,
274320	277480	but you only need to travel around major American cities
277480	283120	or come to London to see, I mean, it looks like a zombie apocalypse,
283120	283760	to be honest.
283800	286840	You know, you go to LA, you go to New York, you go to, I mean,
286840	290960	Nashville, anywhere, and there's literally people lying face down on the ground
290960	292640	with most of their clothes off.
292640	296120	And that's because, you know, for all sorts of different reasons,
296120	299680	but primarily because of the policies that governments have pursued.
299680	303600	So as the level of street crime and violent crime increases,
303600	306200	as people see disorder around them,
306200	310400	it's natural for them to get very frustrated about what is happening.
310400	311720	And I agree with you.
311720	315000	I think there is a section of the right, particularly in the United States,
315000	322160	that is so fed up of the inability to vote your way out of this growing nightmare,
322160	328120	frankly, you know, that instead of helping the police to do a better job,
328120	330800	we have these slogans like defund the police.
330800	333640	All of this stuff is causing people to get frustrated.
333640	337080	And then they say, well, look, democracy isn't working.
337080	339200	So maybe Vladimir Putin is brilliant, you know.
340200	345000	Here in Australia, there's been, there's a poll that's done annually,
345000	348000	which asks Australians about their attitudes towards society,
348000	349760	system of government and so on.
349760	355080	And what that's typically shown us is that an increasing number of people,
355080	357840	especially young people, and it's around one in three,
357840	362960	who say that they're unsatisfied with democracy around one in five,
362960	367840	say that they'd prefer an alternative to democracy.
367960	371200	And these numbers, of course, are much higher for young people, especially.
372880	377520	And one of the main reasons that people say that they're not satisfied with democracy
377520	380280	is that they feel that the system no longer works for the majority,
380280	381760	but works for a minority.
383200	385280	Are we all doing democracy wrong?
385280	387560	Well, it's shocking numbers, isn't it, that they're that low?
389920	390560	Well, it is.
390560	393800	I mean, look, the fact is that Western elites,
393800	395680	and I use this phrase advisedly,
395680	398640	have had their heads up their asses for a very long time now,
398640	401040	and they are insistent on maintaining them there,
401040	402920	no matter how many wake-up calls they get.
402920	406680	Look, I voted Remain in the Brexit referendum,
406680	411880	and frankly, if you'd asked me on the morning after why half of my fellow citizens voted from Brexit,
411880	414720	I would have had no idea, right?
414720	418320	But what I took away from that is that I am the ignorant one,
418320	420680	and it's my job to educate myself, right?
420680	425880	What the elites took from that is they need to suppress that movement as quickly as possible.
425880	427280	This was the same with Donald Trump.
427280	428680	Donald Trump gets elected.
428680	429320	What do they do?
429320	432640	Do they say, oh, my God, I can't believe this guy is so obnoxious.
432640	437240	How badly, how desperate must these people be to vote for Donald Trump?
437240	437840	No.
437840	439840	What they do is they go, oh, it's Russia collusions.
439840	441840	The Russians, they said the same with Brexit.
441840	445840	The Russians did Brexit, and I kept saying to these people,
445840	449680	if the Russians didn't vote Brexit, it would be over by now, you know?
449680	453800	We would have taken the chunk of France with us.
453800	461040	So there is this, there is a tyranny of the mind that is happening among people who are comfortable
461040	463360	and who are so attached to the reins of power.
463360	467600	This is why they keep talking, oh, you know, this is a danger to our democracy.
467600	471840	That's why they say our, because it's their democracy, not democracy for anyone else,
471840	475120	because the moment anyone votes in a way they don't like,
475120	477200	they try and overturn it one way or another.
477200	481640	And this makes me sound like some great defender of orange man bad.
481640	482600	I'm not.
482600	483680	I'm just objective.
483680	488400	And objectively, they spent the entire four years trying to undermine the outcome of the election,
488400	490040	lied about him endlessly.
490040	492480	They claimed, and people should go and look at this.
492480	496880	And many people even in our circles still believe this, the idea that he said, for example,
496880	499440	that there are fine people on both sides.
499440	500400	This isn't true.
500400	503120	You can go and watch the video in which he condemns those people.
503120	505120	He says they should be condemned absolutely.
505120	508720	All they did is they quoted him out of context and then they presented it.
508720	513040	And they did this over and over and over and over again.
513040	514080	Why did they do it?
514080	517680	Because they're not willing to accept that somebody might disagree with them.
517680	523320	And if they keep doing this, we are going to get to a very dangerous place very quickly.
523320	528720	So in a free marketplace of ideas, one would expect that we would be able to say,
528720	532120	here's video, Trump says this thing, here's another version of it.
532120	535880	And that free exchange should, in theory, bring the truth to the surface.
535880	539880	That's at least a textbook case that so much was familiar with.
539880	543000	You know, there's a famous basketball baseball player in America,
543000	545280	Yogi Berra, who was known for his witticisms.
545280	549680	And he said, in theory, there's no difference between theory and practice.
549680	550920	In practice, there is.
550920	555120	And that's kind of, I think that answers your question.
555120	560880	In practice, we have a mainstream media which is dying.
560880	562040	It's dying for a reason.
562040	567240	And the reason is that they have discredited themselves over a long period of time
567240	572160	by spreading things that later turn out not to be true and driving these narratives.
572160	576920	There's a, I wrote a thread on Twitter that went viral on the subject
576920	580960	that I later made as a video and it's a chapter in my book as well.
580960	582360	It was called Why Don't They Believe Us?
582360	586200	And the reason people are increasingly not believing the mainstream media
586200	590800	is the arrogance with which they have purported these lies
590800	593960	on the publics of the Western countries.
593960	598560	I think what is required is a little bit more humility and admitting wrong.
598560	603480	And I always say this to someone who increasingly has interactions
603480	606080	with people in the mainstream media, giving interviews, et cetera.
606080	609760	No personal, you know, no faith in the mainstream media,
609760	612040	so vice-first contact with the mainstream media.
612040	616600	You know, and an example of this, and I'm not bitter,
616600	620520	but an example of this is after my Oxford speech,
620520	623840	a journalist from the New Statesman came and interviewed me
623840	628120	and he asked me how many views the video of my speech had got.
628120	631520	And I said, it's very difficult to measure because, you know,
631520	634040	it goes into people's telegram groups and WhatsApp groups
634040	636440	and people posting a way that you're not able to track.
636440	638200	So you can't really say.
638200	642000	And he wrote that I'd said that the number of views on the speech
642000	643760	is beyond measure.
643760	647720	LAUGHTER
647720	651120	So the mainstream media have done a very bad job
651120	654280	of maintaining their credibility.
654280	656880	Oh, I mean, it is approaching beyond measure at the moment.
656880	657880	That's...
659600	665280	So, look, the mainstream media, you point out, is dying.
665320	667960	You run a platform like several others
667960	671640	that we broadly define in a family of new media.
671640	674760	And what strikes me is really powerful about new media
674760	679160	is it doesn't have the same opportunity to cancel, if you like,
679160	681680	that mainstream media has. It doesn't have the same conventions.
681680	687000	It provides that free access to masses to be able to access
687000	689040	diverse opinions, diverse perspectives,
689040	693880	and be able to, in many cases, share and disseminate freely.
694720	698200	In some respects, it seems to me this is a set of platforms
698200	702800	that protect against cancellation for those reasons.
702800	706240	And so many more people, when we look at these numbers,
706240	709800	consume new media than consume old media.
709800	712480	Does that mean old media will just die itself out?
712480	715320	We'll see. And by the way, I wouldn't want people to take away
715320	719480	from our conversation that I want the mainstream media to die.
719480	723520	I really, really don't. I want them to be better.
723560	727360	Because one of the problems with new media is
727360	731040	you increasingly see the fragmentation of our reality.
731040	735520	And so I often meet people who have not only alternative opinions,
735520	737840	but alternative facts.
737840	741480	And we no longer can agree on what the facts are.
741480	746160	This is not a healthy place to be. I'd much rather we had
746160	748680	a sort of coherence about what we believe,
748680	751000	but I don't know that we're going to get there.
751000	753840	I think the mainstream media will take some time.
753840	758240	It's kind of bleeding out, but it's still standing.
758240	761800	And that's because there's a lot of people who've grown up
761800	765880	reading and listening and watching the mainstream media.
765880	768200	That will continue. They'll continue to be influential.
768200	771480	And by the way, I keep saying to this,
771480	774040	I am the Turkey that would vote for Christmas.
774040	775040	I really would.
775040	779480	I never had the intention to create a media platform online.
779480	781360	It's a responsibility I've never saw.
781360	785840	And increasingly, I'm kind of scared of personally.
785840	788960	I'd quite like to interview comedians about their career
788960	791840	and sports stars, about their mental attitude
791840	794520	and people who've been through traumatic events about resilience
794520	797200	and all sorts of things of that nature.
797200	801400	I don't want to necessarily be raising things that keep getting ignored.
801400	804600	But if the mainstream media will refuse to talk about certain things,
804600	806360	well, someone needs to say something.
806360	809040	And that's the only reason I've ever got into any of this.
809040	814000	So for me, that's a sad state of...
814000	816320	I always keep saying the tragedy of my career
816320	817960	is I keep saying things everybody knows
817960	819760	and everyone goes, oh, my God, it's amazing.
819760	821200	You know.
821200	823960	Yeah, men are men and women are women. Wow.
823960	825560	You know.
825560	826480	A spoiler warning.
826480	829120	Yeah, exactly. Trigger warning is all we need for that one.
829120	829920	Yeah.
829920	832160	Well, related to trigger warnings, I suppose,
832160	834880	one of the first opportunities maybe made in this audience
834880	837200	would have become familiar with your work
837240	840080	was related to a set of trigger warnings, I suppose,
840080	843000	or avoiding those back in 2018,
843000	846520	when you were asked to complete what's sort of described
846520	849760	as a behavioral agreement of some kind
849760	852600	for a university comedy gig.
852600	855400	Tell us about the requirements for that.
855400	857920	Yes. So I was performing in a club in London.
857920	860120	Some students saw me and they invited me
860120	862760	to help them raise money for UNICEF at the university.
862760	867160	And when I agreed, they sent me a two-page behavioral agreement contract
867600	872400	which said that they have a zero tolerance policy on racism,
872400	876160	sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia,
876160	879200	biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia,
879200	880920	anti-religion, anti-Atheism,
880920	883840	and it also said that all jokes must be respectful and kind.
887840	890680	And it was interesting because it was the first time
890680	893160	I really realized that I wasn't the only one that was concerned
893160	895160	about the direction of travel of our society
895160	899800	because that story became the second biggest story
899800	903040	on the BBC News website, and I mean the second most read story
903040	907000	on the BBC News website, on the day that the then Prime Minister,
907000	910960	Theresa May, was nearly removed from office by her own party.
911800	914240	So first story, Prime Minister nearly removed.
914240	915520	And you're not shocked because in Australia,
915520	917680	you backstab your Prime Ministers every day.
920200	922600	But in England, it's quite a big deal, right?
922600	925400	And so the first story was Prime Minister nearly removed
925400	927040	from office by her own party.
927040	930440	Second story, no-name comedian turns down unpaid charity
930440	931880	from two big collars.
933680	935280	And that's when I was like, oh, okay,
935280	937640	I'm not the only one that actually thinks this is a problem.
937640	939360	And of course I got thousands of emails
939360	941960	and I kind of understood that many people feel
941960	944840	like they're living their life having signed a contract like that.
945720	949840	So yes, that was an interesting moment.
949840	953720	I think there is, certainly people always ask me,
953720	956280	have we reached peak woke, are we, you know,
956280	958800	and I think it really fundamentally depends where you are.
958800	961000	I think in the United States,
961000	963240	certainly when it comes to comedy, I mean comedians
963240	966960	who are challenging the orthodoxy are absolutely crushing it.
966960	971640	Rogan, Bill Burr, Shane Gillis, lots of different people.
971640	973920	Yeah, Dave Chappelle, of course.
973920	976520	In the UK, much more rigid and much more difficult.
976520	979200	I don't know what the situation is in Australia.
979200	981880	On the cultural stuff, again, it's very difficult to judge.
981880	985120	I do think you guys at the moment in a better position
985120	987000	and people sometimes disagree with me
987000	989720	because what they hear when I say that is,
989720	991040	you don't have a problem.
991040	992120	That's not what I'm saying.
992120	993840	I'm saying you are sliding down the toilet,
993840	995160	you're just not as far down.
995160	996360	All right.
996360	999560	However, given that you see us making the mistakes,
999560	1002640	you still have the opportunity to not repeat our mistakes.
1002640	1005560	And I really very much would encourage you not to.
1005560	1007840	I mean, missing off the behavioral agreement, by the way,
1008640	1010280	there were plenty of other phobias and isms
1010280	1012360	that were missed there and fat phobia was missing.
1012360	1017480	So be mindful of that one, the bigots at the fundraiser.
1017480	1020520	Here in Australia, one of the issues that I think
1020520	1024600	really taps at our identity is the question
1024600	1027840	that comes around every year for our national day,
1027840	1028680	Australia Day.
1030000	1033960	This is increasingly viewed as not only not a day
1033960	1037680	for celebration, but a day of regret.
1037680	1042080	Humiliation or even viewed as by many particularly
1042080	1044840	on the left as being ultimately an invasion day.
1044840	1049840	And this self-criticism that we see about the nation,
1053600	1056480	why is it that in Western civilization
1056480	1058680	we have so much trouble with nationhood?
1059760	1063040	You've spent 60 years teaching your children
1063040	1064760	to hate your own civilization.
1064760	1067560	Why are you surprised that they hate your civilization?
1067880	1069600	Sorry, but that's what's happened.
1069600	1071080	That's worked and absolutely.
1071080	1073480	And by the way, it's not just hate.
1073480	1074920	It's hard to teach people to hate.
1074920	1077520	What's much easier is to lie to them about history.
1077520	1080240	So in the UK, for example, in England,
1080240	1083320	there's this, the Church of England,
1083320	1085120	I think it's just approved the billion pounds
1085120	1088000	worth of reparations because we talk endlessly
1088000	1090360	about slavery and the narrative on slavery
1090360	1093960	in seems to me to be, there was no slavery
1094960	1096760	and then the British Empire came along
1096760	1100000	and invented slavery and then woke people,
1100000	1101520	came along and ended slavery.
1102600	1104800	When, of course, we all know what actually happened,
1104800	1108680	which is slavery is slaves were probably the first good
1108680	1110560	that human beings ever traded.
1110560	1113200	Never had anything to do with racism, by the way.
1113200	1115960	It just, it was a fact of life that conquered peoples
1115960	1119480	would be subjugated by others and used as labor
1119480	1120840	and would be traded.
1120840	1122560	Native Americans kept slaves
1122560	1124880	and so did everybody else throughout history.
1124880	1127360	The British Empire practiced slavery just like everybody else
1127360	1129480	because of their superior technological advantage,
1129480	1131400	they were able to move slaves across oceans
1131400	1133640	in the way that others weren't.
1133640	1136160	And then the British ended slavery,
1136160	1138880	not only within the borders of their own realm,
1138880	1141880	but also spent a tremendous amount of blood and treasure
1141880	1143800	to force the Trans-Saharan slave trade,
1143800	1145800	which was much worse, lasted longer,
1145800	1148160	had a higher death rate, the men were all castrated,
1148160	1150520	the women were taken as sex slaves.
1150520	1152600	They forced that slave trade to end,
1152600	1157120	a tremendous diplomatic military and monetary cost.
1158400	1163040	And so this idea that we must eternally apologize
1163040	1165760	for the sins of the past seems to me absolutely ridiculous.
1165760	1168440	Now, does that mean we shouldn't recognize
1168440	1169800	that those things were bad?
1169800	1171600	Yes, of course we should and we should acknowledge
1171600	1174080	and learn from them, but it seems to me very odd.
1174080	1175640	Again, I made this point in the book,
1175640	1177120	I have a whole chapter on slavery in it,
1177120	1179840	which is, imagine if you have to,
1179840	1182280	that 50 years from now we're all gonna be vegan
1182280	1184160	because they get their way,
1184160	1186960	because eating animals is this terrible crime.
1188440	1191720	Would we then say that the people who ended that practice
1191720	1193520	were the most evil in history?
1193520	1194760	That wouldn't make any sense at all.
1194760	1197680	I think we would say, well, this is the first empire
1197680	1199840	in the history of the world that ended this practice,
1199840	1201360	we now consider a moral.
1201360	1202200	Good on them.
1202200	1205760	And by the way, did so for moral reasons.
1205760	1208960	I mean, the abolitionists in England were people
1208960	1212280	who were motivated by a different morality
1212280	1214560	that was developing, which said something
1214560	1217040	about the value of the individual.
1218240	1221480	So the idea that we would denigrate our history
1221480	1223560	in this way to me seems absurd.
1223560	1226680	And every civilization in history,
1226680	1229880	every great empire in history is built on conquest.
1229880	1232600	This is how the world is, this is human nature
1232600	1235400	and to pretend otherwise I think is very unwise.
1235440	1238640	It seems that at the moment Western civilization
1238640	1242920	has never been safer, richer than ever.
1245000	1247520	We should ultimately be ever more self-confident
1247520	1251800	in ourselves, yet we are ever more self-critical
1251800	1253280	about ourselves.
1253280	1255000	Is it just because we've had it too good?
1255000	1257480	Is that what allows us to have that luxury?
1257480	1258320	Well, it seems that way.
1258320	1260320	Something I've been thinking about a lot is
1260320	1263960	people are always very suspicious and wary of families
1263960	1266960	that are able to preserve wealth over many generations.
1266960	1270120	The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the whoever's.
1270120	1273000	And I think that's because it's very difficult.
1273000	1274760	The first generation break through
1274760	1275960	and build something special.
1275960	1279080	The second manager and the third was wasted basically
1279080	1280600	is how it tends to go.
1280600	1284520	So to be able to maintain generation upon generation
1284520	1286200	of people who truly value what they have,
1286200	1288880	even though they're growing up in increasing luxury
1288880	1289920	is very, very difficult.
1289920	1291920	And this is where education comes in.
1291920	1294480	And if we had people who were being educated
1294480	1297520	about the history of their civilization and their society
1297520	1300440	in an accurate way, I think we'd be in a far better place.
1300440	1305040	But what has been happening on Western college campuses
1305040	1307680	and in Western schools for the last many decades
1307680	1310000	is the reason we are where we are.
1310000	1313840	One of the reasons why Western civilization has been successful
1313840	1317560	is obviously its capacity to self-criticize, evolve,
1317560	1319320	and improve.
1319320	1322200	Everything you've been talking about tonight
1322200	1324800	doesn't really sound like self-criticism anymore.
1324800	1329840	It's something more malign.
1329840	1332520	Does this mean that we can't grow from this, the experience,
1332520	1335440	the challenges that Western civilization is currently facing?
1335440	1338200	Well, again, let's translate all of this conceptual stuff
1338200	1339640	into simple language.
1339640	1342560	If you talked about your spouse in the way
1342560	1344080	that people talk about their country,
1344080	1347600	people would call you an abuser.
1347600	1348600	That's what they'd say.
1348600	1351360	They'd say, why are you talking about your wife in this way?
1351360	1353560	That's rude, that's wrong, that's immoral,
1353560	1356320	that they would be suspicious of you.
1356320	1358720	But the way that people talk about their own country
1358720	1360360	is perfectly acceptable to do so.
1360360	1363720	So self-criticism, as I mentioned about freedom of expression,
1363720	1365480	is the bedrock of our progress.
1365480	1368400	The ability to say, no, no, we shouldn't be continuing to do this.
1368400	1371560	Actually, we should be thinking about how to do this better.
1371560	1375240	But it seems to me that we're in the grips of,
1375240	1378000	you know, as Christianity has pulled back,
1378000	1379720	we are now in the grips of a new religion
1379720	1382800	that offers no absolution of any kind whatsoever.
1382800	1386280	You cannot do anything to absolve yourself
1386280	1389520	of your straight, white, male privilege.
1389520	1394480	There's no way, you must just feel forever guilty.
1394480	1397120	And this isn't self-criticism, this is self-denigration,
1397120	1399200	and it's designed for self-destruction.
1399200	1403040	These people, as I say again, are the enemies.
1403040	1406480	So some sort of fracturing elements that we see in society.
1406480	1409920	Now, Australia does pride itself as being arguably
1409920	1414360	the most successful multicultural nation here on Earth.
1414360	1417960	And we've sustained and have been great recipients
1417960	1421720	of a high level of immigration for many years.
1421720	1425120	But recently, the Prime Minister described the social license
1425120	1428720	for our immigration system, which is historically very high,
1428720	1432120	as fracturing.
1432120	1434360	Now, this is not uncommon that a lot of the Western world
1434400	1437680	are facing issues related to migration.
1437680	1439320	And we've got several questions that have come through,
1439320	1441960	and thanks for those who have submitted those,
1441960	1446440	that have asked, how do we successfully maintain
1446440	1449600	multiculturalism and high levels of immigration
1449600	1454240	that have enriched our societies in today's high volumes
1454240	1455520	and challenging times?
1455520	1457160	You can't.
1461160	1462600	You can't.
1462600	1465560	It's like saying, look, I love ice cream, right?
1465560	1468320	But if I had ice cream for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
1468320	1470080	every day, and then you said to me,
1470080	1471480	how do you keep the weight off?
1471480	1473440	I'd say, I'm fat, right?
1473440	1474720	There are immigration.
1474720	1477080	How many of you are immigrants or descendants of immigrants
1477080	1479160	here, right?
1479160	1481960	Pretty much all of you, right?
1481960	1483720	Yeah, some of you were involuntary.
1484640	1493760	I'm a first generation immigrant to the West.
1493760	1498440	I think immigration is conducive to a healthy society.
1498440	1500760	If you bring young people, and not just young people,
1500760	1504120	but driven, talented, smart people who
1504120	1506240	are willing to become part of your nation, who
1506240	1508200	are willing to subscribe to national values,
1508200	1511320	who are willing to say, look, I was born blah, blah, blah.
1511320	1512440	I'm British.
1512520	1513760	I'm Australian.
1513760	1514600	I'm American.
1514600	1516960	I'm here to be part of you.
1516960	1519880	And if those people who are coming in are carefully chosen,
1519880	1522920	because they're conducive to the society to which they come,
1522920	1525200	if the numbers are manageable, and you
1525200	1527760	are able to integrate those people into your society,
1527760	1530400	then you see what you've seen in Australia today,
1530400	1532680	which is all my travels that people come up to.
1532680	1534280	Oh, my mother's from Croatia.
1534280	1535080	Oh, I'm from here.
1535080	1536520	Oh, I'm from Hungary.
1536520	1539800	And these people all sound Australian to me, right?
1539800	1541040	Because they are.
1541040	1543160	But if you have levels of immigration
1543160	1544880	that become too difficult to manage,
1544880	1548440	and particularly if you do what we are doing in the UK
1548440	1550880	and what we have there doing in America, which
1550880	1554000	is letting people come in illegally,
1554000	1556280	I can't understand this, because I've lived in Britain
1556280	1558800	long enough to know that there's no greater offense than jumping
1558800	1559280	the queue.
1562400	1565240	And that is what these people are doing, right?
1565240	1566880	And we don't know who they are.
1566880	1568360	We don't know what their values are.
1568360	1570840	We don't know how compatible they are with Western civilization.
1570840	1572480	And the reason they are coming illegally
1572480	1574560	is that we wouldn't let them in otherwise.
1574560	1576600	That's why they're coming illegally, right?
1576600	1580760	So if you want to maintain a successful multi-ethnic
1580760	1584440	society, you have to make sure that you have immigration
1584440	1587960	levels that are appropriate to the size of your country.
1587960	1589200	You welcome people in.
1589200	1589880	You digest.
1589880	1591520	They become part of your society.
1591520	1592760	They have kids who grew up here.
1592760	1593880	They become Australian.
1593880	1595200	You can let more people in.
1595200	1597560	And you can manage your system in a democratic way.
1597560	1599800	One of the biggest problems with all of this, of course,
1599800	1604600	is that in the UK, the government was elected,
1604600	1607480	the current conservative government was elected in 2010,
1607480	1609880	on the promise to reduce legal immigration
1609880	1611000	to the tens of thousands.
1611000	1612880	It's now running over half a million,
1612880	1615520	significantly over half a million a year.
1615520	1617760	And the legal immigration is in the tens of thousands.
1617760	1621280	So my view is that, look, you could
1621280	1624400	think that this country should have zero immigration.
1624400	1627000	And I could think that this country as open borders
1627000	1628240	should have open borders.
1628240	1630240	At the end of the day, the people
1630240	1632200	need to be able to vote for what they want
1632200	1635120	and then have that reflected in the actions of their government.
1635120	1638640	And there is no mandate for what is happening in Western Europe
1638640	1641120	and America.
1641120	1644440	There's a few followers in the audience of British politics.
1644440	1652880	So Andrew asks, what do we take in the British context?
1652880	1655680	Some of the developments we've seen recently, obviously
1655680	1657920	a bit of a circus for the current government,
1657920	1661760	but in particular, the election of someone like George Galloway.
1661760	1665360	What is this signal for the health of democracy
1665360	1670280	is, I guess, the future of politics?
1670280	1672480	George Galloway has been in parliament for a long time
1672480	1672960	in the UK.
1672960	1674680	He's a very charismatic speaker.
1674680	1676880	I've had him on my show.
1676880	1679040	I thought his opposition to the war in Iraq
1679040	1681560	was extremely important and principled.
1681560	1685920	And I don't necessarily think that George is somehow
1685920	1690200	a terrible guy, but his election on a purely sectarian ticket
1690200	1694720	effectively demonstrates what people need to stop pretending
1694720	1697440	isn't true, which is that we live in a country where increasingly
1697440	1701160	people are going to take on the identity politics that
1701160	1704240	has been shoved down their throat for God knows how long
1704240	1706320	and vote along ethnic and religious lines.
1706320	1708400	And that's what's happening.
1708440	1712080	Gabby also points out the challenge faced here in Sydney
1712080	1713440	and in many parts of the world.
1713440	1716920	And that's the plight of Jewish children in schools
1716920	1723040	and feeling deeply unsafe in Western societies as well.
1723040	1727080	She asks, how do we combat the kind of hate that is being seen
1727080	1729920	sometimes for the first time in Western civilizations now?
1729920	1732120	You can't.
1732120	1734000	If you import people who hate Jews,
1734000	1737080	you're going to have people who hate Jews.
1737120	1737680	Am I wrong?
1741800	1745680	So if that's what you're doing, then that's what will happen.
1745680	1747600	You can't fight it.
1747600	1751400	People keep saying, oh, there's no rise in antisemitism.
1751400	1753200	There's no rise in antisemitism.
1753200	1755760	You just found out that you had lots of antisemitic people
1755760	1759760	in your society who've been antisemitic this entire time.
1759760	1760560	There's no rise.
1764880	1766680	So I don't understand what people are talking about when they say,
1766680	1768360	oh, we're going to fight antisemitism.
1768360	1770000	The only way to fight antisemitism
1770000	1773120	is to destroy identity politics and the progressive project.
1777320	1779920	And the reason is very simple.
1779920	1782440	And this is something that my friend Eric Weinstein explained
1782440	1785920	very well when we had him on our show with Sam Harris.
1785920	1788440	The reason for left-wing antisemitism, which
1788440	1791000	is I think what we're probably talking about to some extent
1791000	1794440	outside the kind of more religious-driven element
1794440	1796600	of this, is very simple.
1796600	1801040	Once you say that there are some groups that are underrepresented
1801040	1803360	and there are some groups that are overrepresented,
1803360	1807080	and the reason the only possible explanation of why a group might
1807080	1809480	be overrepresented or underrepresented
1809480	1813280	is privilege and power, then you immediately
1813280	1817200	get to what Adolf would have called the Jewish question.
1817200	1820520	Because as it happens, Jews for cultural and historical reasons
1820520	1822440	and because of what they teach their children,
1822440	1825840	on average, are much more likely to be overrepresented,
1825840	1828240	particularly in certain industries, in the media, in banking,
1828240	1829720	and so on, it's a fact.
1829720	1831440	They are overrepresented in the same way
1831440	1834160	that many middle-men minorities will tend
1834160	1837520	to be overrepresented in success and money and so on
1837520	1838800	in different countries.
1838800	1841720	Armenians were overrepresented in the Ottoman Empire
1841720	1843760	and were persecuted as a result.
1843760	1847320	Foreign-born Chinese are overrepresented all over Asia
1847320	1849480	and are persecuted as a result.
1849480	1853600	East Asians were middle-men minorities in Africa
1853600	1856560	and were pursued by people prosecuted and persecuted
1856560	1859960	by people like Idi Amin, because they are overrepresented.
1859960	1863760	Once you create this ideology, it will inevitably hone in
1863760	1865760	on minorities that are successful.
1865760	1867840	And the Jews are bearing the brunt of that.
1867840	1871080	If you want to stop anti-Semitism, stop talking about anti-Semitism
1871080	1873360	and start talking about identity politics
1873360	1876400	and how the woke project is destroying Western civilization
1876400	1877960	from the inside.
1877960	1881960	APPLAUSE
1882960	1883960	So help us out.
1883960	1885960	We've talked about the woke project, wokeism.
1885960	1888960	What is it that we actually mean specifically?
1888960	1892960	I guess wokeism is the sort of thing we know when we see it.
1892960	1893960	But how do we define it?
1893960	1895960	Well, I was speaking to the lady over there,
1895960	1897960	if you don't mind me bringing you up,
1897960	1899960	92 years old from Hungary, and she says,
1899960	1901960	oh, it's like my childhood.
1901960	1906960	And what she means by that is what we had in the Warsaw Pact,
1906960	1909960	which it would have been in the Soviet Union more specifically,
1909960	1910960	is Marxism.
1910960	1913960	And Marxism is the ideology that says there are oppressors
1913960	1914960	and there are oppressed.
1914960	1917960	We just talked about it with overrepresented groups,
1917960	1919960	underrepresented groups.
1919960	1923960	And the woke project is essentially a product of the realization
1923960	1927960	that the class-based Marxism that we had in the Soviet Union,
1927960	1930960	we have the bourgeois and the capitalist who are the oppressors
1930960	1933960	and the workers and the peasants who are the oppressed.
1933960	1936960	And of course, the solution to this is to flip the pyramid
1936960	1941960	and put the bourgeois and the capitalist in the ground, ideally,
1941960	1942960	at the bottom.
1942960	1946960	And you create this, what was the phrase,
1946960	1951960	tyranny of the work, tyranny of the proletariat.
1951960	1952960	That's right.
1952960	1953960	Yeah.
1953960	1954960	Dictatorship of the proletariat.
1954960	1955960	That's right.
1955960	1956960	Thank you.
1956960	1958960	Dictatorship of the proletariat.
1958960	1960960	And then they came to the Western Marxists,
1960960	1963960	realized that this was never going to work in the West,
1963960	1965960	because Western workers didn't want a revolution.
1965960	1970960	They just wanted better wages and more rights at work and so on.
1970960	1973960	And so the Marxists realized that the way to divide people
1973960	1978960	that runs much deeper with most people is race, ethnicity, tribe, sex.
1978960	1982960	And that's why they've spent the last 60 years attempting to do things
1982960	1985960	that I thought, frankly, would be impossible.
1986960	1991960	The idea that men and women, the relationship between men and women
1991960	1995960	is best understood as some kind of power struggle,
1995960	1999960	is the most idiotic, cretinous idea that's ever been invented.
1999960	2003960	These two groups of people who have had to struggle and work together
2003960	2007960	and pull together for the entirety of human history
2007960	2009960	just to be able to survive,
2009960	2014960	that these two groups are somehow engaged in some sort of battle of the sexes,
2014960	2016960	of the sex insanity.
2016960	2020960	But this is what they're teaching young people, particularly young girls.
2020960	2023960	And when it comes to race, people are tribal.
2023960	2026960	People are pre-wired for all these sorts of things.
2026960	2028960	People are pre-wired for tribalism.
2028960	2032960	And the beauty of the Western project is we have been able to ameliorate
2032960	2036960	some of the ugliness of that approach to society
2036960	2040960	as best as we could, better than anyone else in history.
2040960	2043960	But they want to divide us along those lines.
2043960	2047960	And so to me, wokeness is race Marxism.
2047960	2049960	Some people call it cultural Marxism.
2049960	2052960	I think it's probably a more accurate term, but less easy to understand.
2052960	2057960	That's why I'd say race Marxism is dividing people along racial and sexual lines
2057960	2061960	in order to persuade some people that they are being oppressed
2061960	2064960	instead of encouraging them to see themselves as part of a society
2064960	2069960	in which they have an unparalleled opportunity to thrive and succeed.
2069960	2072960	And it seems to me that the main kind of weapon here is language.
2072960	2077960	We take words that have a particular established meaning,
2077960	2083960	things like social justice, things like safety even, diversity, inclusion.
2083960	2087960	We're familiar with the way that some of that language is co-opted.
2087960	2089960	Why choose language as a weapon?
2089960	2094960	And does this explain why the Western project is particularly vulnerable to it?
2094960	2098960	Well, look, language is a very powerful weapon
2098960	2103960	because once you call something a good name, it's very difficult to oppose.
2103960	2107960	You know, if you created an organization that was about discriminating against black people
2107960	2109960	and called it puppy's lives matter or something,
2109960	2113960	a lot of people would still agree with it, right, just because it has a good name.
2113960	2118960	You know, diversity essentially, I don't know the cultural context here,
2118960	2121960	but in many Western countries diversity just means no white people.
2121960	2126960	That's what it means, but it's kind of hard to argue against
2126960	2128960	because it's diversity and it's inclusion.
2128960	2129960	What does inclusion mean?
2129960	2132960	It means that anyone who disagrees is excluded.
2137960	2142960	So it's a very powerful tool for concealing what you're doing.
2142960	2144960	I call it slide of mouth.
2144960	2147960	It's a very, very good tool for persuading people.
2147960	2151960	And of course, by the way, if you change the meanings of words
2151960	2156960	and the word safety is the kind of focal point of this,
2156960	2159960	you can change legislation without having to legislate.
2159960	2164960	If you say that, you know, if you accept safety as the absence of violence,
2164960	2166960	which is what we always used to understand it to mean,
2166960	2171960	then laws around violence are very clear or laws around safety are very clear.
2171960	2177960	But once you smuggle in the idea that, you know, safety is no one has my feelings,
2177960	2180960	then you're in a very different position.
2180960	2183960	And ultimately, there's no chance of a free society
2183960	2188960	because if we can't exchange ideas because safety is a barrier,
2188960	2190960	it's just protectionism, right?
2190960	2192960	It's protectionism in a market of ideas
2192960	2195960	in the same way that economic protectionism creates problems.
2195960	2198960	And this is why I keep repeating this idea that these people are enemies
2198960	2202960	because the more I talk to them, the more I realize that
2202960	2205960	my friend Michael Malice, who we had on the show some time ago,
2205960	2207960	he said, Constantine, you've got to understand
2207960	2210960	these people are not using language to communicate.
2210960	2212960	They're using language to manipulate.
2212960	2214960	And once you get that, it all suddenly makes sense.
2214960	2217960	Why are they saying all these ridiculous things?
2217960	2219960	It's because they want to manipulate you.
2219960	2223960	They have no intention of engaging in some kind of battle of ideas.
2223960	2226960	You know, as I said, Tom and I did a podcast earlier
2226960	2229960	in which we had a pretty strong argument about Ukraine.
2229960	2231960	That was the battle of ideas from two people
2231960	2233960	who were interested in challenging each other
2233960	2236960	and trying to communicate what they believed to be true.
2236960	2239960	I have found myself very often in TV studios
2239960	2242960	talking to people who clearly have absolutely no idea
2242960	2244960	of discussing anything.
2244960	2249960	And that's why they use labels and smears as much as they do
2249960	2252960	because they're not trying to win the argument.
2252960	2254960	They're trying to destroy you.
2256960	2259960	Someone that many people in this room probably follow
2259960	2262960	and may well be excited about is Douglas Murray,
2262960	2265960	as soon to be here in Australia.
2267960	2269960	You're in for a treat.
2269960	2273960	Well, unless the campaign to cancel his appearance
2273960	2276960	at the Edmore Theatre is successful.
2276960	2278960	Now, for those who are not familiar,
2278960	2281960	this campaign is based on these grounds,
2281960	2284960	that Douglas Murray ferments anti-immigration,
2284960	2287960	Islamophobia, anti-black,
2287960	2291960	European civilizational moral panics.
2292960	2295960	And on this basis, he should not be allowed to appear
2295960	2299960	and give a talk in conversation here in Sydney.
2299960	2301960	Where are my protesters?
2303960	2305960	What about me?
2305960	2307960	I do that as well.
2308960	2313960	In fairness, you did talk at Sydney University a few days ago.
2313960	2315960	There were protesters there.
2315960	2317960	They were there for Tony Abbott in fairness.
2318960	2321960	I'm jealous of him as well.
2321960	2323960	They all had onions.
2325960	2327960	Delicious, I heard.
2329960	2331960	This is cancel culture.
2331960	2333960	They tried to break down one of the doors.
2333960	2335960	These are very sturdy.
2335960	2337960	It was in the Sydney Uni Great Hall.
2337960	2339960	They had one of these massive wooden doors.
2339960	2341960	I felt like I was in Game of Thrones.
2341960	2343960	But they couldn't break it down.
2343960	2345960	I saw it die, I will do that.
2345960	2348960	No one's been known to ram down doors effectively
2348960	2351960	in a siege on a soy diet.
2354960	2356960	I don't know what happened.
2356960	2358960	I did the joke first, then he repeated it.
2360960	2362960	And got my laugh.
2364960	2366960	This cancel culture,
2366960	2369960	we're familiar with what this looks like,
2369960	2373960	particularly, I guess, the left's approach on this.
2373960	2377960	But in some respects, cancel culture is not new.
2377960	2379960	Since the beginning of civilization,
2379960	2383960	societies have had some form of sanctioning of ideas,
2383960	2386960	potentially even moderating ideas, if you like.
2388960	2392960	Is it not the case then that a degree of cancelling
2392960	2396960	or a sanctioning system is entirely appropriate
2396960	2399960	if it comes from members of a community
2399960	2401960	as opposed to the state,
2401960	2403960	and maybe those of us that think of ourselves
2403960	2405960	as being maybe small government oriented
2405960	2407960	might come to that conclusion.
2407960	2410960	If that was the case, would that not create
2410960	2414960	the right sanctions and safeguards for free speech, hate speech
2414960	2417960	in these challenging areas,
2417960	2420960	that's broken down in the current climate?
2420960	2423960	I think it really depends on what you mean by cancelling.
2423960	2427960	And I completely agree with you that I'm not someone
2427960	2429960	who's ever uttered the word, you know,
2429960	2431960	cancel culture has never been worse.
2431960	2435960	500 years ago, Douglas and I would have been burned at the stake.
2435960	2438960	And I'm not joking, that's what would have happened.
2438960	2441960	So do I support burning people in the stake
2441960	2443960	if it's done by the community rather than the government?
2443960	2444960	No.
2446960	2450960	But, and we could go down the list.
2450960	2454960	Obviously, in the US particularly,
2454960	2456960	and to a lesser extent in the UK,
2456960	2458960	we had the Me Too movement.
2458960	2460960	I thought that there were elements of the Me Too movement
2460960	2463960	that were entirely understandable and frankly quite justified.
2463960	2466960	I don't know anyone who disagrees with what happened to Harvey Weinstein,
2466960	2468960	for example, right?
2468960	2471960	But on the other hand, there were lots of other people, you know,
2471960	2474960	who went on a day and things didn't quite go the way
2474960	2477960	that someone wanted and suddenly they're an abuser, right?
2477960	2480960	So I think it's a matter of degrees quite often.
2480960	2483960	And it is, you know, I have no problem
2483960	2486960	with people coming and protesting outside an event.
2486960	2489960	I have no problem with people coming in and asking pointed questions
2489960	2493960	or challenging and I would in fact would have loved for them to come in.
2493960	2497960	But shouting people down, trying to get people to lose jobs
2497960	2500960	because they said something you don't agree with,
2500960	2504960	that is to me not a way of conducting these conversations.
2504960	2506960	If you do not agree with Douglas Murray,
2506960	2509960	the best thing you can possibly do is make a better argument than Douglas Murray.
2509960	2510960	That's what you do.
2510960	2513960	And if you do that, by the way, in our society now,
2513960	2516960	you're going to be rewarded with a huge platform
2516960	2518960	and lots of money and lots of attention.
2518960	2521960	The problem is no one seems to be able to do that.
2521960	2524960	And it tells you something about the strength of their argument.
2524960	2527960	So to me, come along, if you don't agree with me, come along,
2527960	2530960	explain to me why I'm wrong and my wife does it all the time.
2533960	2536960	To societies that have not done this very well.
2536960	2539960	In Russia, of course, a few weeks ago,
2539960	2544960	many of us received the news that Alexei Navalny
2544960	2550960	had passed away, possibly murdered in Russian prison.
2550960	2554960	What does that mean for the future of,
2554960	2558960	in your view, that debate, discourse in Russia
2558960	2561960	and its struggles with democracy?
2561960	2565960	I don't remember the last time Russia struggled with democracy.
2565960	2568960	It's been a long time.
2568960	2573960	Look, I mean, seriously, Russia never had a democracy, ever,
2573960	2577960	in 12 centuries.
2577960	2580960	In 1991, we had a brief window,
2580960	2584960	and even then, there was not a single democratic transition of power.
2584960	2588960	Boris Yeltsin handed power over to Vladimir Putin.
2588960	2591960	Vladimir Putin has been in power for 25 years.
2591960	2597960	I don't understand why people in the West keep talking about democracy in Russia.
2597960	2599960	There is no democracy in Russia.
2599960	2602960	I'm not sure the Russian people would want democracy if it was offered to them.
2602960	2604960	Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't.
2604960	2606960	That wouldn't be my experience.
2606960	2609960	I don't think looking at history, that's what you'd conclude.
2609960	2612960	And the sad death of Alexei Navalny,
2612960	2615960	who, you know, agree or disagree with some things he said,
2615960	2618960	but he was a brave man and a principled man.
2618960	2622960	I don't think it says anything very much about the future of Russia,
2622960	2629960	other than the fact that Vladimir Putin is now even more firmly in control of the country.
2629960	2633960	He obviously Navalny represented the sort of liberal opposition,
2633960	2638960	but, you know, we all, I think, followed the fate of Yevgeny Prugoshin,
2638960	2644960	who challenged Putin by having his troops march on Moscow.
2644960	2651960	He decided to withdraw and miraculously Paris in an accident two days later.
2651960	2659960	Igor Girkin Strelkov, he was one of the people who orchestrated the uprising in the east of Ukraine in 2014.
2659960	2665960	He is now in prison for criticizing Vladimir Putin from a more nationalistic perspective,
2665960	2667960	saying Putin's too weak on Ukraine.
2667960	2671960	And so Vladimir Putin has consolidated power.
2671960	2676960	And I imagine he's going to hold on to it until he can't any longer.
2676960	2684960	Very wise, quite cleverly, succinctly described the current moment as being
2684960	2687960	sense-making institutions have gone mad.
2687960	2692960	And I think we should agree with basically everything you've said tonight.
2692960	2699960	Alex from our audience asks, how do we make institutions more trustworthy again?
2699960	2705960	Well, I can't because I'm not institutions, but what institutions can do is be more trustworthy.
2705960	2707960	And then people will trust them more.
2707960	2709960	It's pretty simple.
2709960	2712960	It sounds glib, I'm not being glib, but that's the answer, right?
2712960	2714960	We talked about the media.
2714960	2720960	If the mainstream media were more trustworthy and didn't jump on every bandwagon and didn't lie and didn't misrepresent
2720960	2724960	and didn't suppress information they didn't like during COVID.
2724960	2730960	I mean, look, I still don't know where COVID comes from. Do you?
2730960	2734960	We hosted a fantastic event about it a few years ago with Sari Markson, though, right?
2734960	2739960	My point is there was a time when if you'd said that there are some scientists,
2739960	2741960	I mean, this is a fact, right?
2741960	2743960	You can agree or disagree about the reality.
2743960	2746960	Some scientists believe that it came from a lab in Wuhan, okay?
2746960	2753960	You would be censored on YouTube and you would have the potential to lose, in my case, is now my living, right?
2753960	2757960	Now, do you think that improves trust in the institutions?
2757960	2758960	No.
2758960	2762960	So what the institutions have to do is stop doing stupid things like that.
2762960	2766960	And then there will be more trust in the institution.
2766960	2769960	So I wish I had more, but I don't.
2769960	2775960	Here at CIS, we've spoken a lot about the issues impacting young people, especially,
2775960	2784960	and we view the intergenerational inequality that we're observing as being a critical function of our role in the public debate as well.
2784960	2793960	One of the key areas there is the issue around housing and the concern that many young people are locked out of housing.
2793960	2804960	And yet there is the same paradox that young people should then say, if they're rational voters, should say, build more houses so they can be affordable.
2804960	2808960	But young people say, don't build more houses.
2808960	2809960	No more development.
2809960	2811960	Developers are evil.
2811960	2813960	Protect the environment.
2813960	2814960	Lower emissions.
2814960	2815960	All of this.
2815960	2817960	Don't clear land.
2817960	2819960	Why is this irrationality?
2819960	2823960	Why this paradox in the way young people are approaching issues impacting their lives?
2823960	2824960	Well, that's easy.
2824960	2826960	Young people are stupid.
2826960	2830960	I don't mean that this cohort is any more stupid than we were when we were young.
2830960	2834960	I just mean all young people are stupid, including us, when we were young.
2834960	2838960	So I don't expect them to necessarily be entirely consistent.
2838960	2845960	But what I also think is important to say is that young people are right to be upset about the lack of housing and the housing crisis.
2845960	2850960	And I don't think it's them that's preventing the houses that are being built, frankly.
2850960	2856960	The people who are preventing the houses from being built are older people who don't want houses to be built in their backyard.
2856960	2866960	And the corrupt construction and land planning situation where people who hold on to land have an incentive to do so because it drives up the price.
2866960	2880960	So it's basically a set of corrupt incentives within government combined with the fact that these governments increasingly rely on the silver vote of older people who don't seem to be thinking about their grandchildren in a way that they absolutely should be.
2880960	2884960	What we are doing to our young people is outrageous.
2884960	2895960	And not only on housing, I know you're in a better position than we are on this issue, but debt to GDP in the UK and in the US is running at over 100%.
2895960	2899960	So this means we're indebting our grandchildren, many of whom are not yet alive.
2899960	2902960	This is not how responsible society behaves.
2902960	2910960	It just isn't. And housing is just one manifestation of the way that the intergenerational bond is breaking down.
2910960	2917960	We have to be willing to do what parents and grandparents have done throughout the ages, which is sacrifice for the next generation.
2917960	2929960	We've got to give something up so that they have a better life, not least because if you don't, they're going to burn the whole thing down.
2929960	2935960	Seven young people applauding.
2935960	2948960	One of the other issues I suppose it mobilizes young people in politics is the challenge of carbon transition, climate emergency, however you like, like to define this challenge.
2948960	2961960	But again, the solutions to this seem to be from innovating our way through to smart solutions, becoming richer and more capable and more able of solving this problem.
2961960	2965960	But young people, again, seem to vote in a different direction.
2965960	2972960	Glenn, again, sorry, look, it's easy for me to make jokes about how stupid young people are, because as I say, they always are.
2972960	2981960	But we've got to stop pretending it's their fault. Who taught them this crap? Who taught them there's a climate apocalypse coming?
2981960	2985960	Who was it? It wasn't 20-year-olds, I promise you.
2985960	2993960	So the fact that they're all terrified is the reason is because they've been terrified by adults who need to step up and take some responsibility.
2993960	2997960	So look, the solution to that issue is technology and innovation.
2997960	3005960	As I said in my Oxford speech, you're not going to get poor people around the world to reduce their consumption levels and you're certainly not going to get rich people around the world to do that either.
3005960	3009960	So we've got to innovate our way out of the problem as we've always done, right?
3009960	3016960	And we should encourage young people who care about that issue to go into climate science and science in general and learn things.
3016960	3022960	And they might realize that things are not as bad and the solution isn't throwing soup on paintings or shouting or protesting.
3022960	3028960	Solution is actually doing things in the real world, which there are many young people who are doing that.
3028960	3031960	So look, the answer to this is not to sneer at young people.
3031960	3036960	The answer to this is take responsibility, understand what's happening in our education system.
3036960	3041960	And look, as a satirist, a comedian, of course I'm going to make fun of saying Greta of climate change.
3041960	3050960	But at the end of the day, we have to recognize that these issues are important to people for a reason.
3050960	3055960	We have to address the reasons both real and mythical and made up.
3055960	3060960	And that's the solution to this problem. Just mocking people isn't going to solve it.
3060960	3063960	How do you?
3063960	3067960	Just a couple more questions for us before we need to conclude.
3067960	3076960	But Brendan asks what lessons Australians can take from the rest of the world in combating these issues?
3076960	3081960	Vaccinate, and I use this word advisedly, vaccinate your children against this ideology.
3081960	3087960	When I was a young boy in the Soviet Union, probably would have gone to school at six or seven.
3087960	3090960	So this was right towards the end of the Soviet Union.
3090960	3096960	My parents said to me, two things. First of all, do not discuss anything we discussed in the house outside the house.
3096960	3100960	And second, you're going to go to school. They're going to teach you a bunch of crap.
3100960	3104960	Here's why it's all wrong. And if you have any questions, come and talk to us.
3104960	3107960	That's what you have to do. Look, that's what you have to do.
3107960	3112960	You are in that position now. So if you have young children, vaccinate them against this ideology.
3112960	3117960	And that's a big part of the solution. It starts with you individually.
3117960	3126960	And then, ultimately, whatever business, institution, organization you're in, you have to realize this is a civilizational moment.
3126960	3132960	You're not going to sit this one out. You're not going to sit this one out. This is real, right?
3132960	3140960	The crisis of meaning and the crisis of confidence in the West, Israel, if we continue slipping down this path, we will not survive.
3140960	3143960	Not in the way that we think of our civilization.
3143960	3149960	Now, look, Greece still exists, but it's not exactly the same as ancient Greece, you know, begging Germany for bailouts.
3149960	3154960	Italy still exists, but it's not exactly the Roman Empire.
3154960	3158960	This is the logical conclusion of what we're doing.
3158960	3166960	So wake up if there's any influence you have, and you probably have some influence, whether it's in your local community, whether it's in some kind of organization,
3166960	3173960	whether it's on the board of your school, if you have them, whether it's in your business, and start to actually change the world through small steps.
3173960	3178960	That's how it works. People doing whatever they can because they realize the moment is here.
3178960	3181960	And the moment is here. You're not going to sit this one out.
3182960	3184960	That's why I...
3188960	3193960	You know, like, there's literally no reason that I should be sitting here talking to any of you.
3193960	3195960	I'm not in any way different to you.
3195960	3204960	I was a comedian playing to 80 people in the rooms above a pub in London, and then I was going home one day,
3204960	3213960	and I remember I got into an altercation with some guys who told me to go back where I came from or something like that.
3213960	3217960	And then I came home, and I had an email from a comedy promoter which said,
3217960	3223960	I'm sorry, we've canceled your spot on the bill tomorrow because we have too many straight white men.
3223960	3228960	And I went, this is weird.
3228960	3233960	And so Francis and I, my co-host on Trigonometry, went, you know, this is going in the wrong direction.
3233960	3234960	Let's do something.
3234960	3245960	And we started a podcast in a room above a comedy club with zero money, zero connections, zero social media, zero followers, zero talent, many people would say.
3247960	3250960	And now we have a million subscribers. If you look at our YouTube and podcast,
3250960	3255960	and I'm sitting here on the other side of the world talking to you, that's how you do it.
3259960	3269960	So largely to that point, we are just about out of time, but James asks, comments and then asks,
3269960	3276960	many people lack the courage to be able to stand up to absurdities, excesses of ideologies.
3276960	3278960	What advice do you give them?
3278960	3281960	Almost to do the same thing that you're doing. What advice do you give them?
3281960	3284960	Well, first of all, you don't want everyone doing what I'm doing.
3284960	3286960	I don't want the competition.
3288960	3291960	Look, everyone's different. Everyone's got a different role to play.
3291960	3294960	I, people often say, well, should more people be like you?
3294960	3297960	No, we've got enough contrarian assholes like me.
3297960	3305960	You know, genuinely, right? Everybody, the role you've got to play in this is different for everybody and everyone's got to work it out for themselves.
3305960	3310960	There is no one size fits all. You know what the right thing to do is and just do it.
3311960	3319960	You encounter situations in your life daily where you could do something that would take the conversation or the business or whatever in a different direction.
3319960	3322960	And most of you probably don't because most of us don't, right?
3322960	3325960	So that is your opportunity to do something.
3325960	3328960	And by the way, you know, I think Jordan is absolutely right about this.
3328960	3334960	I don't do what I do because I have people say, oh, you're so brave. I'm not brave.
3334960	3337960	I just see where we're going and I think it's bad.
3337960	3339960	And that's the only reason I'm doing what I'm doing.
3339960	3345960	The moment I am the turkey that would vote for Christmas, I do not want to be here.
3345960	3348960	I don't. I genuinely don't.
3348960	3351960	There's plenty of other things I could do.
3351960	3355960	I am here because I genuinely think we're in a bad place and we're heading in the wrong direction.
3355960	3358960	And if you agree with me, you have a duty to do something.
3358960	3360960	That's it.
3369960	3373960	You may not want to be here, but we are very glad that you're here.
3373960	3375960	We are just about out of time.
