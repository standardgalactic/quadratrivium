1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,160
I lead our education program at the CIS, which is a great privilege and a great privilege

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,040
to be with you all tonight and also to have Konstantin here with us.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,920
Konstantin, I'm very mindful about your safety and the safety of everybody.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,040
So with that in mind, I do want to respect your preferred pronouns.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,400
I understand that.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,280
You do identify as a Bay-Them politically non-binary.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,240
What does that mean?

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,080
I think it's very important to think for yourself on everything.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,320
And my experience is that whenever you buy into a political ideology wholesale,

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,520
you inevitably end up in positions where you're having to think stupid things

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,920
because other people think them.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,160
I don't see that as a healthy way to run your brain, first and foremost.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,480
Now, of course, when your ideas begin to translate into political decisions,

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,480
you have a binary choice quite frequently at an election,

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,200
although I now understand in this country you have a non-binary system for voting to some extent.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,160
So my primary interest is in trying to understand the world

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,560
and get as close to the truth as I possibly can,

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,960
which of course all of us are inevitably unsuccessful in.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,960
And therefore, to buy a prepackaged set of ideas just seems to me a little bit naive.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,600
I think left, right, up, down, liberal, conservative, whatever,

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,880
they all have flaws in their thinking.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,560
And I'm interested in finding the distinctions and trying to understand,

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,480
well, I think, for example, the inequality in our society is a massive problem.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,520
Intergenerational inequality is a massive problem.

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,960
And to the extent that the left used to care about that, I agree with the left.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,360
There are also issues that I agree with, you know, conservatives and classical liberals on as well.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,080
So mainly it's about insisting on the ability to think for myself.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,040
And so at the moment, you flag the sort of left, right binary

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,400
and the way that you're straddling that, I suppose.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,760
Why is it the left and right labels?

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
Why do they not mean what they used to mean?

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,680
Well, they're both breaking down because what I used to think of as the left,

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,760
which I used to be on, due to a combination of ignorance and cowardice,

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,240
mostly cowardice, to be honest, have allowed themselves to be derailed

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,080
by the people who call themselves progressive.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,040
And my good friend in the UK, Morris Glassman, who's a member of the House of Lords,

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,000
he always says this, you know, if you go to the doctor and they say to you, it's progressive.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
It's not good news, usually.

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,040
So the left has allowed itself to be derailed from its core purpose by the people who are.

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,280
And I mean, I mean, absolutely no bones about saying this.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,320
The people who we talk about when we mean the woke left, these are these, you know,

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,400
race Marxist or cultural Marxist, these people are the enemy of Western civilization.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,240
There's no discussion. There's no debate.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,520
It's not these people want to destroy the foundations of Western civilization.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,360
That's what they want.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,880
And so if you are the sensible left, which is the majority of people on the left,

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,240
and you allow these people to be the tail that wags your dog,

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,320
well, then the whole meaning of these words starts to break down.

49
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,520
And by the way, you give ammunition to people on the right who are going to say,

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
oh, the left are all like this.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
Well, if you don't speak up, then that's all happened.

52
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,840
Or if you do speak up as as I found out and many other people find out,

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
then you become right wing.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,320
So there we go.

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,280
So it's well trodden that the the flaws of the left,

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
when it comes to the aversion around Western civilization,

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
but the left are on the loan in some of those criticisms.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
So just as the left might complain that, you know, big corporations,

59
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
for instance, have destroyed society or hollowed it out and so on.

60
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,440
It's also true, is it not that the right have also got this tinge about complaining

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,760
about society increasingly?

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,360
It's the issues of, I guess, an elite of sorts as well,

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,560
that particularly around bureaucracy and so on,

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
that undermines the true society itself.

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,240
But does the right have as much to blame in the current debate?

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,440
I see it as a little bit of cause and effect.

67
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,320
I think that many of the policies that progressives have pursued

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
have created a society.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
You're fortunate in this country that you don't have this,

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,480
but you only need to travel around major American cities

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,120
or come to London to see, I mean, it looks like a zombie apocalypse,

72
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,760
to be honest.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,840
You know, you go to LA, you go to New York, you go to, I mean,

74
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,960
Nashville, anywhere, and there's literally people lying face down on the ground

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,640
with most of their clothes off.

76
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,120
And that's because, you know, for all sorts of different reasons,

77
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,680
but primarily because of the policies that governments have pursued.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,600
So as the level of street crime and violent crime increases,

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
as people see disorder around them,

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,400
it's natural for them to get very frustrated about what is happening.

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,720
And I agree with you.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,000
I think there is a section of the right, particularly in the United States,

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,160
that is so fed up of the inability to vote your way out of this growing nightmare,

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,120
frankly, you know, that instead of helping the police to do a better job,

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,800
we have these slogans like defund the police.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,640
All of this stuff is causing people to get frustrated.

87
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,080
And then they say, well, look, democracy isn't working.

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
So maybe Vladimir Putin is brilliant, you know.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Here in Australia, there's been, there's a poll that's done annually,

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
which asks Australians about their attitudes towards society,

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,760
system of government and so on.

92
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,080
And what that's typically shown us is that an increasing number of people,

93
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,840
especially young people, and it's around one in three,

94
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,960
who say that they're unsatisfied with democracy around one in five,

95
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,840
say that they'd prefer an alternative to democracy.

96
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,200
And these numbers, of course, are much higher for young people, especially.

97
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,520
And one of the main reasons that people say that they're not satisfied with democracy

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,280
is that they feel that the system no longer works for the majority,

99
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,760
but works for a minority.

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Are we all doing democracy wrong?

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,560
Well, it's shocking numbers, isn't it, that they're that low?

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Well, it is.

103
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,800
I mean, look, the fact is that Western elites,

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,680
and I use this phrase advisedly,

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,640
have had their heads up their asses for a very long time now,

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,040
and they are insistent on maintaining them there,

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
no matter how many wake-up calls they get.

108
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,680
Look, I voted Remain in the Brexit referendum,

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,880
and frankly, if you'd asked me on the morning after why half of my fellow citizens voted from Brexit,

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,720
I would have had no idea, right?

111
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,320
But what I took away from that is that I am the ignorant one,

112
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,680
and it's my job to educate myself, right?

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,880
What the elites took from that is they need to suppress that movement as quickly as possible.

114
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,280
This was the same with Donald Trump.

115
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
Donald Trump gets elected.

116
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,320
What do they do?

117
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,640
Do they say, oh, my God, I can't believe this guy is so obnoxious.

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,240
How badly, how desperate must these people be to vote for Donald Trump?

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,840
No.

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
What they do is they go, oh, it's Russia collusions.

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
The Russians, they said the same with Brexit.

122
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
The Russians did Brexit, and I kept saying to these people,

123
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
if the Russians didn't vote Brexit, it would be over by now, you know?

124
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,800
We would have taken the chunk of France with us.

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:41,040
So there is this, there is a tyranny of the mind that is happening among people who are comfortable

126
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,360
and who are so attached to the reins of power.

127
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,600
This is why they keep talking, oh, you know, this is a danger to our democracy.

128
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,840
That's why they say our, because it's their democracy, not democracy for anyone else,

129
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
because the moment anyone votes in a way they don't like,

130
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,200
they try and overturn it one way or another.

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,640
And this makes me sound like some great defender of orange man bad.

132
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm not.

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm just objective.

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,400
And objectively, they spent the entire four years trying to undermine the outcome of the election,

135
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,040
lied about him endlessly.

136
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,480
They claimed, and people should go and look at this.

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,880
And many people even in our circles still believe this, the idea that he said, for example,

138
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,440
that there are fine people on both sides.

139
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,400
This isn't true.

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
You can go and watch the video in which he condemns those people.

141
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
He says they should be condemned absolutely.

142
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
All they did is they quoted him out of context and then they presented it.

143
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,040
And they did this over and over and over and over again.

144
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,080
Why did they do it?

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,680
Because they're not willing to accept that somebody might disagree with them.

146
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,320
And if they keep doing this, we are going to get to a very dangerous place very quickly.

147
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,720
So in a free marketplace of ideas, one would expect that we would be able to say,

148
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,120
here's video, Trump says this thing, here's another version of it.

149
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,880
And that free exchange should, in theory, bring the truth to the surface.

150
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
That's at least a textbook case that so much was familiar with.

151
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,000
You know, there's a famous basketball baseball player in America,

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
Yogi Berra, who was known for his witticisms.

153
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,680
And he said, in theory, there's no difference between theory and practice.

154
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,920
In practice, there is.

155
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,120
And that's kind of, I think that answers your question.

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,880
In practice, we have a mainstream media which is dying.

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
It's dying for a reason.

158
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,240
And the reason is that they have discredited themselves over a long period of time

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,160
by spreading things that later turn out not to be true and driving these narratives.

160
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,920
There's a, I wrote a thread on Twitter that went viral on the subject

161
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,960
that I later made as a video and it's a chapter in my book as well.

162
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
It was called Why Don't They Believe Us?

163
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,200
And the reason people are increasingly not believing the mainstream media

164
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,800
is the arrogance with which they have purported these lies

165
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,960
on the publics of the Western countries.

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,560
I think what is required is a little bit more humility and admitting wrong.

167
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,480
And I always say this to someone who increasingly has interactions

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,080
with people in the mainstream media, giving interviews, et cetera.

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,760
No personal, you know, no faith in the mainstream media,

170
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,040
so vice-first contact with the mainstream media.

171
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,600
You know, and an example of this, and I'm not bitter,

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,520
but an example of this is after my Oxford speech,

173
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,840
a journalist from the New Statesman came and interviewed me

174
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,120
and he asked me how many views the video of my speech had got.

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,520
And I said, it's very difficult to measure because, you know,

176
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,040
it goes into people's telegram groups and WhatsApp groups

177
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,440
and people posting a way that you're not able to track.

178
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,200
So you can't really say.

179
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,000
And he wrote that I'd said that the number of views on the speech

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
is beyond measure.

181
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,720
LAUGHTER

182
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,120
So the mainstream media have done a very bad job

183
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,280
of maintaining their credibility.

184
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,880
Oh, I mean, it is approaching beyond measure at the moment.

185
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
That's...

186
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,280
So, look, the mainstream media, you point out, is dying.

187
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,960
You run a platform like several others

188
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,640
that we broadly define in a family of new media.

189
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,760
And what strikes me is really powerful about new media

190
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,160
is it doesn't have the same opportunity to cancel, if you like,

191
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,680
that mainstream media has. It doesn't have the same conventions.

192
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,000
It provides that free access to masses to be able to access

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,040
diverse opinions, diverse perspectives,

194
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,880
and be able to, in many cases, share and disseminate freely.

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,200
In some respects, it seems to me this is a set of platforms

196
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,800
that protect against cancellation for those reasons.

197
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
And so many more people, when we look at these numbers,

198
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,800
consume new media than consume old media.

199
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,480
Does that mean old media will just die itself out?

200
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,320
We'll see. And by the way, I wouldn't want people to take away

201
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,480
from our conversation that I want the mainstream media to die.

202
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,520
I really, really don't. I want them to be better.

203
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,360
Because one of the problems with new media is

204
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,040
you increasingly see the fragmentation of our reality.

205
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,520
And so I often meet people who have not only alternative opinions,

206
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,840
but alternative facts.

207
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,480
And we no longer can agree on what the facts are.

208
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,160
This is not a healthy place to be. I'd much rather we had

209
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,680
a sort of coherence about what we believe,

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,000
but I don't know that we're going to get there.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,840
I think the mainstream media will take some time.

212
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,240
It's kind of bleeding out, but it's still standing.

213
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,800
And that's because there's a lot of people who've grown up

214
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,880
reading and listening and watching the mainstream media.

215
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,200
That will continue. They'll continue to be influential.

216
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,480
And by the way, I keep saying to this,

217
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,040
I am the Turkey that would vote for Christmas.

218
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
I really would.

219
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,480
I never had the intention to create a media platform online.

220
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,360
It's a responsibility I've never saw.

221
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,840
And increasingly, I'm kind of scared of personally.

222
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,960
I'd quite like to interview comedians about their career

223
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,840
and sports stars, about their mental attitude

224
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,520
and people who've been through traumatic events about resilience

225
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,200
and all sorts of things of that nature.

226
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't want to necessarily be raising things that keep getting ignored.

227
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,600
But if the mainstream media will refuse to talk about certain things,

228
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,360
well, someone needs to say something.

229
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,040
And that's the only reason I've ever got into any of this.

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,000
So for me, that's a sad state of...

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,320
I always keep saying the tragedy of my career

232
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,960
is I keep saying things everybody knows

233
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,760
and everyone goes, oh, my God, it's amazing.

234
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
You know.

235
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah, men are men and women are women. Wow.

236
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
You know.

237
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,480
A spoiler warning.

238
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,120
Yeah, exactly. Trigger warning is all we need for that one.

239
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
Yeah.

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
Well, related to trigger warnings, I suppose,

241
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,880
one of the first opportunities maybe made in this audience

242
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,200
would have become familiar with your work

243
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,080
was related to a set of trigger warnings, I suppose,

244
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,000
or avoiding those back in 2018,

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,520
when you were asked to complete what's sort of described

246
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,760
as a behavioral agreement of some kind

247
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,600
for a university comedy gig.

248
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Tell us about the requirements for that.

249
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,920
Yes. So I was performing in a club in London.

250
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,120
Some students saw me and they invited me

251
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,760
to help them raise money for UNICEF at the university.

252
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,160
And when I agreed, they sent me a two-page behavioral agreement contract

253
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,400
which said that they have a zero tolerance policy on racism,

254
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,160
sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia,

255
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,200
biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia,

256
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,920
anti-religion, anti-Atheism,

257
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,840
and it also said that all jokes must be respectful and kind.

258
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,680
And it was interesting because it was the first time

259
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,160
I really realized that I wasn't the only one that was concerned

260
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
about the direction of travel of our society

261
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,800
because that story became the second biggest story

262
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,040
on the BBC News website, and I mean the second most read story

263
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,000
on the BBC News website, on the day that the then Prime Minister,

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,960
Theresa May, was nearly removed from office by her own party.

265
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,240
So first story, Prime Minister nearly removed.

266
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,520
And you're not shocked because in Australia,

267
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,680
you backstab your Prime Ministers every day.

268
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
But in England, it's quite a big deal, right?

269
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
And so the first story was Prime Minister nearly removed

270
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
from office by her own party.

271
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,440
Second story, no-name comedian turns down unpaid charity

272
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,880
from two big collars.

273
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,280
And that's when I was like, oh, okay,

274
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,640
I'm not the only one that actually thinks this is a problem.

275
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,360
And of course I got thousands of emails

276
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,960
and I kind of understood that many people feel

277
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,840
like they're living their life having signed a contract like that.

278
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,840
So yes, that was an interesting moment.

279
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,720
I think there is, certainly people always ask me,

280
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,280
have we reached peak woke, are we, you know,

281
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,800
and I think it really fundamentally depends where you are.

282
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,000
I think in the United States,

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,240
certainly when it comes to comedy, I mean comedians

284
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,960
who are challenging the orthodoxy are absolutely crushing it.

285
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,640
Rogan, Bill Burr, Shane Gillis, lots of different people.

286
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,920
Yeah, Dave Chappelle, of course.

287
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,520
In the UK, much more rigid and much more difficult.

288
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,200
I don't know what the situation is in Australia.

289
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,880
On the cultural stuff, again, it's very difficult to judge.

290
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,120
I do think you guys at the moment in a better position

291
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,000
and people sometimes disagree with me

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,720
because what they hear when I say that is,

293
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,040
you don't have a problem.

294
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,120
That's not what I'm saying.

295
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm saying you are sliding down the toilet,

296
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,160
you're just not as far down.

297
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,360
All right.

298
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,560
However, given that you see us making the mistakes,

299
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,640
you still have the opportunity to not repeat our mistakes.

300
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,560
And I really very much would encourage you not to.

301
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,840
I mean, missing off the behavioral agreement, by the way,

302
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,280
there were plenty of other phobias and isms

303
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,360
that were missed there and fat phobia was missing.

304
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,480
So be mindful of that one, the bigots at the fundraiser.

305
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,520
Here in Australia, one of the issues that I think

306
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,600
really taps at our identity is the question

307
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,840
that comes around every year for our national day,

308
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,680
Australia Day.

309
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,960
This is increasingly viewed as not only not a day

310
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,680
for celebration, but a day of regret.

311
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,080
Humiliation or even viewed as by many particularly

312
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,840
on the left as being ultimately an invasion day.

313
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,840
And this self-criticism that we see about the nation,

314
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,480
why is it that in Western civilization

315
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,680
we have so much trouble with nationhood?

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,040
You've spent 60 years teaching your children

317
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,760
to hate your own civilization.

318
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,560
Why are you surprised that they hate your civilization?

319
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,600
Sorry, but that's what's happened.

320
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,080
That's worked and absolutely.

321
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,480
And by the way, it's not just hate.

322
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,920
It's hard to teach people to hate.

323
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,520
What's much easier is to lie to them about history.

324
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,240
So in the UK, for example, in England,

325
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,320
there's this, the Church of England,

326
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,120
I think it's just approved the billion pounds

327
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
worth of reparations because we talk endlessly

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,360
about slavery and the narrative on slavery

329
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,960
in seems to me to be, there was no slavery

330
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,760
and then the British Empire came along

331
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,000
and invented slavery and then woke people,

332
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
came along and ended slavery.

333
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,800
When, of course, we all know what actually happened,

334
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,680
which is slavery is slaves were probably the first good

335
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,560
that human beings ever traded.

336
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,200
Never had anything to do with racism, by the way.

337
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,960
It just, it was a fact of life that conquered peoples

338
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,480
would be subjugated by others and used as labor

339
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,840
and would be traded.

340
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,560
Native Americans kept slaves

341
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,880
and so did everybody else throughout history.

342
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
The British Empire practiced slavery just like everybody else

343
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,480
because of their superior technological advantage,

344
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
they were able to move slaves across oceans

345
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
in the way that others weren't.

346
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,160
And then the British ended slavery,

347
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,880
not only within the borders of their own realm,

348
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,880
but also spent a tremendous amount of blood and treasure

349
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,800
to force the Trans-Saharan slave trade,

350
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
which was much worse, lasted longer,

351
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,160
had a higher death rate, the men were all castrated,

352
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,520
the women were taken as sex slaves.

353
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,600
They forced that slave trade to end,

354
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,120
a tremendous diplomatic military and monetary cost.

355
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,040
And so this idea that we must eternally apologize

356
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,760
for the sins of the past seems to me absolutely ridiculous.

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,440
Now, does that mean we shouldn't recognize

358
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,800
that those things were bad?

359
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,600
Yes, of course we should and we should acknowledge

360
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
and learn from them, but it seems to me very odd.

361
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,640
Again, I made this point in the book,

362
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
I have a whole chapter on slavery in it,

363
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,840
which is, imagine if you have to,

364
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,280
that 50 years from now we're all gonna be vegan

365
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,160
because they get their way,

366
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,960
because eating animals is this terrible crime.

367
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,720
Would we then say that the people who ended that practice

368
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,520
were the most evil in history?

369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,760
That wouldn't make any sense at all.

370
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,680
I think we would say, well, this is the first empire

371
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,840
in the history of the world that ended this practice,

372
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
we now consider a moral.

373
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,200
Good on them.

374
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,760
And by the way, did so for moral reasons.

375
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
I mean, the abolitionists in England were people

376
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,280
who were motivated by a different morality

377
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,560
that was developing, which said something

378
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,040
about the value of the individual.

379
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,480
So the idea that we would denigrate our history

380
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,560
in this way to me seems absurd.

381
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,680
And every civilization in history,

382
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,880
every great empire in history is built on conquest.

383
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,600
This is how the world is, this is human nature

384
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,400
and to pretend otherwise I think is very unwise.

385
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
It seems that at the moment Western civilization

386
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,920
has never been safer, richer than ever.

387
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,520
We should ultimately be ever more self-confident

388
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,800
in ourselves, yet we are ever more self-critical

389
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,280
about ourselves.

390
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,000
Is it just because we've had it too good?

391
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Is that what allows us to have that luxury?

392
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,320
Well, it seems that way.

393
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Something I've been thinking about a lot is

394
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,960
people are always very suspicious and wary of families

395
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
that are able to preserve wealth over many generations.

396
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,120
The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the whoever's.

397
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,000
And I think that's because it's very difficult.

398
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,760
The first generation break through

399
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,960
and build something special.

400
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,080
The second manager and the third was wasted basically

401
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,600
is how it tends to go.

402
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,520
So to be able to maintain generation upon generation

403
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,200
of people who truly value what they have,

404
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,880
even though they're growing up in increasing luxury

405
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
is very, very difficult.

406
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
And this is where education comes in.

407
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,480
And if we had people who were being educated

408
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
about the history of their civilization and their society

409
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,440
in an accurate way, I think we'd be in a far better place.

410
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,040
But what has been happening on Western college campuses

411
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,680
and in Western schools for the last many decades

412
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,000
is the reason we are where we are.

413
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,840
One of the reasons why Western civilization has been successful

414
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,560
is obviously its capacity to self-criticize, evolve,

415
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,320
and improve.

416
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,200
Everything you've been talking about tonight

417
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,800
doesn't really sound like self-criticism anymore.

418
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,840
It's something more malign.

419
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,520
Does this mean that we can't grow from this, the experience,

420
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,440
the challenges that Western civilization is currently facing?

421
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,200
Well, again, let's translate all of this conceptual stuff

422
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,640
into simple language.

423
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,560
If you talked about your spouse in the way

424
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,080
that people talk about their country,

425
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,600
people would call you an abuser.

426
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
That's what they'd say.

427
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,360
They'd say, why are you talking about your wife in this way?

428
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,560
That's rude, that's wrong, that's immoral,

429
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,320
that they would be suspicious of you.

430
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
But the way that people talk about their own country

431
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
is perfectly acceptable to do so.

432
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,720
So self-criticism, as I mentioned about freedom of expression,

433
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,480
is the bedrock of our progress.

434
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,400
The ability to say, no, no, we shouldn't be continuing to do this.

435
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,560
Actually, we should be thinking about how to do this better.

436
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,240
But it seems to me that we're in the grips of,

437
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,000
you know, as Christianity has pulled back,

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,720
we are now in the grips of a new religion

439
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,800
that offers no absolution of any kind whatsoever.

440
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,280
You cannot do anything to absolve yourself

441
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,520
of your straight, white, male privilege.

442
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,480
There's no way, you must just feel forever guilty.

443
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,120
And this isn't self-criticism, this is self-denigration,

444
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
and it's designed for self-destruction.

445
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,040
These people, as I say again, are the enemies.

446
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,480
So some sort of fracturing elements that we see in society.

447
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,920
Now, Australia does pride itself as being arguably

448
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,360
the most successful multicultural nation here on Earth.

449
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,960
And we've sustained and have been great recipients

450
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,720
of a high level of immigration for many years.

451
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,120
But recently, the Prime Minister described the social license

452
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,720
for our immigration system, which is historically very high,

453
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,120
as fracturing.

454
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,360
Now, this is not uncommon that a lot of the Western world

455
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,680
are facing issues related to migration.

456
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,320
And we've got several questions that have come through,

457
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,960
and thanks for those who have submitted those,

458
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,440
that have asked, how do we successfully maintain

459
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,600
multiculturalism and high levels of immigration

460
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,240
that have enriched our societies in today's high volumes

461
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
and challenging times?

462
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,160
You can't.

463
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,600
You can't.

464
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,560
It's like saying, look, I love ice cream, right?

465
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,320
But if I had ice cream for breakfast, lunch, and dinner

466
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
every day, and then you said to me,

467
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,480
how do you keep the weight off?

468
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,440
I'd say, I'm fat, right?

469
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,720
There are immigration.

470
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,080
How many of you are immigrants or descendants of immigrants

471
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,160
here, right?

472
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,960
Pretty much all of you, right?

473
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,720
Yeah, some of you were involuntary.

474
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm a first generation immigrant to the West.

475
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,440
I think immigration is conducive to a healthy society.

476
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,760
If you bring young people, and not just young people,

477
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,120
but driven, talented, smart people who

478
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,240
are willing to become part of your nation, who

479
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,200
are willing to subscribe to national values,

480
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,320
who are willing to say, look, I was born blah, blah, blah.

481
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,440
I'm British.

482
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm Australian.

483
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm American.

484
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm here to be part of you.

485
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,880
And if those people who are coming in are carefully chosen,

486
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,920
because they're conducive to the society to which they come,

487
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,200
if the numbers are manageable, and you

488
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,760
are able to integrate those people into your society,

489
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
then you see what you've seen in Australia today,

490
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,680
which is all my travels that people come up to.

491
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,280
Oh, my mother's from Croatia.

492
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,080
Oh, I'm from here.

493
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,520
Oh, I'm from Hungary.

494
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,800
And these people all sound Australian to me, right?

495
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,040
Because they are.

496
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,160
But if you have levels of immigration

497
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,880
that become too difficult to manage,

498
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,440
and particularly if you do what we are doing in the UK

499
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,880
and what we have there doing in America, which

500
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
is letting people come in illegally,

501
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,280
I can't understand this, because I've lived in Britain

502
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,800
long enough to know that there's no greater offense than jumping

503
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,280
the queue.

504
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,240
And that is what these people are doing, right?

505
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,880
And we don't know who they are.

506
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,360
We don't know what their values are.

507
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,840
We don't know how compatible they are with Western civilization.

508
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,480
And the reason they are coming illegally

509
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,560
is that we wouldn't let them in otherwise.

510
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,600
That's why they're coming illegally, right?

511
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,760
So if you want to maintain a successful multi-ethnic

512
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,440
society, you have to make sure that you have immigration

513
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,960
levels that are appropriate to the size of your country.

514
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,200
You welcome people in.

515
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,880
You digest.

516
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
They become part of your society.

517
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,760
They have kids who grew up here.

518
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,880
They become Australian.

519
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,200
You can let more people in.

520
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
And you can manage your system in a democratic way.

521
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,800
One of the biggest problems with all of this, of course,

522
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,600
is that in the UK, the government was elected,

523
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,480
the current conservative government was elected in 2010,

524
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,880
on the promise to reduce legal immigration

525
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,000
to the tens of thousands.

526
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,880
It's now running over half a million,

527
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,520
significantly over half a million a year.

528
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,760
And the legal immigration is in the tens of thousands.

529
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,280
So my view is that, look, you could

530
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,400
think that this country should have zero immigration.

531
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
And I could think that this country as open borders

532
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,240
should have open borders.

533
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
At the end of the day, the people

534
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
need to be able to vote for what they want

535
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,120
and then have that reflected in the actions of their government.

536
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
And there is no mandate for what is happening in Western Europe

537
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
and America.

538
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,440
There's a few followers in the audience of British politics.

539
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:32,880
So Andrew asks, what do we take in the British context?

540
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,680
Some of the developments we've seen recently, obviously

541
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,920
a bit of a circus for the current government,

542
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,760
but in particular, the election of someone like George Galloway.

543
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
What is this signal for the health of democracy

544
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,280
is, I guess, the future of politics?

545
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,480
George Galloway has been in parliament for a long time

546
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:52,960
in the UK.

547
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,680
He's a very charismatic speaker.

548
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
I've had him on my show.

549
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,040
I thought his opposition to the war in Iraq

550
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,560
was extremely important and principled.

551
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,920
And I don't necessarily think that George is somehow

552
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,200
a terrible guy, but his election on a purely sectarian ticket

553
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,720
effectively demonstrates what people need to stop pretending

554
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
isn't true, which is that we live in a country where increasingly

555
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,160
people are going to take on the identity politics that

556
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,240
has been shoved down their throat for God knows how long

557
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,320
and vote along ethnic and religious lines.

558
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,400
And that's what's happening.

559
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,080
Gabby also points out the challenge faced here in Sydney

560
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
and in many parts of the world.

561
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,920
And that's the plight of Jewish children in schools

562
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,040
and feeling deeply unsafe in Western societies as well.

563
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,080
She asks, how do we combat the kind of hate that is being seen

564
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,920
sometimes for the first time in Western civilizations now?

565
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,120
You can't.

566
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,000
If you import people who hate Jews,

567
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,080
you're going to have people who hate Jews.

568
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Am I wrong?

569
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,680
So if that's what you're doing, then that's what will happen.

570
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,600
You can't fight it.

571
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,400
People keep saying, oh, there's no rise in antisemitism.

572
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
There's no rise in antisemitism.

573
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,760
You just found out that you had lots of antisemitic people

574
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,760
in your society who've been antisemitic this entire time.

575
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
There's no rise.

576
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,680
So I don't understand what people are talking about when they say,

577
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,360
oh, we're going to fight antisemitism.

578
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,000
The only way to fight antisemitism

579
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,120
is to destroy identity politics and the progressive project.

580
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,920
And the reason is very simple.

581
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,440
And this is something that my friend Eric Weinstein explained

582
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,920
very well when we had him on our show with Sam Harris.

583
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,440
The reason for left-wing antisemitism, which

584
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,000
is I think what we're probably talking about to some extent

585
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,440
outside the kind of more religious-driven element

586
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,600
of this, is very simple.

587
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,040
Once you say that there are some groups that are underrepresented

588
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,360
and there are some groups that are overrepresented,

589
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,080
and the reason the only possible explanation of why a group might

590
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,480
be overrepresented or underrepresented

591
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,280
is privilege and power, then you immediately

592
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,200
get to what Adolf would have called the Jewish question.

593
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,520
Because as it happens, Jews for cultural and historical reasons

594
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,440
and because of what they teach their children,

595
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,840
on average, are much more likely to be overrepresented,

596
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,240
particularly in certain industries, in the media, in banking,

597
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,720
and so on, it's a fact.

598
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,440
They are overrepresented in the same way

599
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,160
that many middle-men minorities will tend

600
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,520
to be overrepresented in success and money and so on

601
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,800
in different countries.

602
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,720
Armenians were overrepresented in the Ottoman Empire

603
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,760
and were persecuted as a result.

604
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,320
Foreign-born Chinese are overrepresented all over Asia

605
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,480
and are persecuted as a result.

606
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,600
East Asians were middle-men minorities in Africa

607
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,560
and were pursued by people prosecuted and persecuted

608
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,960
by people like Idi Amin, because they are overrepresented.

609
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,760
Once you create this ideology, it will inevitably hone in

610
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
on minorities that are successful.

611
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
And the Jews are bearing the brunt of that.

612
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,080
If you want to stop anti-Semitism, stop talking about anti-Semitism

613
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,360
and start talking about identity politics

614
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,400
and how the woke project is destroying Western civilization

615
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,960
from the inside.

616
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,960
APPLAUSE

617
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
So help us out.

618
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
We've talked about the woke project, wokeism.

619
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,960
What is it that we actually mean specifically?

620
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I guess wokeism is the sort of thing we know when we see it.

621
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
But how do we define it?

622
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Well, I was speaking to the lady over there,

623
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
if you don't mind me bringing you up,

624
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
92 years old from Hungary, and she says,

625
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
oh, it's like my childhood.

626
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,960
And what she means by that is what we had in the Warsaw Pact,

627
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,960
which it would have been in the Soviet Union more specifically,

628
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
is Marxism.

629
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
And Marxism is the ideology that says there are oppressors

630
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
and there are oppressed.

631
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,960
We just talked about it with overrepresented groups,

632
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,960
underrepresented groups.

633
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,960
And the woke project is essentially a product of the realization

634
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,960
that the class-based Marxism that we had in the Soviet Union,

635
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
we have the bourgeois and the capitalist who are the oppressors

636
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,960
and the workers and the peasants who are the oppressed.

637
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,960
And of course, the solution to this is to flip the pyramid

638
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,960
and put the bourgeois and the capitalist in the ground, ideally,

639
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
at the bottom.

640
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
And you create this, what was the phrase,

641
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,960
tyranny of the work, tyranny of the proletariat.

642
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
That's right.

643
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Yeah.

644
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Dictatorship of the proletariat.

645
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
That's right.

646
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Thank you.

647
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Dictatorship of the proletariat.

648
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
And then they came to the Western Marxists,

649
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,960
realized that this was never going to work in the West,

650
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
because Western workers didn't want a revolution.

651
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,960
They just wanted better wages and more rights at work and so on.

652
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,960
And so the Marxists realized that the way to divide people

653
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,960
that runs much deeper with most people is race, ethnicity, tribe, sex.

654
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
And that's why they've spent the last 60 years attempting to do things

655
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,960
that I thought, frankly, would be impossible.

656
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,960
The idea that men and women, the relationship between men and women

657
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,960
is best understood as some kind of power struggle,

658
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,960
is the most idiotic, cretinous idea that's ever been invented.

659
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,960
These two groups of people who have had to struggle and work together

660
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,960
and pull together for the entirety of human history

661
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
just to be able to survive,

662
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,960
that these two groups are somehow engaged in some sort of battle of the sexes,

663
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
of the sex insanity.

664
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
But this is what they're teaching young people, particularly young girls.

665
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,960
And when it comes to race, people are tribal.

666
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,960
People are pre-wired for all these sorts of things.

667
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
People are pre-wired for tribalism.

668
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
And the beauty of the Western project is we have been able to ameliorate

669
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,960
some of the ugliness of that approach to society

670
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,960
as best as we could, better than anyone else in history.

671
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,960
But they want to divide us along those lines.

672
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,960
And so to me, wokeness is race Marxism.

673
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Some people call it cultural Marxism.

674
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I think it's probably a more accurate term, but less easy to understand.

675
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,960
That's why I'd say race Marxism is dividing people along racial and sexual lines

676
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,960
in order to persuade some people that they are being oppressed

677
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,960
instead of encouraging them to see themselves as part of a society

678
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,960
in which they have an unparalleled opportunity to thrive and succeed.

679
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,960
And it seems to me that the main kind of weapon here is language.

680
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,960
We take words that have a particular established meaning,

681
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,960
things like social justice, things like safety even, diversity, inclusion.

682
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,960
We're familiar with the way that some of that language is co-opted.

683
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Why choose language as a weapon?

684
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,960
And does this explain why the Western project is particularly vulnerable to it?

685
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Well, look, language is a very powerful weapon

686
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,960
because once you call something a good name, it's very difficult to oppose.

687
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,960
You know, if you created an organization that was about discriminating against black people

688
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
and called it puppy's lives matter or something,

689
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,960
a lot of people would still agree with it, right, just because it has a good name.

690
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,960
You know, diversity essentially, I don't know the cultural context here,

691
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,960
but in many Western countries diversity just means no white people.

692
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,960
That's what it means, but it's kind of hard to argue against

693
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
because it's diversity and it's inclusion.

694
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
What does inclusion mean?

695
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,960
It means that anyone who disagrees is excluded.

696
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,960
So it's a very powerful tool for concealing what you're doing.

697
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
I call it slide of mouth.

698
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,960
It's a very, very good tool for persuading people.

699
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,960
And of course, by the way, if you change the meanings of words

700
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,960
and the word safety is the kind of focal point of this,

701
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,960
you can change legislation without having to legislate.

702
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,960
If you say that, you know, if you accept safety as the absence of violence,

703
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
which is what we always used to understand it to mean,

704
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,960
then laws around violence are very clear or laws around safety are very clear.

705
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,960
But once you smuggle in the idea that, you know, safety is no one has my feelings,

706
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,960
then you're in a very different position.

707
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,960
And ultimately, there's no chance of a free society

708
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,960
because if we can't exchange ideas because safety is a barrier,

709
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
it's just protectionism, right?

710
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
It's protectionism in a market of ideas

711
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,960
in the same way that economic protectionism creates problems.

712
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
And this is why I keep repeating this idea that these people are enemies

713
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,960
because the more I talk to them, the more I realize that

714
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,960
my friend Michael Malice, who we had on the show some time ago,

715
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
he said, Constantine, you've got to understand

716
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,960
these people are not using language to communicate.

717
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
They're using language to manipulate.

718
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
And once you get that, it all suddenly makes sense.

719
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Why are they saying all these ridiculous things?

720
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
It's because they want to manipulate you.

721
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,960
They have no intention of engaging in some kind of battle of ideas.

722
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
You know, as I said, Tom and I did a podcast earlier

723
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,960
in which we had a pretty strong argument about Ukraine.

724
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
That was the battle of ideas from two people

725
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
who were interested in challenging each other

726
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,960
and trying to communicate what they believed to be true.

727
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,960
I have found myself very often in TV studios

728
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,960
talking to people who clearly have absolutely no idea

729
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
of discussing anything.

730
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,960
And that's why they use labels and smears as much as they do

731
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,960
because they're not trying to win the argument.

732
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
They're trying to destroy you.

733
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Someone that many people in this room probably follow

734
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,960
and may well be excited about is Douglas Murray,

735
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
as soon to be here in Australia.

736
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
You're in for a treat.

737
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Well, unless the campaign to cancel his appearance

738
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,960
at the Edmore Theatre is successful.

739
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Now, for those who are not familiar,

740
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,960
this campaign is based on these grounds,

741
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,960
that Douglas Murray ferments anti-immigration,

742
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Islamophobia, anti-black,

743
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,960
European civilizational moral panics.

744
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,960
And on this basis, he should not be allowed to appear

745
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,960
and give a talk in conversation here in Sydney.

746
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Where are my protesters?

747
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
What about me?

748
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I do that as well.

749
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,960
In fairness, you did talk at Sydney University a few days ago.

750
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
There were protesters there.

751
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
They were there for Tony Abbott in fairness.

752
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,960
I'm jealous of him as well.

753
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
They all had onions.

754
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Delicious, I heard.

755
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
This is cancel culture.

756
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
They tried to break down one of the doors.

757
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
These are very sturdy.

758
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
It was in the Sydney Uni Great Hall.

759
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
They had one of these massive wooden doors.

760
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I felt like I was in Game of Thrones.

761
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
But they couldn't break it down.

762
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
I saw it die, I will do that.

763
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,960
No one's been known to ram down doors effectively

764
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,960
in a siege on a soy diet.

765
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
I don't know what happened.

766
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
I did the joke first, then he repeated it.

767
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
And got my laugh.

768
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
This cancel culture,

769
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,960
we're familiar with what this looks like,

770
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,960
particularly, I guess, the left's approach on this.

771
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,960
But in some respects, cancel culture is not new.

772
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Since the beginning of civilization,

773
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,960
societies have had some form of sanctioning of ideas,

774
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
potentially even moderating ideas, if you like.

775
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Is it not the case then that a degree of cancelling

776
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,960
or a sanctioning system is entirely appropriate

777
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,960
if it comes from members of a community

778
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
as opposed to the state,

779
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
and maybe those of us that think of ourselves

780
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
as being maybe small government oriented

781
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
might come to that conclusion.

782
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
If that was the case, would that not create

783
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
the right sanctions and safeguards for free speech, hate speech

784
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,960
in these challenging areas,

785
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,960
that's broken down in the current climate?

786
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,960
I think it really depends on what you mean by cancelling.

787
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,960
And I completely agree with you that I'm not someone

788
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
who's ever uttered the word, you know,

789
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
cancel culture has never been worse.

790
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,960
500 years ago, Douglas and I would have been burned at the stake.

791
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,960
And I'm not joking, that's what would have happened.

792
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,960
So do I support burning people in the stake

793
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
if it's done by the community rather than the government?

794
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
No.

795
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
But, and we could go down the list.

796
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Obviously, in the US particularly,

797
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
and to a lesser extent in the UK,

798
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
we had the Me Too movement.

799
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
I thought that there were elements of the Me Too movement

800
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,960
that were entirely understandable and frankly quite justified.

801
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I don't know anyone who disagrees with what happened to Harvey Weinstein,

802
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
for example, right?

803
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,960
But on the other hand, there were lots of other people, you know,

804
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,960
who went on a day and things didn't quite go the way

805
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,960
that someone wanted and suddenly they're an abuser, right?

806
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
So I think it's a matter of degrees quite often.

807
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,960
And it is, you know, I have no problem

808
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,960
with people coming and protesting outside an event.

809
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I have no problem with people coming in and asking pointed questions

810
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,960
or challenging and I would in fact would have loved for them to come in.

811
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,960
But shouting people down, trying to get people to lose jobs

812
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,960
because they said something you don't agree with,

813
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,960
that is to me not a way of conducting these conversations.

814
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
If you do not agree with Douglas Murray,

815
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,960
the best thing you can possibly do is make a better argument than Douglas Murray.

816
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
That's what you do.

817
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,960
And if you do that, by the way, in our society now,

818
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,960
you're going to be rewarded with a huge platform

819
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
and lots of money and lots of attention.

820
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,960
The problem is no one seems to be able to do that.

821
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,960
And it tells you something about the strength of their argument.

822
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,960
So to me, come along, if you don't agree with me, come along,

823
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,960
explain to me why I'm wrong and my wife does it all the time.

824
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,960
To societies that have not done this very well.

825
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,960
In Russia, of course, a few weeks ago,

826
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,960
many of us received the news that Alexei Navalny

827
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,960
had passed away, possibly murdered in Russian prison.

828
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,960
What does that mean for the future of,

829
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,960
in your view, that debate, discourse in Russia

830
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
and its struggles with democracy?

831
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,960
I don't remember the last time Russia struggled with democracy.

832
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,960
It's been a long time.

833
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Look, I mean, seriously, Russia never had a democracy, ever,

834
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,960
in 12 centuries.

835
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,960
In 1991, we had a brief window,

836
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,960
and even then, there was not a single democratic transition of power.

837
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Boris Yeltsin handed power over to Vladimir Putin.

838
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Vladimir Putin has been in power for 25 years.

839
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,960
I don't understand why people in the West keep talking about democracy in Russia.

840
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,960
There is no democracy in Russia.

841
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,960
I'm not sure the Russian people would want democracy if it was offered to them.

842
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't.

843
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
That wouldn't be my experience.

844
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,960
I don't think looking at history, that's what you'd conclude.

845
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,960
And the sad death of Alexei Navalny,

846
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,960
who, you know, agree or disagree with some things he said,

847
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,960
but he was a brave man and a principled man.

848
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,960
I don't think it says anything very much about the future of Russia,

849
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,960
other than the fact that Vladimir Putin is now even more firmly in control of the country.

850
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,960
He obviously Navalny represented the sort of liberal opposition,

851
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,960
but, you know, we all, I think, followed the fate of Yevgeny Prugoshin,

852
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,960
who challenged Putin by having his troops march on Moscow.

853
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,960
He decided to withdraw and miraculously Paris in an accident two days later.

854
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:19,960
Igor Girkin Strelkov, he was one of the people who orchestrated the uprising in the east of Ukraine in 2014.

855
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,960
He is now in prison for criticizing Vladimir Putin from a more nationalistic perspective,

856
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
saying Putin's too weak on Ukraine.

857
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,960
And so Vladimir Putin has consolidated power.

858
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,960
And I imagine he's going to hold on to it until he can't any longer.

859
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,960
Very wise, quite cleverly, succinctly described the current moment as being

860
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,960
sense-making institutions have gone mad.

861
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,960
And I think we should agree with basically everything you've said tonight.

862
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Alex from our audience asks, how do we make institutions more trustworthy again?

863
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Well, I can't because I'm not institutions, but what institutions can do is be more trustworthy.

864
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
And then people will trust them more.

865
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
It's pretty simple.

866
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
It sounds glib, I'm not being glib, but that's the answer, right?

867
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
We talked about the media.

868
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,960
If the mainstream media were more trustworthy and didn't jump on every bandwagon and didn't lie and didn't misrepresent

869
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,960
and didn't suppress information they didn't like during COVID.

870
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I mean, look, I still don't know where COVID comes from. Do you?

871
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,960
We hosted a fantastic event about it a few years ago with Sari Markson, though, right?

872
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,960
My point is there was a time when if you'd said that there are some scientists,

873
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
I mean, this is a fact, right?

874
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
You can agree or disagree about the reality.

875
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Some scientists believe that it came from a lab in Wuhan, okay?

876
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,960
You would be censored on YouTube and you would have the potential to lose, in my case, is now my living, right?

877
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Now, do you think that improves trust in the institutions?

878
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
No.

879
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,960
So what the institutions have to do is stop doing stupid things like that.

880
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,960
And then there will be more trust in the institution.

881
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,960
So I wish I had more, but I don't.

882
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,960
Here at CIS, we've spoken a lot about the issues impacting young people, especially,

883
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:24,960
and we view the intergenerational inequality that we're observing as being a critical function of our role in the public debate as well.

884
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:33,960
One of the key areas there is the issue around housing and the concern that many young people are locked out of housing.

885
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:44,960
And yet there is the same paradox that young people should then say, if they're rational voters, should say, build more houses so they can be affordable.

886
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,960
But young people say, don't build more houses.

887
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,960
No more development.

888
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Developers are evil.

889
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Protect the environment.

890
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Lower emissions.

891
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,960
All of this.

892
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
Don't clear land.

893
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Why is this irrationality?

894
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Why this paradox in the way young people are approaching issues impacting their lives?

895
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Well, that's easy.

896
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
Young people are stupid.

897
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,960
I don't mean that this cohort is any more stupid than we were when we were young.

898
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,960
I just mean all young people are stupid, including us, when we were young.

899
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,960
So I don't expect them to necessarily be entirely consistent.

900
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,960
But what I also think is important to say is that young people are right to be upset about the lack of housing and the housing crisis.

901
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,960
And I don't think it's them that's preventing the houses that are being built, frankly.

902
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,960
The people who are preventing the houses from being built are older people who don't want houses to be built in their backyard.

903
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:46,960
And the corrupt construction and land planning situation where people who hold on to land have an incentive to do so because it drives up the price.

904
00:47:46,960 --> 00:48:00,960
So it's basically a set of corrupt incentives within government combined with the fact that these governments increasingly rely on the silver vote of older people who don't seem to be thinking about their grandchildren in a way that they absolutely should be.

905
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,960
What we are doing to our young people is outrageous.

906
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:15,960
And not only on housing, I know you're in a better position than we are on this issue, but debt to GDP in the UK and in the US is running at over 100%.

907
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,960
So this means we're indebting our grandchildren, many of whom are not yet alive.

908
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,960
This is not how responsible society behaves.

909
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:30,960
It just isn't. And housing is just one manifestation of the way that the intergenerational bond is breaking down.

910
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,960
We have to be willing to do what parents and grandparents have done throughout the ages, which is sacrifice for the next generation.

911
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:49,960
We've got to give something up so that they have a better life, not least because if you don't, they're going to burn the whole thing down.

912
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,960
Seven young people applauding.

913
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:08,960
One of the other issues I suppose it mobilizes young people in politics is the challenge of carbon transition, climate emergency, however you like, like to define this challenge.

914
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:21,960
But again, the solutions to this seem to be from innovating our way through to smart solutions, becoming richer and more capable and more able of solving this problem.

915
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,960
But young people, again, seem to vote in a different direction.

916
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:32,960
Glenn, again, sorry, look, it's easy for me to make jokes about how stupid young people are, because as I say, they always are.

917
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:41,960
But we've got to stop pretending it's their fault. Who taught them this crap? Who taught them there's a climate apocalypse coming?

918
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Who was it? It wasn't 20-year-olds, I promise you.

919
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:53,960
So the fact that they're all terrified is the reason is because they've been terrified by adults who need to step up and take some responsibility.

920
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,960
So look, the solution to that issue is technology and innovation.

921
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:05,960
As I said in my Oxford speech, you're not going to get poor people around the world to reduce their consumption levels and you're certainly not going to get rich people around the world to do that either.

922
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,960
So we've got to innovate our way out of the problem as we've always done, right?

923
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,960
And we should encourage young people who care about that issue to go into climate science and science in general and learn things.

924
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,960
And they might realize that things are not as bad and the solution isn't throwing soup on paintings or shouting or protesting.

925
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Solution is actually doing things in the real world, which there are many young people who are doing that.

926
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,960
So look, the answer to this is not to sneer at young people.

927
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,960
The answer to this is take responsibility, understand what's happening in our education system.

928
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,960
And look, as a satirist, a comedian, of course I'm going to make fun of saying Greta of climate change.

929
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:50,960
But at the end of the day, we have to recognize that these issues are important to people for a reason.

930
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,960
We have to address the reasons both real and mythical and made up.

931
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,960
And that's the solution to this problem. Just mocking people isn't going to solve it.

932
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,960
How do you?

933
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Just a couple more questions for us before we need to conclude.

934
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:16,960
But Brendan asks what lessons Australians can take from the rest of the world in combating these issues?

935
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Vaccinate, and I use this word advisedly, vaccinate your children against this ideology.

936
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,960
When I was a young boy in the Soviet Union, probably would have gone to school at six or seven.

937
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,960
So this was right towards the end of the Soviet Union.

938
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,960
My parents said to me, two things. First of all, do not discuss anything we discussed in the house outside the house.

939
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,960
And second, you're going to go to school. They're going to teach you a bunch of crap.

940
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,960
Here's why it's all wrong. And if you have any questions, come and talk to us.

941
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,960
That's what you have to do. Look, that's what you have to do.

942
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,960
You are in that position now. So if you have young children, vaccinate them against this ideology.

943
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,960
And that's a big part of the solution. It starts with you individually.

944
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:06,960
And then, ultimately, whatever business, institution, organization you're in, you have to realize this is a civilizational moment.

945
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,960
You're not going to sit this one out. You're not going to sit this one out. This is real, right?

946
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:20,960
The crisis of meaning and the crisis of confidence in the West, Israel, if we continue slipping down this path, we will not survive.

947
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Not in the way that we think of our civilization.

948
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Now, look, Greece still exists, but it's not exactly the same as ancient Greece, you know, begging Germany for bailouts.

949
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,960
Italy still exists, but it's not exactly the Roman Empire.

950
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,960
This is the logical conclusion of what we're doing.

951
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:46,960
So wake up if there's any influence you have, and you probably have some influence, whether it's in your local community, whether it's in some kind of organization,

952
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,960
whether it's on the board of your school, if you have them, whether it's in your business, and start to actually change the world through small steps.

953
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,960
That's how it works. People doing whatever they can because they realize the moment is here.

954
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,960
And the moment is here. You're not going to sit this one out.

955
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
That's why I...

956
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,960
You know, like, there's literally no reason that I should be sitting here talking to any of you.

957
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,960
I'm not in any way different to you.

958
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:24,960
I was a comedian playing to 80 people in the rooms above a pub in London, and then I was going home one day,

959
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:33,960
and I remember I got into an altercation with some guys who told me to go back where I came from or something like that.

960
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,960
And then I came home, and I had an email from a comedy promoter which said,

961
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,960
I'm sorry, we've canceled your spot on the bill tomorrow because we have too many straight white men.

962
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,960
And I went, this is weird.

963
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,960
And so Francis and I, my co-host on Trigonometry, went, you know, this is going in the wrong direction.

964
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
Let's do something.

965
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:05,960
And we started a podcast in a room above a comedy club with zero money, zero connections, zero social media, zero followers, zero talent, many people would say.

966
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,960
And now we have a million subscribers. If you look at our YouTube and podcast,

967
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,960
and I'm sitting here on the other side of the world talking to you, that's how you do it.

968
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:29,960
So largely to that point, we are just about out of time, but James asks, comments and then asks,

969
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:36,960
many people lack the courage to be able to stand up to absurdities, excesses of ideologies.

970
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
What advice do you give them?

971
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
Almost to do the same thing that you're doing. What advice do you give them?

972
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,960
Well, first of all, you don't want everyone doing what I'm doing.

973
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,960
I don't want the competition.

974
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Look, everyone's different. Everyone's got a different role to play.

975
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,960
I, people often say, well, should more people be like you?

976
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,960
No, we've got enough contrarian assholes like me.

977
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:05,960
You know, genuinely, right? Everybody, the role you've got to play in this is different for everybody and everyone's got to work it out for themselves.

978
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,960
There is no one size fits all. You know what the right thing to do is and just do it.

979
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:19,960
You encounter situations in your life daily where you could do something that would take the conversation or the business or whatever in a different direction.

980
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,960
And most of you probably don't because most of us don't, right?

981
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,960
So that is your opportunity to do something.

982
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,960
And by the way, you know, I think Jordan is absolutely right about this.

983
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,960
I don't do what I do because I have people say, oh, you're so brave. I'm not brave.

984
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,960
I just see where we're going and I think it's bad.

985
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,960
And that's the only reason I'm doing what I'm doing.

986
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,960
The moment I am the turkey that would vote for Christmas, I do not want to be here.

987
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,960
I don't. I genuinely don't.

988
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,960
There's plenty of other things I could do.

989
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,960
I am here because I genuinely think we're in a bad place and we're heading in the wrong direction.

990
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,960
And if you agree with me, you have a duty to do something.

991
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,960
That's it.

992
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,960
You may not want to be here, but we are very glad that you're here.

993
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,960
We are just about out of time.

994
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,960
Everyone, please thank Constantine Kissen.

995
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,960
Thank you very much.

996
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,960
