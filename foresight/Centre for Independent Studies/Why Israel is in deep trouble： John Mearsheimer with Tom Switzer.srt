1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Why are they starving the Palestinians?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,680
Why are they killing the Palestinians?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,800
Why are they making Gaza unlivable?

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,840
It's very simple. They want to drive them out.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:18,060
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,520
welcome to the Intercontinental.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,120
My name is Tom Switzer.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm the executive director at

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,440
the Center for Independent Studies.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, for those of you who don't know much about CIS,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,320
we're a public policy research organization.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,640
We're just based up the road on Macquarie Street,

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,900
and we are primarily focused on

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,640
tackling our nation's great public policy challenges.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,360
So we're interested in economics,

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
education, energy, housing affordability,

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,440
intergenerational matters, aboriginal affairs.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,280
But we're also very much engaged in

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,080
the foreign policy debates,

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,000
and that brings us to this evening's event.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Now, I should stress from the outset that I think it's

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,760
probably fair to say that this crisis

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,720
between Israel and Gaza in the Middle East,

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,640
it's probably the most vexed issue

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,920
in international relations in 2024.

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,560
In a month's time, we'll hear from Brett Stevens,

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,880
the award-winning columnist at

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,760
the New York Times formerly with the Wall Street Journal.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,240
He'll be speaking in solid defense of

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,520
Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,840
But tonight, we will hear a radically different view.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,440
We at CIS believe that it's very important,

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,760
especially for a classical liberal organization like CIS,

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,880
to hear both sides of any debate.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,160
Now, John Mirshimer is without doubt

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,280
one of the most distinguished professors

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,400
of political science in the world.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
He's been a professor of political science

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,520
at the University of Chicago for more than four decades.

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
He's the author of many prominent and influential books,

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,400
most notably the Tragedy of Great Power Politics,

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,040
that was published in 2001,

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
and Foreign Affairs Magazine,

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,400
the prestigious New York-based journal of opinion

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,560
on international affairs.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,000
It ranks Mirshimer's Great Power Thesis

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,600
as one of the three most influential foreign policy

48
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
theses of the post-Coll war era.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,520
John, as Foreign Affairs has actually acknowledged,

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,520
is quote, one of the most famous political scientists

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,080
in history, extraordinary rap,

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,960
one of the most famous political scientists in history.

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
And that review of John's latest book

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
was written by a critic.

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,880
John is also, I think it's fair to say,

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,840
a global sensation in the digital world.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,840
In fact, 19 of his debates and interviews on YouTube

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
have each attracted more than one million views,

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,320
extraordinary, extraordinary.

60
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,080
And I should stress that since he quite correctly predicted

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680
that the US-led invasion of Iraq would be not just

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
unnecessary, but a strategic blunder of epic proportions.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,600
So it's an extraordinary reach and influence for John.

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,880
And with that, it's my great pleasure,

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,960
on behalf of CIS, to welcome Professor John Mirshimer

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,120
back to CIS.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Thank you very much for the kind words, Tom.

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,520
It's great to be back here.

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,040
Great to see Tom again.

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,000
And thank you all for coming out to hear me speak tonight.

71
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,960
As everybody knows, since October 7th,

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,960
the Middle East has been turned upside down.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,280
I think before October 7th,

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,680
almost everybody thought that the Middle East

75
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
was a quite stable area.

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
There were no big problems.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Then October 7th happened,

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,720
and it looks like nothing but trouble today

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,800
and for as far as the eye can see.

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,960
And what I'd like to do is analyze what has happened

81
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,280
since October 7th.

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
I'd like to talk about the causes of the trouble,

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,520
where we are today, and where we're going.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,520
And in pursuit of that, I want to break my talk down this way.

85
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,800
First, I want to focus on analyzing the conflict in Gaza,

86
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,400
mainly between Israel and the Palestinians,

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,440
or Israel and Hamas.

88
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,920
And also to say a few words about Hezbollah,

89
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,040
because the Hezbollah-Israel conflict is connected to Gaza.

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,200
So that's the first conflict I want to look at.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,600
Then the second conflict I want to look at

92
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,240
is the Iran-Israel-U.S. conflict

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,240
that took place April 1st, April 14th, and April 19th.

94
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,960
And I want to figure out what exactly happened there

95
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,760
and what the consequences are.

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,560
And of course, I'm going to do that with the Gaza war as well.

97
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,760
So those are the two conflicts I'm going to look at.

98
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,960
And then what I want to do in the second part of the talk

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,280
is I want to talk about the consequences of all of this,

100
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,880
the consequences of those two conflicts for Israel,

101
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,440
for the United States, and for Iran.

102
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,760
And my basic argument is that Israel is the big loser.

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,000
Israel is in really serious trouble today,

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,880
and there's little hope of getting away from that moving forward.

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,280
Second, that the Americans are also losers,

106
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,000
although they do not lose as big as Israel does.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,960
And the winners, not in any decisive way,

108
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
but the winners are the Iranians.

109
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,800
So that's the basic structure of my talk this evening.

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Now, let me start with what happened on October 7th

111
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,720
and talk about the Gaza war.

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
And just for purposes of background,

113
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,200
for putting a framework in your head,

114
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,040
it's very important to understand that Israel today

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,280
is what I would call greater Israel.

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,640
Israel controls everything between the river and the sea.

117
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,000
And of course, that phrase is usually associated with Hamas.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,480
And what Hamas wants is to control everything

119
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,920
between the river and the sea, just like Israel does.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
And the end result is that what you have today

121
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
is a greater Israel.

122
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,120
And that greater Israel includes

123
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,080
what's called Green Line Israel.

124
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,760
That was Israel before the 1967 war,

125
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,960
plus Gaza, plus the West Bank.

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Okay, so there are those three areas

127
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,360
that comprise greater Israel.

128
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,040
And what's very important to understand

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,320
is that inside greater Israel,

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,120
there are roughly 7.3 million Palestinians

131
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,400
and roughly 7.3 million Israeli Jews.

132
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,040
There is rough equality between the two sides.

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,440
So the question is, how does Israel think

134
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,640
about dealing with greater Israel

135
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,640
where you have rough equality between these two populations?

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,360
And there are basically four options.

137
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,200
One is you have a democratic greater Israel.

138
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,520
That's not gonna happen

139
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,160
because it would no longer be a Jewish state.

140
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,560
Okay, because if you look at demographic patterns,

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
the Palestinians are making more babies

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
than the Israeli Jews.

143
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,360
So that's not happening.

144
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Second possibility is a two-state solution.

145
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Everybody loves to talk about a two-state solution.

146
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
That is not happening.

147
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,400
Certainly after what happened on October 7th,

148
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,960
but even before then, and I'll talk more about this,

149
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli elite

150
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,000
has no interest in a two-state solution, okay?

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,640
The third possibility is apartheid.

152
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,560
And basically what you now have is an apartheid state.

153
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,680
We can go into this in detail in the Q&A

154
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
if you wanna do that,

155
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,920
but if you look at Amnesty International,

156
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,640
Human Rights Watch, and Bicellum,

157
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,120
which is the leading human rights group in Israel,

158
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,800
all three of those organizations

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
have produced lengthy reports

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,800
that lay out why Israel is an apartheid state.

161
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
The fourth option is ethnic cleansing.

162
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,800
And ethnic cleansing means getting rid of the Palestinians

163
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,840
for the most part who live in Gaza

164
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,880
and who live in the West Bank,

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
and creating a greater Israel

166
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
that is completely dominated by Israeli Jews

167
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,360
and has very few, if any, Palestinians in its midst.

168
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
So again, the four options are,

169
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,640
number one, democratic greater Israel,

170
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
number two, two-state solution.

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
Those two are off the table.

172
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
Number three, apartheid,

173
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,440
which is basically what you have now.

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,800
And number four is ethnic cleansing,

175
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,080
where you get rid of the Palestinians, okay?

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Now, let's switch gears a bit

177
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,880
and talk about what the situation looked like

178
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
before October 7th,

179
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
and focus mainly on Gaza.

180
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,240
Before October 7th,

181
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,920
the Palestinians in Gaza

182
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,600
basically lived in a giant open-air prison.

183
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,560
What happened was that in 2005,

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,680
when Ariel Sharon was the prime minister of Israel,

185
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,680
he decided to pull the settlers out of Gaza.

186
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
As you know, there are settlers in the West Bank.

187
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,040
Up until 2005, there were Israeli settlers in Gaza,

188
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,160
and Sharon pulled them out.

189
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
And he pulled them out

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,520
because Gaza was a hornet's nest,

191
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,040
and having settlers in there was a nightmare.

192
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
And they had their hands full in the West Bank,

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,240
and they wanted to focus on the West Bank.

194
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,960
And what they did was pulled all the settlers out,

195
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,400
and it became an open-air prison.

196
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,320
Now, it looked up until October 7th,

197
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,320
like Netanyahu and company

198
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,320
were able to manage the situation inside of Gaza.

199
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,400
Nobody thought what happened on October 7th was gonna happen.

200
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,160
This is why the Israelis got caught with their pants down.

201
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,160
They thought they were managing the situation very well.

202
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,040
And what was going on there

203
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,880
is that Netanyahu was actually very happy

204
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,560
with the fact that Hamas was running Gaza.

205
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,240
This is hard to believe today, but it is true.

206
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
And he was making sure that Hamas was being funded

207
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,640
and that Hamas was doing reasonably well.

208
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,760
Now, why is that the case?

209
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,320
Because Netanyahu is adamantly opposed

210
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,160
to a two-state solution.

211
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,920
And Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority

212
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,560
in the West Bank, is in favor of a two-state solution.

213
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,800
So from Sharon's point of view, not Sharon,

214
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,640
from Netanyahu's point of view,

215
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,880
would have been true from Sharon's point of view as well,

216
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,360
as if he hadn't passed away,

217
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,680
Abbas is a threat because Abbas wants a two-state solution.

218
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,320
So what Netanyahu has done is supported Hamas

219
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,040
because we all know Hamas does not want a two-state solution.

220
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,080
And he's playing off Hamas against the PLO

221
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,880
in the West Bank.

222
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
And it looks like it works.

223
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,160
And by the way, every once in a while,

224
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,800
every couple of years, the Israelis mow the lawn,

225
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,520
which means they precipitate a conflict with the Palestinians,

226
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,280
they go in there, they kill hundreds,

227
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,120
if not thousands of Palestinians,

228
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,840
destroy some buildings and send them a very clear message

229
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,840
that, you know, we're in charge

230
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
and we want you to understand

231
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
that you have to remain in this open-air prison.

232
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,840
So that's the basic situation that exists.

233
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,320
It looks like Netanyahu is managing the situation.

234
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,680
And almost everybody thinks that,

235
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,400
which is again, is why they get caught

236
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,520
with their pants down on October 7th.

237
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,120
But again, what happens on October 7th

238
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,120
is that Hamas attacks into Israel.

239
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,480
And I think it's fair to say, achieves a spectacular success.

240
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,800
I think the evidence is that Hamas was surprised

241
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,040
by how successful they were.

242
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
And anyway, they eventually leave Israel

243
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,720
and the Israelis consolidate the situation

244
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,000
inside of their borders.

245
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,920
And then they eventually go on the offensive against Hamas.

246
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,920
And that offensive is now taking place.

247
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay, now what we wanna ask ourselves

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,080
is what exactly are Israel's goals here?

249
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,600
This is very important to understand

250
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,640
what Israel is trying to do.

251
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,240
Now, if you read the mainstream media in the West,

252
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
and this includes Australia,

253
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,960
what people talk about is that Israel is interested

254
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,000
in number one, defeating Hamas.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,840
And here we're talking about decisively defeating Hamas

256
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,440
and eliminating Hamas.

257
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,520
And you can understand why from Israel's point of view

258
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,280
that makes sense.

259
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,880
Second goal is to get the hostages back.

260
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,400
As you all know, Hamas took about 240 hostages.

261
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,440
And what the Israelis obviously wanna do

262
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
is get those hostages back.

263
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
So there's sort of two principal goals here.

264
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Defeat Hamas decisively and get back the hostages.

265
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,400
What's not discussed in the Western media is the real goal.

266
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,400
And the real goal is to ethnically cleanse Gaza.

267
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,280
And the reason they wanna ethnically cleanse Gaza

268
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,680
is because number one,

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,480
that's the way you get out of apartheid.

270
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,240
You all understand Israel is an apartheid state.

271
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,240
And the only way you get out of that situation is you cleanse.

272
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
Furthermore, it's the only way you defeat Hamas.

273
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,120
I'll talk more about this.

274
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
It's quite clear that the Israelis

275
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,960
are not gonna defeat Hamas, right?

276
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,080
And I can't believe they thought they would defeat Hamas

277
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,400
before they went in there.

278
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,600
They're too smart for that.

279
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,680
But if you cleanse Gaza

280
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
and you drive all the Palestinians out,

281
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,760
you drive Hamas out.

282
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
So you solve two of the principal problems you face

283
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,040
with ethnic cleansing.

284
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,240
You solve the apartheid problem

285
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,960
and you solve the Hamas problem.

286
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,200
Now you're probably saying to yourself,

287
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,560
Israel wouldn't do anything like this.

288
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,800
Just a couple of points.

289
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,280
First of all, to create the state of Israel,

290
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,320
to begin with, you had to do massive ethnic cleansing.

291
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,000
In 1948 and in 1967,

292
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,760
the Israelis cleansed huge portions

293
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,440
of what is today greater Israel.

294
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,480
And the idea that they wouldn't do this,

295
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,680
if you read all sorts of Israeli media,

296
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,920
they talk about ethnic cleansing all the time.

297
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
And it makes perfect sense if you think about it.

298
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,240
Final point I'd make to you is one of the criticisms

299
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,000
that I'll talk more about this

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,800
of what the Israelis and especially Benjamin Netanyahu

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,520
are doing in Gaza,

302
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,320
is they have not come up with a plan

303
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,600
for what Gaza is going to look like

304
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,480
after the shooting stops.

305
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,000
In other words, what's the political solution here

306
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
once the shooting stops?

307
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,520
And Israeli military commanders, IDF military commanders

308
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,560
are constantly complaining these days

309
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,400
that Netanyahu doesn't give them any sense

310
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,800
of what the final political settlement's gonna look like

311
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,200
so they can deal with Hamas

312
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,400
and deal with the Palestinians

313
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,080
with some thought in mind about what the end game is here.

314
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,520
For the reason there's no end game,

315
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,000
the reason they're not talking about

316
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,520
how they're going to administer

317
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,800
a Palestinian-dominated Gaza

318
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,600
is because they want the Palestinians out.

319
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,880
They wanna ethically cleanse Gaza.

320
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,440
And then that brings us to the question,

321
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
how do you do this, right?

322
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,960
How do you get the Palestinians out?

323
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,160
Well, first of all,

324
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,160
they definitely went after Hamas to start with.

325
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,640
That was the purely military side of the story.

326
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,120
They went after Hamas.

327
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,240
But to make ethnic cleansing work,

328
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
you have to number one,

329
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,600
you have to number one,

330
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,440
kill significant numbers of people,

331
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,880
of Palestinians who are basically innocent Palestinians,

332
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,480
not Hamas.

333
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
You have to kill large numbers of them

334
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,440
and you have to give them a powerful incentive

335
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,560
by killing them to drive them out.

336
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Number two, you have to make the place unlivable.

337
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,840
And that's what they're doing.

338
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,240
I mean, they're not just killing people.

339
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,640
They're making Gaza unlivable.

340
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,840
I could go through this in detail in the Q and A

341
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
if people wanna hear the story.

342
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,920
But it is, as many people say,

343
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,120
especially the UN people who are there,

344
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,560
the place is unlivable.

345
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,920
And the reason it's unlivable

346
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,280
is because they're trying to cleanse Gaza.

347
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,320
It's very important to understand that.

348
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,040
And then finally, what they're doing

349
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,520
is starving the population.

350
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,960
There's all sorts of talk about famine in the north,

351
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,360
northern part of Gaza.

352
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,040
The United States is leaning heavily on the Israelis

353
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,680
to let food and other kinds of aid in.

354
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,080
The Israelis are resisting at every turn.

355
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Why are they starving the Palestinians?

356
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
Why are they killing the Palestinians?

357
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,240
Why are they making Gaza unlivable?

358
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,080
It's very simple.

359
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,400
They wanna drive them out.

360
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,080
So that's basically what's been happening.

361
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,600
And in the beginning, right,

362
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,080
there was all sorts of talk about genocide.

363
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,120
And I was on the record publicly

364
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,400
is saying this is not a genocide.

365
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,040
But after December, I changed my mind on that.

366
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I think the Israelis are now engaged in genocide.

367
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,840
And what's happened here

368
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
is because they have been unable

369
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,040
to get the Palestinians out.

370
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,480
They've had to increase

371
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,640
the amount of killing that they do, right?

372
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,560
They're continuing to push

373
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,160
to get the Palestinians out of Gaza.

374
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,400
And the way they do that is just kill more and more people

375
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,560
and make the Palestinian,

376
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,800
make the situation in Gaza more and more unlivable, right?

377
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,880
So the situation's just getting worse and worse and worse.

378
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,760
Despite the fact that the United States

379
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,560
and actually the West more generally doing what they can,

380
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,320
help feed the Palestinians.

381
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
So the question is, where are we today?

382
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
Where are we today?

383
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,040
First of all, they've not defeated Hamas

384
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,720
and they're not gonna defeat Hamas.

385
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,520
Kurt Campbell, who is the deputy secretary of state

386
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,360
basically said that yesterday.

387
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,200
There are all sorts of stories in the Israeli press

388
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,920
that they're not gonna defeat Hamas.

389
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,160
They haven't gotten the hostages back

390
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,120
and they have not been able to cleanse Gaza.

391
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,600
They've not been able to cleanse Gaza.

392
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,720
Furthermore, they're stuck in Gaza.

393
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,760
They're there, right?

394
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,580
They got out in 2005 and they're back there.

395
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,960
This is not good.

396
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,760
So what you see here is that Israel is in real trouble

397
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,480
in Gaza.

398
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,160
Now, in addition to the problem in Gaza,

399
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,600
they have a huge problem with Hezbollah

400
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,240
because Hezbollah in the North in support of Hamas

401
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,960
has been shelling Northern Israel.

402
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,840
And there are somewhere between 60,000

403
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,200
and 100,000 Israelis from the Northern part of Israel

404
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
who have had to move into the center of Israel

405
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,200
on a temporary basis and can't go home

406
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,880
because Hezbollah is shelling Northern Israel.

407
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,880
And Hezbollah has said that until this all ends in Gaza,

408
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,920
they're gonna continue to fight the Israelis.

409
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,000
This is a huge problem for the Israelis.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,520
So they not only have trouble with Hamas and Gaza,

411
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,400
they have trouble with Hezbollah up on the Northern border.

412
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,880
And by the way, the Houthis are actually now taking aim

413
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
at the Israelis and the Houthis just recently landed

414
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
their first missile inside of Israel.

415
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,160
Just one, but that's a harbinger of things to come.

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,200
You see how much trouble Israel is in.

417
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,920
They have not achieved their objectives

418
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,240
with regard to those two stated objectives

419
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,920
and with regard to the ethnic cleansing.

420
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,320
And as I said to you before,

421
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,600
you always wanna understand there are four options here.

422
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,120
First two are off the table

423
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,040
and that comes down to apartheid or ethnic cleansing.

424
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,240
And the Israelis understand full well.

425
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,920
In apartheid state, we remember what happened to South Africa.

426
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,360
We have got to solve that problem.

427
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,960
That's why ethnic cleansing is so attractive,

428
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,000
but they've been unable to ethnically cleanse so far.

429
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's that story.

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,360
That's the story about Gaza.

431
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
Let's shift gears now and talk about Iran

432
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,240
versus Israel versus the United States.

433
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Up until April 1st, the war between Israel and Iran

434
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,480
and even the United States and Iran was a shadow war.

435
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
And it's very important to understand

436
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,880
that we did not want the war, that shadow war to escalate.

437
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,120
We did not wanna see Iran and Israel

438
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,000
get into a fight.

439
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,640
Very important to understand, nor did the Iranians.

440
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
The Iranians had no interest in escalation.

441
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,520
The country that had an interest in escalation

442
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,680
were the Israelis.

443
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,160
The Israelis have had their gun sights on Iran

444
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,120
for a long time and they've been doing everything

445
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,520
they can over time to pull us into a war against Iran,

446
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
but we didn't want a war.

447
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
What happens on April 1st, as I'm sure all of you remember,

448
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,600
is that the Israelis hit the Iranian embassy

449
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,520
in Damascus, Syria.

450
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,680
This drives the Iranians a portray

451
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,800
and the Iranians make it clear

452
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,800
that they're going to retaliate against Israel.

453
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,120
The United States is a guest.

454
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,560
The United States is very angry at the Israelis

455
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,000
for doing this and not telling them that it was coming.

456
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So the Israelis look like they're gonna get a big conflict

457
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
between Israel and the United States

458
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,960
on one side and the Iranians on the other side,

459
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,760
but the United States doesn't want this

460
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,960
and Iran doesn't want this.

461
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,960
So what happens, this is April 1st, the attack on the embassy.

462
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,240
On April 14th, Iran retaliates against Israel.

463
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
You all remember this.

464
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,560
The question is what happens between April 1st

465
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,680
and April 14th and then what happens on April 14th?

466
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,920
So very important to understand these details.

467
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,920
The United States and Iran work together

468
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,880
through intermediaries,

469
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,400
because we don't have direct relations.

470
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,600
We work together through intermediaries

471
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,600
to make sure that the Iranian attack is limited,

472
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,120
that we see it coming beforehand

473
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,640
and that the United States and the Israelis

474
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,160
and others are able to deal with the attack.

475
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,720
Furthermore, we make it clear that we want the Iranians

476
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,720
not to hit any populated areas

477
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,560
and to basically go after one or two military targets.

478
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,560
We and the Iranians agree

479
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,000
that it will be a limited attack.

480
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
We're coordinating with the Iranians

481
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,800
because again, we don't want escalation.

482
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
We meaning the Americans, nor do they.

483
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Then when the Iranian attack comes, a hotline,

484
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,800
an informal hotline is set up between the United States

485
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,560
and Iran via Oman,

486
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,000
because both the Iranians and the Americans

487
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,440
wanna keep this one under control.

488
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,800
Very important to understand that.

489
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,800
And the Iranians attack and what happens there?

490
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,280
The Americans are deeply involved in defending Israel.

491
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,440
You all remember, everybody talked about

492
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,240
how the Jordanians, the Saudis, the French,

493
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,360
the British, the Americans, the Israelis,

494
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,440
they were all involved in dealing with this attack.

495
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
This is a real problem for Israel

496
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,520
because Israel has always prided itself

497
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,680
on being able to independently deal with an adversary

498
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,640
that thinks about attacking it.

499
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,200
Well, in this case, right,

500
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,080
not only are we coordinating things with the Iranians

501
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,760
to make sure this is limited

502
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,400
and it doesn't spin out of control,

503
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,480
but there is considerable evidence

504
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,000
that roughly half of the missiles and drones

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,520
that were shot down were shot down by the United States,

506
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,840
not by Israel, roughly half.

507
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
We were deeply involved.

508
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,400
We had naval ships that shot down Iranian ballistic missiles

509
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
and we were using fighter aircraft

510
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,200
to shoot down cruise missiles and shoot down drones.

511
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,360
Now, the Israelis played a very important role in this,

512
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,440
but it's important to understand

513
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,200
we, the United States of America,

514
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,120
were coordinating the effort.

515
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,720
See how deeply involved we were?

516
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,960
We wanted to keep this one under control.

517
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,120
We wanted to make sure

518
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,720
that that Iranian offensive against Israel

519
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,680
was not successful.

520
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,080
That brings me to the final part of the story

521
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,520
about April events involving Iran and Israel.

522
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,760
The Israelis retaliate on April 19th.

523
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,680
Remember, April 1st is when they hit the embassy in Damascus.

524
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,680
April 14th is when Iran goes after Israel,

525
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,040
does limited damage, hardly any damage,

526
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,280
and then on April 19th, the Israelis retaliate.

527
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
Now, as you would expect,

528
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,240
the Israelis wanted to unleash the dogs.

529
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,320
The Israelis wanted a big counterattack on Iran.

530
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,400
The United States did not want that for one second.

531
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,040
We were trying to put a cap on the volcano.

532
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,000
So what the Israelis end up doing

533
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,760
is basically taking out one radar

534
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,760
in the Isfahan area of Iran, just one radar.

535
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,480
It's a radar associated with an S-300 missile.

536
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,480
It is a very, very limited response.

537
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,640
And it's a limited response

538
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,720
because the United States demands

539
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,680
that it be a limited response.

540
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,120
Furthermore, we go to great lengths to tell the Israelis

541
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,120
they actually won a great victory on April 14th

542
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,320
by stopping all those Israeli missiles and drones.

543
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,160
So Israel, except the fact

544
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,000
that you won a great victory on April 14th,

545
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,680
all we need is just a small-scale attack

546
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,280
where we go after one radar,

547
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,160
and that's the end of the story.

548
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,960
And of course, that was the end of the story.

549
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,920
This one went away,

550
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,920
unlike Gaza, which continues on to this day.

551
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,800
So what I'm telling you is you have these two big conflicts,

552
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,560
the one in Gaza, which I just described,

553
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,920
and then the one involving Iran, Israel,

554
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,480
and the United States between April 1st and April 19th.

555
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,160
Now, I want to talk about the consequences of this

556
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,720
for Israel, United States, and Iran.

557
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,320
And as I said to you,

558
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,880
I believe that Israel was the big loser here.

559
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,760
Now, you're saying to yourself, why is that the case?

560
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,680
Number of reasons.

561
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,320
First of all, the Israelis are back in Gaza.

562
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,440
They got out in 2005.

563
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,840
Ariel Sharon, as you all know, is no shrinking violet.

564
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,600
He's at least as tough an ombre as Benjamin Netanyahu.

565
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,440
He pulled out because Gaza's a hornet's nest.

566
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,600
Well, the Israelis are back in Gaza.

567
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,600
They have no way of getting out at the moment,

568
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,600
and they have no solution to the problem.

569
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,280
They've made Gaza unlivable.

570
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,880
What are they going to do?

571
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,440
The Palestinians are not leaving.

572
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,600
What are they going to do?

573
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
They're running the place.

574
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,800
They're in deep trouble.

575
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,960
Second reason the Israelis lose,

576
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,240
you have to understand how the Israelis think about deterrence.

577
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,280
And this is a very smart way of thinking about deterrence.

578
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,720
I'm not being critical of Israeli thinking here.

579
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,600
What the Israelis believe is that their deterrence

580
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,600
depends on escalation dominance, escalation dominance.

581
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,960
That means if somebody whacks me and I whacked them back,

582
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,320
I whacked them back harder than they initially whacked me.

583
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,920
In other words, as we go up the escalation ladder,

584
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,260
I dominate escalation dominance.

585
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,260
The best example of this is in the summer of 2003,

586
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Hezbollah killed a few Israelis,

587
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,520
this is up on the northern border.

588
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,360
Hezbollah killed a few Israelis

589
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,360
and kidnapped an Israeli, okay?

590
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,240
The Israelis massively retaliated.

591
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,320
And Nasrallah, who is the head of Hezbollah,

592
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,300
said, I think two months later,

593
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,920
Nasrallah said, if I had known

594
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,080
what the Israelis were gonna do in terms of retaliating,

595
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I would have never allowed the attack on July 12th, 2006.

596
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,760
That's escalation dominance, do you understand?

597
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
It's very important, from Israel's point of view,

598
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,920
they have to make it clear to all their neighbors

599
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,680
that if you whack us, we'll whack you back harder.

600
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,840
It's now very clear the Israelis no longer

601
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,120
have escalation dominance vis-a-vis Iran

602
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,520
or vis-a-vis Hezbollah.

603
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,720
They cannot shut down the conflict

604
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,640
with Hezbollah on their northern border.

605
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,280
Really quite remarkable.

606
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,120
The Israelis are hitting Hezbollah very hard

607
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,240
and Hezbollah is responding.

608
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets and missiles

609
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,400
and those numbers will only grow at the passage of time.

610
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,280
150,000, right?

611
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,440
So the Israelis are limited in what they can do.

612
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,000
And with regard to Iran, I described to you

613
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,960
what happened April 1st, April 14th, April 19th.

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,600
That is not escalation dominance.

615
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm sorry, that is not escalation dominance.

616
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,800
And furthermore, they needed the Americans.

617
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,560
You all understand, I'm just sort of

618
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,040
diverting from the path of mine for one second.

619
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,640
If you look at what's happening in Gaza,

620
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,520
the Israelis could never conduct that operation

621
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,320
in Gaza without American support, not even close.

622
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,520
And all sorts of Israeli generals say that

623
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,640
in the Israeli press.

624
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,680
They cannot by themselves produce the weaponry

625
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,040
to conduct the operations they're now conducting in Gaza.

626
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,000
They need us.

627
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And what I'm telling you about what happened

628
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,840
on April 14th is they needed us.

629
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
You hear all this talk about iron dome

630
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,840
and their ability to shoot down missiles.

631
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,560
They cannot do it alone.

632
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Iron dome is not that formidable defensive system

633
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,960
and furthermore given cost exchange ratios,

634
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,680
the number of missiles that the Iranians

635
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,680
and Hezbollah have, iron dome over the long term

636
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,920
in a fight is just not very useful.

637
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,920
So from a deterrence point of view,

638
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
the Israelis are in real trouble.

639
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,680
So my first point is they're in real trouble

640
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,200
because they're stuck in Gaza

641
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,080
and they have no solution to the problem.

642
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,080
And number two, their deterrence has been badly weakened.

643
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,040
Number three is very important to understand

644
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,720
with the coming of all these missiles

645
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,680
and the coming of drones,

646
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,960
it's now possible for actors like Hamas,

647
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,920
the Houthis and Hezbollah and Iran

648
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,920
to develop the capability to hit Israel

649
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,480
and cause enormous amounts of damage.

650
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,520
And lots of people who live in Israel

651
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,480
are not very comfortable with this situation.

652
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,360
The idea that they are exposed to adversaries

653
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,480
and these are formidable adversaries.

654
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,320
I don't wanna make light of the fact

655
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,440
that groups like Hezbollah and groups like Hamas

656
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,080
would like to finish Israel off.

657
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,080
They would, these are really tough hombres.

658
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,040
And what's happened here is that with the passage of time,

659
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,680
missile capabilities and drone capabilities

660
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,720
have reached the point where it's quite easy

661
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,240
for actors like that to employ those weapons

662
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,760
to create a real threat for Israel.

663
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,200
The fourth way in which Israel is in trouble

664
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,880
is that it has effectively become a pariah state

665
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,600
in ways that it never was in the past.

666
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,600
If you look at what's happening in the United States

667
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,640
and all across the world on university campuses

668
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,360
and college campuses,

669
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,520
this is just evidence whether you think

670
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,840
what's going on is right or wrong

671
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,160
that Israel's reputation has been badly tarnished.

672
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,240
If you think about the fact that South Africa took Israel

673
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,400
before the International Court of Justice

674
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,000
and the International Court of Justice found,

675
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,160
not that Israel is committing genocide.

676
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,400
They didn't find that.

677
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,640
That is yet to be determined.

678
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,600
But what the International Court of Justice did find

679
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,960
is that there is sufficient evidence,

680
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,640
there's enough evidence to think

681
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,640
that Israel might be committing genocide.

682
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
And if you look at polls inside the United States,

683
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
it's truly remarkable how many people,

684
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,680
especially Democrats,

685
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,040
believed that Israel is engaged in genocide.

686
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,880
There's a recent poll that shows

687
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,320
that 56% of all Democrats think

688
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,720
that Israel is committing genocide.

689
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,760
Think about that, 56% of Americans

690
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,120
hold think that Israel is committing genocide.

691
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,720
There's another poll that shows,

692
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,160
talks about Biden voters,

693
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,160
that shows that 57% think Israel is committing genocide.

694
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,320
27% are not sure.

695
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,640
57% think Israel is committing genocide.

696
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,720
27% are not sure.

697
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,520
And then 15% do not believe Israel is committing genocide.

698
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,400
This is quite remarkable.

699
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
When I think about how I thought about Israel

700
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,160
and virtually everybody I knew thought about Israel

701
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,200
when I was a young boy and I was a young man

702
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,800
and how virtually everybody I know now thinks about Israel,

703
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,920
a fundamental transformation has taken place.

704
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,960
It's really quite remarkable.

705
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
And the idea that the Jewish state

706
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,400
is being accused of genocide,

707
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
it's really quite remarkable.

708
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,120
This is a sign of big trouble

709
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,120
and the use of the apartheid label is used increasingly.

710
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,160
And this is not gonna change

711
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,400
because the situation in Gaza is not gonna get any better.

712
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,760
That was one of the points I'm trying to get through to you.

713
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,480
There is no solution on the horizon here.

714
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,040
If anybody asked me in the question and answer period,

715
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,280
what would I do to fix this problem?

716
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,000
I could tell you what the answer is now.

717
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
I have no idea.

718
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,160
Let's be very clear on this.

719
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,120
Categorically depressing.

720
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,360
But anyway, I think that from Israel's point of view,

721
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,520
what's happened to its reputation is disastrous

722
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,840
and I don't think it's gonna get any better over time.

723
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,760
So this is why these four reasons,

724
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,440
number one, the fact they're stuck in Gaza once more.

725
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,680
Number two, the fact that their deterrence has been weakened

726
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,960
because they don't have escalation dominance.

727
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,240
Number three, the fact that they're surrounded by adversaries

728
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,920
who loathe them, would like to destroy them

729
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,600
and who have increasing numbers of missiles and drones

730
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,120
that can cause them lots of trouble is bad news.

731
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,000
And number four, the pariah state argument.

732
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,040
Now let me conclude by talking briefly

733
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,640
about the United States and talking about Iran.

734
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,520
The United States is also a big loser here.

735
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,280
First of all, it's in our interest

736
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,600
to have peace in the Middle East.

737
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,200
First of all, we've been fighting so many wars.

738
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,280
The American public is just sick of all these wars.

739
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,720
The last thing we want are more wars in the Middle East.

740
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,440
Oh my God, a war against Iran.

741
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,840
This is the last thing people want, right?

742
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
We want peace.

743
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,320
Furthermore, we need a peaceful Middle East

744
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,560
so we can pivot to East Asia, right?

745
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,400
From the American point of view,

746
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,120
the most serious threat on the planet is China.

747
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,360
The United States has to contain China.

748
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,000
We have to pivot to Asia.

749
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,240
We can't pivot to Asia because we're pinned down in Ukraine

750
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,600
and now we're pinned down in the Middle East.

751
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
This is not good.

752
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,120
We want for sure to settle this one, right?

753
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,640
To have a situation like the one that existed

754
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,880
before October 7th.

755
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,800
Remember Jake Sullivan said a few weeks

756
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,640
before October 7th, we haven't seen the Middle East

757
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,480
this peaceful for a long time

758
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,640
and he was very happy about that

759
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,960
and it made perfect sense from an American point of view.

760
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,640
But that went away very quickly on October 7th.

761
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,200
So we want peace.

762
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Second point is we also care greatly

763
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,200
about having friendly relations

764
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,000
with as many states in the Middle East as possible.

765
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,760
Why is that the case?

766
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,480
The Russians are already there, number one,

767
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,800
and two, the Chinese are beginning to move in.

768
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
For all the older dogs,

769
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,880
I noticed there are a number of older dogs in the audience.

770
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,600
We all remember back in the day, right?

771
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,600
When the US and the Soviet Union competed in the Middle East.

772
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,720
Well, what you're gonna see moving forward

773
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
is not just the United States and Russia,

774
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,040
but the United States, Russia and China

775
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,240
competing in the Middle East.

776
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
The Chinese are building a blue water navy

777
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,000
to project power into the Gulf, number one.

778
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,760
Number two, they depend heavily on oil

779
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,000
and therefore they're doing everything they can

780
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,680
to have good relations with Iran,

781
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,040
good relations with Saudi Arabia.

782
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,800
And we are very worried about this.

783
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,840
The United States doesn't want bad relations

784
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,160
with countries in the Middle East

785
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,880
that drive them into the arms of the Chinese and the Russians.

786
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,400
And you see a lot of that happening.

787
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,200
By the way, you all know about the Abraham Accords.

788
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,280
The Abraham Accords was where the United States

789
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,760
was recently trying to get Israel, Saudi Arabia,

790
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,000
and the United States all together in a sort of quasi-alliance.

791
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,800
This is all gone by the boards now

792
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,320
because of what's happening in Gaza, right?

793
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,480
This is not in our interest.

794
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,200
It's certainly not in Israel's interest

795
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,040
and it's certainly not in Saudi's interest at all, either.

796
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,320
So you see the problem that we have here,

797
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,800
just one other problem, and this applies to the Israelis as well,

798
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,320
is the nuclear issue.

799
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,320
You all understand Iran is hopskipping a jump away

800
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,240
from developing nuclear weapons

801
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,680
because we, with pressure from the Israelis,

802
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,120
we the Americans, pulled out of the JCPOA.

803
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,760
That was the nuclear agreement

804
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,640
that the Obama administration crafted with Iran.

805
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,280
The Iranians are now enriching uranium up to 60%.

806
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,560
And you have to enrich uranium up to 90%

807
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:11,120
to have it capable of being turned into a bomb.

808
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,600
And it's very easy to get from 60% to 90%.

809
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,680
My guess is, and just from reading the literature,

810
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,320
that Iran could have enough fissile material

811
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,720
for three bombs in about six weeks.

812
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
That's not a bomb.

813
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,240
That's just a fissile material.

814
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I think it would take probably about six months

815
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,920
to build three bombs,

816
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,680
and then they'd have to develop the delivery capability.

817
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,280
So it's not like they're going to develop a bomb

818
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,680
in a month or two's time.

819
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,800
That's not going to happen, but they're not that far away.

820
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,240
And what happens when you bomb their embassy

821
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,280
and then you get in a tit for tat,

822
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,560
fight with them on April 14th and April 19th

823
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,840
is you give them an incentive to get nuclear weapons.

824
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,400
And you can see signs of that.

825
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
You can see signs of the Iranians

826
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,600
talking about getting nuclear weapons.

827
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,520
So one of the principal problems

828
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,240
that the Israelis and the Americans face

829
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,120
as a result of what happened between April 1st and April 19th

830
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,080
is we've incentivized the Iranians to get nuclear weapons.

831
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,600
Not that they'll go through with it,

832
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,520
but we've given them powerful incentive to do that,

833
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,120
and they have the capability

834
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,640
because they can enrich uranium up to 90%

835
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960
and then produce bombs.

836
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,640
Just say a few words in conclusion, Tom, about Iran.

837
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
As I said to you before, I think Iran is the winner.

838
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,440
I think America's the loser.

839
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,040
I think Israel is the biggest loser.

840
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,720
But I think that the Iranians are the winners so far.

841
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,480
And this is not to say that they have really come out

842
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,200
of this smelling like a rose, as my mother used to say.

843
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,720
I don't want to go that far.

844
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,920
But on balance, I think they've done quite well for themselves.

845
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,280
First of all, they have been able, except for April 14th,

846
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,080
to remain on the sidelines.

847
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,440
And they are using their proxies in the region

848
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,640
or they're working with their proxies.

849
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,720
That's a better way to put it, to great effect.

850
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,960
Because as you know, the Iranians are allied with Hamas.

851
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,680
They're allied with Hezbollah.

852
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,400
They're allied with the Houthis.

853
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,480
And they're allied with these militias inside of Iraq and Syria

854
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,600
that have their gun sights not only on the United States,

855
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,080
but on Israel as well.

856
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,120
So they have been able to stay out of the fight,

857
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,240
yet see their proxies do very well in this conflict

858
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:52,080
with both the United States and Israel.

859
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,880
Another point that you want to keep in mind

860
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,360
is that Iran, as a result of all this,

861
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,160
now has very close relations with Russia and China.

862
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,200
What we're doing, what the United States is doing,

863
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,520
is we're driving the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese,

864
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,440
and the North Koreans together.

865
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,200
This makes it harder for us to isolate Iran.

866
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,040
And if Iran starts to go down the nuclear road, nuclear weapons

867
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,200
road, and we want to put pressure on the Iranians,

868
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,000
it's not clear the Chinese and the Russians

869
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,600
are going to help us very much.

870
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,880
We need the Chinese and the Russians to help us.

871
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,280
But anyway, the Iranians feel like they're

872
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,760
in quite a good situation, because the United States

873
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,240
and the Israelis have not been able to do anything

874
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,080
to really harm them.

875
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,000
In fact, Iran got away with whacking Israel.

876
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,640
This is the first time that Iran has ever

877
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,840
been able to launch missiles and drones from its own territory,

878
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,600
hit Israel, and Israel barely retaliated.

879
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,760
Iranians are probably feeling good about that, as they should.

880
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,080
And then the final point is the sanctions against Iran

881
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,800
are not working the way they once were.

882
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,600
They have weakened.

883
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,200
So if you look overall at what's happened to the Iranians

884
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,920
and what's happening to the Americans,

885
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,160
and especially what's happening to the Israelis,

886
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,240
you see that the situation after October 7th

887
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,560
is fundamentally different than the situation

888
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,160
before October 7th.

889
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,120
Just in the case of the Israelis, before October 7th,

890
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,520
it looked like they were in the cat bird seat.

891
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,720
They were managing very well in their own opinion

892
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,440
the situation in Gaza.

893
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,920
And by the way, I want to be clear here.

894
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,840
I thought they were doing an excellent job

895
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,040
of managing the problem in Gaza.

896
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,160
I thought they had things under control.

897
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,920
I was shocked by what happened on October 7th.

898
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,160
But once October 7th happened, and as we've watched

899
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,720
these two conflicts play themselves out,

900
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,720
one, the war in Gaza, and how that's linked to Hezbollah,

901
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,240
you don't want to forget, and then two,

902
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,440
the Iran-Israel-United States exchange

903
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,040
between April 1st and April 19th.

904
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,080
It's quite clear that the world has changed

905
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,960
in ways that are not good for either Israel

906
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,520
or the United States.

907
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,360
Thank you.

908
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,320
Welcome back to CIS.

909
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,640
It's great to have you back.

910
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,480
Notwithstanding all those points you made

911
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,880
about escalation dominance and the fact that the Israelis

912
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,360
are now bogged down in Gaza, aren't you overstating

913
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,200
your point about Israel's grim security outlook?

914
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,360
After all, it's not declared,

915
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,840
but they do have nuclear weapons.

916
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,080
And as a foreign policy realist,

917
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,480
you would surely concede that nuclear weapons

918
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,840
are the ultimate deterrent to a foreign attack.

919
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,480
So are you being overly gloomy

920
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,680
about Israel's security outlook?

921
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,320
I think there's no question, as Tom points out,

922
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,120
that nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent.

923
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,360
And I don't think any country with nuclear weapons

924
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,320
is gonna disappear from the planet

925
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,560
because another country attacks it.

926
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,680
I think that no country would try to inflict

927
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,680
a decisive defeat on Israel because it has nuclear weapons.

928
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,280
But the problem is that Israel has an internal problem.

929
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,280
See, Tom's point about nuclear weapons applies

930
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,280
if you're talking about Iran hitting Israel.

931
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,280
It's an interstate problem, okay?

932
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,280
But Hamas is not another country.

933
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,280
Hamas is inside greater Israel.

934
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,280
What Hamas is doing is executing a rebellion

935
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,280
or executing an insurrection.

936
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,920
And nuclear weapons don't do anything for you

937
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,680
in that regard.

938
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,720
To take this a step further,

939
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,160
we've talked a little bit just briefly about South Africa

940
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,840
and the fact that South Africa was an apartheid state.

941
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,440
And basically that state that existed,

942
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,360
apartheid South Africa, disappeared.

943
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,600
That state had nuclear weapons.

944
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
South Africa had nuclear weapons.

945
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,240
And what you wanna understand,

946
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,000
and this is very important in the Israeli context,

947
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
is that what's happening inside your society,

948
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
inside your body politic matters enormously.

949
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,920
And nuclear weapons can't do much to protect you.

950
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,040
You see what I'm saying?

951
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,000
But I don't wanna take away from his basic point

952
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,840
that nuclear weapons do provide deterrence

953
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,720
against Iran getting nuclear weapons or...

954
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,080
Well, I mean, many scholars would still argue

955
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,600
that the security outlook for Israel

956
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,400
is not as grim as you point out,

957
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,840
not just because of their access to nuclear weapons.

958
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,680
Let me put this to you.

959
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,640
This is Fareed Zakaria, a CNN host

960
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,760
who's also a columnist at the Washington Post.

961
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,760
Now, admittedly, he said this before October 7,

962
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,680
but let me put this to you.

963
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,400
This is what he says.

964
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,000
First, there is the disappearance of the Arab threat.

965
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,400
From its first day in existence,

966
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,640
Israel has faced the danger of extinction by Arab armies.

967
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,160
This is the threat against which the Jewish state

968
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,080
has planned, armed and trade for most of its national life.

969
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Today, that threat is gone.

970
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,840
Second, the armies from Israel's main strategic

971
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,640
adversaries, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, historically,

972
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,680
they're in disarray while the Israeli armed forces

973
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,760
have become the region's superpower

974
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,560
in a league ahead of the rest.

975
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,720
How would you respond to Fareed Zakaria?

976
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,840
He's right in that sense that those traditional adversaries

977
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,160
have effectively disappeared.

978
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,200
When I was young and the 1956 war took place, the 1967 war

979
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,160
took place, the 1973 war took place,

980
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,920
these were all conflicts that involved Israel

981
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,120
up against Arab states.

982
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,320
And by the way, in 1948, when Israel got its independence,

983
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,400
May 14, 1948, yesterday was Israeli Independence Day.

984
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,480
But it's an anniversary.

985
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,160
Yeah, but there's no question that the Israelis fought wars

986
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,960
in 1948 against.

987
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,240
That's his point.

988
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,360
But that's not the threat anymore.

989
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,480
There's a whole new set of threats called Hamas,

990
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,440
called Hezbollah, called the Houthis.

991
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,720
But aren't we seeing a broader trend in the Middle East

992
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,320
between the Iranian-backed Shia proxies

993
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,480
that you just mentioned, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels,

994
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,160
versus Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Gulf states?

995
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,440
Isn't that the broader issue?

996
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,640
And doesn't that, to the extent that is true, help Israel?

997
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,600
Because you've got a civil war, essentially,

998
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,800
in the Muslim community in the Arab world.

999
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,400
How does it help Israel solve the Gaza problem?

1000
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,840
Explain to me how that helps Israel solve the Gaza problem.

1001
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,800
And while you're at it, explain to me

1002
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,600
how it helps solve the missile problem that Hezbollah, Hamas,

1003
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,560
and the Houthis, and Iran present to Israel.

1004
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,520
You, like former president Jimmy Carter and the university,

1005
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,560
we've got time for questions.

1006
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,560
I want to get through it.

1007
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,760
You've called tonight Israel in a partite state.

1008
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,920
It can't Palestinian vote.

1009
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,800
It's important to understand that there are basically

1010
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,600
three groups of Palestinians, the Palestinians, obviously,

1011
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,200
in Gaza, who we talked about tonight,

1012
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,280
the Palestinians in the West Bank,

1013
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,600
and then the Palestinians inside of what's

1014
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,040
called Green Line Israel.

1015
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,520
That was the Israel that existed up until the 1967 war,

1016
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,560
before they captured those two territories.

1017
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,520
And when I say there are 7.3 million Palestinians

1018
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,560
in greater Israel, that includes the Palestinians

1019
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,400
in all three of those areas.

1020
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,680
The only Palestinians who can vote

1021
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,440
are the Palestinians in Green Line Israel.

1022
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:47,120
The Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot vote.

1023
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,360
That's one point.

1024
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,040
The second point is the Palestinians in Israel

1025
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,520
do not have equal rights.

1026
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,680
There's no question they can vote,

1027
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,520
but they don't have equal rights.

1028
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,240
That's why I always argue that Israel

1029
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,840
is not a liberal democracy.

1030
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,440
If you want to argue Israel is a democracy,

1031
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,680
you can make that argument.

1032
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,760
I would even fight with you there because of the West Bank

1033
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,280
in Gaza.

1034
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,440
But let me say I'll give you that, that it is a democracy.

1035
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,480
You can't make the argument that Israel

1036
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,160
is a liberal democracy because the Palestinians don't

1037
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,280
have equal rights inside Green Line Israel.

1038
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,880
This is the principal reason, in my opinion,

1039
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,760
that Israel does not have a constitution.

1040
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,040
They've moved in that direction a couple of times,

1041
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,480
but they can't go too far down that road

1042
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,400
because they don't want equal rights.

1043
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,400
They want a Jewish state, not a state

1044
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,440
where Palestinians and Jews are equal in number

1045
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,080
and have equal rights.

1046
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,400
OK, but your critics, and they're not just Jewish leaders,

1047
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,920
a lot of people in this room, presumably,

1048
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,080
would say it's a stretch to compare Israel today

1049
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,000
to the old, racist South Africa of the SDU.

1050
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,560
And this is the late Les Gilb, someone

1051
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,200
you knew, the former president of the New York

1052
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,120
Base Council on Foreign Relations,

1053
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,680
quote, the US is helping to protect

1054
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,760
one of the few nations in the world

1055
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,520
that share American values and interests, a true democracy.

1056
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,480
And this is Richard Cohen, a longtime columnist

1057
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,600
of The Washington Post.

1058
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,840
The Israel of today and the South Africa of yesterday

1059
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,760
have almost nothing in common.

1060
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,080
In South Africa, the minority white population

1061
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,640
harshly ruled the majority black population.

1062
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,880
Non-whites were denied civil rights.

1063
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,640
And in 1958, they were even deprived of citizenship.

1064
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,320
Cohen goes on to say, in contrast,

1065
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,280
Israeli Arabs, about one-fifth of the country,

1066
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,800
have the same civil and political rights as Israeli Jews.

1067
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,880
Arabs sit in the Knesset and serve in the military,

1068
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,080
although most are exempt from the draft.

1069
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,000
And Cohen concludes, whatever this is,

1070
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,640
and it looks suspiciously like a liberal democracy,

1071
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,240
it cannot be apartheid.

1072
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,320
Again, your response to the likes of Les Gilb and Richard Cohen.

1073
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,560
Just very quickly, they don't have equal rights.

1074
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,840
This is the Palestinians who live inside Green Line Israel.

1075
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,320
They simply don't have equal rights.

1076
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,880
And what about the Palestinians in Gaza

1077
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,640
and the Palestinians in the West Bank?

1078
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,600
This is all part of Greater Israel.

1079
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,200
But let me make a couple of points in addition to that.

1080
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,400
First of all, whether Israel is an apartheid state

1081
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,800
is not based on any comparison with South Africa.

1082
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,800
You have to come up with what is a definition of apartheid.

1083
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,000
And then you have to look at what's happening inside of Israel

1084
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,200
and see whether it meets that definition.

1085
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,000
There's no question that there are differences,

1086
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,600
and I'll get to this in a second,

1087
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,840
between apartheid in South Africa and apartheid in Israel.

1088
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,160
But the question is,

1089
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,200
what are the general characteristics of an apartheid regime

1090
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,560
and does Israel fill the bill?

1091
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,680
Now, as I told you before, if you have any doubts about this,

1092
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,760
there are huge reports written by Human Rights Watch,

1093
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,800
Amnesty International and Bet-Salon,

1094
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,640
which is the leading human rights group inside of Israel,

1095
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,640
laying out the case as to why Israel is an apartheid state.

1096
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,440
And I think those three reports make a very powerful case.

1097
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,280
My final point to you is there are a number

1098
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,760
of South Africans who lived under apartheid in South Africa,

1099
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,600
including South African Jews and including Bishop Tutu,

1100
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,160
who make the argument that the apartheid system in Israel

1101
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,880
is worse than the apartheid system in South Africa.

1102
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,600
Let's turn to Rafa, the Southern city in Gaza.

1103
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,960
Now, the Israeli leadership seems to believe

1104
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,120
that a full-scale ground military invasion

1105
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,000
of Rafa will finish the job of eliminating Hamas.

1106
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,160
You've said that that's not realistic.

1107
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,080
Now, your critics would say that with its gleeful mutilations,

1108
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,720
its rampages, its rapes and beheadings,

1109
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,720
its baby killing on October 7, Hamas needs crushing.

1110
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,920
And if Hamas keeps control of Rafa and the people, it wins.

1111
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,920
The Israelis may believe that Hamas needs to be crushed.

1112
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,320
And you can understand, given what happened on October 7,

1113
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,800
why they feel that way, they're not going to crush Hamas.

1114
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,480
And if you read the newspapers carefully every day,

1115
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,160
you will see that Hamas has come back to life

1116
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,160
in northern Gaza and the Israelis have now sent military forces

1117
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,160
into northern Gaza to deal with Hamas.

1118
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,160
The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal today

1119
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,160
have articles dealing with the fact that Hamas

1120
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,160
is almost impossible to defeat.

1121
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,160
They're just not going to defeat them.

1122
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,160
This is why I said to you, ethnic cleansing is so attractive

1123
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
to the Israelis.

1124
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,160
Ethnic cleansing solves the apartheid problem.

1125
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,160
What Tom was challenging me on a minute ago

1126
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,160
and it solves the Hamas problem which he's challenging me on now.

1127
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Many democratic legislators who have traditionally

1128
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,160
been very supportive of Israel have called on Netanyahu

1129
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
to be replaced.

1130
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,160
To what extent would things change in Gaza

1131
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,160
and the Israeli military operation in Gaza

1132
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,160
if Netanyahu is replaced as many democratic lawmakers

1133
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,160
and indeed Brett Stevens at the New York Times

1134
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,160
has called for Netanyahu to be removed?

1135
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
How would things change?

1136
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,160
Not at all.

1137
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,160
This is an argument that I hear in the United States

1138
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,160
and it's made by liberal American Jews,

1139
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
people like Tom Friedman.

1140
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,160
At the New York Times?

1141
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,160
Yeah, at the New York Times.

1142
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,160
People who believe that Netanyahu is an anomaly

1143
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,160
and if we can only get rid of him

1144
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
and replace him with Thomas Jefferson

1145
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,160
or somebody like that,

1146
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,160
Israel will live happily ever after.

1147
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,160
This is a foolish argument, right?

1148
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,160
It's quite clear that Netanyahu and his war cabinet

1149
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,160
and most of the national security elite in Israel today

1150
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,160
agree with Israeli policy under Netanyahu.

1151
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,160
So it wouldn't change anything.

1152
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,160
It would change hardly anything.

1153
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Now you say Israel has had Iran in its sights for a long time,

1154
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,160
but isn't it true that Iran's sheer theocracy

1155
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,160
has also had Israel in its sights for a long time?

1156
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,160
After all, many of their leaders have declared

1157
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,160
the eradication of Israel off the face of the map.

1158
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:20,160
Look, there's no question that Iran

1159
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,160
considers Israel to be a mortal enemy

1160
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,160
and would like to do away with the Jewish state

1161
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,160
the same way Hezbollah would like to do away with the Jewish state.

1162
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,160
So there's no question about that.

1163
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,160
And there's no question that the Israelis

1164
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,160
hate the Iranians or hate Iran

1165
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:46,160
and it's a case of mutual hatred,

1166
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,160
mutual dislike, call it what you want.

1167
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,160
There's no question about it.

1168
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,160
Who is responsible for starting this?

1169
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,160
The implication of your question was that

1170
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,160
it is Iran that's responsible, not Israel.

1171
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,160
What we'll say later is that talk about this,

1172
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,160
about eradicating Israel off the face of the earth.

1173
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,160
It's pretty provocative, isn't it?

1174
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,160
I agree.

1175
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,160
That's correct, but I'm just saying

1176
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,160
it's not clear that they started it.

1177
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,160
You want to remember that Iran once had very good relations

1178
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,160
with Israel, once had very good relations

1179
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,160
with the United States, and that even in the 1990s

1180
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,160
the Iranians were interested in improving relations

1181
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,160
with the United States.

1182
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,160
And one could make an argument that if you had gotten

1183
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:32,160
a two-state solution that Iran would have reconciled itself

1184
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,160
to dealing with this problem.

1185
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,160
So we haven't talked much about the two-state solution

1186
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,160
in large part because I sort of took it off the table early on.

1187
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,160
But it's very important to understand that every American president

1188
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,160
since Jimmy Carter has pushed hard on the two-state solution

1189
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,160
because we think the two-state solution,

1190
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,160
we meaning American elites, think the two-state solution

1191
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:02,160
is the only reasonable way to get out of this conundrum.

1192
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,160
What has to be done here is that the Palestinians

1193
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,160
have to be given self-determination.

1194
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,160
They need a sovereign state of their own.

1195
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,160
And this is what the two-state solution was designed to do.

1196
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,160
And American leaders understood that if the Israelis

1197
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,160
did not agree to a two-state solution

1198
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,160
and you did not get a two-state solution,

1199
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,160
you were going to have trouble for as far as the eye can see.

1200
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,160
You all understand, maybe the younger people in the audience don't,

1201
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,160
but what happened on October 7th is really not an anomaly.

1202
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,160
There was the first intifada, then there was the second intifada.

1203
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,160
Late 80s and early 2000s.

1204
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,160
Pardon?

1205
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,160
Late 80s and the early 2000s.

1206
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,160
Yes, 1987 was the first intifada

1207
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,160
and 2000 was the second intifada.

1208
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,160
And these were, you know, Palestinian insurrections.

1209
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
But, John, you could get a two-state solution

1210
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,160
with the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank,

1211
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,160
but Hamas has made it very clear as a user of your knowledge

1212
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,160
that they don't support a two-state solution.

1213
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,160
Absolutely.

1214
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,160
There's no question about that.

1215
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,160
I just want to be very clear here.

1216
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,160
This gets back to my point that Netanyahu was playing

1217
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
divide and conquer, right?

1218
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Netanyahu had quite good relations with Hamas before October 7th

1219
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,160
because Hamas doesn't want a two-state solution

1220
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,160
and Netanyahu doesn't want a two-state solution.

1221
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
And from Netanyahu's point of view,

1222
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,160
the real threat was Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority.

1223
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,160
And you notice, by the way, that the Americans have been saying

1224
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,160
that what we need to do in Gaza

1225
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,160
is put the Palestinian Authority in control,

1226
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,160
get Hamas out of the way,

1227
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,160
and put the Palestinian Authority in control.

1228
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Netanyahu has made it unequivocally clear this is not happening,

1229
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,160
and that's because the Palestinian Authority

1230
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,160
has reconciled itself to a two-state solution,

1231
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,160
and that's nightmare news for Netanyahu.

1232
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:09,160
You say that Tehran's hand has been strengthened during this dispute,

1233
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,160
but let me put this to you.

1234
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,160
Iran is surrounded by hostile Sunni states across the Persian Gulf,

1235
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,160
since Saudi Arabia.

1236
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,160
It's fanatically anti-sheer and well-armed arch enemy.

1237
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,160
In Iraq and Syria, at least until recently,

1238
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,160
you had Iran facing large Sunni insurgencies

1239
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,160
dedicated to slaughtering the Shia.

1240
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,160
Then there's the internal unrest within Iran.

1241
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,160
A lot of younger people, a lot of younger Iranians

1242
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,160
take a more liberal view about the world and their parents

1243
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,160
and certainly the Shia clerical regime.

1244
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,160
So are you overlooking Iran's real weaknesses and limitations?

1245
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,160
Well, he only gave me 50 minutes to talk.

1246
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,160
If he had been willing to fulfill my request

1247
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,160
to be able to talk for two hours,

1248
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,160
I would have qualified my argument somewhat.

1249
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,160
There's absolutely no question that Iran has significant problems,

1250
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,160
but the thing you want to remember about Iran

1251
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:21,160
is that Iran is much more powerful than all of its neighbors.

1252
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,160
It has a very large population,

1253
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,160
and the human capital inside of Iran is very impressive.

1254
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,160
And if you were to look at the potential balance of power

1255
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,160
between Iran and Saudi Arabia,

1256
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,160
if they were both able to mobilize all their resources,

1257
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,160
it's a Bambi versus Godzilla situation.

1258
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:47,160
That's why the Saudis are so interested in the Abraham Accord.

1259
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,160
The Saudis want to jump into bed with the Israelis and the Americans

1260
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:57,160
because the Saudis understand that the Iranians have a lot of potential power.

1261
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Whenever you want to measure the power of a country,

1262
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
the two things that you go to,

1263
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,160
number one are population size and number two are wealth.

1264
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,160
Number two is wealth.

1265
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,160
Wealth and population size.

1266
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,160
And if you look at the Iranian situation,

1267
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,160
they are potentially a very powerful country,

1268
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,160
which is not to take away from your points about the problems that they face.

1269
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,160
Now it's time for question time.

1270
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:27,160
And please, I encourage you to try to keep your questions short of the mind.

1271
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,160
But also, feel free to ask about not just the Middle East,

1272
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,160
but also Ukraine and China,

1273
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,160
about which John has spoken in great detail.

1274
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,160
First question.

1275
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,160
You've talked about how Israel now stuck in Gaza.

1276
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,160
Do you see similar trap for the US,

1277
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,160
or do they have a path forward and out of this?

1278
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,160
Well, the United States is not going into Gaza, right?

1279
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,160
I mean, we're not putting forces in there.

1280
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,160
But we are joined at the hip with Israel.

1281
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,160
We have this special relationship

1282
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:05,160
so that as long as Israel is bogged down in Gaza

1283
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,160
and having all sorts of problems,

1284
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,160
both in terms of dealing with the Palestinians

1285
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,160
and dealing with the wider world,

1286
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,160
it has huge consequences for us.

1287
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,160
We end up vetoing Security Council resolutions

1288
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,160
that we don't want to veto.

1289
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:29,160
It ends up poisoning our relations with the Egyptians and the Jordanians.

1290
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:34,160
So there are all sorts of spin-off consequences for us that are negative.

1291
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,160
And this is why the Biden administration, to its credit,

1292
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,160
is deeply committed to trying to figure out how to solve this one.

1293
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,160
As I said before, we'd like Mahmoud Abbas to come in, take over.

1294
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,160
Then we can get the rich Arab countries to pour money in.

1295
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,160
We can rebuild Gaza and live happily ever after.

1296
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,160
That's what we want to do,

1297
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:58,160
because this is not in our interest to let this go on.

1298
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,160
But the problem we face is we can't get the Israelis to go along with us.

1299
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,160
This is well documented.

1300
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,160
And the end result is, you know, no end to trouble,

1301
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,160
certainly for the Israelis, but even for us.

1302
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,160
Next question. Yes, sir.

1303
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,160
Thanks, John Lachlan McIntyre.

1304
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,160
Since Australia's security depends on the United States,

1305
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:24,160
do we have no option but to take sides in Gaza and Ukraine?

1306
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,160
Meaning Australia.

1307
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:32,160
I'm not sure what taking sides means.

1308
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:38,160
If you're talking about Hamas versus Israel,

1309
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:45,160
that's very different than talking about the Palestinians versus Israel.

1310
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:52,160
In other words, I know lots of people who loathe Hamas and hope Israel destroys it,

1311
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,160
who are very sympathetic to the Palestinians,

1312
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,160
who believe that Israel is committing genocide.

1313
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,160
So I would argue you can take the side of the Palestinians

1314
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,160
if you are an Australian,

1315
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:15,160
and you can make the argument that that's in Israel's interest.

1316
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:21,160
People who've argued for a two-state solution have long argued that's in Israel's interest.

1317
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,160
That's the solution. That's the argument.

1318
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,160
But if it's a choice between Hamas and Israel,

1319
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:35,160
Australia, certainly the government and most people who operate in the foreign policy establishment,

1320
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,160
they have no choice but to side with Israel against Hamas.

1321
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,160
Next question, John Connor.

1322
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:50,160
Yes, part of your proposition essentially is that there is no support in Israel for a two-state solution.

1323
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:56,160
Now, I know that there's an organisation which, membership of which is confined to people

1324
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:02,160
who've been the rank of major or above in one of the four Israeli defence and intelligence institutions.

1325
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,160
That has consistently argued, I've not checked since October,

1326
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:11,160
but has consistently argued in favour of a two-state solution while recognising it's difficult.

1327
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:17,160
I really think that that is in fact a reflection of at least the views of a significant part

1328
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:23,160
of the Israeli intelligence and military establishment prior to October 7.

1329
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,160
Now, given that and sufficient pressure from the US and otherwise,

1330
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:36,160
may require transfers of population through Gaza and the 500,000 settlers in the West Bank, Israeli settlers,

1331
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:43,160
but surely there must be some degree you may be pushing on an open door in trying to arrive at that solution.

1332
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:47,160
With all due respect, I don't agree with you on that.

1333
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:55,160
I think there are a handful of people in the Israeli establishment who are in favour of a two-state solution,

1334
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:01,160
but they're small in number and the elites who...

1335
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,160
Sorry, that organisation includes the heads of all of those four,

1336
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,160
previous heads of all of those four organisations, various of them.

1337
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:12,160
Still a small number. I believe there's no evidence.

1338
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:18,160
Furthermore, the Israelis are not going to agree to a two-state solution after what happened on October 7.

1339
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:26,160
You're going to create a viable Palestinian state that has weapons of its own on your border.

1340
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:34,160
You've not defeated Hamas. You've just suffered this devastating defeat on October 7.

1341
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,160
It's just not going to happen.

1342
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,160
Okay, next question, Tony, and then we'll go to Antoinette.

1343
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:45,160
I'd like to just push on this two-state solution a bit further, and really as you as a realist.

1344
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:58,160
Basically, you said that a greater Israel with the West Bank and Gaza in it as a democratic state is off the table.

1345
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,160
I think everybody can understand that.

1346
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:06,160
I think that ethnic cleansing is off the table because it's not going to happen.

1347
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:11,160
Nobody's going to allow Israel to do that, and I'm not even sure that Israel wants to do that.

1348
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:19,160
So you are driven back to the two-state solution, and I'm sort of intrigued as a realist why you're not embracing that.

1349
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:30,160
And can I just push you on? Can't the United States really use its influence to create that solution coming out of this?

1350
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:40,160
Look, I hope that I'm wrong, and the two-state solution is a viable alternative.

1351
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:47,160
The Israelis wake up and smell the coffee, and the Americans do what you described.

1352
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:55,160
I've been wrong before, and if there's an issue, I'd like to be wrong on moving forward.

1353
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,160
This is the issue.

1354
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:07,160
So in spirit, I'm with you, but I don't think, as I said to the gentleman on your right,

1355
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:15,160
that there is much enthusiasm for a two-state solution before October 7th inside of Israel,

1356
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:22,160
and certainly now, and public opinion is against the two-state solution as well as elite opinion.

1357
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:31,160
And furthermore, with regard to the United States putting pressure on Israel, Steve Walt and I wrote this book on the Israel lobby.

1358
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,160
Steve Walt from Harvard University.

1359
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,160
Yeah.

1360
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,160
Steve Walt, who teaches at Harvard, he and I wrote the book on the Israel lobby,

1361
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:42,160
and there's no way any American government can put significant pressure on Israel.

1362
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:49,160
Well, you say that, but the Reagan administration put pressure on Israel and Prime Minister Begin when they invited southern Lebanon.

1363
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
This is the New York Times.

1364
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,160
I think this was just a few days ago.

1365
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:02,160
They quoted, this is the quote, Mr. Reagan used the power of U.S. arms several times to influence Israeli war policy at different points,

1366
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,160
including war planes, custom munitions to be delayed or withheld.

1367
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:11,160
And of course, Joe Biden has recently withheld the support of three and a half thousand bombs to Israel.

1368
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,160
So, so much for the Israel lobby.

1369
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,160
No.

1370
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,160
No.

1371
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:35,160
I mean, there you could point to one or two instances back in the distant past where the United States put some pressure on Israel and the Reagan administration in 1982.

1372
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,160
Yeah.

1373
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,160
That was President Bosnia with the settlements.

1374
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,160
He failed.

1375
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,160
He failed.

1376
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,160
It went nowhere.

1377
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,160
Right.

1378
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,160
No president has been able to put me.

1379
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:49,160
Joe Biden is not going to put meaningful pressure on the lobby.

1380
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:56,160
Joe Biden, you understand Joe Biden wants to win the election this coming November.

1381
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:05,160
And if Joe Biden gets tough on Israel, you'll see what Brett, you'll have Brett Stevens asked here.

1382
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,160
Ask Brett Stevens.

1383
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:14,160
He wrote a big column as soon as soon as Joe Biden told Israel he was holding up these extra bombs.

1384
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:18,160
That they really didn't need anyway, because they've got so many bombs.

1385
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:27,160
As soon as that happened, Brett Stevens had a column and all sorts of supporters of Israel told Joe Biden in no uncertain terms.

1386
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:32,160
You want to remember you're up for reelection and we won't forget.

1387
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:41,160
And of course, the problem that Biden faces is you all know is that Arab Americans and many others are going to punish Biden.

1388
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:52,160
Well, the running joke around Jerusalem is that having been strongly supportive of Netanyahu after October 7, Joe Biden is seriously invested in the two-state solution, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

1389
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,160
Okay, Antoinette.

1390
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,160
Antoinette.

1391
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,160
I have two questions, but I'll make them very, very quick.

1392
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:04,160
Firstly, you said a couple of times that Israel is stuck in Gaza.

1393
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,160
They can't get out.

1394
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,160
Can you be more specific about why they are stuck and why they can't withdraw?

1395
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:18,160
And my second question in all the decades that you have been following this conflict, the situation closely, where do you think Israel is currently?

1396
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:28,160
You said that, you know, reputationally, politically, they're losing, but specifically in regards to the information war and their ability to put out disinformation.

1397
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:35,160
We've got headed babies and people being baked and widespread sexual violence.

1398
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:44,160
Do you think that this is different in terms of people's willingness, the broader public or the greater West's willingness to believe?

1399
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,160
Yeah.

1400
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,160
Okay.

1401
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,160
These are two great questions, as are all the other questions for sure.

1402
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:58,160
But just on the first, the first question is why are the Israelis or why am I saying the Israelis are stuck in Gaza?

1403
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:03,160
Well, they have said they're not leaving Gaza, right?

1404
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:12,160
They're going to stay there and they understand it is a choice, but they decided to stay.

1405
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:20,160
I mean, I said they're stuck in Gaza and I just said that's because they decided to stay there.

1406
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,160
I mean, it may be a choice.

1407
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,160
You might not like the choice, but that's the choice they made.

1408
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,160
And you want to remember they've not defeated Hamas number one.

1409
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,160
And number two, there's the question, who's going to run the place?

1410
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,160
Right.

1411
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,160
So they're going to stay.

1412
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,160
How they do this remains to be seen.

1413
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:46,160
How many troops they leave, where those troops are deployed, how those troops act, that remains to be seen, but they're stuck.

1414
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,160
Second question is a very interesting question.

1415
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:53,160
It's all about controlling the narrative.

1416
01:19:53,160 --> 01:20:00,160
The Israelis controlled the narrative in really powerful ways up until the late 1980s.

1417
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:12,160
Then you had this group of historians in Israel called the new historians who were then young at the time, and they got access to the archives.

1418
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:20,160
And they got access to the records on how Israel was created.

1419
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:29,160
And what they did is they exploded all the myths or almost all the myths about how Israel was created.

1420
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:37,160
And it really portrayed the Israelis in a negative light.

1421
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:42,160
And that was the start of trouble.

1422
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:55,160
And I could tell you all sorts of stories about that because people began to think differently about Israel than from the way we thought about when I was young.

1423
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,160
There was a book by Leon Urus.

1424
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,160
It was called Exodus, and everybody read it.

1425
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,160
And it was a movie.

1426
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,160
Paul Newman and even Marie Sainz starred in it.

1427
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:11,160
And it portrayed the Israelis in a very positive light and the Arabs in a very negative light.

1428
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:21,160
And once the new historians came along, all sorts of people, mainly at the elite level, began to think differently about the creation of Israel and Israel's behavior.

1429
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:29,160
Then what happens is you get social media and you get the internet.

1430
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:41,160
And Israel has huge influence in influencing what the Wall Street Journal, what the New York Times, what the Washington Post says.

1431
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,160
But TikTok is a nightmare for Israel.

1432
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,160
It's an utter nightmare.

1433
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:58,160
There's this famous conversation that you can get on the internet of Jonathan Greenblatt, who is the head of the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL.

1434
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,160
He's Abe Foxman's successor.

1435
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:06,160
He's on the phone talking to somebody, and there's a video of it.

1436
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,160
And he's talking about TikTok.

1437
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,160
And it's just a disaster for Israel.

1438
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,160
People see what's happening.

1439
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,160
And the Israelis, this is really quite remarkable.

1440
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:28,160
The Israelis are filming themselves doing absolutely horrible things to the Palestinians and then putting it on the internet.

1441
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,160
It's just hard to believe.

1442
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:41,160
And furthermore, just on the whole genocide story, you know, if you want to make the case that Israel is guilty of genocide,

1443
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,160
you have to do two things.

1444
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,160
You have to provide evidence of intent, number one.

1445
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:54,160
And you have to provide evidence that Israel's actions are consistent with the intent.

1446
01:22:54,160 --> 01:23:05,160
Now, with regard to intent, the Israeli leaders across the board, including Benjamin Nant and Netanyahu, after October 7th,

1447
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:12,160
said all sorts of things that, in my opinion, demonstrated genocidal intent.

1448
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,160
This was documented in the South African case.

1449
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,160
Yes, documented in the South African case.

1450
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:21,160
And by the way, there was a piece in Haaretz, which is like the New York Times of Israel.

1451
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,160
Is that left-leaning Israeli publication?

1452
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,160
Yeah, liberal. I'd use the word liberal.

1453
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,160
American liberal.

1454
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,160
Yeah, American liberal.

1455
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:35,160
But anyway, there was a piece in Haaretz, and the headline of the piece in Haaretz said,

1456
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
The Road to the Hague.

1457
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:45,160
This is the International Court of Justice decision on whether it's potentially genocide.

1458
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,160
The Haaretz piece said, The Road to the Hague.

1459
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,160
This is the headline.

1460
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:57,160
The Road to the Hague is paved with public comments by Israeli leaders.

1461
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,160
Which is exactly right.

1462
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:02,160
You just sort of say to yourself, are they really saying these things?

1463
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,160
And then again, you have all these videos.

1464
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:10,160
And I was talking to my daughter one day, who's not very political at all.

1465
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:18,160
She's in her 40s, and she was talking about watching what the Israelis are doing to children on TikTok.

1466
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,160
And she said, I can't watch TikTok.

1467
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,160
I just can't watch these videos anymore.

1468
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,160
They're so horrible.

1469
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,160
This is a disaster for Israel.

1470
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,160
It's a public relations disaster.

1471
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:33,160
John, we've been very happy to welcome students from Year 12.

1472
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:38,160
So they're last year at high school from Ravenswood College, which is a prestigious school in Sydney.

1473
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,160
We've got some students here.

1474
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,160
We've got one school teacher I think wants to ask a question.

1475
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:45,160
And they will also ask one of the students to ask a question if that's possible.

1476
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,160
Sure.

1477
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,160
Thanks for the talk.

1478
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:58,160
You mentioned the winners and losers referring to the US, Iran and Israel of this war.

1479
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:06,160
But I'm wondering, I'd like to hear what you feel will be the impact on the 7.4 million Palestinians,

1480
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,160
the other party to the war in the long run.

1481
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,160
Obviously they're suffering at the moment.

1482
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:14,160
But my real question is really about the one state solution.

1483
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:24,160
You said the options are a one state solution, two state solution, continued apartheid or ethnic cleansing.

1484
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:31,160
For those of us that believe that ethnic cleansing and apartheid are not acceptable,

1485
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:38,160
and that want to see the maintenance of international law, that leaves us with the one state or two state.

1486
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:44,160
I think many experts are saying the two states not possible, given the patchwork of illegal settlements.

1487
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:54,160
So what would have to change the future to bring about a one state solution?

1488
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,160
You know, as I said, did everybody hear the question?

1489
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,160
I don't have a good answer to that.

1490
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:12,160
I mean, as I said to these two gentlemen on my left, I hope that I'm wrong and they're right about the possibility of a two state solution.

1491
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:22,160
I think they're wrong, and as I make clear, and I don't think there's any way you're going to get a one state solution.

1492
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:29,160
And I kind of don't, I don't fully understand where this train is headed, right?

1493
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,160
I think Israel is in deep trouble.

1494
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:36,160
I think the Israelis will continue to push at ethnic cleansing.

1495
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,160
I think that's what you're going to see.

1496
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:46,160
I think for the reasons I tried to elaborate here, that from their point of view seems to be the best solution.

1497
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,160
I don't think they can get away with it.

1498
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
I'm not 100% sure.

1499
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,160
I hope they can't get away with it.

1500
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,160
But where this all ends?

1501
01:26:55,160 --> 01:27:04,160
You know, it gets back to the brief discussion I was having with Tom when Tom said, oh, Israel has a nuclear weapon.

1502
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,160
It's not going anywhere.

1503
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:15,160
And you want to remember that South Africa had a nuclear weapon, as I reminded Tom, and apartheid South Africa disappeared.

1504
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:22,160
The sort of long term future of Israel is in question for a lot of reasons.

1505
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:28,160
Many of which I have not touched on tonight for time related reasons.

1506
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:36,160
But you want to understand that immediately after October 7th, 500,000 Israelis left the country.

1507
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,160
500,000 Israelis left Israel after October 7th?

1508
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,160
Yeah.

1509
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,160
Wow.

1510
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:52,160
And it's, you know, I was talking to somebody who is in the Polish foreign policy establishment the other day.

1511
01:27:52,160 --> 01:28:07,160
And he was telling me, you'd be amazed at how many Israelis are applying for a Polish citizenship, so that they can have a Polish passport.

1512
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:11,160
And the same is true with other European countries.

1513
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:21,160
So you just, you don't, I don't want to get into the centrifugal forces that are at play inside of Israel, because it's too late in the evening.

1514
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:25,160
But this is a country that just has lots of problems.

1515
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,160
And where this all goes, I don't know.

1516
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,160
Not least the demographic challenges.

1517
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:34,160
Now, do we have a question from one of the students at Ravenswood?

1518
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,160
Hello.

1519
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:39,160
I'm a year 12 student at Ravenswood School for Girls.

1520
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:45,160
The question that I want to ask is essentially looking at the US election.

1521
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:55,160
How do you think the conflict in the Middle East and the impact of non-state actors will influence the result in the upcoming US election, which you touched on earlier in your talk?

1522
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,160
Thank you.

1523
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,160
I'm jealous of all you students.

1524
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,160
You're so young.

1525
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:05,160
It's depressing to think how old I am.

1526
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,160
Yeah, it's a very interesting question.

1527
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,160
What happens if Trump gets elected?

1528
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:16,160
First of all, I think in terms of the Middle East and in terms of East Asia, it will have little effect.

1529
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,160
Okay.

1530
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:25,160
The interesting question is whether it will matter in Europe with regard to NATO and with regard to Putin.

1531
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:33,160
As we all know from the last time around with Trump, he really wanted to throw NATO down the toilet bowl.

1532
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,160
He has no use for NATO.

1533
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:41,160
He thinks our European allies are freeloaders and he'd like to get rid of them.

1534
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,160
And he likes Putin.

1535
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,160
This is not surprising.

1536
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,160
And he really wanted to have good relations with Putin.

1537
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:52,160
He lost on both counts.

1538
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:58,160
The blob or the deep state, whatever you want to call it, beat him back.

1539
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:04,160
He is now determined if he wins to not let that happen again.

1540
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:15,160
And he is number one going to bring in a whole group of seasoned individuals who served with him in the first term, who share his view of the world.

1541
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:23,160
He didn't have those people available in 2017 when he moved in the White House, January 2017.

1542
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:33,160
He now feels, and I think it's correct, that he can bring in a team of individuals and they collectively can beat back the deep state, number one.

1543
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:47,160
And number two, at the Heritage Foundation, they're coming up with a plan for what to do once they move back into the White House in 2025.

1544
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:51,160
So they're going to have the people, they're going to have the plan or the grand strategy.

1545
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,160
And then the question is, can they make it work?

1546
01:30:54,160 --> 01:31:04,160
And again, my initial point to you is I think that where they will try to change things in a fundamental way is in Europe.

1547
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:17,160
And the question you have to ask yourself is, do you think that Trump, even with all of the preparation that's now in train, do you think that Trump can beat the deep state?

1548
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:21,160
I'm a structuralist, as some of you know, the students clearly know this.

1549
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:29,160
I believe that structure really matters and it limits how much agency someone like Trump has.

1550
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:37,160
So I'm betting on the deep state with regard to NATO and with regard to Europe.

1551
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:47,160
And I think whether Trump or Biden wins, it won't matter that much on the foreign policy front.

1552
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:53,160
I think the dais cast here, certainly in East Asia, I think the dais cast in the Middle East.

1553
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,160
I mean, what's he going to do in the Middle East?

1554
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:58,160
What's Trump going to do differently?

1555
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:03,160
Well, the Republican Party is clearly more pro-Israel than the Democrat Party, correct?

1556
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:23,160
Yeah, but even there, because of my point to Tony about the lobby, the Democratic Party is filled with people who are, especially among the younger Democrats, who are, I think it's fair to say, hostile to Israel at this point in time.

1557
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:34,160
But the elites, the Democratic Party elites, the people who run the country, they're, you know, no different than the Republicans, right?

1558
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,160
It's Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

1559
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:40,160
And Joe Biden, it will be the Democrat.

1560
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,160
If the Democrats win, it'll be Donald Trump of the Republicans.

1561
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:46,160
And I just don't think you're going to get much difference.

1562
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:51,160
Fortunately, we are running out of time, but I just want to conclude and make a few remarks about CIS.

1563
01:32:51,160 --> 01:33:00,160
One of our favorite quotes, you've heard me say this before, first from John Stuart Mill, the famous English liberal thinker of the 19th century.

1564
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:06,160
He famously said, he who knows only his own position knows little of that.

1565
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:15,160
And what that meant was, as my friend and mentor and former CIS senior fellow, Owen Harries, used to put it, and this is very relevant to the students in the room,

1566
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:25,160
to take particular care to understand the position of your adversary and to understand it, not in a caricatured or superficial form,

1567
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:30,160
but at its strongest for until you have rebutted it at its strongest, you have not rebutted it at all.

1568
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:38,160
And this is a necessary condition for both developing your own position fully and attacking your opponents successfully.

1569
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,160
That's the first quote.

1570
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:46,160
My favorite quote at CIS is from the great 20th century public intellectual Walter Lippman, also a foreign policy realist.

1571
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:52,160
And he said, we're all think alike, no one thinks very much.

1572
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:59,160
Now, I think tonight we heard a strikingly different view from the one you'll hear in the Australian newspaper, the financial review,

1573
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,160
the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph.

1574
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:05,160
I only mentioned these papers because these are papers that you and I read regularly.

1575
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:13,160
And I think it's fair to say that on behalf of our colleagues and board members here at CIS, John, we're very grateful for you being here,

1576
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,160
putting forward the counterargument.

1577
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,160
You'll hear from Brett Stevens in a month's time.

1578
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,160
Please join me in thanking John Mishon.

1579
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:32,160
For decades, CIS has been a fiercely independent voice working hard to promote sound liberal principles.
