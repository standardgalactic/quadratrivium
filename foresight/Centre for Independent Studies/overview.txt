3. **Courage to Stand Up**: In response to James's question about how people lacking courage can stand up against absurdities and excesses of ideologies, Kissen advises that everyone has a different role to play and should do what they believe is right in situations where they could influence the direction of conversation or action.

Checking Centre for Independent Studies/Why Israel is in deep trouble： John Mearsheimer with Tom Switzer.txt
1. John Roskam from the Centre for Independent Studies (CIS) and The Spectator Australia engaged in a discussion with John Mills, the founder of the Global Panoply Foundation and former White House official under President Trump. They discussed the potential return of Trump to the White House and the implications for foreign policy, particularly in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.

2. Roskam highlighted the concept of structure, suggesting that the deep state's influence on foreign policy is significant, potentially limiting the ability of any single individual, including Trump, to make fundamental changes. He believes that both a Trump or Biden presidency would result in similar policies, especially regarding NATO and Europe.

3. Mills argued that if Trump returns to office, he will likely bring in a team from his first term who share his views and are prepared to take on the deep state. He also mentioned that the Heritage Foundation is developing strategies for a potential second term.

4. In the Middle East, despite a generally more pro-Israel stance of the Republican Party compared to the Democratic Party, Mills pointed out that both parties are similar in their foreign policy approaches towards Israel due to the influence of lobbying groups.

5. Roskam emphasized the importance of understanding one's adversary's position and refuting it at its strongest, referencing the thoughts of John Stuart Mill and Walter Lippman. He noted that the perspectives shared by Mills would be a stark contrast to those commonly found in mainstream media outlets.

6. The discussion underscored the value of CIS as an independent voice promoting liberal principles and encouraged viewers to subscribe to their channel for future content, while also inviting them to support CIS through donations.
