WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Why are they starving the Palestinians?

00:02.640 --> 00:04.680
Why are they killing the Palestinians?

00:04.680 --> 00:06.800
Why are they making Gaza unlivable?

00:06.800 --> 00:08.840
It's very simple. They want to drive them out.

00:08.840 --> 00:18.060
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

00:18.060 --> 00:19.520
welcome to the Intercontinental.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.120
My name is Tom Switzer.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.560
I'm the executive director at

00:22.560 --> 00:24.440
the Center for Independent Studies.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.000
Now, for those of you who don't know much about CIS,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.320
we're a public policy research organization.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.640
We're just based up the road on Macquarie Street,

00:31.640 --> 00:34.900
and we are primarily focused on

00:34.900 --> 00:37.640
tackling our nation's great public policy challenges.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.360
So we're interested in economics,

00:39.360 --> 00:44.160
education, energy, housing affordability,

00:44.160 --> 00:47.440
intergenerational matters, aboriginal affairs.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.280
But we're also very much engaged in

00:49.280 --> 00:51.080
the foreign policy debates,

00:51.080 --> 00:54.000
and that brings us to this evening's event.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.800
Now, I should stress from the outset that I think it's

00:56.800 --> 00:58.760
probably fair to say that this crisis

00:58.760 --> 01:01.720
between Israel and Gaza in the Middle East,

01:01.720 --> 01:03.640
it's probably the most vexed issue

01:03.640 --> 01:06.920
in international relations in 2024.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.560
In a month's time, we'll hear from Brett Stevens,

01:10.560 --> 01:11.880
the award-winning columnist at

01:11.880 --> 01:14.760
the New York Times formerly with the Wall Street Journal.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.240
He'll be speaking in solid defense of

01:17.240 --> 01:20.520
Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.840
But tonight, we will hear a radically different view.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.440
We at CIS believe that it's very important,

01:26.480 --> 01:29.760
especially for a classical liberal organization like CIS,

01:29.760 --> 01:32.880
to hear both sides of any debate.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.160
Now, John Mirshimer is without doubt

01:35.160 --> 01:37.280
one of the most distinguished professors

01:37.280 --> 01:39.400
of political science in the world.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.400
He's been a professor of political science

01:41.400 --> 01:45.520
at the University of Chicago for more than four decades.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.240
He's the author of many prominent and influential books,

01:48.240 --> 01:52.400
most notably the Tragedy of Great Power Politics,

01:52.400 --> 01:55.040
that was published in 2001,

01:55.040 --> 01:56.440
and Foreign Affairs Magazine,

01:56.440 --> 01:59.400
the prestigious New York-based journal of opinion

01:59.400 --> 02:01.560
on international affairs.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.000
It ranks Mirshimer's Great Power Thesis

02:06.000 --> 02:09.600
as one of the three most influential foreign policy

02:09.600 --> 02:13.000
theses of the post-Coll war era.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.520
John, as Foreign Affairs has actually acknowledged,

02:16.520 --> 02:21.520
is quote, one of the most famous political scientists

02:22.320 --> 02:25.080
in history, extraordinary rap,

02:25.080 --> 02:28.960
one of the most famous political scientists in history.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.960
And that review of John's latest book

02:30.960 --> 02:32.240
was written by a critic.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.880
John is also, I think it's fair to say,

02:35.880 --> 02:38.840
a global sensation in the digital world.

02:38.840 --> 02:43.840
In fact, 19 of his debates and interviews on YouTube

02:44.720 --> 02:48.400
have each attracted more than one million views,

02:48.400 --> 02:50.320
extraordinary, extraordinary.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.080
And I should stress that since he quite correctly predicted

02:54.080 --> 02:57.680
that the US-led invasion of Iraq would be not just

02:57.680 --> 03:02.080
unnecessary, but a strategic blunder of epic proportions.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.600
So it's an extraordinary reach and influence for John.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.880
And with that, it's my great pleasure,

03:07.880 --> 03:10.960
on behalf of CIS, to welcome Professor John Mirshimer

03:10.960 --> 03:12.120
back to CIS.

03:12.120 --> 03:17.120
Thank you very much for the kind words, Tom.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.520
It's great to be back here.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.040
Great to see Tom again.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.000
And thank you all for coming out to hear me speak tonight.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.960
As everybody knows, since October 7th,

03:27.960 --> 03:31.960
the Middle East has been turned upside down.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.280
I think before October 7th,

03:34.280 --> 03:38.680
almost everybody thought that the Middle East

03:38.680 --> 03:40.560
was a quite stable area.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.560
There were no big problems.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.440
Then October 7th happened,

03:44.440 --> 03:48.720
and it looks like nothing but trouble today

03:48.720 --> 03:51.800
and for as far as the eye can see.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.960
And what I'd like to do is analyze what has happened

03:56.960 --> 03:59.280
since October 7th.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.640
I'd like to talk about the causes of the trouble,

04:02.640 --> 04:07.520
where we are today, and where we're going.

04:07.520 --> 04:13.520
And in pursuit of that, I want to break my talk down this way.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.800
First, I want to focus on analyzing the conflict in Gaza,

04:18.800 --> 04:23.400
mainly between Israel and the Palestinians,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.440
or Israel and Hamas.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.920
And also to say a few words about Hezbollah,

04:28.920 --> 04:34.040
because the Hezbollah-Israel conflict is connected to Gaza.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.200
So that's the first conflict I want to look at.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.600
Then the second conflict I want to look at

04:41.240 --> 04:44.240
is the Iran-Israel-U.S. conflict

04:44.240 --> 04:50.240
that took place April 1st, April 14th, and April 19th.

04:51.960 --> 04:57.960
And I want to figure out what exactly happened there

04:57.960 --> 05:00.760
and what the consequences are.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.560
And of course, I'm going to do that with the Gaza war as well.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.760
So those are the two conflicts I'm going to look at.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.960
And then what I want to do in the second part of the talk

05:10.960 --> 05:14.280
is I want to talk about the consequences of all of this,

05:14.280 --> 05:18.880
the consequences of those two conflicts for Israel,

05:18.880 --> 05:22.440
for the United States, and for Iran.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.760
And my basic argument is that Israel is the big loser.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.000
Israel is in really serious trouble today,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.880
and there's little hope of getting away from that moving forward.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.280
Second, that the Americans are also losers,

05:38.280 --> 05:43.000
although they do not lose as big as Israel does.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.960
And the winners, not in any decisive way,

05:45.960 --> 05:48.680
but the winners are the Iranians.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.800
So that's the basic structure of my talk this evening.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.760
Now, let me start with what happened on October 7th

05:57.760 --> 06:00.720
and talk about the Gaza war.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.880
And just for purposes of background,

06:02.880 --> 06:05.200
for putting a framework in your head,

06:05.200 --> 06:10.040
it's very important to understand that Israel today

06:10.040 --> 06:13.280
is what I would call greater Israel.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.640
Israel controls everything between the river and the sea.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.000
And of course, that phrase is usually associated with Hamas.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.480
And what Hamas wants is to control everything

06:24.480 --> 06:27.920
between the river and the sea, just like Israel does.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.480
And the end result is that what you have today

06:30.480 --> 06:32.720
is a greater Israel.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.120
And that greater Israel includes

06:36.120 --> 06:38.080
what's called Green Line Israel.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.760
That was Israel before the 1967 war,

06:42.760 --> 06:46.960
plus Gaza, plus the West Bank.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.240
Okay, so there are those three areas

06:49.240 --> 06:51.360
that comprise greater Israel.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.040
And what's very important to understand

06:56.040 --> 06:58.320
is that inside greater Israel,

06:58.320 --> 07:03.120
there are roughly 7.3 million Palestinians

07:03.120 --> 07:07.400
and roughly 7.3 million Israeli Jews.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.040
There is rough equality between the two sides.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.440
So the question is, how does Israel think

07:16.440 --> 07:20.640
about dealing with greater Israel

07:20.640 --> 07:24.640
where you have rough equality between these two populations?

07:24.800 --> 07:28.360
And there are basically four options.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.200
One is you have a democratic greater Israel.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.520
That's not gonna happen

07:34.520 --> 07:37.160
because it would no longer be a Jewish state.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.560
Okay, because if you look at demographic patterns,

07:41.560 --> 07:43.560
the Palestinians are making more babies

07:43.560 --> 07:45.080
than the Israeli Jews.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.360
So that's not happening.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.800
Second possibility is a two-state solution.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.640
Everybody loves to talk about a two-state solution.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.040
That is not happening.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.400
Certainly after what happened on October 7th,

07:57.400 --> 07:59.960
but even before then, and I'll talk more about this,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.600
Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli elite

08:02.600 --> 08:07.000
has no interest in a two-state solution, okay?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.640
The third possibility is apartheid.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.560
And basically what you now have is an apartheid state.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.680
We can go into this in detail in the Q&A

08:15.680 --> 08:16.960
if you wanna do that,

08:16.960 --> 08:19.920
but if you look at Amnesty International,

08:19.920 --> 08:22.640
Human Rights Watch, and Bicellum,

08:22.680 --> 08:26.120
which is the leading human rights group in Israel,

08:26.120 --> 08:28.800
all three of those organizations

08:28.800 --> 08:31.280
have produced lengthy reports

08:31.280 --> 08:34.800
that lay out why Israel is an apartheid state.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.760
The fourth option is ethnic cleansing.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.800
And ethnic cleansing means getting rid of the Palestinians

08:43.800 --> 08:45.840
for the most part who live in Gaza

08:45.840 --> 08:47.880
and who live in the West Bank,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.880
and creating a greater Israel

08:49.880 --> 08:52.440
that is completely dominated by Israeli Jews

08:52.440 --> 08:57.360
and has very few, if any, Palestinians in its midst.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.240
So again, the four options are,

09:00.240 --> 09:04.640
number one, democratic greater Israel,

09:04.640 --> 09:06.320
number two, two-state solution.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.920
Those two are off the table.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.520
Number three, apartheid,

09:09.520 --> 09:11.440
which is basically what you have now.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.800
And number four is ethnic cleansing,

09:13.800 --> 09:17.080
where you get rid of the Palestinians, okay?

09:17.080 --> 09:19.680
Now, let's switch gears a bit

09:19.680 --> 09:22.880
and talk about what the situation looked like

09:22.880 --> 09:24.800
before October 7th,

09:26.160 --> 09:29.040
and focus mainly on Gaza.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.240
Before October 7th,

09:31.240 --> 09:33.920
the Palestinians in Gaza

09:33.920 --> 09:37.600
basically lived in a giant open-air prison.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.560
What happened was that in 2005,

09:40.560 --> 09:43.680
when Ariel Sharon was the prime minister of Israel,

09:43.680 --> 09:48.680
he decided to pull the settlers out of Gaza.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.920
As you know, there are settlers in the West Bank.

09:51.920 --> 09:56.040
Up until 2005, there were Israeli settlers in Gaza,

09:56.040 --> 09:58.160
and Sharon pulled them out.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.200
And he pulled them out

09:59.200 --> 10:01.520
because Gaza was a hornet's nest,

10:01.520 --> 10:05.040
and having settlers in there was a nightmare.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
And they had their hands full in the West Bank,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.240
and they wanted to focus on the West Bank.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.960
And what they did was pulled all the settlers out,

10:11.960 --> 10:14.400
and it became an open-air prison.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.320
Now, it looked up until October 7th,

10:18.360 --> 10:20.320
like Netanyahu and company

10:20.320 --> 10:25.320
were able to manage the situation inside of Gaza.

10:26.920 --> 10:31.400
Nobody thought what happened on October 7th was gonna happen.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.160
This is why the Israelis got caught with their pants down.

10:34.160 --> 10:39.160
They thought they were managing the situation very well.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.040
And what was going on there

10:42.040 --> 10:45.880
is that Netanyahu was actually very happy

10:45.880 --> 10:49.560
with the fact that Hamas was running Gaza.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.240
This is hard to believe today, but it is true.

10:52.240 --> 10:57.240
And he was making sure that Hamas was being funded

10:57.640 --> 11:02.640
and that Hamas was doing reasonably well.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.760
Now, why is that the case?

11:04.760 --> 11:07.320
Because Netanyahu is adamantly opposed

11:07.320 --> 11:09.160
to a two-state solution.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.920
And Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority

11:13.960 --> 11:18.560
in the West Bank, is in favor of a two-state solution.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.800
So from Sharon's point of view, not Sharon,

11:21.800 --> 11:23.640
from Netanyahu's point of view,

11:23.640 --> 11:25.880
would have been true from Sharon's point of view as well,

11:25.880 --> 11:27.360
as if he hadn't passed away,

11:28.560 --> 11:32.680
Abbas is a threat because Abbas wants a two-state solution.

11:34.320 --> 11:39.320
So what Netanyahu has done is supported Hamas

11:39.640 --> 11:43.040
because we all know Hamas does not want a two-state solution.

11:43.080 --> 11:48.080
And he's playing off Hamas against the PLO

11:48.960 --> 11:51.880
in the West Bank.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.800
And it looks like it works.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.160
And by the way, every once in a while,

11:56.160 --> 11:59.800
every couple of years, the Israelis mow the lawn,

11:59.800 --> 12:03.520
which means they precipitate a conflict with the Palestinians,

12:03.520 --> 12:05.280
they go in there, they kill hundreds,

12:05.280 --> 12:07.120
if not thousands of Palestinians,

12:07.120 --> 12:10.840
destroy some buildings and send them a very clear message

12:10.880 --> 12:13.840
that, you know, we're in charge

12:13.840 --> 12:16.160
and we want you to understand

12:16.160 --> 12:19.760
that you have to remain in this open-air prison.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.840
So that's the basic situation that exists.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.320
It looks like Netanyahu is managing the situation.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.680
And almost everybody thinks that,

12:27.680 --> 12:29.400
which is again, is why they get caught

12:29.400 --> 12:32.520
with their pants down on October 7th.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.120
But again, what happens on October 7th

12:36.120 --> 12:41.120
is that Hamas attacks into Israel.

12:41.480 --> 12:46.480
And I think it's fair to say, achieves a spectacular success.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.800
I think the evidence is that Hamas was surprised

12:49.800 --> 12:52.040
by how successful they were.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.600
And anyway, they eventually leave Israel

12:57.600 --> 13:01.720
and the Israelis consolidate the situation

13:01.720 --> 13:04.000
inside of their borders.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.920
And then they eventually go on the offensive against Hamas.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.920
And that offensive is now taking place.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.000
Okay, now what we wanna ask ourselves

13:18.000 --> 13:22.080
is what exactly are Israel's goals here?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.600
This is very important to understand

13:23.600 --> 13:25.640
what Israel is trying to do.

13:25.640 --> 13:28.240
Now, if you read the mainstream media in the West,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.920
and this includes Australia,

13:29.920 --> 13:33.960
what people talk about is that Israel is interested

13:34.440 --> 13:37.000
in number one, defeating Hamas.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.840
And here we're talking about decisively defeating Hamas

13:39.840 --> 13:41.440
and eliminating Hamas.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.520
And you can understand why from Israel's point of view

13:43.520 --> 13:45.280
that makes sense.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.880
Second goal is to get the hostages back.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.400
As you all know, Hamas took about 240 hostages.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.440
And what the Israelis obviously wanna do

13:55.440 --> 13:57.360
is get those hostages back.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.760
So there's sort of two principal goals here.

13:59.800 --> 14:04.800
Defeat Hamas decisively and get back the hostages.

14:04.920 --> 14:09.400
What's not discussed in the Western media is the real goal.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.400
And the real goal is to ethnically cleanse Gaza.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.280
And the reason they wanna ethnically cleanse Gaza

14:16.280 --> 14:19.680
is because number one,

14:20.840 --> 14:24.480
that's the way you get out of apartheid.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.240
You all understand Israel is an apartheid state.

14:28.240 --> 14:33.240
And the only way you get out of that situation is you cleanse.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.800
Furthermore, it's the only way you defeat Hamas.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.120
I'll talk more about this.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.120
It's quite clear that the Israelis

14:42.120 --> 14:44.960
are not gonna defeat Hamas, right?

14:44.960 --> 14:48.080
And I can't believe they thought they would defeat Hamas

14:48.080 --> 14:49.400
before they went in there.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.600
They're too smart for that.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.680
But if you cleanse Gaza

14:55.680 --> 14:57.920
and you drive all the Palestinians out,

14:57.920 --> 14:59.760
you drive Hamas out.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.760
So you solve two of the principal problems you face

15:02.760 --> 15:04.040
with ethnic cleansing.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.240
You solve the apartheid problem

15:08.520 --> 15:10.960
and you solve the Hamas problem.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.200
Now you're probably saying to yourself,

15:12.200 --> 15:14.560
Israel wouldn't do anything like this.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.800
Just a couple of points.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.280
First of all, to create the state of Israel,

15:20.280 --> 15:23.320
to begin with, you had to do massive ethnic cleansing.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.000
In 1948 and in 1967,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.760
the Israelis cleansed huge portions

15:31.760 --> 15:34.440
of what is today greater Israel.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.480
And the idea that they wouldn't do this,

15:36.480 --> 15:40.680
if you read all sorts of Israeli media,

15:40.680 --> 15:43.920
they talk about ethnic cleansing all the time.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.320
And it makes perfect sense if you think about it.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.240
Final point I'd make to you is one of the criticisms

15:51.240 --> 15:53.000
that I'll talk more about this

15:53.000 --> 15:55.800
of what the Israelis and especially Benjamin Netanyahu

15:56.000 --> 15:57.520
are doing in Gaza,

15:57.520 --> 16:00.320
is they have not come up with a plan

16:01.360 --> 16:05.600
for what Gaza is going to look like

16:05.600 --> 16:07.480
after the shooting stops.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.000
In other words, what's the political solution here

16:11.000 --> 16:13.240
once the shooting stops?

16:13.240 --> 16:17.520
And Israeli military commanders, IDF military commanders

16:17.520 --> 16:19.560
are constantly complaining these days

16:19.560 --> 16:22.400
that Netanyahu doesn't give them any sense

16:22.400 --> 16:26.800
of what the final political settlement's gonna look like

16:26.800 --> 16:28.200
so they can deal with Hamas

16:28.200 --> 16:29.400
and deal with the Palestinians

16:29.400 --> 16:33.080
with some thought in mind about what the end game is here.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.520
For the reason there's no end game,

16:35.520 --> 16:37.000
the reason they're not talking about

16:37.000 --> 16:39.520
how they're going to administer

16:39.520 --> 16:41.800
a Palestinian-dominated Gaza

16:41.800 --> 16:44.600
is because they want the Palestinians out.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.880
They wanna ethically cleanse Gaza.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.440
And then that brings us to the question,

16:50.440 --> 16:52.440
how do you do this, right?

16:52.440 --> 16:54.960
How do you get the Palestinians out?

16:54.960 --> 16:58.160
Well, first of all,

16:59.160 --> 17:03.160
they definitely went after Hamas to start with.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.640
That was the purely military side of the story.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.120
They went after Hamas.

17:09.120 --> 17:12.240
But to make ethnic cleansing work,

17:12.240 --> 17:15.280
you have to number one,

17:15.280 --> 17:17.600
you have to number one,

17:17.600 --> 17:21.440
kill significant numbers of people,

17:21.440 --> 17:25.880
of Palestinians who are basically innocent Palestinians,

17:25.880 --> 17:27.480
not Hamas.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.400
You have to kill large numbers of them

17:29.400 --> 17:31.440
and you have to give them a powerful incentive

17:31.440 --> 17:33.560
by killing them to drive them out.

17:34.480 --> 17:39.480
Number two, you have to make the place unlivable.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.840
And that's what they're doing.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.240
I mean, they're not just killing people.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.640
They're making Gaza unlivable.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.840
I could go through this in detail in the Q and A

17:51.840 --> 17:54.320
if people wanna hear the story.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.920
But it is, as many people say,

17:57.920 --> 18:00.120
especially the UN people who are there,

18:00.120 --> 18:01.560
the place is unlivable.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.920
And the reason it's unlivable

18:02.920 --> 18:06.280
is because they're trying to cleanse Gaza.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.320
It's very important to understand that.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.040
And then finally, what they're doing

18:13.080 --> 18:15.520
is starving the population.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.960
There's all sorts of talk about famine in the north,

18:18.960 --> 18:20.360
northern part of Gaza.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.040
The United States is leaning heavily on the Israelis

18:24.040 --> 18:26.680
to let food and other kinds of aid in.

18:26.680 --> 18:30.080
The Israelis are resisting at every turn.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
Why are they starving the Palestinians?

18:32.080 --> 18:34.160
Why are they killing the Palestinians?

18:34.160 --> 18:36.240
Why are they making Gaza unlivable?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.080
It's very simple.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.400
They wanna drive them out.

18:39.400 --> 18:45.080
So that's basically what's been happening.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.600
And in the beginning, right,

18:47.600 --> 18:50.080
there was all sorts of talk about genocide.

18:50.080 --> 18:54.120
And I was on the record publicly

18:54.120 --> 18:56.400
is saying this is not a genocide.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.040
But after December, I changed my mind on that.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.040
I think the Israelis are now engaged in genocide.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.840
And what's happened here

19:03.840 --> 19:05.600
is because they have been unable

19:05.600 --> 19:08.040
to get the Palestinians out.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.480
They've had to increase

19:09.480 --> 19:12.640
the amount of killing that they do, right?

19:12.640 --> 19:15.560
They're continuing to push

19:15.560 --> 19:18.160
to get the Palestinians out of Gaza.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.400
And the way they do that is just kill more and more people

19:21.400 --> 19:23.560
and make the Palestinian,

19:23.560 --> 19:28.800
make the situation in Gaza more and more unlivable, right?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.880
So the situation's just getting worse and worse and worse.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.760
Despite the fact that the United States

19:33.760 --> 19:36.560
and actually the West more generally doing what they can,

19:38.520 --> 19:41.320
help feed the Palestinians.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.080
So the question is, where are we today?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.120
Where are we today?

19:49.040 --> 19:52.040
First of all, they've not defeated Hamas

19:52.040 --> 19:53.720
and they're not gonna defeat Hamas.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.520
Kurt Campbell, who is the deputy secretary of state

19:56.520 --> 19:58.360
basically said that yesterday.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.200
There are all sorts of stories in the Israeli press

20:01.200 --> 20:03.920
that they're not gonna defeat Hamas.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.160
They haven't gotten the hostages back

20:07.120 --> 20:12.120
and they have not been able to cleanse Gaza.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.600
They've not been able to cleanse Gaza.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.720
Furthermore, they're stuck in Gaza.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.760
They're there, right?

20:21.760 --> 20:24.580
They got out in 2005 and they're back there.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.960
This is not good.

20:29.400 --> 20:33.760
So what you see here is that Israel is in real trouble

20:34.640 --> 20:35.480
in Gaza.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.160
Now, in addition to the problem in Gaza,

20:40.160 --> 20:42.600
they have a huge problem with Hezbollah

20:42.600 --> 20:47.240
because Hezbollah in the North in support of Hamas

20:47.240 --> 20:49.960
has been shelling Northern Israel.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.840
And there are somewhere between 60,000

20:52.840 --> 20:57.200
and 100,000 Israelis from the Northern part of Israel

20:57.200 --> 21:00.080
who have had to move into the center of Israel

21:00.080 --> 21:03.200
on a temporary basis and can't go home

21:03.200 --> 21:07.880
because Hezbollah is shelling Northern Israel.

21:07.880 --> 21:12.880
And Hezbollah has said that until this all ends in Gaza,

21:14.480 --> 21:16.920
they're gonna continue to fight the Israelis.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.000
This is a huge problem for the Israelis.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.520
So they not only have trouble with Hamas and Gaza,

21:21.520 --> 21:25.400
they have trouble with Hezbollah up on the Northern border.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.880
And by the way, the Houthis are actually now taking aim

21:28.880 --> 21:32.000
at the Israelis and the Houthis just recently landed

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
their first missile inside of Israel.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.160
Just one, but that's a harbinger of things to come.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.200
You see how much trouble Israel is in.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.920
They have not achieved their objectives

21:50.040 --> 21:52.240
with regard to those two stated objectives

21:52.240 --> 21:55.920
and with regard to the ethnic cleansing.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.320
And as I said to you before,

21:57.320 --> 22:00.600
you always wanna understand there are four options here.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.120
First two are off the table

22:02.120 --> 22:06.040
and that comes down to apartheid or ethnic cleansing.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.240
And the Israelis understand full well.

22:08.240 --> 22:12.920
In apartheid state, we remember what happened to South Africa.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.360
We have got to solve that problem.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.960
That's why ethnic cleansing is so attractive,

22:17.960 --> 22:22.000
but they've been unable to ethnically cleanse so far.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That's that story.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.360
That's the story about Gaza.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.760
Let's shift gears now and talk about Iran

22:28.200 --> 22:32.240
versus Israel versus the United States.

22:34.200 --> 22:39.200
Up until April 1st, the war between Israel and Iran

22:40.560 --> 22:44.480
and even the United States and Iran was a shadow war.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.880
And it's very important to understand

22:48.880 --> 22:53.880
that we did not want the war, that shadow war to escalate.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.120
We did not wanna see Iran and Israel

22:57.120 --> 22:59.000
get into a fight.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.640
Very important to understand, nor did the Iranians.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.640
The Iranians had no interest in escalation.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.520
The country that had an interest in escalation

23:08.520 --> 23:09.680
were the Israelis.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.160
The Israelis have had their gun sights on Iran

23:12.160 --> 23:15.120
for a long time and they've been doing everything

23:15.120 --> 23:19.520
they can over time to pull us into a war against Iran,

23:19.520 --> 23:21.600
but we didn't want a war.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.600
What happens on April 1st, as I'm sure all of you remember,

23:25.600 --> 23:30.600
is that the Israelis hit the Iranian embassy

23:31.560 --> 23:33.520
in Damascus, Syria.

23:34.680 --> 23:39.680
This drives the Iranians a portray

23:42.080 --> 23:44.800
and the Iranians make it clear

23:44.800 --> 23:49.800
that they're going to retaliate against Israel.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.120
The United States is a guest.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.560
The United States is very angry at the Israelis

23:56.560 --> 24:01.000
for doing this and not telling them that it was coming.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
So the Israelis look like they're gonna get a big conflict

24:06.920 --> 24:08.440
between Israel and the United States

24:08.440 --> 24:10.960
on one side and the Iranians on the other side,

24:10.960 --> 24:12.760
but the United States doesn't want this

24:12.760 --> 24:14.960
and Iran doesn't want this.

24:14.960 --> 24:19.960
So what happens, this is April 1st, the attack on the embassy.

24:20.240 --> 24:25.240
On April 14th, Iran retaliates against Israel.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.520
You all remember this.

24:27.520 --> 24:30.560
The question is what happens between April 1st

24:30.560 --> 24:34.680
and April 14th and then what happens on April 14th?

24:34.680 --> 24:37.920
So very important to understand these details.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.920
The United States and Iran work together

24:43.480 --> 24:44.880
through intermediaries,

24:44.880 --> 24:47.400
because we don't have direct relations.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.600
We work together through intermediaries

24:51.600 --> 24:56.600
to make sure that the Iranian attack is limited,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.120
that we see it coming beforehand

25:01.120 --> 25:04.640
and that the United States and the Israelis

25:04.640 --> 25:08.160
and others are able to deal with the attack.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.720
Furthermore, we make it clear that we want the Iranians

25:11.720 --> 25:14.720
not to hit any populated areas

25:14.720 --> 25:18.560
and to basically go after one or two military targets.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.560
We and the Iranians agree

25:21.560 --> 25:24.000
that it will be a limited attack.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.960
We're coordinating with the Iranians

25:26.960 --> 25:28.800
because again, we don't want escalation.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.800
We meaning the Americans, nor do they.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.800
Then when the Iranian attack comes, a hotline,

25:37.760 --> 25:42.800
an informal hotline is set up between the United States

25:42.800 --> 25:46.560
and Iran via Oman,

25:47.480 --> 25:50.000
because both the Iranians and the Americans

25:50.000 --> 25:53.440
wanna keep this one under control.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.800
Very important to understand that.

25:55.800 --> 26:00.800
And the Iranians attack and what happens there?

26:02.280 --> 26:07.280
The Americans are deeply involved in defending Israel.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.440
You all remember, everybody talked about

26:09.440 --> 26:12.240
how the Jordanians, the Saudis, the French,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.360
the British, the Americans, the Israelis,

26:14.360 --> 26:18.440
they were all involved in dealing with this attack.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.080
This is a real problem for Israel

26:20.080 --> 26:22.520
because Israel has always prided itself

26:22.520 --> 26:26.680
on being able to independently deal with an adversary

26:26.680 --> 26:28.640
that thinks about attacking it.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.200
Well, in this case, right,

26:31.200 --> 26:35.080
not only are we coordinating things with the Iranians

26:35.080 --> 26:36.760
to make sure this is limited

26:36.760 --> 26:39.400
and it doesn't spin out of control,

26:39.400 --> 26:42.480
but there is considerable evidence

26:42.480 --> 26:47.000
that roughly half of the missiles and drones

26:47.000 --> 26:50.520
that were shot down were shot down by the United States,

26:50.520 --> 26:53.840
not by Israel, roughly half.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.080
We were deeply involved.

26:56.080 --> 27:00.400
We had naval ships that shot down Iranian ballistic missiles

27:00.400 --> 27:02.200
and we were using fighter aircraft

27:02.200 --> 27:07.200
to shoot down cruise missiles and shoot down drones.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.360
Now, the Israelis played a very important role in this,

27:10.360 --> 27:12.440
but it's important to understand

27:12.440 --> 27:14.200
we, the United States of America,

27:14.200 --> 27:16.120
were coordinating the effort.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.720
See how deeply involved we were?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.960
We wanted to keep this one under control.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.120
We wanted to make sure

27:21.120 --> 27:23.720
that that Iranian offensive against Israel

27:23.720 --> 27:25.680
was not successful.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.080
That brings me to the final part of the story

27:28.080 --> 27:32.520
about April events involving Iran and Israel.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.760
The Israelis retaliate on April 19th.

27:35.760 --> 27:39.680
Remember, April 1st is when they hit the embassy in Damascus.

27:39.680 --> 27:44.680
April 14th is when Iran goes after Israel,

27:45.640 --> 27:50.040
does limited damage, hardly any damage,

27:50.040 --> 27:54.280
and then on April 19th, the Israelis retaliate.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.320
Now, as you would expect,

27:55.320 --> 27:58.240
the Israelis wanted to unleash the dogs.

27:58.240 --> 28:02.320
The Israelis wanted a big counterattack on Iran.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.400
The United States did not want that for one second.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.040
We were trying to put a cap on the volcano.

28:09.040 --> 28:12.000
So what the Israelis end up doing

28:12.000 --> 28:16.760
is basically taking out one radar

28:16.760 --> 28:21.760
in the Isfahan area of Iran, just one radar.

28:22.640 --> 28:25.480
It's a radar associated with an S-300 missile.

28:25.480 --> 28:30.480
It is a very, very limited response.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.640
And it's a limited response

28:33.640 --> 28:36.720
because the United States demands

28:36.720 --> 28:38.680
that it be a limited response.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.120
Furthermore, we go to great lengths to tell the Israelis

28:41.120 --> 28:46.120
they actually won a great victory on April 14th

28:46.320 --> 28:51.320
by stopping all those Israeli missiles and drones.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.160
So Israel, except the fact

28:55.160 --> 28:58.000
that you won a great victory on April 14th,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.680
all we need is just a small-scale attack

29:01.680 --> 29:03.280
where we go after one radar,

29:03.280 --> 29:05.160
and that's the end of the story.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.960
And of course, that was the end of the story.

29:07.960 --> 29:08.920
This one went away,

29:08.920 --> 29:12.920
unlike Gaza, which continues on to this day.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.800
So what I'm telling you is you have these two big conflicts,

29:15.800 --> 29:18.560
the one in Gaza, which I just described,

29:18.560 --> 29:21.920
and then the one involving Iran, Israel,

29:21.920 --> 29:25.480
and the United States between April 1st and April 19th.

29:26.480 --> 29:31.160
Now, I want to talk about the consequences of this

29:31.160 --> 29:35.720
for Israel, United States, and Iran.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.320
And as I said to you,

29:37.320 --> 29:41.880
I believe that Israel was the big loser here.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.760
Now, you're saying to yourself, why is that the case?

29:45.760 --> 29:47.680
Number of reasons.

29:47.680 --> 29:52.320
First of all, the Israelis are back in Gaza.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.440
They got out in 2005.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.840
Ariel Sharon, as you all know, is no shrinking violet.

30:00.120 --> 30:04.600
He's at least as tough an ombre as Benjamin Netanyahu.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.440
He pulled out because Gaza's a hornet's nest.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.600
Well, the Israelis are back in Gaza.

30:12.600 --> 30:17.600
They have no way of getting out at the moment,

30:18.600 --> 30:23.600
and they have no solution to the problem.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.280
They've made Gaza unlivable.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.880
What are they going to do?

30:27.880 --> 30:30.440
The Palestinians are not leaving.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.600
What are they going to do?

30:31.600 --> 30:33.200
They're running the place.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.800
They're in deep trouble.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.960
Second reason the Israelis lose,

30:40.960 --> 30:45.240
you have to understand how the Israelis think about deterrence.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.280
And this is a very smart way of thinking about deterrence.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.720
I'm not being critical of Israeli thinking here.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.600
What the Israelis believe is that their deterrence

30:56.600 --> 31:01.600
depends on escalation dominance, escalation dominance.

31:01.960 --> 31:06.960
That means if somebody whacks me and I whacked them back,

31:07.480 --> 31:12.320
I whacked them back harder than they initially whacked me.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.920
In other words, as we go up the escalation ladder,

31:15.920 --> 31:19.260
I dominate escalation dominance.

31:19.260 --> 31:24.260
The best example of this is in the summer of 2003,

31:25.840 --> 31:30.840
Hezbollah killed a few Israelis,

31:31.080 --> 31:32.520
this is up on the northern border.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.360
Hezbollah killed a few Israelis

31:35.360 --> 31:39.360
and kidnapped an Israeli, okay?

31:39.400 --> 31:43.240
The Israelis massively retaliated.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.320
And Nasrallah, who is the head of Hezbollah,

31:46.320 --> 31:49.300
said, I think two months later,

31:49.300 --> 31:52.920
Nasrallah said, if I had known

31:52.920 --> 31:57.080
what the Israelis were gonna do in terms of retaliating,

31:57.080 --> 32:02.080
I would have never allowed the attack on July 12th, 2006.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.760
That's escalation dominance, do you understand?

32:07.760 --> 32:10.320
It's very important, from Israel's point of view,

32:10.320 --> 32:12.920
they have to make it clear to all their neighbors

32:12.920 --> 32:16.680
that if you whack us, we'll whack you back harder.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.840
It's now very clear the Israelis no longer

32:20.840 --> 32:25.120
have escalation dominance vis-a-vis Iran

32:25.120 --> 32:28.520
or vis-a-vis Hezbollah.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.720
They cannot shut down the conflict

32:31.720 --> 32:34.640
with Hezbollah on their northern border.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.280
Really quite remarkable.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.120
The Israelis are hitting Hezbollah very hard

32:40.120 --> 32:43.240
and Hezbollah is responding.

32:43.240 --> 32:48.240
Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets and missiles

32:48.400 --> 32:52.400
and those numbers will only grow at the passage of time.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.280
150,000, right?

32:55.280 --> 32:57.440
So the Israelis are limited in what they can do.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.000
And with regard to Iran, I described to you

33:00.000 --> 33:03.960
what happened April 1st, April 14th, April 19th.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.600
That is not escalation dominance.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.560
I'm sorry, that is not escalation dominance.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.800
And furthermore, they needed the Americans.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.560
You all understand, I'm just sort of

33:16.640 --> 33:19.040
diverting from the path of mine for one second.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.640
If you look at what's happening in Gaza,

33:21.640 --> 33:25.520
the Israelis could never conduct that operation

33:25.520 --> 33:29.320
in Gaza without American support, not even close.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.520
And all sorts of Israeli generals say that

33:31.520 --> 33:32.640
in the Israeli press.

33:33.480 --> 33:37.680
They cannot by themselves produce the weaponry

33:37.680 --> 33:41.040
to conduct the operations they're now conducting in Gaza.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.000
They need us.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
And what I'm telling you about what happened

33:45.000 --> 33:47.840
on April 14th is they needed us.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.080
You hear all this talk about iron dome

33:51.080 --> 33:52.840
and their ability to shoot down missiles.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.560
They cannot do it alone.

33:54.560 --> 33:59.560
Iron dome is not that formidable defensive system

33:59.560 --> 34:01.960
and furthermore given cost exchange ratios,

34:01.960 --> 34:03.680
the number of missiles that the Iranians

34:03.680 --> 34:08.680
and Hezbollah have, iron dome over the long term

34:08.680 --> 34:11.920
in a fight is just not very useful.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.920
So from a deterrence point of view,

34:14.920 --> 34:16.920
the Israelis are in real trouble.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.680
So my first point is they're in real trouble

34:18.680 --> 34:20.200
because they're stuck in Gaza

34:20.200 --> 34:23.080
and they have no solution to the problem.

34:23.080 --> 34:28.080
And number two, their deterrence has been badly weakened.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.040
Number three is very important to understand

34:32.040 --> 34:33.720
with the coming of all these missiles

34:33.720 --> 34:35.680
and the coming of drones,

34:35.680 --> 34:38.960
it's now possible for actors like Hamas,

34:38.960 --> 34:42.920
the Houthis and Hezbollah and Iran

34:42.920 --> 34:47.920
to develop the capability to hit Israel

34:49.600 --> 34:52.480
and cause enormous amounts of damage.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.520
And lots of people who live in Israel

34:54.520 --> 34:57.480
are not very comfortable with this situation.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.360
The idea that they are exposed to adversaries

35:02.360 --> 35:04.480
and these are formidable adversaries.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.320
I don't wanna make light of the fact

35:06.320 --> 35:10.440
that groups like Hezbollah and groups like Hamas

35:10.440 --> 35:12.080
would like to finish Israel off.

35:12.080 --> 35:17.080
They would, these are really tough hombres.

35:17.440 --> 35:22.040
And what's happened here is that with the passage of time,

35:22.040 --> 35:24.680
missile capabilities and drone capabilities

35:24.680 --> 35:26.720
have reached the point where it's quite easy

35:26.720 --> 35:30.240
for actors like that to employ those weapons

35:30.240 --> 35:32.760
to create a real threat for Israel.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.200
The fourth way in which Israel is in trouble

35:36.200 --> 35:40.880
is that it has effectively become a pariah state

35:42.040 --> 35:45.600
in ways that it never was in the past.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.600
If you look at what's happening in the United States

35:48.600 --> 35:51.640
and all across the world on university campuses

35:51.640 --> 35:53.360
and college campuses,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.520
this is just evidence whether you think

35:55.520 --> 35:57.840
what's going on is right or wrong

35:57.840 --> 36:02.160
that Israel's reputation has been badly tarnished.

36:05.240 --> 36:10.240
If you think about the fact that South Africa took Israel

36:10.680 --> 36:14.400
before the International Court of Justice

36:14.400 --> 36:17.000
and the International Court of Justice found,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.160
not that Israel is committing genocide.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.400
They didn't find that.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.640
That is yet to be determined.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.600
But what the International Court of Justice did find

36:26.600 --> 36:28.960
is that there is sufficient evidence,

36:28.960 --> 36:32.640
there's enough evidence to think

36:32.640 --> 36:37.640
that Israel might be committing genocide.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.560
And if you look at polls inside the United States,

36:40.560 --> 36:43.920
it's truly remarkable how many people,

36:43.920 --> 36:45.680
especially Democrats,

36:45.680 --> 36:49.040
believed that Israel is engaged in genocide.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.880
There's a recent poll that shows

36:50.880 --> 36:55.320
that 56% of all Democrats think

36:55.320 --> 36:57.720
that Israel is committing genocide.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.760
Think about that, 56% of Americans

37:02.760 --> 37:06.120
hold think that Israel is committing genocide.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.720
There's another poll that shows,

37:09.720 --> 37:12.160
talks about Biden voters,

37:12.160 --> 37:17.160
that shows that 57% think Israel is committing genocide.

37:17.200 --> 37:21.320
27% are not sure.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.640
57% think Israel is committing genocide.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.720
27% are not sure.

37:27.720 --> 37:32.520
And then 15% do not believe Israel is committing genocide.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.400
This is quite remarkable.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.800
When I think about how I thought about Israel

37:37.800 --> 37:41.160
and virtually everybody I knew thought about Israel

37:41.160 --> 37:44.200
when I was a young boy and I was a young man

37:44.280 --> 37:48.800
and how virtually everybody I know now thinks about Israel,

37:49.680 --> 37:52.920
a fundamental transformation has taken place.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.960
It's really quite remarkable.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.720
And the idea that the Jewish state

37:56.720 --> 37:59.400
is being accused of genocide,

37:59.400 --> 38:01.000
it's really quite remarkable.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.120
This is a sign of big trouble

38:04.120 --> 38:08.120
and the use of the apartheid label is used increasingly.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.160
And this is not gonna change

38:10.160 --> 38:13.400
because the situation in Gaza is not gonna get any better.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.760
That was one of the points I'm trying to get through to you.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.480
There is no solution on the horizon here.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.040
If anybody asked me in the question and answer period,

38:21.040 --> 38:23.280
what would I do to fix this problem?

38:23.280 --> 38:25.000
I could tell you what the answer is now.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.320
I have no idea.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.160
Let's be very clear on this.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.120
Categorically depressing.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.360
But anyway, I think that from Israel's point of view,

38:35.360 --> 38:39.520
what's happened to its reputation is disastrous

38:39.520 --> 38:42.840
and I don't think it's gonna get any better over time.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.760
So this is why these four reasons,

38:45.760 --> 38:50.440
number one, the fact they're stuck in Gaza once more.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.680
Number two, the fact that their deterrence has been weakened

38:53.680 --> 38:55.960
because they don't have escalation dominance.

38:55.960 --> 39:00.240
Number three, the fact that they're surrounded by adversaries

39:00.240 --> 39:03.920
who loathe them, would like to destroy them

39:03.920 --> 39:08.600
and who have increasing numbers of missiles and drones

39:08.600 --> 39:12.120
that can cause them lots of trouble is bad news.

39:12.160 --> 39:16.000
And number four, the pariah state argument.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.040
Now let me conclude by talking briefly

39:18.040 --> 39:20.640
about the United States and talking about Iran.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.520
The United States is also a big loser here.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.280
First of all, it's in our interest

39:28.280 --> 39:30.600
to have peace in the Middle East.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.200
First of all, we've been fighting so many wars.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.280
The American public is just sick of all these wars.

39:36.280 --> 39:39.720
The last thing we want are more wars in the Middle East.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.440
Oh my God, a war against Iran.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.840
This is the last thing people want, right?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.120
We want peace.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.320
Furthermore, we need a peaceful Middle East

39:47.320 --> 39:50.560
so we can pivot to East Asia, right?

39:50.560 --> 39:52.400
From the American point of view,

39:52.400 --> 39:55.120
the most serious threat on the planet is China.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.360
The United States has to contain China.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.000
We have to pivot to Asia.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.240
We can't pivot to Asia because we're pinned down in Ukraine

40:02.240 --> 40:06.600
and now we're pinned down in the Middle East.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.400
This is not good.

40:08.400 --> 40:13.120
We want for sure to settle this one, right?

40:13.120 --> 40:17.640
To have a situation like the one that existed

40:17.640 --> 40:19.880
before October 7th.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.800
Remember Jake Sullivan said a few weeks

40:21.800 --> 40:24.640
before October 7th, we haven't seen the Middle East

40:24.640 --> 40:26.480
this peaceful for a long time

40:26.480 --> 40:28.640
and he was very happy about that

40:28.640 --> 40:31.960
and it made perfect sense from an American point of view.

40:31.960 --> 40:35.640
But that went away very quickly on October 7th.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.200
So we want peace.

40:37.200 --> 40:42.200
Second point is we also care greatly

40:42.320 --> 40:45.200
about having friendly relations

40:45.200 --> 40:49.000
with as many states in the Middle East as possible.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.760
Why is that the case?

40:50.760 --> 40:54.480
The Russians are already there, number one,

40:54.480 --> 40:57.800
and two, the Chinese are beginning to move in.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.800
For all the older dogs,

40:59.800 --> 41:02.880
I noticed there are a number of older dogs in the audience.

41:02.880 --> 41:06.600
We all remember back in the day, right?

41:06.600 --> 41:11.600
When the US and the Soviet Union competed in the Middle East.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.720
Well, what you're gonna see moving forward

41:16.720 --> 41:19.200
is not just the United States and Russia,

41:19.200 --> 41:22.040
but the United States, Russia and China

41:22.040 --> 41:24.240
competing in the Middle East.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.160
The Chinese are building a blue water navy

41:26.160 --> 41:29.000
to project power into the Gulf, number one.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.760
Number two, they depend heavily on oil

41:32.760 --> 41:35.000
and therefore they're doing everything they can

41:35.000 --> 41:36.680
to have good relations with Iran,

41:36.680 --> 41:39.040
good relations with Saudi Arabia.

41:39.040 --> 41:42.800
And we are very worried about this.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.840
The United States doesn't want bad relations

41:46.840 --> 41:48.160
with countries in the Middle East

41:48.160 --> 41:51.880
that drive them into the arms of the Chinese and the Russians.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.400
And you see a lot of that happening.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.200
By the way, you all know about the Abraham Accords.

41:56.200 --> 42:00.280
The Abraham Accords was where the United States

42:00.280 --> 42:04.760
was recently trying to get Israel, Saudi Arabia,

42:04.760 --> 42:10.000
and the United States all together in a sort of quasi-alliance.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.800
This is all gone by the boards now

42:11.800 --> 42:14.320
because of what's happening in Gaza, right?

42:14.320 --> 42:15.480
This is not in our interest.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.200
It's certainly not in Israel's interest

42:17.200 --> 42:21.040
and it's certainly not in Saudi's interest at all, either.

42:21.040 --> 42:25.320
So you see the problem that we have here,

42:25.320 --> 42:29.800
just one other problem, and this applies to the Israelis as well,

42:29.800 --> 42:31.320
is the nuclear issue.

42:31.320 --> 42:36.320
You all understand Iran is hopskipping a jump away

42:36.320 --> 42:39.240
from developing nuclear weapons

42:39.240 --> 42:42.680
because we, with pressure from the Israelis,

42:42.680 --> 42:47.120
we the Americans, pulled out of the JCPOA.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.760
That was the nuclear agreement

42:48.760 --> 42:53.640
that the Obama administration crafted with Iran.

42:53.640 --> 42:59.280
The Iranians are now enriching uranium up to 60%.

42:59.280 --> 43:03.560
And you have to enrich uranium up to 90%

43:03.560 --> 43:11.120
to have it capable of being turned into a bomb.

43:11.120 --> 43:14.600
And it's very easy to get from 60% to 90%.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.680
My guess is, and just from reading the literature,

43:17.680 --> 43:21.320
that Iran could have enough fissile material

43:21.320 --> 43:24.720
for three bombs in about six weeks.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.720
That's not a bomb.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.240
That's just a fissile material.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.240
I think it would take probably about six months

43:29.240 --> 43:30.920
to build three bombs,

43:30.920 --> 43:34.680
and then they'd have to develop the delivery capability.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.280
So it's not like they're going to develop a bomb

43:37.280 --> 43:38.680
in a month or two's time.

43:38.680 --> 43:42.800
That's not going to happen, but they're not that far away.

43:42.800 --> 43:47.240
And what happens when you bomb their embassy

43:47.240 --> 43:51.280
and then you get in a tit for tat,

43:51.280 --> 43:55.560
fight with them on April 14th and April 19th

43:55.600 --> 43:58.840
is you give them an incentive to get nuclear weapons.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.400
And you can see signs of that.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
You can see signs of the Iranians

44:03.400 --> 44:05.600
talking about getting nuclear weapons.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.520
So one of the principal problems

44:08.520 --> 44:10.240
that the Israelis and the Americans face

44:10.240 --> 44:14.120
as a result of what happened between April 1st and April 19th

44:14.120 --> 44:18.080
is we've incentivized the Iranians to get nuclear weapons.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.600
Not that they'll go through with it,

44:19.600 --> 44:22.520
but we've given them powerful incentive to do that,

44:22.520 --> 44:25.120
and they have the capability

44:25.120 --> 44:28.640
because they can enrich uranium up to 90%

44:28.640 --> 44:30.960
and then produce bombs.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.640
Just say a few words in conclusion, Tom, about Iran.

44:34.640 --> 44:37.040
As I said to you before, I think Iran is the winner.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.440
I think America's the loser.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.040
I think Israel is the biggest loser.

44:41.040 --> 44:45.720
But I think that the Iranians are the winners so far.

44:45.720 --> 44:49.480
And this is not to say that they have really come out

44:49.480 --> 44:53.200
of this smelling like a rose, as my mother used to say.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.720
I don't want to go that far.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.920
But on balance, I think they've done quite well for themselves.

44:58.920 --> 45:03.280
First of all, they have been able, except for April 14th,

45:03.280 --> 45:06.080
to remain on the sidelines.

45:06.080 --> 45:09.440
And they are using their proxies in the region

45:09.440 --> 45:11.640
or they're working with their proxies.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.720
That's a better way to put it, to great effect.

45:14.720 --> 45:18.960
Because as you know, the Iranians are allied with Hamas.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.680
They're allied with Hezbollah.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.400
They're allied with the Houthis.

45:22.480 --> 45:27.480
And they're allied with these militias inside of Iraq and Syria

45:27.480 --> 45:30.600
that have their gun sights not only on the United States,

45:30.600 --> 45:34.080
but on Israel as well.

45:34.080 --> 45:39.120
So they have been able to stay out of the fight,

45:39.120 --> 45:45.240
yet see their proxies do very well in this conflict

45:45.240 --> 45:52.080
with both the United States and Israel.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.880
Another point that you want to keep in mind

45:54.880 --> 45:59.360
is that Iran, as a result of all this,

45:59.360 --> 46:03.160
now has very close relations with Russia and China.

46:03.160 --> 46:06.200
What we're doing, what the United States is doing,

46:06.200 --> 46:09.520
is we're driving the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese,

46:09.520 --> 46:13.440
and the North Koreans together.

46:13.440 --> 46:17.200
This makes it harder for us to isolate Iran.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.040
And if Iran starts to go down the nuclear road, nuclear weapons

46:21.400 --> 46:24.200
road, and we want to put pressure on the Iranians,

46:24.200 --> 46:26.000
it's not clear the Chinese and the Russians

46:26.000 --> 46:27.600
are going to help us very much.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.880
We need the Chinese and the Russians to help us.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.280
But anyway, the Iranians feel like they're

46:33.280 --> 46:36.760
in quite a good situation, because the United States

46:36.760 --> 46:39.240
and the Israelis have not been able to do anything

46:39.240 --> 46:41.080
to really harm them.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.000
In fact, Iran got away with whacking Israel.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.640
This is the first time that Iran has ever

46:46.640 --> 46:50.840
been able to launch missiles and drones from its own territory,

46:50.840 --> 46:54.600
hit Israel, and Israel barely retaliated.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.760
Iranians are probably feeling good about that, as they should.

47:00.600 --> 47:04.080
And then the final point is the sanctions against Iran

47:04.080 --> 47:06.800
are not working the way they once were.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.600
They have weakened.

47:08.600 --> 47:13.200
So if you look overall at what's happened to the Iranians

47:13.200 --> 47:15.920
and what's happening to the Americans,

47:15.920 --> 47:19.160
and especially what's happening to the Israelis,

47:19.240 --> 47:23.240
you see that the situation after October 7th

47:23.240 --> 47:26.560
is fundamentally different than the situation

47:26.560 --> 47:29.160
before October 7th.

47:29.160 --> 47:32.120
Just in the case of the Israelis, before October 7th,

47:32.120 --> 47:34.520
it looked like they were in the cat bird seat.

47:34.520 --> 47:38.720
They were managing very well in their own opinion

47:38.720 --> 47:40.440
the situation in Gaza.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.920
And by the way, I want to be clear here.

47:41.920 --> 47:44.840
I thought they were doing an excellent job

47:44.840 --> 47:47.040
of managing the problem in Gaza.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.160
I thought they had things under control.

47:49.160 --> 47:52.920
I was shocked by what happened on October 7th.

47:52.920 --> 47:56.160
But once October 7th happened, and as we've watched

47:56.160 --> 47:58.720
these two conflicts play themselves out,

47:58.720 --> 48:03.720
one, the war in Gaza, and how that's linked to Hezbollah,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.240
you don't want to forget, and then two,

48:06.240 --> 48:10.440
the Iran-Israel-United States exchange

48:10.440 --> 48:13.040
between April 1st and April 19th.

48:13.040 --> 48:16.080
It's quite clear that the world has changed

48:16.080 --> 48:19.960
in ways that are not good for either Israel

48:19.960 --> 48:21.520
or the United States.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.360
Thank you.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.320
Welcome back to CIS.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.640
It's great to have you back.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.480
Notwithstanding all those points you made

48:28.480 --> 48:32.880
about escalation dominance and the fact that the Israelis

48:32.880 --> 48:37.360
are now bogged down in Gaza, aren't you overstating

48:37.360 --> 48:40.200
your point about Israel's grim security outlook?

48:40.200 --> 48:42.360
After all, it's not declared,

48:42.360 --> 48:44.840
but they do have nuclear weapons.

48:44.840 --> 48:47.080
And as a foreign policy realist,

48:47.080 --> 48:49.480
you would surely concede that nuclear weapons

48:49.480 --> 48:52.840
are the ultimate deterrent to a foreign attack.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.480
So are you being overly gloomy

48:54.480 --> 48:56.680
about Israel's security outlook?

48:58.720 --> 49:01.320
I think there's no question, as Tom points out,

49:01.320 --> 49:05.120
that nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent.

49:05.120 --> 49:09.360
And I don't think any country with nuclear weapons

49:09.400 --> 49:12.320
is gonna disappear from the planet

49:12.320 --> 49:15.560
because another country attacks it.

49:15.560 --> 49:18.680
I think that no country would try to inflict

49:18.680 --> 49:23.680
a decisive defeat on Israel because it has nuclear weapons.

49:28.280 --> 49:33.280
But the problem is that Israel has an internal problem.

49:34.280 --> 49:38.280
See, Tom's point about nuclear weapons applies

49:38.280 --> 49:42.280
if you're talking about Iran hitting Israel.

49:42.280 --> 49:46.280
It's an interstate problem, okay?

49:46.280 --> 49:51.280
But Hamas is not another country.

49:51.280 --> 49:55.280
Hamas is inside greater Israel.

49:55.280 --> 50:00.280
What Hamas is doing is executing a rebellion

50:03.280 --> 50:08.280
or executing an insurrection.

50:08.320 --> 50:11.920
And nuclear weapons don't do anything for you

50:11.920 --> 50:13.680
in that regard.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.720
To take this a step further,

50:15.720 --> 50:19.160
we've talked a little bit just briefly about South Africa

50:19.160 --> 50:22.840
and the fact that South Africa was an apartheid state.

50:22.840 --> 50:25.440
And basically that state that existed,

50:25.440 --> 50:28.360
apartheid South Africa, disappeared.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.600
That state had nuclear weapons.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.600
South Africa had nuclear weapons.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.240
And what you wanna understand,

50:34.240 --> 50:37.000
and this is very important in the Israeli context,

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
is that what's happening inside your society,

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
inside your body politic matters enormously.

50:46.160 --> 50:49.920
And nuclear weapons can't do much to protect you.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.040
You see what I'm saying?

50:52.040 --> 50:55.000
But I don't wanna take away from his basic point

50:55.000 --> 50:57.840
that nuclear weapons do provide deterrence

50:57.840 --> 51:00.720
against Iran getting nuclear weapons or...

51:01.680 --> 51:04.080
Well, I mean, many scholars would still argue

51:04.080 --> 51:06.600
that the security outlook for Israel

51:06.600 --> 51:08.400
is not as grim as you point out,

51:08.400 --> 51:10.840
not just because of their access to nuclear weapons.

51:10.840 --> 51:11.680
Let me put this to you.

51:11.680 --> 51:14.640
This is Fareed Zakaria, a CNN host

51:14.640 --> 51:16.760
who's also a columnist at the Washington Post.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.760
Now, admittedly, he said this before October 7,

51:18.760 --> 51:19.680
but let me put this to you.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.400
This is what he says.

51:21.400 --> 51:25.000
First, there is the disappearance of the Arab threat.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.400
From its first day in existence,

51:27.440 --> 51:31.640
Israel has faced the danger of extinction by Arab armies.

51:31.640 --> 51:34.160
This is the threat against which the Jewish state

51:34.160 --> 51:39.080
has planned, armed and trade for most of its national life.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
Today, that threat is gone.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.840
Second, the armies from Israel's main strategic

51:43.840 --> 51:47.640
adversaries, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, historically,

51:47.640 --> 51:50.680
they're in disarray while the Israeli armed forces

51:50.680 --> 51:52.760
have become the region's superpower

51:52.760 --> 51:54.560
in a league ahead of the rest.

51:54.560 --> 51:56.720
How would you respond to Fareed Zakaria?

51:56.720 --> 52:03.840
He's right in that sense that those traditional adversaries

52:03.840 --> 52:06.160
have effectively disappeared.

52:06.160 --> 52:12.200
When I was young and the 1956 war took place, the 1967 war

52:12.200 --> 52:16.160
took place, the 1973 war took place,

52:16.160 --> 52:18.920
these were all conflicts that involved Israel

52:18.920 --> 52:21.120
up against Arab states.

52:21.120 --> 52:26.320
And by the way, in 1948, when Israel got its independence,

52:26.320 --> 52:31.400
May 14, 1948, yesterday was Israeli Independence Day.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.480
But it's an anniversary.

52:33.480 --> 52:37.160
Yeah, but there's no question that the Israelis fought wars

52:37.160 --> 52:39.960
in 1948 against.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.240
That's his point.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.360
But that's not the threat anymore.

52:43.360 --> 52:46.480
There's a whole new set of threats called Hamas,

52:46.480 --> 52:50.440
called Hezbollah, called the Houthis.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.720
But aren't we seeing a broader trend in the Middle East

52:53.720 --> 52:56.320
between the Iranian-backed Shia proxies

52:56.320 --> 53:01.480
that you just mentioned, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels,

53:01.480 --> 53:05.160
versus Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Gulf states?

53:05.160 --> 53:06.440
Isn't that the broader issue?

53:06.440 --> 53:09.640
And doesn't that, to the extent that is true, help Israel?

53:09.640 --> 53:11.600
Because you've got a civil war, essentially,

53:11.600 --> 53:13.800
in the Muslim community in the Arab world.

53:13.800 --> 53:18.400
How does it help Israel solve the Gaza problem?

53:18.400 --> 53:21.840
Explain to me how that helps Israel solve the Gaza problem.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.800
And while you're at it, explain to me

53:23.800 --> 53:28.600
how it helps solve the missile problem that Hezbollah, Hamas,

53:28.600 --> 53:32.560
and the Houthis, and Iran present to Israel.

53:32.560 --> 53:36.520
You, like former president Jimmy Carter and the university,

53:36.520 --> 53:37.560
we've got time for questions.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.560
I want to get through it.

53:38.560 --> 53:45.760
You've called tonight Israel in a partite state.

53:45.760 --> 53:46.920
It can't Palestinian vote.

53:51.840 --> 53:55.800
It's important to understand that there are basically

53:55.800 --> 53:59.600
three groups of Palestinians, the Palestinians, obviously,

53:59.600 --> 54:02.200
in Gaza, who we talked about tonight,

54:02.200 --> 54:05.280
the Palestinians in the West Bank,

54:05.280 --> 54:07.600
and then the Palestinians inside of what's

54:07.600 --> 54:09.040
called Green Line Israel.

54:09.040 --> 54:14.520
That was the Israel that existed up until the 1967 war,

54:14.520 --> 54:20.560
before they captured those two territories.

54:20.560 --> 54:26.520
And when I say there are 7.3 million Palestinians

54:26.520 --> 54:29.560
in greater Israel, that includes the Palestinians

54:29.560 --> 54:32.400
in all three of those areas.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.680
The only Palestinians who can vote

54:35.680 --> 54:40.440
are the Palestinians in Green Line Israel.

54:40.440 --> 54:47.120
The Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot vote.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.360
That's one point.

54:48.360 --> 54:53.040
The second point is the Palestinians in Israel

54:53.040 --> 54:55.520
do not have equal rights.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.680
There's no question they can vote,

54:57.680 --> 54:59.520
but they don't have equal rights.

54:59.520 --> 55:02.240
That's why I always argue that Israel

55:02.240 --> 55:04.840
is not a liberal democracy.

55:04.840 --> 55:08.440
If you want to argue Israel is a democracy,

55:08.440 --> 55:09.680
you can make that argument.

55:09.680 --> 55:12.760
I would even fight with you there because of the West Bank

55:12.760 --> 55:13.280
in Gaza.

55:13.280 --> 55:17.440
But let me say I'll give you that, that it is a democracy.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.480
You can't make the argument that Israel

55:19.480 --> 55:24.160
is a liberal democracy because the Palestinians don't

55:24.160 --> 55:28.280
have equal rights inside Green Line Israel.

55:28.280 --> 55:30.880
This is the principal reason, in my opinion,

55:30.880 --> 55:33.760
that Israel does not have a constitution.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.040
They've moved in that direction a couple of times,

55:36.040 --> 55:38.480
but they can't go too far down that road

55:38.480 --> 55:41.400
because they don't want equal rights.

55:41.400 --> 55:45.400
They want a Jewish state, not a state

55:45.400 --> 55:49.440
where Palestinians and Jews are equal in number

55:49.440 --> 55:51.080
and have equal rights.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.400
OK, but your critics, and they're not just Jewish leaders,

55:53.400 --> 55:54.920
a lot of people in this room, presumably,

55:54.920 --> 55:58.080
would say it's a stretch to compare Israel today

55:58.080 --> 56:02.000
to the old, racist South Africa of the SDU.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.560
And this is the late Les Gilb, someone

56:04.560 --> 56:07.200
you knew, the former president of the New York

56:07.200 --> 56:09.120
Base Council on Foreign Relations,

56:09.120 --> 56:11.680
quote, the US is helping to protect

56:11.680 --> 56:13.760
one of the few nations in the world

56:13.800 --> 56:17.520
that share American values and interests, a true democracy.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.480
And this is Richard Cohen, a longtime columnist

56:19.480 --> 56:21.600
of The Washington Post.

56:21.600 --> 56:24.840
The Israel of today and the South Africa of yesterday

56:24.840 --> 56:26.760
have almost nothing in common.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.080
In South Africa, the minority white population

56:30.080 --> 56:33.640
harshly ruled the majority black population.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.880
Non-whites were denied civil rights.

56:35.880 --> 56:39.640
And in 1958, they were even deprived of citizenship.

56:39.640 --> 56:42.320
Cohen goes on to say, in contrast,

56:42.320 --> 56:45.280
Israeli Arabs, about one-fifth of the country,

56:45.280 --> 56:49.800
have the same civil and political rights as Israeli Jews.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.880
Arabs sit in the Knesset and serve in the military,

56:52.880 --> 56:55.080
although most are exempt from the draft.

56:55.080 --> 56:58.000
And Cohen concludes, whatever this is,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.640
and it looks suspiciously like a liberal democracy,

57:00.640 --> 57:02.240
it cannot be apartheid.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.320
Again, your response to the likes of Les Gilb and Richard Cohen.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.560
Just very quickly, they don't have equal rights.

57:07.560 --> 57:10.840
This is the Palestinians who live inside Green Line Israel.

57:10.840 --> 57:14.320
They simply don't have equal rights.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.880
And what about the Palestinians in Gaza

57:16.880 --> 57:18.640
and the Palestinians in the West Bank?

57:18.640 --> 57:21.600
This is all part of Greater Israel.

57:21.600 --> 57:25.200
But let me make a couple of points in addition to that.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.400
First of all, whether Israel is an apartheid state

57:28.400 --> 57:31.800
is not based on any comparison with South Africa.

57:31.800 --> 57:35.800
You have to come up with what is a definition of apartheid.

57:35.800 --> 57:39.000
And then you have to look at what's happening inside of Israel

57:39.040 --> 57:42.200
and see whether it meets that definition.

57:42.200 --> 57:44.000
There's no question that there are differences,

57:44.000 --> 57:45.600
and I'll get to this in a second,

57:45.600 --> 57:49.840
between apartheid in South Africa and apartheid in Israel.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.160
But the question is,

57:51.160 --> 57:55.200
what are the general characteristics of an apartheid regime

57:55.200 --> 57:58.560
and does Israel fill the bill?

57:58.560 --> 58:02.680
Now, as I told you before, if you have any doubts about this,

58:02.680 --> 58:06.760
there are huge reports written by Human Rights Watch,

58:06.760 --> 58:08.800
Amnesty International and Bet-Salon,

58:08.800 --> 58:12.640
which is the leading human rights group inside of Israel,

58:12.640 --> 58:17.640
laying out the case as to why Israel is an apartheid state.

58:18.440 --> 58:23.440
And I think those three reports make a very powerful case.

58:24.280 --> 58:29.280
My final point to you is there are a number

58:30.760 --> 58:35.760
of South Africans who lived under apartheid in South Africa,

58:36.600 --> 58:41.600
including South African Jews and including Bishop Tutu,

58:44.160 --> 58:49.160
who make the argument that the apartheid system in Israel

58:49.880 --> 58:54.880
is worse than the apartheid system in South Africa.

58:55.560 --> 58:58.600
Let's turn to Rafa, the Southern city in Gaza.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.960
Now, the Israeli leadership seems to believe

59:00.960 --> 59:04.120
that a full-scale ground military invasion

59:05.120 --> 59:08.000
of Rafa will finish the job of eliminating Hamas.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.160
You've said that that's not realistic.

59:10.160 --> 59:14.080
Now, your critics would say that with its gleeful mutilations,

59:14.080 --> 59:17.720
its rampages, its rapes and beheadings,

59:17.720 --> 59:22.720
its baby killing on October 7, Hamas needs crushing.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.920
And if Hamas keeps control of Rafa and the people, it wins.

59:27.920 --> 59:32.920
The Israelis may believe that Hamas needs to be crushed.

59:33.680 --> 59:37.320
And you can understand, given what happened on October 7,

59:37.320 --> 59:41.800
why they feel that way, they're not going to crush Hamas.

59:41.800 --> 59:45.480
And if you read the newspapers carefully every day,

59:45.480 --> 59:49.160
you will see that Hamas has come back to life

59:49.160 --> 59:54.160
in northern Gaza and the Israelis have now sent military forces

59:54.160 --> 59:58.160
into northern Gaza to deal with Hamas.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.160
The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal today

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.160
have articles dealing with the fact that Hamas

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.160
is almost impossible to defeat.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
They're just not going to defeat them.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.160
This is why I said to you, ethnic cleansing is so attractive

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
to the Israelis.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.160
Ethnic cleansing solves the apartheid problem.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.160
What Tom was challenging me on a minute ago

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.160
and it solves the Hamas problem which he's challenging me on now.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.160
Many democratic legislators who have traditionally

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.160
been very supportive of Israel have called on Netanyahu

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.160
to be replaced.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.160
To what extent would things change in Gaza

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.160
and the Israeli military operation in Gaza

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.160
if Netanyahu is replaced as many democratic lawmakers

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160
and indeed Brett Stevens at the New York Times

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.160
has called for Netanyahu to be removed?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.160
How would things change?

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.160
Not at all.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.160
This is an argument that I hear in the United States

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.160
and it's made by liberal American Jews,

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.160
people like Tom Friedman.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.160
At the New York Times?

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.160
Yeah, at the New York Times.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.160
People who believe that Netanyahu is an anomaly

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160
and if we can only get rid of him

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160
and replace him with Thomas Jefferson

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
or somebody like that,

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.160
Israel will live happily ever after.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.160
This is a foolish argument, right?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.160
It's quite clear that Netanyahu and his war cabinet

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.160
and most of the national security elite in Israel today

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:51.160
agree with Israeli policy under Netanyahu.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.160
So it wouldn't change anything.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.160
It would change hardly anything.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.160
Now you say Israel has had Iran in its sights for a long time,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.160
but isn't it true that Iran's sheer theocracy

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.160
has also had Israel in its sights for a long time?

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.160
After all, many of their leaders have declared

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.160
the eradication of Israel off the face of the map.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:20.160
Look, there's no question that Iran

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.160
considers Israel to be a mortal enemy

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.160
and would like to do away with the Jewish state

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.160
the same way Hezbollah would like to do away with the Jewish state.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160
So there's no question about that.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.160
And there's no question that the Israelis

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.160
hate the Iranians or hate Iran

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.160
and it's a case of mutual hatred,

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.160
mutual dislike, call it what you want.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.160
There's no question about it.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.160
Who is responsible for starting this?

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.160
The implication of your question was that

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.160
it is Iran that's responsible, not Israel.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.160
What we'll say later is that talk about this,

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.160
about eradicating Israel off the face of the earth.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160
It's pretty provocative, isn't it?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160
I agree.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.160
That's correct, but I'm just saying

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.160
it's not clear that they started it.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.160
You want to remember that Iran once had very good relations

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.160
with Israel, once had very good relations

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.160
with the United States, and that even in the 1990s

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.160
the Iranians were interested in improving relations

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160
with the United States.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.160
And one could make an argument that if you had gotten

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.160
a two-state solution that Iran would have reconciled itself

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.160
to dealing with this problem.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.160
So we haven't talked much about the two-state solution

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.160
in large part because I sort of took it off the table early on.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.160
But it's very important to understand that every American president

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.160
since Jimmy Carter has pushed hard on the two-state solution

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.160
because we think the two-state solution,

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.160
we meaning American elites, think the two-state solution

01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:02.160
is the only reasonable way to get out of this conundrum.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.160
What has to be done here is that the Palestinians

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.160
have to be given self-determination.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.160
They need a sovereign state of their own.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.160
And this is what the two-state solution was designed to do.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.160
And American leaders understood that if the Israelis

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.160
did not agree to a two-state solution

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.160
and you did not get a two-state solution,

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.160
you were going to have trouble for as far as the eye can see.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.160
You all understand, maybe the younger people in the audience don't,

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.160
but what happened on October 7th is really not an anomaly.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.160
There was the first intifada, then there was the second intifada.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160
Late 80s and early 2000s.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160
Pardon?

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.160
Late 80s and the early 2000s.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.160
Yes, 1987 was the first intifada

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.160
and 2000 was the second intifada.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.160
And these were, you know, Palestinian insurrections.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160
But, John, you could get a two-state solution

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.160
with the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank,

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.160
but Hamas has made it very clear as a user of your knowledge

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160
that they don't support a two-state solution.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160
Absolutely.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.160
There's no question about that.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160
I just want to be very clear here.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.160
This gets back to my point that Netanyahu was playing

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160
divide and conquer, right?

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.160
Netanyahu had quite good relations with Hamas before October 7th

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:23.160
because Hamas doesn't want a two-state solution

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.160
and Netanyahu doesn't want a two-state solution.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.160
And from Netanyahu's point of view,

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.160
the real threat was Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.160
And you notice, by the way, that the Americans have been saying

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.160
that what we need to do in Gaza

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.160
is put the Palestinian Authority in control,

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.160
get Hamas out of the way,

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.160
and put the Palestinian Authority in control.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.160
Netanyahu has made it unequivocally clear this is not happening,

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.160
and that's because the Palestinian Authority

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.160
has reconciled itself to a two-state solution,

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.160
and that's nightmare news for Netanyahu.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.160
You say that Tehran's hand has been strengthened during this dispute,

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160
but let me put this to you.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:16.160
Iran is surrounded by hostile Sunni states across the Persian Gulf,

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.160
since Saudi Arabia.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.160
It's fanatically anti-sheer and well-armed arch enemy.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.160
In Iraq and Syria, at least until recently,

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.160
you had Iran facing large Sunni insurgencies

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.160
dedicated to slaughtering the Shia.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.160
Then there's the internal unrest within Iran.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.160
A lot of younger people, a lot of younger Iranians

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.160
take a more liberal view about the world and their parents

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.160
and certainly the Shia clerical regime.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:51.160
So are you overlooking Iran's real weaknesses and limitations?

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.160
Well, he only gave me 50 minutes to talk.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.160
If he had been willing to fulfill my request

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.160
to be able to talk for two hours,

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.160
I would have qualified my argument somewhat.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:12.160
There's absolutely no question that Iran has significant problems,

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.160
but the thing you want to remember about Iran

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.160
is that Iran is much more powerful than all of its neighbors.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.160
It has a very large population,

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.160
and the human capital inside of Iran is very impressive.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.160
And if you were to look at the potential balance of power

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160
between Iran and Saudi Arabia,

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.160
if they were both able to mobilize all their resources,

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.160
it's a Bambi versus Godzilla situation.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:47.160
That's why the Saudis are so interested in the Abraham Accord.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.160
The Saudis want to jump into bed with the Israelis and the Americans

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.160
because the Saudis understand that the Iranians have a lot of potential power.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.160
Whenever you want to measure the power of a country,

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.160
the two things that you go to,

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.160
number one are population size and number two are wealth.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.160
Number two is wealth.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.160
Wealth and population size.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.160
And if you look at the Iranian situation,

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.160
they are potentially a very powerful country,

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.160
which is not to take away from your points about the problems that they face.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160
Now it's time for question time.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.160
And please, I encourage you to try to keep your questions short of the mind.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.160
But also, feel free to ask about not just the Middle East,

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.160
but also Ukraine and China,

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.160
about which John has spoken in great detail.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160
First question.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.160
You've talked about how Israel now stuck in Gaza.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.160
Do you see similar trap for the US,

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.160
or do they have a path forward and out of this?

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.160
Well, the United States is not going into Gaza, right?

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.160
I mean, we're not putting forces in there.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.160
But we are joined at the hip with Israel.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.160
We have this special relationship

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:05.160
so that as long as Israel is bogged down in Gaza

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.160
and having all sorts of problems,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.160
both in terms of dealing with the Palestinians

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.160
and dealing with the wider world,

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.160
it has huge consequences for us.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.160
We end up vetoing Security Council resolutions

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.160
that we don't want to veto.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:29.160
It ends up poisoning our relations with the Egyptians and the Jordanians.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:34.160
So there are all sorts of spin-off consequences for us that are negative.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.160
And this is why the Biden administration, to its credit,

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.160
is deeply committed to trying to figure out how to solve this one.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.160
As I said before, we'd like Mahmoud Abbas to come in, take over.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.160
Then we can get the rich Arab countries to pour money in.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.160
We can rebuild Gaza and live happily ever after.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.160
That's what we want to do,

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.160
because this is not in our interest to let this go on.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.160
But the problem we face is we can't get the Israelis to go along with us.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.160
This is well documented.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.160
And the end result is, you know, no end to trouble,

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.160
certainly for the Israelis, but even for us.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.160
Next question. Yes, sir.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.160
Thanks, John Lachlan McIntyre.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.160
Since Australia's security depends on the United States,

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.160
do we have no option but to take sides in Gaza and Ukraine?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.160
Meaning Australia.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.160
I'm not sure what taking sides means.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.160
If you're talking about Hamas versus Israel,

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:45.160
that's very different than talking about the Palestinians versus Israel.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:52.160
In other words, I know lots of people who loathe Hamas and hope Israel destroys it,

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.160
who are very sympathetic to the Palestinians,

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:01.160
who believe that Israel is committing genocide.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.160
So I would argue you can take the side of the Palestinians

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.160
if you are an Australian,

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.160
and you can make the argument that that's in Israel's interest.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:21.160
People who've argued for a two-state solution have long argued that's in Israel's interest.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.160
That's the solution. That's the argument.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.160
But if it's a choice between Hamas and Israel,

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:35.160
Australia, certainly the government and most people who operate in the foreign policy establishment,

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.160
they have no choice but to side with Israel against Hamas.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.160
Next question, John Connor.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:50.160
Yes, part of your proposition essentially is that there is no support in Israel for a two-state solution.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.160
Now, I know that there's an organisation which, membership of which is confined to people

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:02.160
who've been the rank of major or above in one of the four Israeli defence and intelligence institutions.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.160
That has consistently argued, I've not checked since October,

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.160
but has consistently argued in favour of a two-state solution while recognising it's difficult.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:17.160
I really think that that is in fact a reflection of at least the views of a significant part

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:23.160
of the Israeli intelligence and military establishment prior to October 7.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.160
Now, given that and sufficient pressure from the US and otherwise,

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:36.160
may require transfers of population through Gaza and the 500,000 settlers in the West Bank, Israeli settlers,

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:43.160
but surely there must be some degree you may be pushing on an open door in trying to arrive at that solution.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.160
With all due respect, I don't agree with you on that.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:55.160
I think there are a handful of people in the Israeli establishment who are in favour of a two-state solution,

01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.160
but they're small in number and the elites who...

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.160
Sorry, that organisation includes the heads of all of those four,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.160
previous heads of all of those four organisations, various of them.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.160
Still a small number. I believe there's no evidence.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:18.160
Furthermore, the Israelis are not going to agree to a two-state solution after what happened on October 7.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:26.160
You're going to create a viable Palestinian state that has weapons of its own on your border.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:34.160
You've not defeated Hamas. You've just suffered this devastating defeat on October 7.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.160
It's just not going to happen.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.160
Okay, next question, Tony, and then we'll go to Antoinette.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:45.160
I'd like to just push on this two-state solution a bit further, and really as you as a realist.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:58.160
Basically, you said that a greater Israel with the West Bank and Gaza in it as a democratic state is off the table.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.160
I think everybody can understand that.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.160
I think that ethnic cleansing is off the table because it's not going to happen.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.160
Nobody's going to allow Israel to do that, and I'm not even sure that Israel wants to do that.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:19.160
So you are driven back to the two-state solution, and I'm sort of intrigued as a realist why you're not embracing that.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:30.160
And can I just push you on? Can't the United States really use its influence to create that solution coming out of this?

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:40.160
Look, I hope that I'm wrong, and the two-state solution is a viable alternative.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:47.160
The Israelis wake up and smell the coffee, and the Americans do what you described.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:55.160
I've been wrong before, and if there's an issue, I'd like to be wrong on moving forward.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.160
This is the issue.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:07.160
So in spirit, I'm with you, but I don't think, as I said to the gentleman on your right,

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:15.160
that there is much enthusiasm for a two-state solution before October 7th inside of Israel,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:22.160
and certainly now, and public opinion is against the two-state solution as well as elite opinion.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:31.160
And furthermore, with regard to the United States putting pressure on Israel, Steve Walt and I wrote this book on the Israel lobby.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160
Steve Walt from Harvard University.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.160
Yeah.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160
Steve Walt, who teaches at Harvard, he and I wrote the book on the Israel lobby,

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:42.160
and there's no way any American government can put significant pressure on Israel.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:49.160
Well, you say that, but the Reagan administration put pressure on Israel and Prime Minister Begin when they invited southern Lebanon.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160
This is the New York Times.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.160
I think this was just a few days ago.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:02.160
They quoted, this is the quote, Mr. Reagan used the power of U.S. arms several times to influence Israeli war policy at different points,

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:06.160
including war planes, custom munitions to be delayed or withheld.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.160
And of course, Joe Biden has recently withheld the support of three and a half thousand bombs to Israel.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.160
So, so much for the Israel lobby.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.160
No.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.160
No.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:35.160
I mean, there you could point to one or two instances back in the distant past where the United States put some pressure on Israel and the Reagan administration in 1982.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160
Yeah.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.160
That was President Bosnia with the settlements.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.160
He failed.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160
He failed.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160
It went nowhere.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160
Right.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160
No president has been able to put me.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Joe Biden is not going to put meaningful pressure on the lobby.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:56.160
Joe Biden, you understand Joe Biden wants to win the election this coming November.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:05.160
And if Joe Biden gets tough on Israel, you'll see what Brett, you'll have Brett Stevens asked here.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.160
Ask Brett Stevens.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:14.160
He wrote a big column as soon as soon as Joe Biden told Israel he was holding up these extra bombs.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.160
That they really didn't need anyway, because they've got so many bombs.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:27.160
As soon as that happened, Brett Stevens had a column and all sorts of supporters of Israel told Joe Biden in no uncertain terms.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.160
You want to remember you're up for reelection and we won't forget.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:41.160
And of course, the problem that Biden faces is you all know is that Arab Americans and many others are going to punish Biden.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:52.160
Well, the running joke around Jerusalem is that having been strongly supportive of Netanyahu after October 7, Joe Biden is seriously invested in the two-state solution, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.160
Okay, Antoinette.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160
Antoinette.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.160
I have two questions, but I'll make them very, very quick.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.160
Firstly, you said a couple of times that Israel is stuck in Gaza.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160
They can't get out.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:09.160
Can you be more specific about why they are stuck and why they can't withdraw?

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:18.160
And my second question in all the decades that you have been following this conflict, the situation closely, where do you think Israel is currently?

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:28.160
You said that, you know, reputationally, politically, they're losing, but specifically in regards to the information war and their ability to put out disinformation.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:35.160
We've got headed babies and people being baked and widespread sexual violence.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:44.160
Do you think that this is different in terms of people's willingness, the broader public or the greater West's willingness to believe?

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.160
Yeah.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160
Okay.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.160
These are two great questions, as are all the other questions for sure.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:58.160
But just on the first, the first question is why are the Israelis or why am I saying the Israelis are stuck in Gaza?

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.160
Well, they have said they're not leaving Gaza, right?

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:12.160
They're going to stay there and they understand it is a choice, but they decided to stay.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:20.160
I mean, I said they're stuck in Gaza and I just said that's because they decided to stay there.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.160
I mean, it may be a choice.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.160
You might not like the choice, but that's the choice they made.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.160
And you want to remember they've not defeated Hamas number one.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.160
And number two, there's the question, who's going to run the place?

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.160
Right.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.160
So they're going to stay.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.160
How they do this remains to be seen.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:46.160
How many troops they leave, where those troops are deployed, how those troops act, that remains to be seen, but they're stuck.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.160
Second question is a very interesting question.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.160
It's all about controlling the narrative.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:20:00.160
The Israelis controlled the narrative in really powerful ways up until the late 1980s.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:12.160
Then you had this group of historians in Israel called the new historians who were then young at the time, and they got access to the archives.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:20.160
And they got access to the records on how Israel was created.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:29.160
And what they did is they exploded all the myths or almost all the myths about how Israel was created.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:37.160
And it really portrayed the Israelis in a negative light.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:42.160
And that was the start of trouble.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:55.160
And I could tell you all sorts of stories about that because people began to think differently about Israel than from the way we thought about when I was young.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.160
There was a book by Leon Urus.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.160
It was called Exodus, and everybody read it.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.160
And it was a movie.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.160
Paul Newman and even Marie Sainz starred in it.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:11.160
And it portrayed the Israelis in a very positive light and the Arabs in a very negative light.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:21.160
And once the new historians came along, all sorts of people, mainly at the elite level, began to think differently about the creation of Israel and Israel's behavior.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:29.160
Then what happens is you get social media and you get the internet.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:41.160
And Israel has huge influence in influencing what the Wall Street Journal, what the New York Times, what the Washington Post says.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.160
But TikTok is a nightmare for Israel.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160
It's an utter nightmare.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:58.160
There's this famous conversation that you can get on the internet of Jonathan Greenblatt, who is the head of the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.160
He's Abe Foxman's successor.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.160
He's on the phone talking to somebody, and there's a video of it.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.160
And he's talking about TikTok.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.160
And it's just a disaster for Israel.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.160
People see what's happening.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.160
And the Israelis, this is really quite remarkable.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:28.160
The Israelis are filming themselves doing absolutely horrible things to the Palestinians and then putting it on the internet.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160
It's just hard to believe.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:41.160
And furthermore, just on the whole genocide story, you know, if you want to make the case that Israel is guilty of genocide,

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160
you have to do two things.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.160
You have to provide evidence of intent, number one.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:54.160
And you have to provide evidence that Israel's actions are consistent with the intent.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:23:05.160
Now, with regard to intent, the Israeli leaders across the board, including Benjamin Nant and Netanyahu, after October 7th,

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:12.160
said all sorts of things that, in my opinion, demonstrated genocidal intent.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.160
This was documented in the South African case.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160
Yes, documented in the South African case.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:21.160
And by the way, there was a piece in Haaretz, which is like the New York Times of Israel.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160
Is that left-leaning Israeli publication?

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160
Yeah, liberal. I'd use the word liberal.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160
American liberal.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160
Yeah, American liberal.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:35.160
But anyway, there was a piece in Haaretz, and the headline of the piece in Haaretz said,

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160
The Road to the Hague.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:45.160
This is the International Court of Justice decision on whether it's potentially genocide.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.160
The Haaretz piece said, The Road to the Hague.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160
This is the headline.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:57.160
The Road to the Hague is paved with public comments by Israeli leaders.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160
Which is exactly right.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.160
You just sort of say to yourself, are they really saying these things?

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.160
And then again, you have all these videos.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.160
And I was talking to my daughter one day, who's not very political at all.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:18.160
She's in her 40s, and she was talking about watching what the Israelis are doing to children on TikTok.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.160
And she said, I can't watch TikTok.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.160
I just can't watch these videos anymore.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160
They're so horrible.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.160
This is a disaster for Israel.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.160
It's a public relations disaster.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:33.160
John, we've been very happy to welcome students from Year 12.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:38.160
So they're last year at high school from Ravenswood College, which is a prestigious school in Sydney.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160
We've got some students here.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160
We've got one school teacher I think wants to ask a question.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.160
And they will also ask one of the students to ask a question if that's possible.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160
Sure.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160
Thanks for the talk.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:58.160
You mentioned the winners and losers referring to the US, Iran and Israel of this war.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:06.160
But I'm wondering, I'd like to hear what you feel will be the impact on the 7.4 million Palestinians,

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.160
the other party to the war in the long run.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.160
Obviously they're suffering at the moment.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.160
But my real question is really about the one state solution.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:24.160
You said the options are a one state solution, two state solution, continued apartheid or ethnic cleansing.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:31.160
For those of us that believe that ethnic cleansing and apartheid are not acceptable,

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:38.160
and that want to see the maintenance of international law, that leaves us with the one state or two state.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.160
I think many experts are saying the two states not possible, given the patchwork of illegal settlements.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:54.160
So what would have to change the future to bring about a one state solution?

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.160
You know, as I said, did everybody hear the question?

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.160
I don't have a good answer to that.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:12.160
I mean, as I said to these two gentlemen on my left, I hope that I'm wrong and they're right about the possibility of a two state solution.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:22.160
I think they're wrong, and as I make clear, and I don't think there's any way you're going to get a one state solution.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:29.160
And I kind of don't, I don't fully understand where this train is headed, right?

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:32.160
I think Israel is in deep trouble.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.160
I think the Israelis will continue to push at ethnic cleansing.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.160
I think that's what you're going to see.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:46.160
I think for the reasons I tried to elaborate here, that from their point of view seems to be the best solution.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.160
I don't think they can get away with it.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160
I'm not 100% sure.

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160
I hope they can't get away with it.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.160
But where this all ends?

01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:04.160
You know, it gets back to the brief discussion I was having with Tom when Tom said, oh, Israel has a nuclear weapon.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160
It's not going anywhere.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:15.160
And you want to remember that South Africa had a nuclear weapon, as I reminded Tom, and apartheid South Africa disappeared.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:22.160
The sort of long term future of Israel is in question for a lot of reasons.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:28.160
Many of which I have not touched on tonight for time related reasons.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:36.160
But you want to understand that immediately after October 7th, 500,000 Israelis left the country.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.160
500,000 Israelis left Israel after October 7th?

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160
Yeah.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160
Wow.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:52.160
And it's, you know, I was talking to somebody who is in the Polish foreign policy establishment the other day.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:28:07.160
And he was telling me, you'd be amazed at how many Israelis are applying for a Polish citizenship, so that they can have a Polish passport.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.160
And the same is true with other European countries.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:21.160
So you just, you don't, I don't want to get into the centrifugal forces that are at play inside of Israel, because it's too late in the evening.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.160
But this is a country that just has lots of problems.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.160
And where this all goes, I don't know.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.160
Not least the demographic challenges.

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.160
Now, do we have a question from one of the students at Ravenswood?

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.160
Hello.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.160
I'm a year 12 student at Ravenswood School for Girls.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:45.160
The question that I want to ask is essentially looking at the US election.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:55.160
How do you think the conflict in the Middle East and the impact of non-state actors will influence the result in the upcoming US election, which you touched on earlier in your talk?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160
Thank you.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.160
I'm jealous of all you students.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.160
You're so young.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.160
It's depressing to think how old I am.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.160
Yeah, it's a very interesting question.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.160
What happens if Trump gets elected?

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:16.160
First of all, I think in terms of the Middle East and in terms of East Asia, it will have little effect.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.160
Okay.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:25.160
The interesting question is whether it will matter in Europe with regard to NATO and with regard to Putin.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:33.160
As we all know from the last time around with Trump, he really wanted to throw NATO down the toilet bowl.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.160
He has no use for NATO.

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:41.160
He thinks our European allies are freeloaders and he'd like to get rid of them.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.160
And he likes Putin.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.160
This is not surprising.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.160
And he really wanted to have good relations with Putin.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:52.160
He lost on both counts.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:58.160
The blob or the deep state, whatever you want to call it, beat him back.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:04.160
He is now determined if he wins to not let that happen again.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:15.160
And he is number one going to bring in a whole group of seasoned individuals who served with him in the first term, who share his view of the world.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:23.160
He didn't have those people available in 2017 when he moved in the White House, January 2017.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:33.160
He now feels, and I think it's correct, that he can bring in a team of individuals and they collectively can beat back the deep state, number one.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:47.160
And number two, at the Heritage Foundation, they're coming up with a plan for what to do once they move back into the White House in 2025.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:51.160
So they're going to have the people, they're going to have the plan or the grand strategy.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.160
And then the question is, can they make it work?

01:30:54.160 --> 01:31:04.160
And again, my initial point to you is I think that where they will try to change things in a fundamental way is in Europe.

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:17.160
And the question you have to ask yourself is, do you think that Trump, even with all of the preparation that's now in train, do you think that Trump can beat the deep state?

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:21.160
I'm a structuralist, as some of you know, the students clearly know this.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:29.160
I believe that structure really matters and it limits how much agency someone like Trump has.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:37.160
So I'm betting on the deep state with regard to NATO and with regard to Europe.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:47.160
And I think whether Trump or Biden wins, it won't matter that much on the foreign policy front.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:53.160
I think the dais cast here, certainly in East Asia, I think the dais cast in the Middle East.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.160
I mean, what's he going to do in the Middle East?

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.160
What's Trump going to do differently?

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.160
Well, the Republican Party is clearly more pro-Israel than the Democrat Party, correct?

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:23.160
Yeah, but even there, because of my point to Tony about the lobby, the Democratic Party is filled with people who are, especially among the younger Democrats, who are, I think it's fair to say, hostile to Israel at this point in time.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:34.160
But the elites, the Democratic Party elites, the people who run the country, they're, you know, no different than the Republicans, right?

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.160
It's Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:40.160
And Joe Biden, it will be the Democrat.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.160
If the Democrats win, it'll be Donald Trump of the Republicans.

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:46.160
And I just don't think you're going to get much difference.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:51.160
Fortunately, we are running out of time, but I just want to conclude and make a few remarks about CIS.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:33:00.160
One of our favorite quotes, you've heard me say this before, first from John Stuart Mill, the famous English liberal thinker of the 19th century.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:06.160
He famously said, he who knows only his own position knows little of that.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:15.160
And what that meant was, as my friend and mentor and former CIS senior fellow, Owen Harries, used to put it, and this is very relevant to the students in the room,

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:25.160
to take particular care to understand the position of your adversary and to understand it, not in a caricatured or superficial form,

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:30.160
but at its strongest for until you have rebutted it at its strongest, you have not rebutted it at all.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:38.160
And this is a necessary condition for both developing your own position fully and attacking your opponents successfully.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.160
That's the first quote.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:46.160
My favorite quote at CIS is from the great 20th century public intellectual Walter Lippman, also a foreign policy realist.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:52.160
And he said, we're all think alike, no one thinks very much.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:59.160
Now, I think tonight we heard a strikingly different view from the one you'll hear in the Australian newspaper, the financial review,

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.160
the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.160
I only mentioned these papers because these are papers that you and I read regularly.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:13.160
And I think it's fair to say that on behalf of our colleagues and board members here at CIS, John, we're very grateful for you being here,

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.160
putting forward the counterargument.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.160
You'll hear from Brett Stevens in a month's time.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.160
Please join me in thanking John Mishon.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:32.160
For decades, CIS has been a fiercely independent voice working hard to promote sound liberal principles.
