0	2640	Why are they starving the Palestinians?
2640	4680	Why are they killing the Palestinians?
4680	6800	Why are they making Gaza unlivable?
6800	8840	It's very simple. They want to drive them out.
8840	18060	Well, ladies and gentlemen,
18060	19520	welcome to the Intercontinental.
19520	21120	My name is Tom Switzer.
21120	22560	I'm the executive director at
22560	24440	the Center for Independent Studies.
24440	27000	Now, for those of you who don't know much about CIS,
27000	29320	we're a public policy research organization.
29320	31640	We're just based up the road on Macquarie Street,
31640	34900	and we are primarily focused on
34900	37640	tackling our nation's great public policy challenges.
37640	39360	So we're interested in economics,
39360	44160	education, energy, housing affordability,
44160	47440	intergenerational matters, aboriginal affairs.
47440	49280	But we're also very much engaged in
49280	51080	the foreign policy debates,
51080	54000	and that brings us to this evening's event.
54000	56800	Now, I should stress from the outset that I think it's
56800	58760	probably fair to say that this crisis
58760	61720	between Israel and Gaza in the Middle East,
61720	63640	it's probably the most vexed issue
63640	66920	in international relations in 2024.
66920	70560	In a month's time, we'll hear from Brett Stevens,
70560	71880	the award-winning columnist at
71880	74760	the New York Times formerly with the Wall Street Journal.
74760	77240	He'll be speaking in solid defense of
77240	80520	Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
80520	83840	But tonight, we will hear a radically different view.
83840	86440	We at CIS believe that it's very important,
86480	89760	especially for a classical liberal organization like CIS,
89760	92880	to hear both sides of any debate.
92880	95160	Now, John Mirshimer is without doubt
95160	97280	one of the most distinguished professors
97280	99400	of political science in the world.
99400	101400	He's been a professor of political science
101400	105520	at the University of Chicago for more than four decades.
105520	108240	He's the author of many prominent and influential books,
108240	112400	most notably the Tragedy of Great Power Politics,
112400	115040	that was published in 2001,
115040	116440	and Foreign Affairs Magazine,
116440	119400	the prestigious New York-based journal of opinion
119400	121560	on international affairs.
121560	126000	It ranks Mirshimer's Great Power Thesis
126000	129600	as one of the three most influential foreign policy
129600	133000	theses of the post-Coll war era.
133000	136520	John, as Foreign Affairs has actually acknowledged,
136520	141520	is quote, one of the most famous political scientists
142320	145080	in history, extraordinary rap,
145080	148960	one of the most famous political scientists in history.
148960	150960	And that review of John's latest book
150960	152240	was written by a critic.
153640	155880	John is also, I think it's fair to say,
155880	158840	a global sensation in the digital world.
158840	163840	In fact, 19 of his debates and interviews on YouTube
164720	168400	have each attracted more than one million views,
168400	170320	extraordinary, extraordinary.
170320	174080	And I should stress that since he quite correctly predicted
174080	177680	that the US-led invasion of Iraq would be not just
177680	182080	unnecessary, but a strategic blunder of epic proportions.
182080	185600	So it's an extraordinary reach and influence for John.
185600	187880	And with that, it's my great pleasure,
187880	190960	on behalf of CIS, to welcome Professor John Mirshimer
190960	192120	back to CIS.
192120	197120	Thank you very much for the kind words, Tom.
197120	198520	It's great to be back here.
198520	200040	Great to see Tom again.
200040	203000	And thank you all for coming out to hear me speak tonight.
204600	207960	As everybody knows, since October 7th,
207960	211960	the Middle East has been turned upside down.
211960	214280	I think before October 7th,
214280	218680	almost everybody thought that the Middle East
218680	220560	was a quite stable area.
220560	222560	There were no big problems.
222560	224440	Then October 7th happened,
224440	228720	and it looks like nothing but trouble today
228720	231800	and for as far as the eye can see.
231800	236960	And what I'd like to do is analyze what has happened
236960	239280	since October 7th.
239280	242640	I'd like to talk about the causes of the trouble,
242640	247520	where we are today, and where we're going.
247520	253520	And in pursuit of that, I want to break my talk down this way.
253520	258800	First, I want to focus on analyzing the conflict in Gaza,
258800	263400	mainly between Israel and the Palestinians,
263400	265440	or Israel and Hamas.
265440	268920	And also to say a few words about Hezbollah,
268920	274040	because the Hezbollah-Israel conflict is connected to Gaza.
274040	277200	So that's the first conflict I want to look at.
277200	280600	Then the second conflict I want to look at
281240	284240	is the Iran-Israel-U.S. conflict
284240	290240	that took place April 1st, April 14th, and April 19th.
291960	297960	And I want to figure out what exactly happened there
297960	300760	and what the consequences are.
300760	303560	And of course, I'm going to do that with the Gaza war as well.
303560	306760	So those are the two conflicts I'm going to look at.
306760	310960	And then what I want to do in the second part of the talk
310960	314280	is I want to talk about the consequences of all of this,
314280	318880	the consequences of those two conflicts for Israel,
318880	322440	for the United States, and for Iran.
322440	326760	And my basic argument is that Israel is the big loser.
326760	330000	Israel is in really serious trouble today,
330000	334880	and there's little hope of getting away from that moving forward.
334920	338280	Second, that the Americans are also losers,
338280	343000	although they do not lose as big as Israel does.
343000	345960	And the winners, not in any decisive way,
345960	348680	but the winners are the Iranians.
348680	352800	So that's the basic structure of my talk this evening.
353920	357760	Now, let me start with what happened on October 7th
357760	360720	and talk about the Gaza war.
360720	362880	And just for purposes of background,
362880	365200	for putting a framework in your head,
365200	370040	it's very important to understand that Israel today
370040	373280	is what I would call greater Israel.
373280	377640	Israel controls everything between the river and the sea.
377640	382000	And of course, that phrase is usually associated with Hamas.
382000	384480	And what Hamas wants is to control everything
384480	387920	between the river and the sea, just like Israel does.
387920	390480	And the end result is that what you have today
390480	392720	is a greater Israel.
392720	396120	And that greater Israel includes
396120	398080	what's called Green Line Israel.
398080	402760	That was Israel before the 1967 war,
402760	406960	plus Gaza, plus the West Bank.
406960	409240	Okay, so there are those three areas
409240	411360	that comprise greater Israel.
412520	416040	And what's very important to understand
416040	418320	is that inside greater Israel,
418320	423120	there are roughly 7.3 million Palestinians
423120	427400	and roughly 7.3 million Israeli Jews.
427400	432040	There is rough equality between the two sides.
432040	436440	So the question is, how does Israel think
436440	440640	about dealing with greater Israel
440640	444640	where you have rough equality between these two populations?
444800	448360	And there are basically four options.
448360	453200	One is you have a democratic greater Israel.
453200	454520	That's not gonna happen
454520	457160	because it would no longer be a Jewish state.
458400	461560	Okay, because if you look at demographic patterns,
461560	463560	the Palestinians are making more babies
463560	465080	than the Israeli Jews.
465080	467360	So that's not happening.
467360	470800	Second possibility is a two-state solution.
470800	473640	Everybody loves to talk about a two-state solution.
473640	475040	That is not happening.
475040	477400	Certainly after what happened on October 7th,
477400	479960	but even before then, and I'll talk more about this,
479960	482600	Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli elite
482600	487000	has no interest in a two-state solution, okay?
487000	489640	The third possibility is apartheid.
489640	493560	And basically what you now have is an apartheid state.
493560	495680	We can go into this in detail in the Q&A
495680	496960	if you wanna do that,
496960	499920	but if you look at Amnesty International,
499920	502640	Human Rights Watch, and Bicellum,
502680	506120	which is the leading human rights group in Israel,
506120	508800	all three of those organizations
508800	511280	have produced lengthy reports
511280	514800	that lay out why Israel is an apartheid state.
516240	519760	The fourth option is ethnic cleansing.
519760	523800	And ethnic cleansing means getting rid of the Palestinians
523800	525840	for the most part who live in Gaza
525840	527880	and who live in the West Bank,
527880	529880	and creating a greater Israel
529880	532440	that is completely dominated by Israeli Jews
532440	537360	and has very few, if any, Palestinians in its midst.
537360	540240	So again, the four options are,
540240	544640	number one, democratic greater Israel,
544640	546320	number two, two-state solution.
546320	547920	Those two are off the table.
547920	549520	Number three, apartheid,
549520	551440	which is basically what you have now.
551440	553800	And number four is ethnic cleansing,
553800	557080	where you get rid of the Palestinians, okay?
557080	559680	Now, let's switch gears a bit
559680	562880	and talk about what the situation looked like
562880	564800	before October 7th,
566160	569040	and focus mainly on Gaza.
569040	571240	Before October 7th,
571240	573920	the Palestinians in Gaza
573920	577600	basically lived in a giant open-air prison.
577600	580560	What happened was that in 2005,
580560	583680	when Ariel Sharon was the prime minister of Israel,
583680	588680	he decided to pull the settlers out of Gaza.
589680	591920	As you know, there are settlers in the West Bank.
591920	596040	Up until 2005, there were Israeli settlers in Gaza,
596040	598160	and Sharon pulled them out.
598160	599200	And he pulled them out
599200	601520	because Gaza was a hornet's nest,
601520	605040	and having settlers in there was a nightmare.
605040	607040	And they had their hands full in the West Bank,
607040	609240	and they wanted to focus on the West Bank.
609240	611960	And what they did was pulled all the settlers out,
611960	614400	and it became an open-air prison.
614400	618320	Now, it looked up until October 7th,
618360	620320	like Netanyahu and company
620320	625320	were able to manage the situation inside of Gaza.
626920	631400	Nobody thought what happened on October 7th was gonna happen.
631400	634160	This is why the Israelis got caught with their pants down.
634160	639160	They thought they were managing the situation very well.
639280	642040	And what was going on there
642040	645880	is that Netanyahu was actually very happy
645880	649560	with the fact that Hamas was running Gaza.
649560	652240	This is hard to believe today, but it is true.
652240	657240	And he was making sure that Hamas was being funded
657640	662640	and that Hamas was doing reasonably well.
663080	664760	Now, why is that the case?
664760	667320	Because Netanyahu is adamantly opposed
667320	669160	to a two-state solution.
669160	673920	And Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority
673960	678560	in the West Bank, is in favor of a two-state solution.
678560	681800	So from Sharon's point of view, not Sharon,
681800	683640	from Netanyahu's point of view,
683640	685880	would have been true from Sharon's point of view as well,
685880	687360	as if he hadn't passed away,
688560	692680	Abbas is a threat because Abbas wants a two-state solution.
694320	699320	So what Netanyahu has done is supported Hamas
699640	703040	because we all know Hamas does not want a two-state solution.
703080	708080	And he's playing off Hamas against the PLO
708960	711880	in the West Bank.
711880	713800	And it looks like it works.
713800	716160	And by the way, every once in a while,
716160	719800	every couple of years, the Israelis mow the lawn,
719800	723520	which means they precipitate a conflict with the Palestinians,
723520	725280	they go in there, they kill hundreds,
725280	727120	if not thousands of Palestinians,
727120	730840	destroy some buildings and send them a very clear message
730880	733840	that, you know, we're in charge
733840	736160	and we want you to understand
736160	739760	that you have to remain in this open-air prison.
739760	741840	So that's the basic situation that exists.
741840	745320	It looks like Netanyahu is managing the situation.
745320	747680	And almost everybody thinks that,
747680	749400	which is again, is why they get caught
749400	752520	with their pants down on October 7th.
752520	756120	But again, what happens on October 7th
756120	761120	is that Hamas attacks into Israel.
761480	766480	And I think it's fair to say, achieves a spectacular success.
766640	769800	I think the evidence is that Hamas was surprised
769800	772040	by how successful they were.
773600	777600	And anyway, they eventually leave Israel
777600	781720	and the Israelis consolidate the situation
781720	784000	inside of their borders.
784920	789920	And then they eventually go on the offensive against Hamas.
791560	794920	And that offensive is now taking place.
794920	798000	Okay, now what we wanna ask ourselves
798000	802080	is what exactly are Israel's goals here?
802080	803600	This is very important to understand
803600	805640	what Israel is trying to do.
805640	808240	Now, if you read the mainstream media in the West,
808240	809920	and this includes Australia,
809920	813960	what people talk about is that Israel is interested
814440	817000	in number one, defeating Hamas.
817000	819840	And here we're talking about decisively defeating Hamas
819840	821440	and eliminating Hamas.
821440	823520	And you can understand why from Israel's point of view
823520	825280	that makes sense.
825280	828880	Second goal is to get the hostages back.
828880	833400	As you all know, Hamas took about 240 hostages.
833400	835440	And what the Israelis obviously wanna do
835440	837360	is get those hostages back.
837360	839760	So there's sort of two principal goals here.
839800	844800	Defeat Hamas decisively and get back the hostages.
844920	849400	What's not discussed in the Western media is the real goal.
849400	853400	And the real goal is to ethnically cleanse Gaza.
853400	856280	And the reason they wanna ethnically cleanse Gaza
856280	859680	is because number one,
860840	864480	that's the way you get out of apartheid.
864480	868240	You all understand Israel is an apartheid state.
868240	873240	And the only way you get out of that situation is you cleanse.
875760	878800	Furthermore, it's the only way you defeat Hamas.
878800	880120	I'll talk more about this.
880120	882120	It's quite clear that the Israelis
882120	884960	are not gonna defeat Hamas, right?
884960	888080	And I can't believe they thought they would defeat Hamas
888080	889400	before they went in there.
889400	891600	They're too smart for that.
893080	895680	But if you cleanse Gaza
895680	897920	and you drive all the Palestinians out,
897920	899760	you drive Hamas out.
899760	902760	So you solve two of the principal problems you face
902760	904040	with ethnic cleansing.
905400	907240	You solve the apartheid problem
908520	910960	and you solve the Hamas problem.
910960	912200	Now you're probably saying to yourself,
912200	914560	Israel wouldn't do anything like this.
916840	917800	Just a couple of points.
917800	920280	First of all, to create the state of Israel,
920280	923320	to begin with, you had to do massive ethnic cleansing.
923320	927000	In 1948 and in 1967,
927000	931760	the Israelis cleansed huge portions
931760	934440	of what is today greater Israel.
934440	936480	And the idea that they wouldn't do this,
936480	940680	if you read all sorts of Israeli media,
940680	943920	they talk about ethnic cleansing all the time.
943920	946320	And it makes perfect sense if you think about it.
947560	951240	Final point I'd make to you is one of the criticisms
951240	953000	that I'll talk more about this
953000	955800	of what the Israelis and especially Benjamin Netanyahu
956000	957520	are doing in Gaza,
957520	960320	is they have not come up with a plan
961360	965600	for what Gaza is going to look like
965600	967480	after the shooting stops.
967480	971000	In other words, what's the political solution here
971000	973240	once the shooting stops?
973240	977520	And Israeli military commanders, IDF military commanders
977520	979560	are constantly complaining these days
979560	982400	that Netanyahu doesn't give them any sense
982400	986800	of what the final political settlement's gonna look like
986800	988200	so they can deal with Hamas
988200	989400	and deal with the Palestinians
989400	993080	with some thought in mind about what the end game is here.
993080	995520	For the reason there's no end game,
995520	997000	the reason they're not talking about
997000	999520	how they're going to administer
999520	1001800	a Palestinian-dominated Gaza
1001800	1004600	is because they want the Palestinians out.
1004600	1006880	They wanna ethically cleanse Gaza.
1007800	1010440	And then that brings us to the question,
1010440	1012440	how do you do this, right?
1012440	1014960	How do you get the Palestinians out?
1014960	1018160	Well, first of all,
1019160	1023160	they definitely went after Hamas to start with.
1023440	1026640	That was the purely military side of the story.
1026640	1028120	They went after Hamas.
1029120	1032240	But to make ethnic cleansing work,
1032240	1035280	you have to number one,
1035280	1037600	you have to number one,
1037600	1041440	kill significant numbers of people,
1041440	1045880	of Palestinians who are basically innocent Palestinians,
1045880	1047480	not Hamas.
1047480	1049400	You have to kill large numbers of them
1049400	1051440	and you have to give them a powerful incentive
1051440	1053560	by killing them to drive them out.
1054480	1059480	Number two, you have to make the place unlivable.
1060120	1061840	And that's what they're doing.
1061840	1065240	I mean, they're not just killing people.
1065240	1068640	They're making Gaza unlivable.
1068640	1071840	I could go through this in detail in the Q and A
1071840	1074320	if people wanna hear the story.
1074320	1077920	But it is, as many people say,
1077920	1080120	especially the UN people who are there,
1080120	1081560	the place is unlivable.
1081560	1082920	And the reason it's unlivable
1082920	1086280	is because they're trying to cleanse Gaza.
1088160	1091320	It's very important to understand that.
1091320	1093040	And then finally, what they're doing
1093080	1095520	is starving the population.
1095520	1098960	There's all sorts of talk about famine in the north,
1098960	1100360	northern part of Gaza.
1100360	1104040	The United States is leaning heavily on the Israelis
1104040	1106680	to let food and other kinds of aid in.
1106680	1110080	The Israelis are resisting at every turn.
1110080	1112080	Why are they starving the Palestinians?
1112080	1114160	Why are they killing the Palestinians?
1114160	1116240	Why are they making Gaza unlivable?
1116240	1117080	It's very simple.
1117080	1118400	They wanna drive them out.
1119400	1125080	So that's basically what's been happening.
1125080	1127600	And in the beginning, right,
1127600	1130080	there was all sorts of talk about genocide.
1130080	1134120	And I was on the record publicly
1134120	1136400	is saying this is not a genocide.
1136400	1139040	But after December, I changed my mind on that.
1139040	1142040	I think the Israelis are now engaged in genocide.
1142040	1143840	And what's happened here
1143840	1145600	is because they have been unable
1145600	1148040	to get the Palestinians out.
1148040	1149480	They've had to increase
1149480	1152640	the amount of killing that they do, right?
1152640	1155560	They're continuing to push
1155560	1158160	to get the Palestinians out of Gaza.
1158160	1161400	And the way they do that is just kill more and more people
1161400	1163560	and make the Palestinian,
1163560	1168800	make the situation in Gaza more and more unlivable, right?
1168800	1171880	So the situation's just getting worse and worse and worse.
1171880	1173760	Despite the fact that the United States
1173760	1176560	and actually the West more generally doing what they can,
1178520	1181320	help feed the Palestinians.
1183520	1186080	So the question is, where are we today?
1186080	1187120	Where are we today?
1189040	1192040	First of all, they've not defeated Hamas
1192040	1193720	and they're not gonna defeat Hamas.
1193720	1196520	Kurt Campbell, who is the deputy secretary of state
1196520	1198360	basically said that yesterday.
1198360	1201200	There are all sorts of stories in the Israeli press
1201200	1203920	that they're not gonna defeat Hamas.
1203920	1206160	They haven't gotten the hostages back
1207120	1212120	and they have not been able to cleanse Gaza.
1214360	1216600	They've not been able to cleanse Gaza.
1216600	1218720	Furthermore, they're stuck in Gaza.
1219640	1221760	They're there, right?
1221760	1224580	They got out in 2005 and they're back there.
1225920	1226960	This is not good.
1229400	1233760	So what you see here is that Israel is in real trouble
1234640	1235480	in Gaza.
1236920	1240160	Now, in addition to the problem in Gaza,
1240160	1242600	they have a huge problem with Hezbollah
1242600	1247240	because Hezbollah in the North in support of Hamas
1247240	1249960	has been shelling Northern Israel.
1249960	1252840	And there are somewhere between 60,000
1252840	1257200	and 100,000 Israelis from the Northern part of Israel
1257200	1260080	who have had to move into the center of Israel
1260080	1263200	on a temporary basis and can't go home
1263200	1267880	because Hezbollah is shelling Northern Israel.
1267880	1272880	And Hezbollah has said that until this all ends in Gaza,
1274480	1276920	they're gonna continue to fight the Israelis.
1276920	1279000	This is a huge problem for the Israelis.
1279000	1281520	So they not only have trouble with Hamas and Gaza,
1281520	1285400	they have trouble with Hezbollah up on the Northern border.
1285400	1288880	And by the way, the Houthis are actually now taking aim
1288880	1292000	at the Israelis and the Houthis just recently landed
1292000	1297000	their first missile inside of Israel.
1298600	1302160	Just one, but that's a harbinger of things to come.
1303000	1306200	You see how much trouble Israel is in.
1306200	1308920	They have not achieved their objectives
1310040	1312240	with regard to those two stated objectives
1312240	1315920	and with regard to the ethnic cleansing.
1315920	1317320	And as I said to you before,
1317320	1320600	you always wanna understand there are four options here.
1320640	1322120	First two are off the table
1322120	1326040	and that comes down to apartheid or ethnic cleansing.
1326040	1328240	And the Israelis understand full well.
1328240	1332920	In apartheid state, we remember what happened to South Africa.
1332920	1335360	We have got to solve that problem.
1335360	1337960	That's why ethnic cleansing is so attractive,
1337960	1342000	but they've been unable to ethnically cleanse so far.
1342000	1343000	That's that story.
1343000	1345360	That's the story about Gaza.
1345360	1347760	Let's shift gears now and talk about Iran
1348200	1352240	versus Israel versus the United States.
1354200	1359200	Up until April 1st, the war between Israel and Iran
1360560	1364480	and even the United States and Iran was a shadow war.
1366640	1368880	And it's very important to understand
1368880	1373880	that we did not want the war, that shadow war to escalate.
1374320	1377120	We did not wanna see Iran and Israel
1377120	1379000	get into a fight.
1379000	1382640	Very important to understand, nor did the Iranians.
1382640	1385640	The Iranians had no interest in escalation.
1385640	1388520	The country that had an interest in escalation
1388520	1389680	were the Israelis.
1389680	1392160	The Israelis have had their gun sights on Iran
1392160	1395120	for a long time and they've been doing everything
1395120	1399520	they can over time to pull us into a war against Iran,
1399520	1401600	but we didn't want a war.
1401600	1405600	What happens on April 1st, as I'm sure all of you remember,
1405600	1410600	is that the Israelis hit the Iranian embassy
1411560	1413520	in Damascus, Syria.
1414680	1419680	This drives the Iranians a portray
1422080	1424800	and the Iranians make it clear
1424800	1429800	that they're going to retaliate against Israel.
1430000	1434120	The United States is a guest.
1434120	1436560	The United States is very angry at the Israelis
1436560	1441000	for doing this and not telling them that it was coming.
1441000	1446000	So the Israelis look like they're gonna get a big conflict
1446920	1448440	between Israel and the United States
1448440	1450960	on one side and the Iranians on the other side,
1450960	1452760	but the United States doesn't want this
1452760	1454960	and Iran doesn't want this.
1454960	1459960	So what happens, this is April 1st, the attack on the embassy.
1460240	1465240	On April 14th, Iran retaliates against Israel.
1465760	1467520	You all remember this.
1467520	1470560	The question is what happens between April 1st
1470560	1474680	and April 14th and then what happens on April 14th?
1474680	1477920	So very important to understand these details.
1477920	1482920	The United States and Iran work together
1483480	1484880	through intermediaries,
1484880	1487400	because we don't have direct relations.
1487520	1491600	We work together through intermediaries
1491600	1496600	to make sure that the Iranian attack is limited,
1497000	1501120	that we see it coming beforehand
1501120	1504640	and that the United States and the Israelis
1504640	1508160	and others are able to deal with the attack.
1508160	1511720	Furthermore, we make it clear that we want the Iranians
1511720	1514720	not to hit any populated areas
1514720	1518560	and to basically go after one or two military targets.
1518560	1521560	We and the Iranians agree
1521560	1524000	that it will be a limited attack.
1524880	1526960	We're coordinating with the Iranians
1526960	1528800	because again, we don't want escalation.
1528800	1531800	We meaning the Americans, nor do they.
1531800	1536800	Then when the Iranian attack comes, a hotline,
1537760	1542800	an informal hotline is set up between the United States
1542800	1546560	and Iran via Oman,
1547480	1550000	because both the Iranians and the Americans
1550000	1553440	wanna keep this one under control.
1553440	1555800	Very important to understand that.
1555800	1560800	And the Iranians attack and what happens there?
1562280	1567280	The Americans are deeply involved in defending Israel.
1567280	1569440	You all remember, everybody talked about
1569440	1572240	how the Jordanians, the Saudis, the French,
1572240	1574360	the British, the Americans, the Israelis,
1574360	1578440	they were all involved in dealing with this attack.
1578440	1580080	This is a real problem for Israel
1580080	1582520	because Israel has always prided itself
1582520	1586680	on being able to independently deal with an adversary
1586680	1588640	that thinks about attacking it.
1588640	1591200	Well, in this case, right,
1591200	1595080	not only are we coordinating things with the Iranians
1595080	1596760	to make sure this is limited
1596760	1599400	and it doesn't spin out of control,
1599400	1602480	but there is considerable evidence
1602480	1607000	that roughly half of the missiles and drones
1607000	1610520	that were shot down were shot down by the United States,
1610520	1613840	not by Israel, roughly half.
1613840	1616080	We were deeply involved.
1616080	1620400	We had naval ships that shot down Iranian ballistic missiles
1620400	1622200	and we were using fighter aircraft
1622200	1627200	to shoot down cruise missiles and shoot down drones.
1627200	1630360	Now, the Israelis played a very important role in this,
1630360	1632440	but it's important to understand
1632440	1634200	we, the United States of America,
1634200	1636120	were coordinating the effort.
1636120	1637720	See how deeply involved we were?
1637720	1639960	We wanted to keep this one under control.
1639960	1641120	We wanted to make sure
1641120	1643720	that that Iranian offensive against Israel
1643720	1645680	was not successful.
1645680	1648080	That brings me to the final part of the story
1648080	1652520	about April events involving Iran and Israel.
1652520	1655760	The Israelis retaliate on April 19th.
1655760	1659680	Remember, April 1st is when they hit the embassy in Damascus.
1659680	1664680	April 14th is when Iran goes after Israel,
1665640	1670040	does limited damage, hardly any damage,
1670040	1674280	and then on April 19th, the Israelis retaliate.
1674280	1675320	Now, as you would expect,
1675320	1678240	the Israelis wanted to unleash the dogs.
1678240	1682320	The Israelis wanted a big counterattack on Iran.
1682320	1686400	The United States did not want that for one second.
1686400	1689040	We were trying to put a cap on the volcano.
1689040	1692000	So what the Israelis end up doing
1692000	1696760	is basically taking out one radar
1696760	1701760	in the Isfahan area of Iran, just one radar.
1702640	1705480	It's a radar associated with an S-300 missile.
1705480	1710480	It is a very, very limited response.
1711320	1713640	And it's a limited response
1713640	1716720	because the United States demands
1716720	1718680	that it be a limited response.
1718680	1721120	Furthermore, we go to great lengths to tell the Israelis
1721120	1726120	they actually won a great victory on April 14th
1726320	1731320	by stopping all those Israeli missiles and drones.
1732400	1735160	So Israel, except the fact
1735160	1738000	that you won a great victory on April 14th,
1738000	1741680	all we need is just a small-scale attack
1741680	1743280	where we go after one radar,
1743280	1745160	and that's the end of the story.
1745160	1747960	And of course, that was the end of the story.
1747960	1748920	This one went away,
1748920	1752920	unlike Gaza, which continues on to this day.
1752920	1755800	So what I'm telling you is you have these two big conflicts,
1755800	1758560	the one in Gaza, which I just described,
1758560	1761920	and then the one involving Iran, Israel,
1761920	1765480	and the United States between April 1st and April 19th.
1766480	1771160	Now, I want to talk about the consequences of this
1771160	1775720	for Israel, United States, and Iran.
1775720	1777320	And as I said to you,
1777320	1781880	I believe that Israel was the big loser here.
1781880	1784760	Now, you're saying to yourself, why is that the case?
1785760	1787680	Number of reasons.
1787680	1792320	First of all, the Israelis are back in Gaza.
1793080	1795440	They got out in 2005.
1795440	1798840	Ariel Sharon, as you all know, is no shrinking violet.
1800120	1804600	He's at least as tough an ombre as Benjamin Netanyahu.
1804600	1808440	He pulled out because Gaza's a hornet's nest.
1808440	1812600	Well, the Israelis are back in Gaza.
1812600	1817600	They have no way of getting out at the moment,
1818600	1823600	and they have no solution to the problem.
1823920	1826280	They've made Gaza unlivable.
1826280	1827880	What are they going to do?
1827880	1830440	The Palestinians are not leaving.
1830440	1831600	What are they going to do?
1831600	1833200	They're running the place.
1834320	1835800	They're in deep trouble.
1837600	1840960	Second reason the Israelis lose,
1840960	1845240	you have to understand how the Israelis think about deterrence.
1845800	1848280	And this is a very smart way of thinking about deterrence.
1848280	1850720	I'm not being critical of Israeli thinking here.
1852720	1856600	What the Israelis believe is that their deterrence
1856600	1861600	depends on escalation dominance, escalation dominance.
1861960	1866960	That means if somebody whacks me and I whacked them back,
1867480	1872320	I whacked them back harder than they initially whacked me.
1872320	1875920	In other words, as we go up the escalation ladder,
1875920	1879260	I dominate escalation dominance.
1879260	1884260	The best example of this is in the summer of 2003,
1885840	1890840	Hezbollah killed a few Israelis,
1891080	1892520	this is up on the northern border.
1892520	1895360	Hezbollah killed a few Israelis
1895360	1899360	and kidnapped an Israeli, okay?
1899400	1903240	The Israelis massively retaliated.
1903240	1906320	And Nasrallah, who is the head of Hezbollah,
1906320	1909300	said, I think two months later,
1909300	1912920	Nasrallah said, if I had known
1912920	1917080	what the Israelis were gonna do in terms of retaliating,
1917080	1922080	I would have never allowed the attack on July 12th, 2006.
1924400	1927760	That's escalation dominance, do you understand?
1927760	1930320	It's very important, from Israel's point of view,
1930320	1932920	they have to make it clear to all their neighbors
1932920	1936680	that if you whack us, we'll whack you back harder.
1936680	1940840	It's now very clear the Israelis no longer
1940840	1945120	have escalation dominance vis-a-vis Iran
1945120	1948520	or vis-a-vis Hezbollah.
1948520	1951720	They cannot shut down the conflict
1951720	1954640	with Hezbollah on their northern border.
1954640	1956280	Really quite remarkable.
1956280	1960120	The Israelis are hitting Hezbollah very hard
1960120	1963240	and Hezbollah is responding.
1963240	1968240	Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets and missiles
1968400	1972400	and those numbers will only grow at the passage of time.
1972400	1975280	150,000, right?
1975280	1977440	So the Israelis are limited in what they can do.
1977440	1980000	And with regard to Iran, I described to you
1980000	1983960	what happened April 1st, April 14th, April 19th.
1984000	1986600	That is not escalation dominance.
1986600	1989560	I'm sorry, that is not escalation dominance.
1989560	1992800	And furthermore, they needed the Americans.
1992800	1995560	You all understand, I'm just sort of
1996640	1999040	diverting from the path of mine for one second.
1999040	2001640	If you look at what's happening in Gaza,
2001640	2005520	the Israelis could never conduct that operation
2005520	2009320	in Gaza without American support, not even close.
2009320	2011520	And all sorts of Israeli generals say that
2011520	2012640	in the Israeli press.
2013480	2017680	They cannot by themselves produce the weaponry
2017680	2021040	to conduct the operations they're now conducting in Gaza.
2021040	2022000	They need us.
2022000	2025000	And what I'm telling you about what happened
2025000	2027840	on April 14th is they needed us.
2029160	2031080	You hear all this talk about iron dome
2031080	2032840	and their ability to shoot down missiles.
2032840	2034560	They cannot do it alone.
2034560	2039560	Iron dome is not that formidable defensive system
2039560	2041960	and furthermore given cost exchange ratios,
2041960	2043680	the number of missiles that the Iranians
2043680	2048680	and Hezbollah have, iron dome over the long term
2048680	2051920	in a fight is just not very useful.
2051920	2054920	So from a deterrence point of view,
2054920	2056920	the Israelis are in real trouble.
2056920	2058680	So my first point is they're in real trouble
2058680	2060200	because they're stuck in Gaza
2060200	2063080	and they have no solution to the problem.
2063080	2068080	And number two, their deterrence has been badly weakened.
2068920	2072040	Number three is very important to understand
2072040	2073720	with the coming of all these missiles
2073720	2075680	and the coming of drones,
2075680	2078960	it's now possible for actors like Hamas,
2078960	2082920	the Houthis and Hezbollah and Iran
2082920	2087920	to develop the capability to hit Israel
2089600	2092480	and cause enormous amounts of damage.
2092480	2094520	And lots of people who live in Israel
2094520	2097480	are not very comfortable with this situation.
2098520	2102360	The idea that they are exposed to adversaries
2102360	2104480	and these are formidable adversaries.
2104480	2106320	I don't wanna make light of the fact
2106320	2110440	that groups like Hezbollah and groups like Hamas
2110440	2112080	would like to finish Israel off.
2112080	2117080	They would, these are really tough hombres.
2117440	2122040	And what's happened here is that with the passage of time,
2122040	2124680	missile capabilities and drone capabilities
2124680	2126720	have reached the point where it's quite easy
2126720	2130240	for actors like that to employ those weapons
2130240	2132760	to create a real threat for Israel.
2132760	2136200	The fourth way in which Israel is in trouble
2136200	2140880	is that it has effectively become a pariah state
2142040	2145600	in ways that it never was in the past.
2145600	2148600	If you look at what's happening in the United States
2148600	2151640	and all across the world on university campuses
2151640	2153360	and college campuses,
2153360	2155520	this is just evidence whether you think
2155520	2157840	what's going on is right or wrong
2157840	2162160	that Israel's reputation has been badly tarnished.
2165240	2170240	If you think about the fact that South Africa took Israel
2170680	2174400	before the International Court of Justice
2174400	2177000	and the International Court of Justice found,
2177000	2180160	not that Israel is committing genocide.
2180160	2181400	They didn't find that.
2181400	2183640	That is yet to be determined.
2183680	2186600	But what the International Court of Justice did find
2186600	2188960	is that there is sufficient evidence,
2188960	2192640	there's enough evidence to think
2192640	2197640	that Israel might be committing genocide.
2197760	2200560	And if you look at polls inside the United States,
2200560	2203920	it's truly remarkable how many people,
2203920	2205680	especially Democrats,
2205680	2209040	believed that Israel is engaged in genocide.
2209040	2210880	There's a recent poll that shows
2210880	2215320	that 56% of all Democrats think
2215320	2217720	that Israel is committing genocide.
2217720	2221760	Think about that, 56% of Americans
2222760	2226120	hold think that Israel is committing genocide.
2227400	2229720	There's another poll that shows,
2229720	2232160	talks about Biden voters,
2232160	2237160	that shows that 57% think Israel is committing genocide.
2237200	2241320	27% are not sure.
2241320	2244640	57% think Israel is committing genocide.
2244640	2247720	27% are not sure.
2247720	2252520	And then 15% do not believe Israel is committing genocide.
2252520	2254400	This is quite remarkable.
2254400	2257800	When I think about how I thought about Israel
2257800	2261160	and virtually everybody I knew thought about Israel
2261160	2264200	when I was a young boy and I was a young man
2264280	2268800	and how virtually everybody I know now thinks about Israel,
2269680	2272920	a fundamental transformation has taken place.
2272920	2274960	It's really quite remarkable.
2274960	2276720	And the idea that the Jewish state
2276720	2279400	is being accused of genocide,
2279400	2281000	it's really quite remarkable.
2282000	2284120	This is a sign of big trouble
2284120	2288120	and the use of the apartheid label is used increasingly.
2288120	2290160	And this is not gonna change
2290160	2293400	because the situation in Gaza is not gonna get any better.
2293400	2295760	That was one of the points I'm trying to get through to you.
2295760	2298480	There is no solution on the horizon here.
2298480	2301040	If anybody asked me in the question and answer period,
2301040	2303280	what would I do to fix this problem?
2303280	2305000	I could tell you what the answer is now.
2305000	2306320	I have no idea.
2307560	2309160	Let's be very clear on this.
2309160	2311120	Categorically depressing.
2311120	2315360	But anyway, I think that from Israel's point of view,
2315360	2319520	what's happened to its reputation is disastrous
2319520	2322840	and I don't think it's gonna get any better over time.
2322840	2325760	So this is why these four reasons,
2325760	2330440	number one, the fact they're stuck in Gaza once more.
2330440	2333680	Number two, the fact that their deterrence has been weakened
2333680	2335960	because they don't have escalation dominance.
2335960	2340240	Number three, the fact that they're surrounded by adversaries
2340240	2343920	who loathe them, would like to destroy them
2343920	2348600	and who have increasing numbers of missiles and drones
2348600	2352120	that can cause them lots of trouble is bad news.
2352160	2356000	And number four, the pariah state argument.
2356000	2358040	Now let me conclude by talking briefly
2358040	2360640	about the United States and talking about Iran.
2361800	2364520	The United States is also a big loser here.
2365960	2368280	First of all, it's in our interest
2368280	2370600	to have peace in the Middle East.
2370600	2373200	First of all, we've been fighting so many wars.
2373200	2376280	The American public is just sick of all these wars.
2376280	2379720	The last thing we want are more wars in the Middle East.
2379720	2381440	Oh my God, a war against Iran.
2381440	2383840	This is the last thing people want, right?
2383840	2385120	We want peace.
2385120	2387320	Furthermore, we need a peaceful Middle East
2387320	2390560	so we can pivot to East Asia, right?
2390560	2392400	From the American point of view,
2392400	2395120	the most serious threat on the planet is China.
2395120	2397360	The United States has to contain China.
2397360	2399000	We have to pivot to Asia.
2399000	2402240	We can't pivot to Asia because we're pinned down in Ukraine
2402240	2406600	and now we're pinned down in the Middle East.
2406600	2408400	This is not good.
2408400	2413120	We want for sure to settle this one, right?
2413120	2417640	To have a situation like the one that existed
2417640	2419880	before October 7th.
2419880	2421800	Remember Jake Sullivan said a few weeks
2421800	2424640	before October 7th, we haven't seen the Middle East
2424640	2426480	this peaceful for a long time
2426480	2428640	and he was very happy about that
2428640	2431960	and it made perfect sense from an American point of view.
2431960	2435640	But that went away very quickly on October 7th.
2435640	2437200	So we want peace.
2437200	2442200	Second point is we also care greatly
2442320	2445200	about having friendly relations
2445200	2449000	with as many states in the Middle East as possible.
2449000	2450760	Why is that the case?
2450760	2454480	The Russians are already there, number one,
2454480	2457800	and two, the Chinese are beginning to move in.
2457800	2459800	For all the older dogs,
2459800	2462880	I noticed there are a number of older dogs in the audience.
2462880	2466600	We all remember back in the day, right?
2466600	2471600	When the US and the Soviet Union competed in the Middle East.
2472920	2476720	Well, what you're gonna see moving forward
2476720	2479200	is not just the United States and Russia,
2479200	2482040	but the United States, Russia and China
2482040	2484240	competing in the Middle East.
2484240	2486160	The Chinese are building a blue water navy
2486160	2489000	to project power into the Gulf, number one.
2489000	2492760	Number two, they depend heavily on oil
2492760	2495000	and therefore they're doing everything they can
2495000	2496680	to have good relations with Iran,
2496680	2499040	good relations with Saudi Arabia.
2499040	2502800	And we are very worried about this.
2502800	2506840	The United States doesn't want bad relations
2506840	2508160	with countries in the Middle East
2508160	2511880	that drive them into the arms of the Chinese and the Russians.
2511880	2513400	And you see a lot of that happening.
2513400	2516200	By the way, you all know about the Abraham Accords.
2516200	2520280	The Abraham Accords was where the United States
2520280	2524760	was recently trying to get Israel, Saudi Arabia,
2524760	2530000	and the United States all together in a sort of quasi-alliance.
2530000	2531800	This is all gone by the boards now
2531800	2534320	because of what's happening in Gaza, right?
2534320	2535480	This is not in our interest.
2535480	2537200	It's certainly not in Israel's interest
2537200	2541040	and it's certainly not in Saudi's interest at all, either.
2541040	2545320	So you see the problem that we have here,
2545320	2549800	just one other problem, and this applies to the Israelis as well,
2549800	2551320	is the nuclear issue.
2551320	2556320	You all understand Iran is hopskipping a jump away
2556320	2559240	from developing nuclear weapons
2559240	2562680	because we, with pressure from the Israelis,
2562680	2567120	we the Americans, pulled out of the JCPOA.
2567120	2568760	That was the nuclear agreement
2568760	2573640	that the Obama administration crafted with Iran.
2573640	2579280	The Iranians are now enriching uranium up to 60%.
2579280	2583560	And you have to enrich uranium up to 90%
2583560	2591120	to have it capable of being turned into a bomb.
2591120	2594600	And it's very easy to get from 60% to 90%.
2594600	2597680	My guess is, and just from reading the literature,
2597680	2601320	that Iran could have enough fissile material
2601320	2604720	for three bombs in about six weeks.
2604720	2605720	That's not a bomb.
2605720	2607240	That's just a fissile material.
2607240	2609240	I think it would take probably about six months
2609240	2610920	to build three bombs,
2610920	2614680	and then they'd have to develop the delivery capability.
2614680	2617280	So it's not like they're going to develop a bomb
2617280	2618680	in a month or two's time.
2618680	2622800	That's not going to happen, but they're not that far away.
2622800	2627240	And what happens when you bomb their embassy
2627240	2631280	and then you get in a tit for tat,
2631280	2635560	fight with them on April 14th and April 19th
2635600	2638840	is you give them an incentive to get nuclear weapons.
2638840	2641400	And you can see signs of that.
2641400	2643400	You can see signs of the Iranians
2643400	2645600	talking about getting nuclear weapons.
2645600	2648520	So one of the principal problems
2648520	2650240	that the Israelis and the Americans face
2650240	2654120	as a result of what happened between April 1st and April 19th
2654120	2658080	is we've incentivized the Iranians to get nuclear weapons.
2658080	2659600	Not that they'll go through with it,
2659600	2662520	but we've given them powerful incentive to do that,
2662520	2665120	and they have the capability
2665120	2668640	because they can enrich uranium up to 90%
2668640	2670960	and then produce bombs.
2670960	2674640	Just say a few words in conclusion, Tom, about Iran.
2674640	2677040	As I said to you before, I think Iran is the winner.
2677040	2678440	I think America's the loser.
2678440	2681040	I think Israel is the biggest loser.
2681040	2685720	But I think that the Iranians are the winners so far.
2685720	2689480	And this is not to say that they have really come out
2689480	2693200	of this smelling like a rose, as my mother used to say.
2693200	2694720	I don't want to go that far.
2694720	2698920	But on balance, I think they've done quite well for themselves.
2698920	2703280	First of all, they have been able, except for April 14th,
2703280	2706080	to remain on the sidelines.
2706080	2709440	And they are using their proxies in the region
2709440	2711640	or they're working with their proxies.
2711640	2714720	That's a better way to put it, to great effect.
2714720	2718960	Because as you know, the Iranians are allied with Hamas.
2718960	2720680	They're allied with Hezbollah.
2720680	2722400	They're allied with the Houthis.
2722480	2727480	And they're allied with these militias inside of Iraq and Syria
2727480	2730600	that have their gun sights not only on the United States,
2730600	2734080	but on Israel as well.
2734080	2739120	So they have been able to stay out of the fight,
2739120	2745240	yet see their proxies do very well in this conflict
2745240	2752080	with both the United States and Israel.
2752080	2754880	Another point that you want to keep in mind
2754880	2759360	is that Iran, as a result of all this,
2759360	2763160	now has very close relations with Russia and China.
2763160	2766200	What we're doing, what the United States is doing,
2766200	2769520	is we're driving the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese,
2769520	2773440	and the North Koreans together.
2773440	2777200	This makes it harder for us to isolate Iran.
2777200	2781040	And if Iran starts to go down the nuclear road, nuclear weapons
2781400	2784200	road, and we want to put pressure on the Iranians,
2784200	2786000	it's not clear the Chinese and the Russians
2786000	2787600	are going to help us very much.
2787600	2790880	We need the Chinese and the Russians to help us.
2790880	2793280	But anyway, the Iranians feel like they're
2793280	2796760	in quite a good situation, because the United States
2796760	2799240	and the Israelis have not been able to do anything
2799240	2801080	to really harm them.
2801080	2804000	In fact, Iran got away with whacking Israel.
2804000	2806640	This is the first time that Iran has ever
2806640	2810840	been able to launch missiles and drones from its own territory,
2810840	2814600	hit Israel, and Israel barely retaliated.
2814600	2817760	Iranians are probably feeling good about that, as they should.
2820600	2824080	And then the final point is the sanctions against Iran
2824080	2826800	are not working the way they once were.
2826800	2828600	They have weakened.
2828600	2833200	So if you look overall at what's happened to the Iranians
2833200	2835920	and what's happening to the Americans,
2835920	2839160	and especially what's happening to the Israelis,
2839240	2843240	you see that the situation after October 7th
2843240	2846560	is fundamentally different than the situation
2846560	2849160	before October 7th.
2849160	2852120	Just in the case of the Israelis, before October 7th,
2852120	2854520	it looked like they were in the cat bird seat.
2854520	2858720	They were managing very well in their own opinion
2858720	2860440	the situation in Gaza.
2860440	2861920	And by the way, I want to be clear here.
2861920	2864840	I thought they were doing an excellent job
2864840	2867040	of managing the problem in Gaza.
2867040	2869160	I thought they had things under control.
2869160	2872920	I was shocked by what happened on October 7th.
2872920	2876160	But once October 7th happened, and as we've watched
2876160	2878720	these two conflicts play themselves out,
2878720	2883720	one, the war in Gaza, and how that's linked to Hezbollah,
2884000	2886240	you don't want to forget, and then two,
2886240	2890440	the Iran-Israel-United States exchange
2890440	2893040	between April 1st and April 19th.
2893040	2896080	It's quite clear that the world has changed
2896080	2899960	in ways that are not good for either Israel
2899960	2901520	or the United States.
2901520	2903360	Thank you.
2903360	2904320	Welcome back to CIS.
2904320	2906640	It's great to have you back.
2906640	2908480	Notwithstanding all those points you made
2908480	2912880	about escalation dominance and the fact that the Israelis
2912880	2917360	are now bogged down in Gaza, aren't you overstating
2917360	2920200	your point about Israel's grim security outlook?
2920200	2922360	After all, it's not declared,
2922360	2924840	but they do have nuclear weapons.
2924840	2927080	And as a foreign policy realist,
2927080	2929480	you would surely concede that nuclear weapons
2929480	2932840	are the ultimate deterrent to a foreign attack.
2932840	2934480	So are you being overly gloomy
2934480	2936680	about Israel's security outlook?
2938720	2941320	I think there's no question, as Tom points out,
2941320	2945120	that nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent.
2945120	2949360	And I don't think any country with nuclear weapons
2949400	2952320	is gonna disappear from the planet
2952320	2955560	because another country attacks it.
2955560	2958680	I think that no country would try to inflict
2958680	2963680	a decisive defeat on Israel because it has nuclear weapons.
2968280	2973280	But the problem is that Israel has an internal problem.
2974280	2978280	See, Tom's point about nuclear weapons applies
2978280	2982280	if you're talking about Iran hitting Israel.
2982280	2986280	It's an interstate problem, okay?
2986280	2991280	But Hamas is not another country.
2991280	2995280	Hamas is inside greater Israel.
2995280	3000280	What Hamas is doing is executing a rebellion
3003280	3008280	or executing an insurrection.
3008320	3011920	And nuclear weapons don't do anything for you
3011920	3013680	in that regard.
3013680	3015720	To take this a step further,
3015720	3019160	we've talked a little bit just briefly about South Africa
3019160	3022840	and the fact that South Africa was an apartheid state.
3022840	3025440	And basically that state that existed,
3025440	3028360	apartheid South Africa, disappeared.
3028360	3030600	That state had nuclear weapons.
3030600	3032600	South Africa had nuclear weapons.
3032720	3034240	And what you wanna understand,
3034240	3037000	and this is very important in the Israeli context,
3037000	3041000	is that what's happening inside your society,
3041000	3046000	inside your body politic matters enormously.
3046160	3049920	And nuclear weapons can't do much to protect you.
3049920	3052040	You see what I'm saying?
3052040	3055000	But I don't wanna take away from his basic point
3055000	3057840	that nuclear weapons do provide deterrence
3057840	3060720	against Iran getting nuclear weapons or...
3061680	3064080	Well, I mean, many scholars would still argue
3064080	3066600	that the security outlook for Israel
3066600	3068400	is not as grim as you point out,
3068400	3070840	not just because of their access to nuclear weapons.
3070840	3071680	Let me put this to you.
3071680	3074640	This is Fareed Zakaria, a CNN host
3074640	3076760	who's also a columnist at the Washington Post.
3076760	3078760	Now, admittedly, he said this before October 7,
3078760	3079680	but let me put this to you.
3079680	3081400	This is what he says.
3081400	3085000	First, there is the disappearance of the Arab threat.
3085000	3087400	From its first day in existence,
3087440	3091640	Israel has faced the danger of extinction by Arab armies.
3091640	3094160	This is the threat against which the Jewish state
3094160	3099080	has planned, armed and trade for most of its national life.
3099080	3101080	Today, that threat is gone.
3101080	3103840	Second, the armies from Israel's main strategic
3103840	3107640	adversaries, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, historically,
3107640	3110680	they're in disarray while the Israeli armed forces
3110680	3112760	have become the region's superpower
3112760	3114560	in a league ahead of the rest.
3114560	3116720	How would you respond to Fareed Zakaria?
3116720	3123840	He's right in that sense that those traditional adversaries
3123840	3126160	have effectively disappeared.
3126160	3132200	When I was young and the 1956 war took place, the 1967 war
3132200	3136160	took place, the 1973 war took place,
3136160	3138920	these were all conflicts that involved Israel
3138920	3141120	up against Arab states.
3141120	3146320	And by the way, in 1948, when Israel got its independence,
3146320	3151400	May 14, 1948, yesterday was Israeli Independence Day.
3151400	3153480	But it's an anniversary.
3153480	3157160	Yeah, but there's no question that the Israelis fought wars
3157160	3159960	in 1948 against.
3159960	3161240	That's his point.
3161240	3163360	But that's not the threat anymore.
3163360	3166480	There's a whole new set of threats called Hamas,
3166480	3170440	called Hezbollah, called the Houthis.
3170440	3173720	But aren't we seeing a broader trend in the Middle East
3173720	3176320	between the Iranian-backed Shia proxies
3176320	3181480	that you just mentioned, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels,
3181480	3185160	versus Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Gulf states?
3185160	3186440	Isn't that the broader issue?
3186440	3189640	And doesn't that, to the extent that is true, help Israel?
3189640	3191600	Because you've got a civil war, essentially,
3191600	3193800	in the Muslim community in the Arab world.
3193800	3198400	How does it help Israel solve the Gaza problem?
3198400	3201840	Explain to me how that helps Israel solve the Gaza problem.
3201840	3203800	And while you're at it, explain to me
3203800	3208600	how it helps solve the missile problem that Hezbollah, Hamas,
3208600	3212560	and the Houthis, and Iran present to Israel.
3212560	3216520	You, like former president Jimmy Carter and the university,
3216520	3217560	we've got time for questions.
3217560	3218560	I want to get through it.
3218560	3225760	You've called tonight Israel in a partite state.
3225760	3226920	It can't Palestinian vote.
3231840	3235800	It's important to understand that there are basically
3235800	3239600	three groups of Palestinians, the Palestinians, obviously,
3239600	3242200	in Gaza, who we talked about tonight,
3242200	3245280	the Palestinians in the West Bank,
3245280	3247600	and then the Palestinians inside of what's
3247600	3249040	called Green Line Israel.
3249040	3254520	That was the Israel that existed up until the 1967 war,
3254520	3260560	before they captured those two territories.
3260560	3266520	And when I say there are 7.3 million Palestinians
3266520	3269560	in greater Israel, that includes the Palestinians
3269560	3272400	in all three of those areas.
3272400	3275680	The only Palestinians who can vote
3275680	3280440	are the Palestinians in Green Line Israel.
3280440	3287120	The Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot vote.
3287120	3288360	That's one point.
3288360	3293040	The second point is the Palestinians in Israel
3293040	3295520	do not have equal rights.
3295520	3297680	There's no question they can vote,
3297680	3299520	but they don't have equal rights.
3299520	3302240	That's why I always argue that Israel
3302240	3304840	is not a liberal democracy.
3304840	3308440	If you want to argue Israel is a democracy,
3308440	3309680	you can make that argument.
3309680	3312760	I would even fight with you there because of the West Bank
3312760	3313280	in Gaza.
3313280	3317440	But let me say I'll give you that, that it is a democracy.
3317440	3319480	You can't make the argument that Israel
3319480	3324160	is a liberal democracy because the Palestinians don't
3324160	3328280	have equal rights inside Green Line Israel.
3328280	3330880	This is the principal reason, in my opinion,
3330880	3333760	that Israel does not have a constitution.
3333760	3336040	They've moved in that direction a couple of times,
3336040	3338480	but they can't go too far down that road
3338480	3341400	because they don't want equal rights.
3341400	3345400	They want a Jewish state, not a state
3345400	3349440	where Palestinians and Jews are equal in number
3349440	3351080	and have equal rights.
3351080	3353400	OK, but your critics, and they're not just Jewish leaders,
3353400	3354920	a lot of people in this room, presumably,
3354920	3358080	would say it's a stretch to compare Israel today
3358080	3362000	to the old, racist South Africa of the SDU.
3362000	3364560	And this is the late Les Gilb, someone
3364560	3367200	you knew, the former president of the New York
3367200	3369120	Base Council on Foreign Relations,
3369120	3371680	quote, the US is helping to protect
3371680	3373760	one of the few nations in the world
3373800	3377520	that share American values and interests, a true democracy.
3377520	3379480	And this is Richard Cohen, a longtime columnist
3379480	3381600	of The Washington Post.
3381600	3384840	The Israel of today and the South Africa of yesterday
3384840	3386760	have almost nothing in common.
3386760	3390080	In South Africa, the minority white population
3390080	3393640	harshly ruled the majority black population.
3393640	3395880	Non-whites were denied civil rights.
3395880	3399640	And in 1958, they were even deprived of citizenship.
3399640	3402320	Cohen goes on to say, in contrast,
3402320	3405280	Israeli Arabs, about one-fifth of the country,
3405280	3409800	have the same civil and political rights as Israeli Jews.
3409800	3412880	Arabs sit in the Knesset and serve in the military,
3412880	3415080	although most are exempt from the draft.
3415080	3418000	And Cohen concludes, whatever this is,
3418000	3420640	and it looks suspiciously like a liberal democracy,
3420640	3422240	it cannot be apartheid.
3422240	3425320	Again, your response to the likes of Les Gilb and Richard Cohen.
3425320	3427560	Just very quickly, they don't have equal rights.
3427560	3430840	This is the Palestinians who live inside Green Line Israel.
3430840	3434320	They simply don't have equal rights.
3434320	3436880	And what about the Palestinians in Gaza
3436880	3438640	and the Palestinians in the West Bank?
3438640	3441600	This is all part of Greater Israel.
3441600	3445200	But let me make a couple of points in addition to that.
3445200	3448400	First of all, whether Israel is an apartheid state
3448400	3451800	is not based on any comparison with South Africa.
3451800	3455800	You have to come up with what is a definition of apartheid.
3455800	3459000	And then you have to look at what's happening inside of Israel
3459040	3462200	and see whether it meets that definition.
3462200	3464000	There's no question that there are differences,
3464000	3465600	and I'll get to this in a second,
3465600	3469840	between apartheid in South Africa and apartheid in Israel.
3469840	3471160	But the question is,
3471160	3475200	what are the general characteristics of an apartheid regime
3475200	3478560	and does Israel fill the bill?
3478560	3482680	Now, as I told you before, if you have any doubts about this,
3482680	3486760	there are huge reports written by Human Rights Watch,
3486760	3488800	Amnesty International and Bet-Salon,
3488800	3492640	which is the leading human rights group inside of Israel,
3492640	3497640	laying out the case as to why Israel is an apartheid state.
3498440	3503440	And I think those three reports make a very powerful case.
3504280	3509280	My final point to you is there are a number
3510760	3515760	of South Africans who lived under apartheid in South Africa,
3516600	3521600	including South African Jews and including Bishop Tutu,
3524160	3529160	who make the argument that the apartheid system in Israel
3529880	3534880	is worse than the apartheid system in South Africa.
3535560	3538600	Let's turn to Rafa, the Southern city in Gaza.
3538600	3540960	Now, the Israeli leadership seems to believe
3540960	3544120	that a full-scale ground military invasion
3545120	3548000	of Rafa will finish the job of eliminating Hamas.
3548000	3550160	You've said that that's not realistic.
3550160	3554080	Now, your critics would say that with its gleeful mutilations,
3554080	3557720	its rampages, its rapes and beheadings,
3557720	3562720	its baby killing on October 7, Hamas needs crushing.
3563080	3566920	And if Hamas keeps control of Rafa and the people, it wins.
3567920	3572920	The Israelis may believe that Hamas needs to be crushed.
3573680	3577320	And you can understand, given what happened on October 7,
3577320	3581800	why they feel that way, they're not going to crush Hamas.
3581800	3585480	And if you read the newspapers carefully every day,
3585480	3589160	you will see that Hamas has come back to life
3589160	3594160	in northern Gaza and the Israelis have now sent military forces
3594160	3598160	into northern Gaza to deal with Hamas.
3598160	3602160	The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal today
3602160	3606160	have articles dealing with the fact that Hamas
3606160	3609160	is almost impossible to defeat.
3609160	3611160	They're just not going to defeat them.
3611160	3615160	This is why I said to you, ethnic cleansing is so attractive
3615160	3616160	to the Israelis.
3616160	3620160	Ethnic cleansing solves the apartheid problem.
3620160	3623160	What Tom was challenging me on a minute ago
3624160	3628160	and it solves the Hamas problem which he's challenging me on now.
3637160	3640160	Many democratic legislators who have traditionally
3640160	3644160	been very supportive of Israel have called on Netanyahu
3644160	3645160	to be replaced.
3646160	3650160	To what extent would things change in Gaza
3651160	3654160	and the Israeli military operation in Gaza
3654160	3658160	if Netanyahu is replaced as many democratic lawmakers
3658160	3660160	and indeed Brett Stevens at the New York Times
3660160	3663160	has called for Netanyahu to be removed?
3663160	3665160	How would things change?
3665160	3666160	Not at all.
3667160	3670160	This is an argument that I hear in the United States
3670160	3672160	and it's made by liberal American Jews,
3672160	3674160	people like Tom Friedman.
3674160	3675160	At the New York Times?
3675160	3677160	Yeah, at the New York Times.
3677160	3682160	People who believe that Netanyahu is an anomaly
3683160	3685160	and if we can only get rid of him
3685160	3687160	and replace him with Thomas Jefferson
3687160	3689160	or somebody like that,
3689160	3692160	Israel will live happily ever after.
3693160	3696160	This is a foolish argument, right?
3696160	3701160	It's quite clear that Netanyahu and his war cabinet
3701160	3706160	and most of the national security elite in Israel today
3706160	3711160	agree with Israeli policy under Netanyahu.
3711160	3715160	So it wouldn't change anything.
3715160	3718160	It would change hardly anything.
3718160	3722160	Now you say Israel has had Iran in its sights for a long time,
3722160	3725160	but isn't it true that Iran's sheer theocracy
3725160	3728160	has also had Israel in its sights for a long time?
3728160	3730160	After all, many of their leaders have declared
3730160	3733160	the eradication of Israel off the face of the map.
3733160	3740160	Look, there's no question that Iran
3740160	3744160	considers Israel to be a mortal enemy
3744160	3748160	and would like to do away with the Jewish state
3748160	3753160	the same way Hezbollah would like to do away with the Jewish state.
3753160	3755160	So there's no question about that.
3755160	3758160	And there's no question that the Israelis
3758160	3761160	hate the Iranians or hate Iran
3761160	3766160	and it's a case of mutual hatred,
3766160	3768160	mutual dislike, call it what you want.
3768160	3769160	There's no question about it.
3769160	3772160	Who is responsible for starting this?
3772160	3775160	The implication of your question was that
3775160	3779160	it is Iran that's responsible, not Israel.
3779160	3781160	What we'll say later is that talk about this,
3781160	3784160	about eradicating Israel off the face of the earth.
3784160	3785160	It's pretty provocative, isn't it?
3785160	3786160	I agree.
3786160	3788160	That's correct, but I'm just saying
3788160	3790160	it's not clear that they started it.
3790160	3793160	You want to remember that Iran once had very good relations
3793160	3796160	with Israel, once had very good relations
3796160	3799160	with the United States, and that even in the 1990s
3799160	3803160	the Iranians were interested in improving relations
3803160	3804160	with the United States.
3804160	3807160	And one could make an argument that if you had gotten
3807160	3812160	a two-state solution that Iran would have reconciled itself
3812160	3814160	to dealing with this problem.
3814160	3817160	So we haven't talked much about the two-state solution
3817160	3821160	in large part because I sort of took it off the table early on.
3821160	3825160	But it's very important to understand that every American president
3825160	3829160	since Jimmy Carter has pushed hard on the two-state solution
3829160	3832160	because we think the two-state solution,
3832160	3835160	we meaning American elites, think the two-state solution
3835160	3842160	is the only reasonable way to get out of this conundrum.
3842160	3846160	What has to be done here is that the Palestinians
3846160	3850160	have to be given self-determination.
3850160	3853160	They need a sovereign state of their own.
3853160	3857160	And this is what the two-state solution was designed to do.
3857160	3861160	And American leaders understood that if the Israelis
3861160	3864160	did not agree to a two-state solution
3864160	3867160	and you did not get a two-state solution,
3867160	3870160	you were going to have trouble for as far as the eye can see.
3870160	3874160	You all understand, maybe the younger people in the audience don't,
3874160	3878160	but what happened on October 7th is really not an anomaly.
3878160	3882160	There was the first intifada, then there was the second intifada.
3882160	3883160	Late 80s and early 2000s.
3883160	3884160	Pardon?
3884160	3885160	Late 80s and the early 2000s.
3885160	3888160	Yes, 1987 was the first intifada
3888160	3891160	and 2000 was the second intifada.
3891160	3894160	And these were, you know, Palestinian insurrections.
3894160	3896160	But, John, you could get a two-state solution
3896160	3898160	with the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank,
3898160	3901160	but Hamas has made it very clear as a user of your knowledge
3901160	3903160	that they don't support a two-state solution.
3903160	3904160	Absolutely.
3904160	3907160	There's no question about that.
3907160	3909160	I just want to be very clear here.
3909160	3912160	This gets back to my point that Netanyahu was playing
3912160	3914160	divide and conquer, right?
3914160	3919160	Netanyahu had quite good relations with Hamas before October 7th
3919160	3923160	because Hamas doesn't want a two-state solution
3923160	3926160	and Netanyahu doesn't want a two-state solution.
3926160	3928160	And from Netanyahu's point of view,
3928160	3932160	the real threat was Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority.
3932160	3936160	And you notice, by the way, that the Americans have been saying
3936160	3939160	that what we need to do in Gaza
3939160	3943160	is put the Palestinian Authority in control,
3943160	3945160	get Hamas out of the way,
3945160	3949160	and put the Palestinian Authority in control.
3949160	3953160	Netanyahu has made it unequivocally clear this is not happening,
3953160	3956160	and that's because the Palestinian Authority
3956160	3960160	has reconciled itself to a two-state solution,
3960160	3964160	and that's nightmare news for Netanyahu.
3964160	3969160	You say that Tehran's hand has been strengthened during this dispute,
3969160	3971160	but let me put this to you.
3971160	3976160	Iran is surrounded by hostile Sunni states across the Persian Gulf,
3976160	3978160	since Saudi Arabia.
3978160	3981160	It's fanatically anti-sheer and well-armed arch enemy.
3981160	3984160	In Iraq and Syria, at least until recently,
3984160	3989160	you had Iran facing large Sunni insurgencies
3989160	3992160	dedicated to slaughtering the Shia.
3992160	3995160	Then there's the internal unrest within Iran.
3995160	3998160	A lot of younger people, a lot of younger Iranians
3998160	4002160	take a more liberal view about the world and their parents
4002160	4006160	and certainly the Shia clerical regime.
4006160	4011160	So are you overlooking Iran's real weaknesses and limitations?
4011160	4015160	Well, he only gave me 50 minutes to talk.
4016160	4021160	If he had been willing to fulfill my request
4021160	4024160	to be able to talk for two hours,
4024160	4027160	I would have qualified my argument somewhat.
4027160	4032160	There's absolutely no question that Iran has significant problems,
4032160	4036160	but the thing you want to remember about Iran
4036160	4041160	is that Iran is much more powerful than all of its neighbors.
4041160	4044160	It has a very large population,
4044160	4049160	and the human capital inside of Iran is very impressive.
4049160	4053160	And if you were to look at the potential balance of power
4053160	4055160	between Iran and Saudi Arabia,
4055160	4059160	if they were both able to mobilize all their resources,
4059160	4062160	it's a Bambi versus Godzilla situation.
4062160	4067160	That's why the Saudis are so interested in the Abraham Accord.
4067160	4071160	The Saudis want to jump into bed with the Israelis and the Americans
4071160	4077160	because the Saudis understand that the Iranians have a lot of potential power.
4077160	4080160	Whenever you want to measure the power of a country,
4080160	4082160	the two things that you go to,
4082160	4086160	number one are population size and number two are wealth.
4086160	4088160	Number two is wealth.
4088160	4090160	Wealth and population size.
4090160	4093160	And if you look at the Iranian situation,
4093160	4096160	they are potentially a very powerful country,
4096160	4100160	which is not to take away from your points about the problems that they face.
4100160	4102160	Now it's time for question time.
4102160	4107160	And please, I encourage you to try to keep your questions short of the mind.
4107160	4110160	But also, feel free to ask about not just the Middle East,
4110160	4112160	but also Ukraine and China,
4112160	4115160	about which John has spoken in great detail.
4115160	4117160	First question.
4117160	4120160	You've talked about how Israel now stuck in Gaza.
4120160	4123160	Do you see similar trap for the US,
4123160	4126160	or do they have a path forward and out of this?
4126160	4131160	Well, the United States is not going into Gaza, right?
4131160	4134160	I mean, we're not putting forces in there.
4134160	4137160	But we are joined at the hip with Israel.
4137160	4140160	We have this special relationship
4140160	4145160	so that as long as Israel is bogged down in Gaza
4145160	4148160	and having all sorts of problems,
4148160	4152160	both in terms of dealing with the Palestinians
4152160	4155160	and dealing with the wider world,
4155160	4158160	it has huge consequences for us.
4158160	4162160	We end up vetoing Security Council resolutions
4162160	4164160	that we don't want to veto.
4164160	4169160	It ends up poisoning our relations with the Egyptians and the Jordanians.
4169160	4174160	So there are all sorts of spin-off consequences for us that are negative.
4174160	4178160	And this is why the Biden administration, to its credit,
4178160	4182160	is deeply committed to trying to figure out how to solve this one.
4182160	4186160	As I said before, we'd like Mahmoud Abbas to come in, take over.
4186160	4190160	Then we can get the rich Arab countries to pour money in.
4190160	4193160	We can rebuild Gaza and live happily ever after.
4193160	4194160	That's what we want to do,
4194160	4198160	because this is not in our interest to let this go on.
4198160	4203160	But the problem we face is we can't get the Israelis to go along with us.
4203160	4206160	This is well documented.
4206160	4210160	And the end result is, you know, no end to trouble,
4210160	4212160	certainly for the Israelis, but even for us.
4212160	4214160	Next question. Yes, sir.
4214160	4216160	Thanks, John Lachlan McIntyre.
4216160	4219160	Since Australia's security depends on the United States,
4219160	4224160	do we have no option but to take sides in Gaza and Ukraine?
4224160	4227160	Meaning Australia.
4227160	4232160	I'm not sure what taking sides means.
4232160	4238160	If you're talking about Hamas versus Israel,
4238160	4245160	that's very different than talking about the Palestinians versus Israel.
4245160	4252160	In other words, I know lots of people who loathe Hamas and hope Israel destroys it,
4252160	4256160	who are very sympathetic to the Palestinians,
4256160	4261160	who believe that Israel is committing genocide.
4261160	4266160	So I would argue you can take the side of the Palestinians
4266160	4270160	if you are an Australian,
4270160	4275160	and you can make the argument that that's in Israel's interest.
4275160	4281160	People who've argued for a two-state solution have long argued that's in Israel's interest.
4281160	4285160	That's the solution. That's the argument.
4285160	4289160	But if it's a choice between Hamas and Israel,
4289160	4295160	Australia, certainly the government and most people who operate in the foreign policy establishment,
4295160	4298160	they have no choice but to side with Israel against Hamas.
4298160	4300160	Next question, John Connor.
4300160	4310160	Yes, part of your proposition essentially is that there is no support in Israel for a two-state solution.
4310160	4316160	Now, I know that there's an organisation which, membership of which is confined to people
4316160	4322160	who've been the rank of major or above in one of the four Israeli defence and intelligence institutions.
4322160	4326160	That has consistently argued, I've not checked since October,
4326160	4331160	but has consistently argued in favour of a two-state solution while recognising it's difficult.
4331160	4337160	I really think that that is in fact a reflection of at least the views of a significant part
4337160	4343160	of the Israeli intelligence and military establishment prior to October 7.
4343160	4347160	Now, given that and sufficient pressure from the US and otherwise,
4348160	4356160	may require transfers of population through Gaza and the 500,000 settlers in the West Bank, Israeli settlers,
4356160	4363160	but surely there must be some degree you may be pushing on an open door in trying to arrive at that solution.
4363160	4367160	With all due respect, I don't agree with you on that.
4367160	4375160	I think there are a handful of people in the Israeli establishment who are in favour of a two-state solution,
4375160	4381160	but they're small in number and the elites who...
4381160	4385160	Sorry, that organisation includes the heads of all of those four,
4385160	4388160	previous heads of all of those four organisations, various of them.
4388160	4392160	Still a small number. I believe there's no evidence.
4392160	4398160	Furthermore, the Israelis are not going to agree to a two-state solution after what happened on October 7.
4398160	4406160	You're going to create a viable Palestinian state that has weapons of its own on your border.
4406160	4414160	You've not defeated Hamas. You've just suffered this devastating defeat on October 7.
4414160	4416160	It's just not going to happen.
4416160	4418160	Okay, next question, Tony, and then we'll go to Antoinette.
4418160	4425160	I'd like to just push on this two-state solution a bit further, and really as you as a realist.
4425160	4438160	Basically, you said that a greater Israel with the West Bank and Gaza in it as a democratic state is off the table.
4438160	4440160	I think everybody can understand that.
4440160	4446160	I think that ethnic cleansing is off the table because it's not going to happen.
4446160	4451160	Nobody's going to allow Israel to do that, and I'm not even sure that Israel wants to do that.
4451160	4459160	So you are driven back to the two-state solution, and I'm sort of intrigued as a realist why you're not embracing that.
4459160	4470160	And can I just push you on? Can't the United States really use its influence to create that solution coming out of this?
4470160	4480160	Look, I hope that I'm wrong, and the two-state solution is a viable alternative.
4480160	4487160	The Israelis wake up and smell the coffee, and the Americans do what you described.
4487160	4495160	I've been wrong before, and if there's an issue, I'd like to be wrong on moving forward.
4495160	4497160	This is the issue.
4497160	4507160	So in spirit, I'm with you, but I don't think, as I said to the gentleman on your right,
4507160	4515160	that there is much enthusiasm for a two-state solution before October 7th inside of Israel,
4515160	4522160	and certainly now, and public opinion is against the two-state solution as well as elite opinion.
4522160	4531160	And furthermore, with regard to the United States putting pressure on Israel, Steve Walt and I wrote this book on the Israel lobby.
4531160	4532160	Steve Walt from Harvard University.
4532160	4533160	Yeah.
4533160	4536160	Steve Walt, who teaches at Harvard, he and I wrote the book on the Israel lobby,
4536160	4542160	and there's no way any American government can put significant pressure on Israel.
4542160	4549160	Well, you say that, but the Reagan administration put pressure on Israel and Prime Minister Begin when they invited southern Lebanon.
4549160	4551160	This is the New York Times.
4551160	4554160	I think this was just a few days ago.
4554160	4562160	They quoted, this is the quote, Mr. Reagan used the power of U.S. arms several times to influence Israeli war policy at different points,
4562160	4566160	including war planes, custom munitions to be delayed or withheld.
4566160	4571160	And of course, Joe Biden has recently withheld the support of three and a half thousand bombs to Israel.
4571160	4574160	So, so much for the Israel lobby.
4574160	4576160	No.
4576160	4577160	No.
4577160	4595160	I mean, there you could point to one or two instances back in the distant past where the United States put some pressure on Israel and the Reagan administration in 1982.
4595160	4596160	Yeah.
4596160	4599160	That was President Bosnia with the settlements.
4599160	4600160	He failed.
4600160	4601160	He failed.
4601160	4602160	It went nowhere.
4602160	4603160	Right.
4603160	4605160	No president has been able to put me.
4605160	4609160	Joe Biden is not going to put meaningful pressure on the lobby.
4609160	4616160	Joe Biden, you understand Joe Biden wants to win the election this coming November.
4616160	4625160	And if Joe Biden gets tough on Israel, you'll see what Brett, you'll have Brett Stevens asked here.
4625160	4627160	Ask Brett Stevens.
4627160	4634160	He wrote a big column as soon as soon as Joe Biden told Israel he was holding up these extra bombs.
4634160	4638160	That they really didn't need anyway, because they've got so many bombs.
4638160	4647160	As soon as that happened, Brett Stevens had a column and all sorts of supporters of Israel told Joe Biden in no uncertain terms.
4647160	4652160	You want to remember you're up for reelection and we won't forget.
4652160	4661160	And of course, the problem that Biden faces is you all know is that Arab Americans and many others are going to punish Biden.
4661160	4672160	Well, the running joke around Jerusalem is that having been strongly supportive of Netanyahu after October 7, Joe Biden is seriously invested in the two-state solution, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
4672160	4675160	Okay, Antoinette.
4675160	4676160	Antoinette.
4676160	4679160	I have two questions, but I'll make them very, very quick.
4679160	4684160	Firstly, you said a couple of times that Israel is stuck in Gaza.
4684160	4685160	They can't get out.
4685160	4689160	Can you be more specific about why they are stuck and why they can't withdraw?
4689160	4698160	And my second question in all the decades that you have been following this conflict, the situation closely, where do you think Israel is currently?
4698160	4708160	You said that, you know, reputationally, politically, they're losing, but specifically in regards to the information war and their ability to put out disinformation.
4708160	4715160	We've got headed babies and people being baked and widespread sexual violence.
4715160	4724160	Do you think that this is different in terms of people's willingness, the broader public or the greater West's willingness to believe?
4724160	4725160	Yeah.
4725160	4726160	Okay.
4726160	4730160	These are two great questions, as are all the other questions for sure.
4730160	4738160	But just on the first, the first question is why are the Israelis or why am I saying the Israelis are stuck in Gaza?
4738160	4743160	Well, they have said they're not leaving Gaza, right?
4743160	4752160	They're going to stay there and they understand it is a choice, but they decided to stay.
4752160	4760160	I mean, I said they're stuck in Gaza and I just said that's because they decided to stay there.
4760160	4762160	I mean, it may be a choice.
4762160	4765160	You might not like the choice, but that's the choice they made.
4765160	4769160	And you want to remember they've not defeated Hamas number one.
4769160	4772160	And number two, there's the question, who's going to run the place?
4772160	4773160	Right.
4773160	4775160	So they're going to stay.
4775160	4779160	How they do this remains to be seen.
4779160	4786160	How many troops they leave, where those troops are deployed, how those troops act, that remains to be seen, but they're stuck.
4786160	4788160	Second question is a very interesting question.
4788160	4793160	It's all about controlling the narrative.
4793160	4800160	The Israelis controlled the narrative in really powerful ways up until the late 1980s.
4800160	4812160	Then you had this group of historians in Israel called the new historians who were then young at the time, and they got access to the archives.
4812160	4820160	And they got access to the records on how Israel was created.
4820160	4829160	And what they did is they exploded all the myths or almost all the myths about how Israel was created.
4829160	4837160	And it really portrayed the Israelis in a negative light.
4837160	4842160	And that was the start of trouble.
4842160	4855160	And I could tell you all sorts of stories about that because people began to think differently about Israel than from the way we thought about when I was young.
4855160	4857160	There was a book by Leon Urus.
4857160	4860160	It was called Exodus, and everybody read it.
4860160	4861160	And it was a movie.
4861160	4864160	Paul Newman and even Marie Sainz starred in it.
4864160	4871160	And it portrayed the Israelis in a very positive light and the Arabs in a very negative light.
4871160	4881160	And once the new historians came along, all sorts of people, mainly at the elite level, began to think differently about the creation of Israel and Israel's behavior.
4881160	4889160	Then what happens is you get social media and you get the internet.
4889160	4901160	And Israel has huge influence in influencing what the Wall Street Journal, what the New York Times, what the Washington Post says.
4901160	4905160	But TikTok is a nightmare for Israel.
4905160	4907160	It's an utter nightmare.
4907160	4918160	There's this famous conversation that you can get on the internet of Jonathan Greenblatt, who is the head of the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL.
4918160	4921160	He's Abe Foxman's successor.
4921160	4926160	He's on the phone talking to somebody, and there's a video of it.
4926160	4928160	And he's talking about TikTok.
4928160	4932160	And it's just a disaster for Israel.
4932160	4933160	People see what's happening.
4934160	4937160	And the Israelis, this is really quite remarkable.
4937160	4948160	The Israelis are filming themselves doing absolutely horrible things to the Palestinians and then putting it on the internet.
4948160	4951160	It's just hard to believe.
4951160	4961160	And furthermore, just on the whole genocide story, you know, if you want to make the case that Israel is guilty of genocide,
4961160	4963160	you have to do two things.
4963160	4967160	You have to provide evidence of intent, number one.
4967160	4974160	And you have to provide evidence that Israel's actions are consistent with the intent.
4974160	4985160	Now, with regard to intent, the Israeli leaders across the board, including Benjamin Nant and Netanyahu, after October 7th,
4985160	4992160	said all sorts of things that, in my opinion, demonstrated genocidal intent.
4992160	4994160	This was documented in the South African case.
4994160	4996160	Yes, documented in the South African case.
4996160	5001160	And by the way, there was a piece in Haaretz, which is like the New York Times of Israel.
5001160	5003160	Is that left-leaning Israeli publication?
5003160	5005160	Yeah, liberal. I'd use the word liberal.
5005160	5007160	American liberal.
5007160	5009160	Yeah, American liberal.
5009160	5015160	But anyway, there was a piece in Haaretz, and the headline of the piece in Haaretz said,
5015160	5017160	The Road to the Hague.
5017160	5025160	This is the International Court of Justice decision on whether it's potentially genocide.
5025160	5029160	The Haaretz piece said, The Road to the Hague.
5029160	5030160	This is the headline.
5030160	5037160	The Road to the Hague is paved with public comments by Israeli leaders.
5037160	5038160	Which is exactly right.
5038160	5042160	You just sort of say to yourself, are they really saying these things?
5042160	5045160	And then again, you have all these videos.
5045160	5050160	And I was talking to my daughter one day, who's not very political at all.
5050160	5058160	She's in her 40s, and she was talking about watching what the Israelis are doing to children on TikTok.
5058160	5060160	And she said, I can't watch TikTok.
5060160	5062160	I just can't watch these videos anymore.
5062160	5064160	They're so horrible.
5064160	5066160	This is a disaster for Israel.
5066160	5068160	It's a public relations disaster.
5068160	5073160	John, we've been very happy to welcome students from Year 12.
5073160	5078160	So they're last year at high school from Ravenswood College, which is a prestigious school in Sydney.
5078160	5079160	We've got some students here.
5079160	5081160	We've got one school teacher I think wants to ask a question.
5081160	5085160	And they will also ask one of the students to ask a question if that's possible.
5085160	5086160	Sure.
5086160	5088160	Thanks for the talk.
5089160	5098160	You mentioned the winners and losers referring to the US, Iran and Israel of this war.
5098160	5106160	But I'm wondering, I'd like to hear what you feel will be the impact on the 7.4 million Palestinians,
5106160	5108160	the other party to the war in the long run.
5108160	5110160	Obviously they're suffering at the moment.
5110160	5114160	But my real question is really about the one state solution.
5114160	5124160	You said the options are a one state solution, two state solution, continued apartheid or ethnic cleansing.
5124160	5131160	For those of us that believe that ethnic cleansing and apartheid are not acceptable,
5131160	5138160	and that want to see the maintenance of international law, that leaves us with the one state or two state.
5138160	5144160	I think many experts are saying the two states not possible, given the patchwork of illegal settlements.
5144160	5154160	So what would have to change the future to bring about a one state solution?
5154160	5159160	You know, as I said, did everybody hear the question?
5159160	5163160	I don't have a good answer to that.
5163160	5172160	I mean, as I said to these two gentlemen on my left, I hope that I'm wrong and they're right about the possibility of a two state solution.
5172160	5182160	I think they're wrong, and as I make clear, and I don't think there's any way you're going to get a one state solution.
5182160	5189160	And I kind of don't, I don't fully understand where this train is headed, right?
5189160	5192160	I think Israel is in deep trouble.
5192160	5196160	I think the Israelis will continue to push at ethnic cleansing.
5196160	5198160	I think that's what you're going to see.
5198160	5206160	I think for the reasons I tried to elaborate here, that from their point of view seems to be the best solution.
5206160	5209160	I don't think they can get away with it.
5209160	5210160	I'm not 100% sure.
5210160	5212160	I hope they can't get away with it.
5212160	5215160	But where this all ends?
5215160	5224160	You know, it gets back to the brief discussion I was having with Tom when Tom said, oh, Israel has a nuclear weapon.
5224160	5226160	It's not going anywhere.
5226160	5235160	And you want to remember that South Africa had a nuclear weapon, as I reminded Tom, and apartheid South Africa disappeared.
5235160	5242160	The sort of long term future of Israel is in question for a lot of reasons.
5243160	5248160	Many of which I have not touched on tonight for time related reasons.
5248160	5256160	But you want to understand that immediately after October 7th, 500,000 Israelis left the country.
5256160	5260160	500,000 Israelis left Israel after October 7th?
5260160	5261160	Yeah.
5261160	5262160	Wow.
5262160	5272160	And it's, you know, I was talking to somebody who is in the Polish foreign policy establishment the other day.
5272160	5287160	And he was telling me, you'd be amazed at how many Israelis are applying for a Polish citizenship, so that they can have a Polish passport.
5287160	5291160	And the same is true with other European countries.
5291160	5301160	So you just, you don't, I don't want to get into the centrifugal forces that are at play inside of Israel, because it's too late in the evening.
5301160	5305160	But this is a country that just has lots of problems.
5305160	5308160	And where this all goes, I don't know.
5308160	5310160	Not least the demographic challenges.
5310160	5314160	Now, do we have a question from one of the students at Ravenswood?
5314160	5315160	Hello.
5315160	5319160	I'm a year 12 student at Ravenswood School for Girls.
5319160	5325160	The question that I want to ask is essentially looking at the US election.
5325160	5335160	How do you think the conflict in the Middle East and the impact of non-state actors will influence the result in the upcoming US election, which you touched on earlier in your talk?
5335160	5336160	Thank you.
5336160	5338160	I'm jealous of all you students.
5338160	5340160	You're so young.
5340160	5345160	It's depressing to think how old I am.
5345160	5347160	Yeah, it's a very interesting question.
5347160	5349160	What happens if Trump gets elected?
5349160	5356160	First of all, I think in terms of the Middle East and in terms of East Asia, it will have little effect.
5356160	5357160	Okay.
5357160	5365160	The interesting question is whether it will matter in Europe with regard to NATO and with regard to Putin.
5365160	5373160	As we all know from the last time around with Trump, he really wanted to throw NATO down the toilet bowl.
5373160	5375160	He has no use for NATO.
5375160	5381160	He thinks our European allies are freeloaders and he'd like to get rid of them.
5381160	5383160	And he likes Putin.
5383160	5385160	This is not surprising.
5385160	5388160	And he really wanted to have good relations with Putin.
5388160	5392160	He lost on both counts.
5392160	5398160	The blob or the deep state, whatever you want to call it, beat him back.
5398160	5404160	He is now determined if he wins to not let that happen again.
5404160	5415160	And he is number one going to bring in a whole group of seasoned individuals who served with him in the first term, who share his view of the world.
5415160	5423160	He didn't have those people available in 2017 when he moved in the White House, January 2017.
5423160	5433160	He now feels, and I think it's correct, that he can bring in a team of individuals and they collectively can beat back the deep state, number one.
5433160	5447160	And number two, at the Heritage Foundation, they're coming up with a plan for what to do once they move back into the White House in 2025.
5447160	5451160	So they're going to have the people, they're going to have the plan or the grand strategy.
5451160	5454160	And then the question is, can they make it work?
5454160	5464160	And again, my initial point to you is I think that where they will try to change things in a fundamental way is in Europe.
5464160	5477160	And the question you have to ask yourself is, do you think that Trump, even with all of the preparation that's now in train, do you think that Trump can beat the deep state?
5477160	5481160	I'm a structuralist, as some of you know, the students clearly know this.
5481160	5489160	I believe that structure really matters and it limits how much agency someone like Trump has.
5489160	5497160	So I'm betting on the deep state with regard to NATO and with regard to Europe.
5497160	5507160	And I think whether Trump or Biden wins, it won't matter that much on the foreign policy front.
5507160	5513160	I think the dais cast here, certainly in East Asia, I think the dais cast in the Middle East.
5513160	5515160	I mean, what's he going to do in the Middle East?
5515160	5518160	What's Trump going to do differently?
5518160	5523160	Well, the Republican Party is clearly more pro-Israel than the Democrat Party, correct?
5523160	5543160	Yeah, but even there, because of my point to Tony about the lobby, the Democratic Party is filled with people who are, especially among the younger Democrats, who are, I think it's fair to say, hostile to Israel at this point in time.
5543160	5554160	But the elites, the Democratic Party elites, the people who run the country, they're, you know, no different than the Republicans, right?
5554160	5556160	It's Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
5556160	5560160	And Joe Biden, it will be the Democrat.
5560160	5563160	If the Democrats win, it'll be Donald Trump of the Republicans.
5563160	5566160	And I just don't think you're going to get much difference.
5566160	5571160	Fortunately, we are running out of time, but I just want to conclude and make a few remarks about CIS.
5571160	5580160	One of our favorite quotes, you've heard me say this before, first from John Stuart Mill, the famous English liberal thinker of the 19th century.
5580160	5586160	He famously said, he who knows only his own position knows little of that.
5586160	5595160	And what that meant was, as my friend and mentor and former CIS senior fellow, Owen Harries, used to put it, and this is very relevant to the students in the room,
5595160	5605160	to take particular care to understand the position of your adversary and to understand it, not in a caricatured or superficial form,
5605160	5610160	but at its strongest for until you have rebutted it at its strongest, you have not rebutted it at all.
5610160	5618160	And this is a necessary condition for both developing your own position fully and attacking your opponents successfully.
5618160	5619160	That's the first quote.
5619160	5626160	My favorite quote at CIS is from the great 20th century public intellectual Walter Lippman, also a foreign policy realist.
5626160	5632160	And he said, we're all think alike, no one thinks very much.
5632160	5639160	Now, I think tonight we heard a strikingly different view from the one you'll hear in the Australian newspaper, the financial review,
5639160	5641160	the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph.
5641160	5645160	I only mentioned these papers because these are papers that you and I read regularly.
5645160	5653160	And I think it's fair to say that on behalf of our colleagues and board members here at CIS, John, we're very grateful for you being here,
5653160	5654160	putting forward the counterargument.
5654160	5656160	You'll hear from Brett Stevens in a month's time.
5656160	5659160	Please join me in thanking John Mishon.
5665160	5672160	For decades, CIS has been a fiercely independent voice working hard to promote sound liberal principles.
