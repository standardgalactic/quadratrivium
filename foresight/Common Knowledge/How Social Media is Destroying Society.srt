1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
I want you to start looking for something, and I promise you, once you start looking

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,760
for it, you'll never be able to stop seeing it everywhere you go.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,800
When's the last time you've walked into a restaurant and saw an entire table of friends

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,760
on their phone, or a group of people on the street, or maybe even your family in the morning,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,080
each content to be in their own world nearly unaware of the reality around them?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,240
If the majority of human interaction is non-verbal, what would happen if you removed everything

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,360
but that small remainder for over a decade?

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,800
As it turns out, that's the very experiment that we're living in today.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,040
I remember when I was growing up, way back in the day, a prehistoric time before everyone

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,360
had a cell phone and computers were named after the year they were made in.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,920
Okay, I'm not quite a dinosaur yet, but I grew up in a unique time where half of my

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,720
childhood was without the major technology and platforms that seemed to rule parts of

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,040
our lives today, and the other half of my childhood was rapidly slingshot into the new

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,600
age of technology.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,960
I remember from the earlier half of my childhood, life seemed different, especially human interaction.

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,840
If you wanted to talk with someone, you had no other option but to physically go out and

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
find them and spend uninterrupted time with them in the same room, and while you were

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,560
there, there was nothing pulling your attention away, nothing in the back of your mind reminding

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,280
you that there are hundreds of other people sharing information that you might be missing

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
out on.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,280
That degree of presence, practiced day in and day out, created a different richness to

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,600
human interaction, with intricacies and nuances that seems to be slowly and gradually lost,

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,880
the further we progress into this new age of technological advancement.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,520
And with the meteoric rise and popularity for documentaries like The Social Dilemma,

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,280
it's safe to say that this is a growing sentiment and realization within today's culture.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,600
The terrifying crux to the problem is actually quite simple.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,600
There's a massive mismatch between the rate of adaptation and advancement between our

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,400
biology and technology.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Because of the law of accelerating returns, the pace of advancement in information technology

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,960
is exponential, and while technology continues to grow at a rapid pace, we're left still

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,360
trying to figure out how it actually impacts us, especially when we're teaching algorithms

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,520
to predict and modulate our behavior.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,480
I don't think that anyone's denying that social media, as well as instant communication,

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,480
is extremely addictive, and its addiction falls right within the same symptoms as substance

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
abuse.

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,560
But what we don't quite know yet is how this addiction over time changes not only our behaviors

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,160
through hacking our positive reinforcement centers of the brain, but how over time it

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
changes our perception of reality itself.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,640
When we first embarked upon the social media experiment, we had far more in-person interactions

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,000
under our belt than we did interactions online, so we took our in-person frame of reference

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,280
and viewed all of our technological interactions through that lens.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,760
But now, in a time when we have hundreds, even thousands of friends, acquaintances, celebrities,

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,440
and online personalities that we keep up with online, we have slowly over time replaced

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,480
the majority of our interactions with being digital.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,840
How much do we now view our in-person interactions through our new digital lens?

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,280
As a prominent example, you can look at our growingly polarized political discourse in

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,280
modern times, and you see that we've already started to see the symptoms of a very binary

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
interpretation of human interaction.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,920
It's also worrisome to think that our upcoming generation's digital presence may end up

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,760
being more important than their in-person presence.

51
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,080
So how do we stop all of this from happening?

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Is the answer to shut it all down, just pull the plug on big tech?

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,960
I don't think that it is.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,920
The truth is, we've opened Pandora's box, and this is the reality that we're now faced

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
with.

56
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
So what's the path forward?

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,600
The first step is underway.

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Awareness.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,720
Much of classical conditioning, and if you don't know what that is, Pavlov's Dogs

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,720
might ring a bell, is based on the more non-conscious mechanisms of the brain.

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,440
If you become conscious of how the conditioning is affecting you, it gives you a degree of

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,840
control over your behavior.

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,760
Beyond that, it's important to maintain that balance of in-person and digital interaction.

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,960
You want the lens that you view the world from to be a full 100% of human communication.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,120
Body language, emotion, facial expression, nuanced tonality, it's what we were designed

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,120
to do, and we can't let that practice atrophy, because that's what creates our sense of

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,800
identity and community that gives us a healthy view of others in the world.

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,200
If we can maintain that balance, we can begin to have a healthier relationship with our

69
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,120
online presence, and retain control over the influence these platforms and technologies

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,560
have on us.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,840
These algorithms are based on human behavior and response, and that's something we have

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
control over.

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,160
Take some small steps today.

74
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Maybe start by uninstalling some social media platforms from your phone.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,160
Then you have to physically go log into your computer to use it, removing some of the convenience.

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,360
If you're tied to your phone for work, once the day is done, find some time to spend with

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,240
your family and friends, and turn your phone completely off for it, be fully present with

78
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,560
the people that you're with, and you just might notice that the world isn't quite as

79
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,000
crazy as it seems, and that the life right in front of you is beautiful.
