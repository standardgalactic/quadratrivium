0	4760	I want you to start looking for something, and I promise you, once you start looking
4760	9760	for it, you'll never be able to stop seeing it everywhere you go.
9760	13800	When's the last time you've walked into a restaurant and saw an entire table of friends
13800	18760	on their phone, or a group of people on the street, or maybe even your family in the morning,
18760	24080	each content to be in their own world nearly unaware of the reality around them?
24080	29240	If the majority of human interaction is non-verbal, what would happen if you removed everything
29240	32360	but that small remainder for over a decade?
32360	36800	As it turns out, that's the very experiment that we're living in today.
36800	42040	I remember when I was growing up, way back in the day, a prehistoric time before everyone
42040	46360	had a cell phone and computers were named after the year they were made in.
46360	51920	Okay, I'm not quite a dinosaur yet, but I grew up in a unique time where half of my
51920	56720	childhood was without the major technology and platforms that seemed to rule parts of
56720	62040	our lives today, and the other half of my childhood was rapidly slingshot into the new
62040	63600	age of technology.
63600	69960	I remember from the earlier half of my childhood, life seemed different, especially human interaction.
69960	73840	If you wanted to talk with someone, you had no other option but to physically go out and
73840	78320	find them and spend uninterrupted time with them in the same room, and while you were
78320	83560	there, there was nothing pulling your attention away, nothing in the back of your mind reminding
83560	88280	you that there are hundreds of other people sharing information that you might be missing
88280	89280	out on.
89280	94280	That degree of presence, practiced day in and day out, created a different richness to
94280	100600	human interaction, with intricacies and nuances that seems to be slowly and gradually lost,
100600	104880	the further we progress into this new age of technological advancement.
104880	109520	And with the meteoric rise and popularity for documentaries like The Social Dilemma,
109520	114280	it's safe to say that this is a growing sentiment and realization within today's culture.
114280	117600	The terrifying crux to the problem is actually quite simple.
117600	122600	There's a massive mismatch between the rate of adaptation and advancement between our
122600	125400	biology and technology.
125400	130400	Because of the law of accelerating returns, the pace of advancement in information technology
130400	135960	is exponential, and while technology continues to grow at a rapid pace, we're left still
135960	141360	trying to figure out how it actually impacts us, especially when we're teaching algorithms
141360	144520	to predict and modulate our behavior.
144520	149480	I don't think that anyone's denying that social media, as well as instant communication,
149480	154480	is extremely addictive, and its addiction falls right within the same symptoms as substance
154480	155480	abuse.
155480	161560	But what we don't quite know yet is how this addiction over time changes not only our behaviors
161560	166160	through hacking our positive reinforcement centers of the brain, but how over time it
166160	169440	changes our perception of reality itself.
169440	174640	When we first embarked upon the social media experiment, we had far more in-person interactions
174640	181000	under our belt than we did interactions online, so we took our in-person frame of reference
181000	185280	and viewed all of our technological interactions through that lens.
185280	191760	But now, in a time when we have hundreds, even thousands of friends, acquaintances, celebrities,
191760	197440	and online personalities that we keep up with online, we have slowly over time replaced
197440	200480	the majority of our interactions with being digital.
200480	205840	How much do we now view our in-person interactions through our new digital lens?
205840	210280	As a prominent example, you can look at our growingly polarized political discourse in
210280	215280	modern times, and you see that we've already started to see the symptoms of a very binary
215280	218080	interpretation of human interaction.
218080	222920	It's also worrisome to think that our upcoming generation's digital presence may end up
222920	226760	being more important than their in-person presence.
226760	229080	So how do we stop all of this from happening?
229080	233080	Is the answer to shut it all down, just pull the plug on big tech?
233080	234960	I don't think that it is.
234960	239920	The truth is, we've opened Pandora's box, and this is the reality that we're now faced
240680	241680	with.
241680	242680	So what's the path forward?
242680	244600	The first step is underway.
244600	246000	Awareness.
246000	249720	Much of classical conditioning, and if you don't know what that is, Pavlov's Dogs
249720	254720	might ring a bell, is based on the more non-conscious mechanisms of the brain.
254720	259440	If you become conscious of how the conditioning is affecting you, it gives you a degree of
259440	261840	control over your behavior.
261840	267760	Beyond that, it's important to maintain that balance of in-person and digital interaction.
267760	273960	You want the lens that you view the world from to be a full 100% of human communication.
273960	279120	Body language, emotion, facial expression, nuanced tonality, it's what we were designed
279120	284120	to do, and we can't let that practice atrophy, because that's what creates our sense of
284120	288800	identity and community that gives us a healthy view of others in the world.
288800	293200	If we can maintain that balance, we can begin to have a healthier relationship with our
293200	298120	online presence, and retain control over the influence these platforms and technologies
298120	299560	have on us.
299560	303840	These algorithms are based on human behavior and response, and that's something we have
303840	305240	control over.
305240	307160	Take some small steps today.
307160	310920	Maybe start by uninstalling some social media platforms from your phone.
310920	316160	Then you have to physically go log into your computer to use it, removing some of the convenience.
316160	320360	If you're tied to your phone for work, once the day is done, find some time to spend with
320360	325240	your family and friends, and turn your phone completely off for it, be fully present with
325240	329560	the people that you're with, and you just might notice that the world isn't quite as
329560	334000	crazy as it seems, and that the life right in front of you is beautiful.
