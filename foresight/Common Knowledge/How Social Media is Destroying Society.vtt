00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
I want you to start looking for something, and I promise you, once you start looking

00:04.760 --> 00:09.760
for it, you'll never be able to stop seeing it everywhere you go.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.800
When's the last time you've walked into a restaurant and saw an entire table of friends

00:13.800 --> 00:18.760
on their phone, or a group of people on the street, or maybe even your family in the morning,

00:18.760 --> 00:24.080
each content to be in their own world nearly unaware of the reality around them?

00:24.080 --> 00:29.240
If the majority of human interaction is non-verbal, what would happen if you removed everything

00:29.240 --> 00:32.360
but that small remainder for over a decade?

00:32.360 --> 00:36.800
As it turns out, that's the very experiment that we're living in today.

00:36.800 --> 00:42.040
I remember when I was growing up, way back in the day, a prehistoric time before everyone

00:42.040 --> 00:46.360
had a cell phone and computers were named after the year they were made in.

00:46.360 --> 00:51.920
Okay, I'm not quite a dinosaur yet, but I grew up in a unique time where half of my

00:51.920 --> 00:56.720
childhood was without the major technology and platforms that seemed to rule parts of

00:56.720 --> 01:02.040
our lives today, and the other half of my childhood was rapidly slingshot into the new

01:02.040 --> 01:03.600
age of technology.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.960
I remember from the earlier half of my childhood, life seemed different, especially human interaction.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.840
If you wanted to talk with someone, you had no other option but to physically go out and

01:13.840 --> 01:18.320
find them and spend uninterrupted time with them in the same room, and while you were

01:18.320 --> 01:23.560
there, there was nothing pulling your attention away, nothing in the back of your mind reminding

01:23.560 --> 01:28.280
you that there are hundreds of other people sharing information that you might be missing

01:28.280 --> 01:29.280
out on.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.280
That degree of presence, practiced day in and day out, created a different richness to

01:34.280 --> 01:40.600
human interaction, with intricacies and nuances that seems to be slowly and gradually lost,

01:40.600 --> 01:44.880
the further we progress into this new age of technological advancement.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.520
And with the meteoric rise and popularity for documentaries like The Social Dilemma,

01:49.520 --> 01:54.280
it's safe to say that this is a growing sentiment and realization within today's culture.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.600
The terrifying crux to the problem is actually quite simple.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.600
There's a massive mismatch between the rate of adaptation and advancement between our

02:02.600 --> 02:05.400
biology and technology.

02:05.400 --> 02:10.400
Because of the law of accelerating returns, the pace of advancement in information technology

02:10.400 --> 02:15.960
is exponential, and while technology continues to grow at a rapid pace, we're left still

02:15.960 --> 02:21.360
trying to figure out how it actually impacts us, especially when we're teaching algorithms

02:21.360 --> 02:24.520
to predict and modulate our behavior.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.480
I don't think that anyone's denying that social media, as well as instant communication,

02:29.480 --> 02:34.480
is extremely addictive, and its addiction falls right within the same symptoms as substance

02:34.480 --> 02:35.480
abuse.

02:35.480 --> 02:41.560
But what we don't quite know yet is how this addiction over time changes not only our behaviors

02:41.560 --> 02:46.160
through hacking our positive reinforcement centers of the brain, but how over time it

02:46.160 --> 02:49.440
changes our perception of reality itself.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.640
When we first embarked upon the social media experiment, we had far more in-person interactions

02:54.640 --> 03:01.000
under our belt than we did interactions online, so we took our in-person frame of reference

03:01.000 --> 03:05.280
and viewed all of our technological interactions through that lens.

03:05.280 --> 03:11.760
But now, in a time when we have hundreds, even thousands of friends, acquaintances, celebrities,

03:11.760 --> 03:17.440
and online personalities that we keep up with online, we have slowly over time replaced

03:17.440 --> 03:20.480
the majority of our interactions with being digital.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.840
How much do we now view our in-person interactions through our new digital lens?

03:25.840 --> 03:30.280
As a prominent example, you can look at our growingly polarized political discourse in

03:30.280 --> 03:35.280
modern times, and you see that we've already started to see the symptoms of a very binary

03:35.280 --> 03:38.080
interpretation of human interaction.

03:38.080 --> 03:42.920
It's also worrisome to think that our upcoming generation's digital presence may end up

03:42.920 --> 03:46.760
being more important than their in-person presence.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.080
So how do we stop all of this from happening?

03:49.080 --> 03:53.080
Is the answer to shut it all down, just pull the plug on big tech?

03:53.080 --> 03:54.960
I don't think that it is.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.920
The truth is, we've opened Pandora's box, and this is the reality that we're now faced

04:00.680 --> 04:01.680
with.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.680
So what's the path forward?

04:02.680 --> 04:04.600
The first step is underway.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.000
Awareness.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.720
Much of classical conditioning, and if you don't know what that is, Pavlov's Dogs

04:09.720 --> 04:14.720
might ring a bell, is based on the more non-conscious mechanisms of the brain.

04:14.720 --> 04:19.440
If you become conscious of how the conditioning is affecting you, it gives you a degree of

04:19.440 --> 04:21.840
control over your behavior.

04:21.840 --> 04:27.760
Beyond that, it's important to maintain that balance of in-person and digital interaction.

04:27.760 --> 04:33.960
You want the lens that you view the world from to be a full 100% of human communication.

04:33.960 --> 04:39.120
Body language, emotion, facial expression, nuanced tonality, it's what we were designed

04:39.120 --> 04:44.120
to do, and we can't let that practice atrophy, because that's what creates our sense of

04:44.120 --> 04:48.800
identity and community that gives us a healthy view of others in the world.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.200
If we can maintain that balance, we can begin to have a healthier relationship with our

04:53.200 --> 04:58.120
online presence, and retain control over the influence these platforms and technologies

04:58.120 --> 04:59.560
have on us.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.840
These algorithms are based on human behavior and response, and that's something we have

05:03.840 --> 05:05.240
control over.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.160
Take some small steps today.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.920
Maybe start by uninstalling some social media platforms from your phone.

05:10.920 --> 05:16.160
Then you have to physically go log into your computer to use it, removing some of the convenience.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.360
If you're tied to your phone for work, once the day is done, find some time to spend with

05:20.360 --> 05:25.240
your family and friends, and turn your phone completely off for it, be fully present with

05:25.240 --> 05:29.560
the people that you're with, and you just might notice that the world isn't quite as

05:29.560 --> 05:34.000
crazy as it seems, and that the life right in front of you is beautiful.
