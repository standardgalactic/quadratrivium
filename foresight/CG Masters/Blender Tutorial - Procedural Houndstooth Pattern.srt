00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Hey, this is Chris Plush from CG Masters.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,040
In this step-by-step project, we'll be creating a fully procedural houndstooth pattern, and

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
this is what that pattern looks like.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
But even more simply, this is what it really looks like.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,920
Then this pattern is repeated all over.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,960
So let's break down what we need to do to create this.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,160
So there are four sections to this pattern.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,280
The top right quadrant is just a black square, and the bottom left quadrant is just a white

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,280
square.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,840
It's easy enough to make with the checker texture.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Now for the striped quadrants at the top left and bottom right, each have one, two,

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,560
three, four checkered stripes going diagonally.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,960
There are many ways to create diagonal lines with nodes, but alignment will be key here,

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,720
and using a Voronoi texture will more easily give us perfect alignment than any other method.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,280
But let's start things off by making the one single black square in the pattern.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,560
So here in Blender, I've already deleted everything in my scene, and now I'll press

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,320
Shift and A, and I'll add in a mesh plane to work with.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,440
And then I'll press numpad 7 for top view, and let's zoom in on that.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Now let's split the window.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,800
So I'll go to the top right corner, left click on that, and drag it to the left.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,280
And then let's change this editor type over here to the shader editor.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,640
Then I'll press the N key to get rid of the right side toolbar, and let's start off by

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,280
giving this a new material.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,120
So I'll click on the new button up there, and we'll rename this to houndstooth.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,520
And for this, we actually don't need the principled node, so I'm going to left click

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,920
on that to select it, and then press delete to get rid of it.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
We're not going to need that because we're just going to be focusing on the pattern right

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
now.

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,720
And for that, we can just use some preview nodes, which reminds me, make sure you have

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Node Wrangler enabled in your user preferences.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,200
For that, you can go to the edit menu, go down to preferences, and in the add-ons tab,

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,480
type node in the search field there, and make sure you've enabled Node Wrangler right here.

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,640
That just gives us a set of hotkeys that really come in handy when creating shaders.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,600
So let's start things off now by pressing shift and A, and from the texture menu, we'll

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,400
add in a checker texture.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,040
Now this is going to be a pattern that we'll need to lay flat on all surfaces, so it'll

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,320
be best to use UV coordinates for this.

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,880
So your objects will need to be UV unwrapped in order to use this shader.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,000
The plane is already unwrapped by default, so we don't need to worry about unwrapping

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
it.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,560
And now let's add in a texture coordinate node so that we can actually use UV coordinates.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,200
So I'll press shift and A again, and from the input menu, I'll add in a texture coordinate

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,440
node.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,720
And every texture node that we use, we're going to plug the UV coordinates from this

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,060
node into that.

46
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,000
So let's plug UV from there into the vector input of the checker texture.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,760
All right, now let's preview what we have so far.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,720
So over in the 3D view, let's press the Z key and choose material preview mode.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,680
Then I'll hold control and shift and left click on the checker texture node.

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,600
Then node wrangler connects that node, or the top output of that node, to an emission

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,840
node here so that we can preview it.

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,280
But let's get a preview of the factor output here, which will be black and white, which

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
is what we want.

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,160
To get a preview of the next output down, hold control, shift, and left click on that again,

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,520
and then we'll get a preview of that socket.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
And all right, cool.

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,320
But we just want four squares in this space though so that we can work on just the isolated

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
pattern for the houndstooth.

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
So let's turn the checker texture scale down to two.

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,320
And then we'll get a two by two checker grid over here.

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,080
Now we just need the top right black square though.

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
So what we can do is create a white band across the bottom that kind of overrides the black

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
square down here.

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
That way we'll have three white squares and one black one.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
And we can do that by using another checker texture.

66
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,520
So let me left click on the checker texture node to select it, and I'll press shift and

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,200
D to duplicate it and move it down to right there.

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,800
Now to create a white band from this checker texture, let's press shift and A, and from

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,200
the vector menu, we'll add in a mapping node.

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,840
Let me space these things out a little bit.

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,640
Now with the mapping node, we can stretch these checker textures infinitely wide so

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,680
we end up with just two black and white bands going horizontally.

73
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,200
So to do that, first let's connect the vector output to the vector input of the checker

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,360
texture, and again we want to use UV coordinates for every texture node that we use.

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,760
So let's plug the UV coordinates into the vector input of the mapping node.

76
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,920
And now let's get a preview of what we have so far, a hold control, shift, and left click

77
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,200
on this checker texture twice to preview the factor output.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Okay, so it looks exactly the same as the other one so far, but now we've got a mapping

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,440
node that we can use to stretch it.

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,040
So let's play around with the, where's it at, the X scale here.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,180
You can see it's going to stretch it or squash it on the X axis.

82
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,140
Let's turn the scale down to zero, and it stretches it infinitely wide and we end up

83
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,740
with a white band on top and a black band on the bottom.

84
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,340
So we've got a black and white mask to use now, and what I want to do is use this by

85
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,380
replacing the bottom stripe with the color white, and the top stripe will have that single

86
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,060
black square in the top right corner still.

87
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,780
So let's go over here, and I'll press shift and A, and from the color menu, I'll add in

88
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,540
a mix RGB node, and let me move it up there.

89
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,620
So with this mix node, we can mix two different colors or two different inputs together, and

90
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,940
we can mix them using a mask if we plug that mask into the factor value here.

91
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,660
So let's plug our mask down here into that by plugging the factor output into the factor

92
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,220
input of the mix node, and let's preview this by holding control, shift, and left-clicking

93
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,860
on it.

94
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,860
So our black and white mask from down here is now mixing these two different colors.

95
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,260
So for example, if we change color one to red, you can see the stripe that was black

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,260
in our mask is now showing color number one, and the stripe that was white is showing color

97
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,700
number two.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
So that's great.

99
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,020
Now we just need to change these colors to be the right inputs.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,420
So we want the bottom stripe to be white.

101
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,340
So let's go ahead and click on that color field, and we'll increase RGB all the way up

102
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,160
to one so we have a pure white.

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,260
And we want the top stripe here just to be the original checker texture that had that

104
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,060
black square at the top right.

105
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,300
We'll plug that factor value in as color number two, and there we go.

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,180
Alright so now we have two quadrants completed.

107
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,500
We've got the black square in the top right, and we've got a white square at the bottom

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
left.

109
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,420
Now we just need to get diagonal stripes in this square and this one.

110
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,020
And for that we'll need four diagonal stripes going through each quadrant.

111
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,060
Now there's a few ways to create diagonal stripes.

112
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,220
You might be tempted to use something like the horizontal bands we created with the checker

113
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,660
texture, and then just rotate those bands 45 degrees and scale them, and you can test

114
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,180
that out if you want, but rotating those bands will make them difficult to align perfectly.

115
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,540
But luckily the Voronoi texture is great for precision alignments, especially when it comes

116
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,740
to aligning with the checker texture.

117
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,580
If you've seen my carbon fiber tutorial, you've already seen how well the Voronoi texture

118
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,300
aligns with checker textures.

119
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,940
It's a fantastic combo for making patterns.

120
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,020
So over in the shader editor here, let's press shift and A, and from the texture menu, I'll

121
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,980
add in a Voronoi texture.

122
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,460
And let's bring this down here a little bit.

123
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,980
And now let's press control, shift, and left click on that to get a preview of the distance

124
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
output.

125
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,820
Okay, so how the heck do we turn this into diagonal lines?

126
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,740
Well if we switch the dimensions of the texture over to 1D, then it can give us some interesting

127
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,780
patterns including diagonal lines.

128
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,660
1D will produce an effect on a single axis, so we can create lines with it.

129
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,540
And it's the W value right here that's used for the result.

130
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,180
Right now W is set to a single value, so we're seeing a single color as a result in the end.

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,540
So it's not really useful unless we plug more interesting information into it, like

132
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,740
texture coordinates for example.

133
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,660
So let's go ahead and plug our UV coordinates into the W input of the Voronoi texture.

134
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,020
And there we go.

135
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,960
Now we've got some diagonal lines.

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,860
When using texture coordinates, every point on the surface has a different value.

137
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,740
So all of these different values will produce different lines when run through this texture,

138
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,940
and we end up with diagonal lines.

139
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,780
Let's turn the randomness value here down to zero though, so we can perfectly space

140
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,620
out those lines.

141
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,480
But now we need solid bands instead of gradients.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,940
So let's press shift and A, and from the converter menu, add in a math node.

143
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,760
And just drag it over that line until it highlights and drop it there to connect it.

144
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,460
And let's change this from add to, where's it at, less than.

145
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,900
And we'll turn the threshold down to .25.

146
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
And there we go.

147
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,260
Now just to give you an idea of what the less than node does, it takes all of the brightness

148
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,540
values from the distance output.

149
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,380
And any values that are greater than .25 become black lines, and any values that are less

150
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,100
than .25 become white lines.

151
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,460
And in the end, this is the result.

152
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,220
We get these diagonal bands, all of them being the same exact width.

153
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,740
All right, so now we need four bands in each block, so that's going to be eight bands total.

154
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,780
Right now we don't have eight bands going through this.

155
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,100
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, then a piece of one up there and a piece down there.

156
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,340
But let's increase the Voronoi texture scale here up to six, and that should give us what

157
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
we need.

158
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,100
So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, then half of one up there and

159
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
half down there.

160
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,300
So technically we do have eight, but we'll need to center these better.

161
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,500
So let's press shift and A, and from the input menu, or no, from the vector menu, let's add

162
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
in a mapping node.

163
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,380
And I'll drag it over that line and drop it there so it connects.

164
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,380
So we'll need to change the X location here to offset these and center them perfectly.

165
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,860
Now I played around with this, and I found that a value of 0.125 or one eighth gives

166
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,220
us the exact offset we need to have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight full bands.

167
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,700
And right now these are running the wrong way.

168
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,380
We want them running from bottom left to top right.

169
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,460
So let's just rotate these on the Z axis.

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,100
I'm going to type in 90 degrees, and there we go, perfect.

171
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,700
And now let's mix these stripes in with the single black square we created.

172
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,860
So let me hold control and shift, and I'll right click and drag between these two nodes,

173
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,660
and node Wrangler connects them with a MixRGB node right here.

174
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,820
And let me space things out a little bit better.

175
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,220
So right now the MixFactor is set to 0.5, so it's combining both of those textures 50-50,

176
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,300
not exactly what we want.

177
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,340
We want the stripes to show up only in the top left and bottom right quadrants.

178
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,380
And for that we'll need a mask that we can plug into this factor value.

179
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,900
We actually already have a mask right here.

180
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Our first checker texture, if I hold control, shift, and left click on that twice to preview

181
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,740
it, is the perfect mask to use because we can just replace the white squares here with

182
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,220
the stripes.

183
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,340
So let me hold control, shift, and left click on this mix node again.

184
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,500
And let's connect this factor output from the original checker texture into the factor

185
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,580
input of the mix node, and there we go.

186
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,580
And again with masks the white squares, which have a numerical value of 1, are going to

187
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,780
show the bottom color, which was our stripes, and the black squares, which have a numerical

188
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,660
value of 0, are going to show the top color, which is our black and white square quadrants.

189
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,260
So now we're almost finished, but we do need to invert the colors for the stripes at the

190
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,620
top left quadrant here.

191
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,980
They're all backwards right now.

192
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,900
So for that let me press shift and A over here, and from the color menu I'll add in

193
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,060
an invert node.

194
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,860
And let's drag it over this line here, and drop it there so it connects.

195
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,780
Now at first this inverts everything, but I just want to invert what's on the top left

196
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
here.

197
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,460
And for that we can use the original bands that we created right here.

198
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,820
If we use these bands as invert values, the white band has a numerical value of 1, so

199
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,660
everything up top will invert fully, and the black band has a numerical value of 0, so

200
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,380
nothing on the bottom will be inverted.

201
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,820
And that's perfect, that's exactly what we want.

202
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,380
So let's press control, shift, and left click on the mix node again to get a preview of

203
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,020
it, and let's plug this checker texture's factor output in as the factor input for the

204
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,900
invert node, and there we go.

205
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,980
And that is perfect.

206
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,100
So now we have our base pattern, but now let's create a master scale control to control the

207
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
density of it all.

208
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,860
And for that let's head back to our texture coordinate node right here.

209
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,060
Now what I want to do is scale the UV coordinates before those coordinates are sent out to all

210
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,540
of the texture nodes.

211
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,100
So we're going to need a reroute node.

212
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,260
So let's left click on the texture coordinate node to select it, then press shift and W

213
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,940
for the node wrangler menu, and go down to add reroutes and choose two linked outputs.

214
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,460
I'll add this little reroute node right here which will separate the texture coordinate

215
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,260
node from all those lines stemming out from it.

216
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,100
I think there's a hot key for that too, but I forget what it is.

217
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,140
But now what we have left is this single line right here which we can sneak a mapping node

218
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
into.

219
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,300
So let's press shift and A, and from the vector menu add in a mapping node.

220
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,180
Drag it over that line until it highlights, then left click and drop it there.

221
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,980
And now we can adjust the entire texture scale by using these values here.

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,980
But to be able to change all of them at the same time, let's press shift and A, and from

223
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,260
the input menu add in a value node.

224
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,980
And we'll plug this value into the scale socket right there, and now we can just change the

225
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,100
scale using this one value node.

226
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,260
And we can actually control the rotation of the texture here as well.

227
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,380
Let me type in 180 for the Z rotation.

228
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
And now we're all done.

229
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,940
The pattern is now complete, and now you can plug this into a principled node or whatever

230
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,140
you want to do with it.

231
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,700
Alright, and that's going to do it for this project.

232
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,580
