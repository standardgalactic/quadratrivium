0	7040	Hey, this is Chris Plush from CG Masters.
7040	11040	In this step-by-step project, we'll be creating a fully procedural houndstooth pattern, and
11040	13440	this is what that pattern looks like.
13440	16800	But even more simply, this is what it really looks like.
16800	18920	Then this pattern is repeated all over.
18920	21960	So let's break down what we need to do to create this.
21960	24160	So there are four sections to this pattern.
24160	28280	The top right quadrant is just a black square, and the bottom left quadrant is just a white
28280	29280	square.
29280	31840	It's easy enough to make with the checker texture.
31840	36520	Now for the striped quadrants at the top left and bottom right, each have one, two,
36520	39560	three, four checkered stripes going diagonally.
39560	43960	There are many ways to create diagonal lines with nodes, but alignment will be key here,
43960	48720	and using a Voronoi texture will more easily give us perfect alignment than any other method.
48720	53280	But let's start things off by making the one single black square in the pattern.
53280	56560	So here in Blender, I've already deleted everything in my scene, and now I'll press
56560	60320	Shift and A, and I'll add in a mesh plane to work with.
60320	64440	And then I'll press numpad 7 for top view, and let's zoom in on that.
64440	65440	Now let's split the window.
65440	69800	So I'll go to the top right corner, left click on that, and drag it to the left.
69800	73280	And then let's change this editor type over here to the shader editor.
73280	77640	Then I'll press the N key to get rid of the right side toolbar, and let's start off by
77640	79280	giving this a new material.
79280	86120	So I'll click on the new button up there, and we'll rename this to houndstooth.
86120	88520	And for this, we actually don't need the principled node, so I'm going to left click
88520	91920	on that to select it, and then press delete to get rid of it.
91920	95520	We're not going to need that because we're just going to be focusing on the pattern right
95520	96520	now.
96520	99720	And for that, we can just use some preview nodes, which reminds me, make sure you have
99720	102600	Node Wrangler enabled in your user preferences.
102600	109200	For that, you can go to the edit menu, go down to preferences, and in the add-ons tab,
109200	115480	type node in the search field there, and make sure you've enabled Node Wrangler right here.
115480	119640	That just gives us a set of hotkeys that really come in handy when creating shaders.
119640	124600	So let's start things off now by pressing shift and A, and from the texture menu, we'll
124600	129400	add in a checker texture.
129400	133040	Now this is going to be a pattern that we'll need to lay flat on all surfaces, so it'll
133040	135320	be best to use UV coordinates for this.
135320	138880	So your objects will need to be UV unwrapped in order to use this shader.
138880	142000	The plane is already unwrapped by default, so we don't need to worry about unwrapping
142000	143280	it.
143280	147560	And now let's add in a texture coordinate node so that we can actually use UV coordinates.
147560	152200	So I'll press shift and A again, and from the input menu, I'll add in a texture coordinate
152200	154440	node.
154440	157720	And every texture node that we use, we're going to plug the UV coordinates from this
157720	159060	node into that.
159060	163000	So let's plug UV from there into the vector input of the checker texture.
163000	165760	All right, now let's preview what we have so far.
165760	171720	So over in the 3D view, let's press the Z key and choose material preview mode.
171720	175680	Then I'll hold control and shift and left click on the checker texture node.
175680	179600	Then node wrangler connects that node, or the top output of that node, to an emission
179600	181840	node here so that we can preview it.
181840	185280	But let's get a preview of the factor output here, which will be black and white, which
185280	186560	is what we want.
186560	191160	To get a preview of the next output down, hold control, shift, and left click on that again,
191160	194520	and then we'll get a preview of that socket.
194520	195920	And all right, cool.
195920	200320	But we just want four squares in this space though so that we can work on just the isolated
200320	202080	pattern for the houndstooth.
202080	205760	So let's turn the checker texture scale down to two.
205760	209320	And then we'll get a two by two checker grid over here.
209320	212080	Now we just need the top right black square though.
212080	216560	So what we can do is create a white band across the bottom that kind of overrides the black
216560	217840	square down here.
217840	220560	That way we'll have three white squares and one black one.
220560	223120	And we can do that by using another checker texture.
223120	226520	So let me left click on the checker texture node to select it, and I'll press shift and
226520	230200	D to duplicate it and move it down to right there.
230200	234800	Now to create a white band from this checker texture, let's press shift and A, and from
234800	239200	the vector menu, we'll add in a mapping node.
239200	245840	Let me space these things out a little bit.
245840	249640	Now with the mapping node, we can stretch these checker textures infinitely wide so
249640	253680	we end up with just two black and white bands going horizontally.
253680	257200	So to do that, first let's connect the vector output to the vector input of the checker
257200	262360	texture, and again we want to use UV coordinates for every texture node that we use.
262360	266760	So let's plug the UV coordinates into the vector input of the mapping node.
266760	270920	And now let's get a preview of what we have so far, a hold control, shift, and left click
270920	274200	on this checker texture twice to preview the factor output.
274200	278400	Okay, so it looks exactly the same as the other one so far, but now we've got a mapping
278400	280440	node that we can use to stretch it.
280440	284040	So let's play around with the, where's it at, the X scale here.
284040	287180	You can see it's going to stretch it or squash it on the X axis.
287180	291140	Let's turn the scale down to zero, and it stretches it infinitely wide and we end up
291140	294740	with a white band on top and a black band on the bottom.
294740	298340	So we've got a black and white mask to use now, and what I want to do is use this by
298340	302380	replacing the bottom stripe with the color white, and the top stripe will have that single
302380	305060	black square in the top right corner still.
305060	310780	So let's go over here, and I'll press shift and A, and from the color menu, I'll add in
310780	315540	a mix RGB node, and let me move it up there.
315540	319620	So with this mix node, we can mix two different colors or two different inputs together, and
319620	323940	we can mix them using a mask if we plug that mask into the factor value here.
323940	328660	So let's plug our mask down here into that by plugging the factor output into the factor
328660	333220	input of the mix node, and let's preview this by holding control, shift, and left-clicking
333220	334860	on it.
334860	338860	So our black and white mask from down here is now mixing these two different colors.
338860	343260	So for example, if we change color one to red, you can see the stripe that was black
343260	348260	in our mask is now showing color number one, and the stripe that was white is showing color
348260	350700	number two.
350700	351700	So that's great.
351700	354020	Now we just need to change these colors to be the right inputs.
354020	356420	So we want the bottom stripe to be white.
356420	360340	So let's go ahead and click on that color field, and we'll increase RGB all the way up
360340	363160	to one so we have a pure white.
363160	368260	And we want the top stripe here just to be the original checker texture that had that
368260	370060	black square at the top right.
370060	375300	We'll plug that factor value in as color number two, and there we go.
375300	377180	Alright so now we have two quadrants completed.
377180	380500	We've got the black square in the top right, and we've got a white square at the bottom
380500	381500	left.
381500	385420	Now we just need to get diagonal stripes in this square and this one.
385420	389020	And for that we'll need four diagonal stripes going through each quadrant.
389020	391060	Now there's a few ways to create diagonal stripes.
391060	394220	You might be tempted to use something like the horizontal bands we created with the checker
394220	398660	texture, and then just rotate those bands 45 degrees and scale them, and you can test
398660	403180	that out if you want, but rotating those bands will make them difficult to align perfectly.
403180	407540	But luckily the Voronoi texture is great for precision alignments, especially when it comes
407540	409740	to aligning with the checker texture.
409740	413580	If you've seen my carbon fiber tutorial, you've already seen how well the Voronoi texture
413580	415300	aligns with checker textures.
415300	417940	It's a fantastic combo for making patterns.
417940	423020	So over in the shader editor here, let's press shift and A, and from the texture menu, I'll
423020	424980	add in a Voronoi texture.
424980	428460	And let's bring this down here a little bit.
428460	431980	And now let's press control, shift, and left click on that to get a preview of the distance
431980	432980	output.
432980	436820	Okay, so how the heck do we turn this into diagonal lines?
436820	441740	Well if we switch the dimensions of the texture over to 1D, then it can give us some interesting
441740	444780	patterns including diagonal lines.
444780	448660	1D will produce an effect on a single axis, so we can create lines with it.
448660	451540	And it's the W value right here that's used for the result.
451540	456180	Right now W is set to a single value, so we're seeing a single color as a result in the end.
456180	459540	So it's not really useful unless we plug more interesting information into it, like
459540	461740	texture coordinates for example.
461740	468660	So let's go ahead and plug our UV coordinates into the W input of the Voronoi texture.
468660	470020	And there we go.
470020	471960	Now we've got some diagonal lines.
471960	475860	When using texture coordinates, every point on the surface has a different value.
475860	479740	So all of these different values will produce different lines when run through this texture,
479740	481940	and we end up with diagonal lines.
481940	485780	Let's turn the randomness value here down to zero though, so we can perfectly space
485780	487620	out those lines.
487620	490480	But now we need solid bands instead of gradients.
490480	495940	So let's press shift and A, and from the converter menu, add in a math node.
495940	500760	And just drag it over that line until it highlights and drop it there to connect it.
500760	506460	And let's change this from add to, where's it at, less than.
506460	510900	And we'll turn the threshold down to .25.
510900	511900	And there we go.
511900	515260	Now just to give you an idea of what the less than node does, it takes all of the brightness
515260	517540	values from the distance output.
517540	522380	And any values that are greater than .25 become black lines, and any values that are less
522380	525100	than .25 become white lines.
525100	526460	And in the end, this is the result.
526460	530220	We get these diagonal bands, all of them being the same exact width.
530220	534740	All right, so now we need four bands in each block, so that's going to be eight bands total.
534740	536780	Right now we don't have eight bands going through this.
536780	542100	We have one, two, three, four, five, six, then a piece of one up there and a piece down there.
542100	547340	But let's increase the Voronoi texture scale here up to six, and that should give us what
547340	548340	we need.
548340	552100	So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, then half of one up there and
552100	553100	half down there.
553100	557300	So technically we do have eight, but we'll need to center these better.
557300	563500	So let's press shift and A, and from the input menu, or no, from the vector menu, let's add
563500	564500	in a mapping node.
564500	568380	And I'll drag it over that line and drop it there so it connects.
568380	573380	So we'll need to change the X location here to offset these and center them perfectly.
573380	578860	Now I played around with this, and I found that a value of 0.125 or one eighth gives
578860	585220	us the exact offset we need to have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight full bands.
585220	586700	And right now these are running the wrong way.
586700	589380	We want them running from bottom left to top right.
589380	591460	So let's just rotate these on the Z axis.
591460	596100	I'm going to type in 90 degrees, and there we go, perfect.
596100	600700	And now let's mix these stripes in with the single black square we created.
600700	605860	So let me hold control and shift, and I'll right click and drag between these two nodes,
605860	609660	and node Wrangler connects them with a MixRGB node right here.
609660	612820	And let me space things out a little bit better.
612820	618220	So right now the MixFactor is set to 0.5, so it's combining both of those textures 50-50,
618220	619300	not exactly what we want.
619300	623340	We want the stripes to show up only in the top left and bottom right quadrants.
623340	626380	And for that we'll need a mask that we can plug into this factor value.
626380	628900	We actually already have a mask right here.
628900	632900	Our first checker texture, if I hold control, shift, and left click on that twice to preview
632900	637740	it, is the perfect mask to use because we can just replace the white squares here with
637740	639220	the stripes.
639220	643340	So let me hold control, shift, and left click on this mix node again.
643340	647500	And let's connect this factor output from the original checker texture into the factor
647500	650580	input of the mix node, and there we go.
650580	654580	And again with masks the white squares, which have a numerical value of 1, are going to
654580	658780	show the bottom color, which was our stripes, and the black squares, which have a numerical
658780	664660	value of 0, are going to show the top color, which is our black and white square quadrants.
664660	668260	So now we're almost finished, but we do need to invert the colors for the stripes at the
668260	669620	top left quadrant here.
669620	671980	They're all backwards right now.
671980	675900	So for that let me press shift and A over here, and from the color menu I'll add in
675900	677060	an invert node.
677060	681860	And let's drag it over this line here, and drop it there so it connects.
681860	685780	Now at first this inverts everything, but I just want to invert what's on the top left
685780	686780	here.
686780	690460	And for that we can use the original bands that we created right here.
690460	694820	If we use these bands as invert values, the white band has a numerical value of 1, so
694820	699660	everything up top will invert fully, and the black band has a numerical value of 0, so
699660	701380	nothing on the bottom will be inverted.
701380	703820	And that's perfect, that's exactly what we want.
703820	707380	So let's press control, shift, and left click on the mix node again to get a preview of
707380	713020	it, and let's plug this checker texture's factor output in as the factor input for the
713020	715900	invert node, and there we go.
715900	716980	And that is perfect.
716980	721100	So now we have our base pattern, but now let's create a master scale control to control the
721100	722100	density of it all.
722100	725860	And for that let's head back to our texture coordinate node right here.
725860	730060	Now what I want to do is scale the UV coordinates before those coordinates are sent out to all
730060	731540	of the texture nodes.
731540	733100	So we're going to need a reroute node.
733100	737260	So let's left click on the texture coordinate node to select it, then press shift and W
737260	742940	for the node wrangler menu, and go down to add reroutes and choose two linked outputs.
742940	747460	I'll add this little reroute node right here which will separate the texture coordinate
747460	751260	node from all those lines stemming out from it.
751260	754100	I think there's a hot key for that too, but I forget what it is.
754100	758140	But now what we have left is this single line right here which we can sneak a mapping node
758140	759140	into.
759140	764300	So let's press shift and A, and from the vector menu add in a mapping node.
764300	768180	Drag it over that line until it highlights, then left click and drop it there.
768180	771980	And now we can adjust the entire texture scale by using these values here.
771980	775980	But to be able to change all of them at the same time, let's press shift and A, and from
775980	779260	the input menu add in a value node.
779260	785980	And we'll plug this value into the scale socket right there, and now we can just change the
785980	788100	scale using this one value node.
789020	792260	And we can actually control the rotation of the texture here as well.
792260	797380	Let me type in 180 for the Z rotation.
797380	798380	And now we're all done.
798380	802940	The pattern is now complete, and now you can plug this into a principled node or whatever
802940	804140	you want to do with it.
804140	806700	Alright, and that's going to do it for this project.
