Processing Overview for CG Masters
============================
Checking CG Masters/Blender Tutorial - Procedural Houndstooth Pattern.txt
1. **Objective**: Create a pattern with black and white square quadrants and striped diagonal lines in Blender using Cycles.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - Create a checker texture for the base pattern.
   - Use a noise texture to generate stripes.
   - Combine both textures using a MixRGB node set to Multiply for stripes, with a factor of 0.5 to blend them evenly across the material.

3. **Creating a Mask**:
   - Realize that the first checker texture can serve as a mask to reveal the stripes only in the top left and bottom right quadrants.
   - Use control + shift + left click to preview the original checker texture as a mask.
   - Connect the factor output of the first checker texture (mask) to the factor input of the MixRGB node.

4. **Inverting Colors**:
   - Add an Invert node to reverse the colors of the stripes in the top left quadrant.
   - Use the bands from the noise texture to control which parts of the image are inverted.
   - Preview the combined effect with the invert applied to the stripes.

5. **Adding a Master Scale Control**:
   - Insert a reroute node to separate the texture coordinate output for individual manipulation.
   - Add a Mapping node to scale and rotate the entire texture pattern.
   - Use a Value node to control both the scale and rotation of the texture coordinates.

6. **Final Steps**:
   - Rotate the texture 180 degrees on the Z-axis for a different orientation if desired.
   - The pattern is now complete and ready to be used in materials, shaders, or as an element within a larger scene.

7. **Additional Resources**:
   - Consider enrolling in "The Blender Encyclopedia" course for comprehensive Blender tutorials and reference guides.

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a complex pattern with specific control over different areas of the material using Blender's node system within Cycles. The resulting pattern can be applied to any object within a Blender scene, offering both visual interest and control over design elements.
