00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
Hey, this is Chris Plush from CG Masters.

00:07.040 --> 00:11.040
In this step-by-step project, we'll be creating a fully procedural houndstooth pattern, and

00:11.040 --> 00:13.440
this is what that pattern looks like.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.800
But even more simply, this is what it really looks like.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.920
Then this pattern is repeated all over.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.960
So let's break down what we need to do to create this.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.160
So there are four sections to this pattern.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.280
The top right quadrant is just a black square, and the bottom left quadrant is just a white

00:28.280 --> 00:29.280
square.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.840
It's easy enough to make with the checker texture.

00:31.840 --> 00:36.520
Now for the striped quadrants at the top left and bottom right, each have one, two,

00:36.520 --> 00:39.560
three, four checkered stripes going diagonally.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.960
There are many ways to create diagonal lines with nodes, but alignment will be key here,

00:43.960 --> 00:48.720
and using a Voronoi texture will more easily give us perfect alignment than any other method.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.280
But let's start things off by making the one single black square in the pattern.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.560
So here in Blender, I've already deleted everything in my scene, and now I'll press

00:56.560 --> 01:00.320
Shift and A, and I'll add in a mesh plane to work with.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.440
And then I'll press numpad 7 for top view, and let's zoom in on that.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
Now let's split the window.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.800
So I'll go to the top right corner, left click on that, and drag it to the left.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.280
And then let's change this editor type over here to the shader editor.

01:13.280 --> 01:17.640
Then I'll press the N key to get rid of the right side toolbar, and let's start off by

01:17.640 --> 01:19.280
giving this a new material.

01:19.280 --> 01:26.120
So I'll click on the new button up there, and we'll rename this to houndstooth.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.520
And for this, we actually don't need the principled node, so I'm going to left click

01:28.520 --> 01:31.920
on that to select it, and then press delete to get rid of it.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.520
We're not going to need that because we're just going to be focusing on the pattern right

01:35.520 --> 01:36.520
now.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.720
And for that, we can just use some preview nodes, which reminds me, make sure you have

01:39.720 --> 01:42.600
Node Wrangler enabled in your user preferences.

01:42.600 --> 01:49.200
For that, you can go to the edit menu, go down to preferences, and in the add-ons tab,

01:49.200 --> 01:55.480
type node in the search field there, and make sure you've enabled Node Wrangler right here.

01:55.480 --> 01:59.640
That just gives us a set of hotkeys that really come in handy when creating shaders.

01:59.640 --> 02:04.600
So let's start things off now by pressing shift and A, and from the texture menu, we'll

02:04.600 --> 02:09.400
add in a checker texture.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.040
Now this is going to be a pattern that we'll need to lay flat on all surfaces, so it'll

02:13.040 --> 02:15.320
be best to use UV coordinates for this.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.880
So your objects will need to be UV unwrapped in order to use this shader.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.000
The plane is already unwrapped by default, so we don't need to worry about unwrapping

02:22.000 --> 02:23.280
it.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.560
And now let's add in a texture coordinate node so that we can actually use UV coordinates.

02:27.560 --> 02:32.200
So I'll press shift and A again, and from the input menu, I'll add in a texture coordinate

02:32.200 --> 02:34.440
node.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.720
And every texture node that we use, we're going to plug the UV coordinates from this

02:37.720 --> 02:39.060
node into that.

02:39.060 --> 02:43.000
So let's plug UV from there into the vector input of the checker texture.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.760
All right, now let's preview what we have so far.

02:45.760 --> 02:51.720
So over in the 3D view, let's press the Z key and choose material preview mode.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.680
Then I'll hold control and shift and left click on the checker texture node.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.600
Then node wrangler connects that node, or the top output of that node, to an emission

02:59.600 --> 03:01.840
node here so that we can preview it.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.280
But let's get a preview of the factor output here, which will be black and white, which

03:05.280 --> 03:06.560
is what we want.

03:06.560 --> 03:11.160
To get a preview of the next output down, hold control, shift, and left click on that again,

03:11.160 --> 03:14.520
and then we'll get a preview of that socket.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.920
And all right, cool.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.320
But we just want four squares in this space though so that we can work on just the isolated

03:20.320 --> 03:22.080
pattern for the houndstooth.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.760
So let's turn the checker texture scale down to two.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.320
And then we'll get a two by two checker grid over here.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.080
Now we just need the top right black square though.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.560
So what we can do is create a white band across the bottom that kind of overrides the black

03:36.560 --> 03:37.840
square down here.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.560
That way we'll have three white squares and one black one.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.120
And we can do that by using another checker texture.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.520
So let me left click on the checker texture node to select it, and I'll press shift and

03:46.520 --> 03:50.200
D to duplicate it and move it down to right there.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.800
Now to create a white band from this checker texture, let's press shift and A, and from

03:54.800 --> 03:59.200
the vector menu, we'll add in a mapping node.

03:59.200 --> 04:05.840
Let me space these things out a little bit.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.640
Now with the mapping node, we can stretch these checker textures infinitely wide so

04:09.640 --> 04:13.680
we end up with just two black and white bands going horizontally.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.200
So to do that, first let's connect the vector output to the vector input of the checker

04:17.200 --> 04:22.360
texture, and again we want to use UV coordinates for every texture node that we use.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.760
So let's plug the UV coordinates into the vector input of the mapping node.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.920
And now let's get a preview of what we have so far, a hold control, shift, and left click

04:30.920 --> 04:34.200
on this checker texture twice to preview the factor output.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.400
Okay, so it looks exactly the same as the other one so far, but now we've got a mapping

04:38.400 --> 04:40.440
node that we can use to stretch it.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.040
So let's play around with the, where's it at, the X scale here.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.180
You can see it's going to stretch it or squash it on the X axis.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.140
Let's turn the scale down to zero, and it stretches it infinitely wide and we end up

04:51.140 --> 04:54.740
with a white band on top and a black band on the bottom.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.340
So we've got a black and white mask to use now, and what I want to do is use this by

04:58.340 --> 05:02.380
replacing the bottom stripe with the color white, and the top stripe will have that single

05:02.380 --> 05:05.060
black square in the top right corner still.

05:05.060 --> 05:10.780
So let's go over here, and I'll press shift and A, and from the color menu, I'll add in

05:10.780 --> 05:15.540
a mix RGB node, and let me move it up there.

05:15.540 --> 05:19.620
So with this mix node, we can mix two different colors or two different inputs together, and

05:19.620 --> 05:23.940
we can mix them using a mask if we plug that mask into the factor value here.

05:23.940 --> 05:28.660
So let's plug our mask down here into that by plugging the factor output into the factor

05:28.660 --> 05:33.220
input of the mix node, and let's preview this by holding control, shift, and left-clicking

05:33.220 --> 05:34.860
on it.

05:34.860 --> 05:38.860
So our black and white mask from down here is now mixing these two different colors.

05:38.860 --> 05:43.260
So for example, if we change color one to red, you can see the stripe that was black

05:43.260 --> 05:48.260
in our mask is now showing color number one, and the stripe that was white is showing color

05:48.260 --> 05:50.700
number two.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.700
So that's great.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.020
Now we just need to change these colors to be the right inputs.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.420
So we want the bottom stripe to be white.

05:56.420 --> 06:00.340
So let's go ahead and click on that color field, and we'll increase RGB all the way up

06:00.340 --> 06:03.160
to one so we have a pure white.

06:03.160 --> 06:08.260
And we want the top stripe here just to be the original checker texture that had that

06:08.260 --> 06:10.060
black square at the top right.

06:10.060 --> 06:15.300
We'll plug that factor value in as color number two, and there we go.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.180
Alright so now we have two quadrants completed.

06:17.180 --> 06:20.500
We've got the black square in the top right, and we've got a white square at the bottom

06:20.500 --> 06:21.500
left.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.420
Now we just need to get diagonal stripes in this square and this one.

06:25.420 --> 06:29.020
And for that we'll need four diagonal stripes going through each quadrant.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.060
Now there's a few ways to create diagonal stripes.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.220
You might be tempted to use something like the horizontal bands we created with the checker

06:34.220 --> 06:38.660
texture, and then just rotate those bands 45 degrees and scale them, and you can test

06:38.660 --> 06:43.180
that out if you want, but rotating those bands will make them difficult to align perfectly.

06:43.180 --> 06:47.540
But luckily the Voronoi texture is great for precision alignments, especially when it comes

06:47.540 --> 06:49.740
to aligning with the checker texture.

06:49.740 --> 06:53.580
If you've seen my carbon fiber tutorial, you've already seen how well the Voronoi texture

06:53.580 --> 06:55.300
aligns with checker textures.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.940
It's a fantastic combo for making patterns.

06:57.940 --> 07:03.020
So over in the shader editor here, let's press shift and A, and from the texture menu, I'll

07:03.020 --> 07:04.980
add in a Voronoi texture.

07:04.980 --> 07:08.460
And let's bring this down here a little bit.

07:08.460 --> 07:11.980
And now let's press control, shift, and left click on that to get a preview of the distance

07:11.980 --> 07:12.980
output.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.820
Okay, so how the heck do we turn this into diagonal lines?

07:16.820 --> 07:21.740
Well if we switch the dimensions of the texture over to 1D, then it can give us some interesting

07:21.740 --> 07:24.780
patterns including diagonal lines.

07:24.780 --> 07:28.660
1D will produce an effect on a single axis, so we can create lines with it.

07:28.660 --> 07:31.540
And it's the W value right here that's used for the result.

07:31.540 --> 07:36.180
Right now W is set to a single value, so we're seeing a single color as a result in the end.

07:36.180 --> 07:39.540
So it's not really useful unless we plug more interesting information into it, like

07:39.540 --> 07:41.740
texture coordinates for example.

07:41.740 --> 07:48.660
So let's go ahead and plug our UV coordinates into the W input of the Voronoi texture.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.020
And there we go.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.960
Now we've got some diagonal lines.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.860
When using texture coordinates, every point on the surface has a different value.

07:55.860 --> 07:59.740
So all of these different values will produce different lines when run through this texture,

07:59.740 --> 08:01.940
and we end up with diagonal lines.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.780
Let's turn the randomness value here down to zero though, so we can perfectly space

08:05.780 --> 08:07.620
out those lines.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.480
But now we need solid bands instead of gradients.

08:10.480 --> 08:15.940
So let's press shift and A, and from the converter menu, add in a math node.

08:15.940 --> 08:20.760
And just drag it over that line until it highlights and drop it there to connect it.

08:20.760 --> 08:26.460
And let's change this from add to, where's it at, less than.

08:26.460 --> 08:30.900
And we'll turn the threshold down to .25.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.900
And there we go.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.260
Now just to give you an idea of what the less than node does, it takes all of the brightness

08:35.260 --> 08:37.540
values from the distance output.

08:37.540 --> 08:42.380
And any values that are greater than .25 become black lines, and any values that are less

08:42.380 --> 08:45.100
than .25 become white lines.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.460
And in the end, this is the result.

08:46.460 --> 08:50.220
We get these diagonal bands, all of them being the same exact width.

08:50.220 --> 08:54.740
All right, so now we need four bands in each block, so that's going to be eight bands total.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.780
Right now we don't have eight bands going through this.

08:56.780 --> 09:02.100
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, then a piece of one up there and a piece down there.

09:02.100 --> 09:07.340
But let's increase the Voronoi texture scale here up to six, and that should give us what

09:07.340 --> 09:08.340
we need.

09:08.340 --> 09:12.100
So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, then half of one up there and

09:12.100 --> 09:13.100
half down there.

09:13.100 --> 09:17.300
So technically we do have eight, but we'll need to center these better.

09:17.300 --> 09:23.500
So let's press shift and A, and from the input menu, or no, from the vector menu, let's add

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
in a mapping node.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.380
And I'll drag it over that line and drop it there so it connects.

09:28.380 --> 09:33.380
So we'll need to change the X location here to offset these and center them perfectly.

09:33.380 --> 09:38.860
Now I played around with this, and I found that a value of 0.125 or one eighth gives

09:38.860 --> 09:45.220
us the exact offset we need to have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight full bands.

09:45.220 --> 09:46.700
And right now these are running the wrong way.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.380
We want them running from bottom left to top right.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.460
So let's just rotate these on the Z axis.

09:51.460 --> 09:56.100
I'm going to type in 90 degrees, and there we go, perfect.

09:56.100 --> 10:00.700
And now let's mix these stripes in with the single black square we created.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.860
So let me hold control and shift, and I'll right click and drag between these two nodes,

10:05.860 --> 10:09.660
and node Wrangler connects them with a MixRGB node right here.

10:09.660 --> 10:12.820
And let me space things out a little bit better.

10:12.820 --> 10:18.220
So right now the MixFactor is set to 0.5, so it's combining both of those textures 50-50,

10:18.220 --> 10:19.300
not exactly what we want.

10:19.300 --> 10:23.340
We want the stripes to show up only in the top left and bottom right quadrants.

10:23.340 --> 10:26.380
And for that we'll need a mask that we can plug into this factor value.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.900
We actually already have a mask right here.

10:28.900 --> 10:32.900
Our first checker texture, if I hold control, shift, and left click on that twice to preview

10:32.900 --> 10:37.740
it, is the perfect mask to use because we can just replace the white squares here with

10:37.740 --> 10:39.220
the stripes.

10:39.220 --> 10:43.340
So let me hold control, shift, and left click on this mix node again.

10:43.340 --> 10:47.500
And let's connect this factor output from the original checker texture into the factor

10:47.500 --> 10:50.580
input of the mix node, and there we go.

10:50.580 --> 10:54.580
And again with masks the white squares, which have a numerical value of 1, are going to

10:54.580 --> 10:58.780
show the bottom color, which was our stripes, and the black squares, which have a numerical

10:58.780 --> 11:04.660
value of 0, are going to show the top color, which is our black and white square quadrants.

11:04.660 --> 11:08.260
So now we're almost finished, but we do need to invert the colors for the stripes at the

11:08.260 --> 11:09.620
top left quadrant here.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.980
They're all backwards right now.

11:11.980 --> 11:15.900
So for that let me press shift and A over here, and from the color menu I'll add in

11:15.900 --> 11:17.060
an invert node.

11:17.060 --> 11:21.860
And let's drag it over this line here, and drop it there so it connects.

11:21.860 --> 11:25.780
Now at first this inverts everything, but I just want to invert what's on the top left

11:25.780 --> 11:26.780
here.

11:26.780 --> 11:30.460
And for that we can use the original bands that we created right here.

11:30.460 --> 11:34.820
If we use these bands as invert values, the white band has a numerical value of 1, so

11:34.820 --> 11:39.660
everything up top will invert fully, and the black band has a numerical value of 0, so

11:39.660 --> 11:41.380
nothing on the bottom will be inverted.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.820
And that's perfect, that's exactly what we want.

11:43.820 --> 11:47.380
So let's press control, shift, and left click on the mix node again to get a preview of

11:47.380 --> 11:53.020
it, and let's plug this checker texture's factor output in as the factor input for the

11:53.020 --> 11:55.900
invert node, and there we go.

11:55.900 --> 11:56.980
And that is perfect.

11:56.980 --> 12:01.100
So now we have our base pattern, but now let's create a master scale control to control the

12:01.100 --> 12:02.100
density of it all.

12:02.100 --> 12:05.860
And for that let's head back to our texture coordinate node right here.

12:05.860 --> 12:10.060
Now what I want to do is scale the UV coordinates before those coordinates are sent out to all

12:10.060 --> 12:11.540
of the texture nodes.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.100
So we're going to need a reroute node.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.260
So let's left click on the texture coordinate node to select it, then press shift and W

12:17.260 --> 12:22.940
for the node wrangler menu, and go down to add reroutes and choose two linked outputs.

12:22.940 --> 12:27.460
I'll add this little reroute node right here which will separate the texture coordinate

12:27.460 --> 12:31.260
node from all those lines stemming out from it.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.100
I think there's a hot key for that too, but I forget what it is.

12:34.100 --> 12:38.140
But now what we have left is this single line right here which we can sneak a mapping node

12:38.140 --> 12:39.140
into.

12:39.140 --> 12:44.300
So let's press shift and A, and from the vector menu add in a mapping node.

12:44.300 --> 12:48.180
Drag it over that line until it highlights, then left click and drop it there.

12:48.180 --> 12:51.980
And now we can adjust the entire texture scale by using these values here.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.980
But to be able to change all of them at the same time, let's press shift and A, and from

12:55.980 --> 12:59.260
the input menu add in a value node.

12:59.260 --> 13:05.980
And we'll plug this value into the scale socket right there, and now we can just change the

13:05.980 --> 13:08.100
scale using this one value node.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.260
And we can actually control the rotation of the texture here as well.

13:12.260 --> 13:17.380
Let me type in 180 for the Z rotation.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.380
And now we're all done.

13:18.380 --> 13:22.940
The pattern is now complete, and now you can plug this into a principled node or whatever

13:22.940 --> 13:24.140
you want to do with it.

13:24.140 --> 13:26.700
Alright, and that's going to do it for this project.

13:26.700 --> 13:30.580
