00:00.000 --> 00:04.740
What entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence?

00:04.860 --> 00:09.180
Maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up confidence.

00:09.460 --> 00:13.420
Success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly likely. It is rare, right?

00:13.420 --> 00:18.620
That is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science. It's really rare.

00:18.940 --> 00:27.140
Maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea, right?

00:27.220 --> 00:30.500
Instead of saying, let me take this idea and see if I can make it work.

00:30.860 --> 00:34.100
You should do experiments and sort of prove out that the idea does not work.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.900
And if it turns out the idea does not work, you should get out of it.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.740
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Coffeezilla.

00:44.740 --> 00:50.500
Today we are talking to someone I've been kind of a fan of his work for a long time.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.220
But finally, I get to sit down and talk with him.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.260
This is Dr. Hartman of the Copenhagen Business School.

00:56.260 --> 01:07.780
He is an associate professor, and he wrote a paper about the, I'm going to totally mess this up, the Voblin, Vleblinian entrepreneur,

01:07.780 --> 01:12.980
AKA, I just want to say, because I want to call it this during this show, the Wontrepreneur sort of thing.

01:13.860 --> 01:21.020
And it's towards an un-entrepreneurial economy, the entrepreneurship industry and the rise of the Vleblinian entrepreneur.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.980
Can you summarize that idea for us real quick?

01:23.980 --> 01:27.660
Because I think it's a really interesting concept.

01:28.060 --> 01:34.540
Yeah. So the, thank you for the introduction, Stephen, by the way, and thank you for the opportunity.

01:34.780 --> 01:49.860
So the Vleblinian entrepreneur is a, or let's call it the Wontrepreneur, that's fine too, is our effort to sort of put a label on what I think a lot of people are seeing, right?

01:49.940 --> 02:01.060
The fact that there is, that there are people starting entrepreneurship, not so much with the intention of actually becoming innovation-driven entrepreneurs,

02:01.060 --> 02:09.660
but more actually to just sort of engage in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and to build up the kind of identity that comes with that.

02:11.260 --> 02:15.940
So basically, is entrepreneurship pursued for identity purposes, not productive purposes?

02:16.260 --> 02:26.340
You guys have all seen this at your, whether it's your university, you've seen it at these, you know, some coffee shops, it's a lot of times people are pursuing entrepreneurship,

02:26.340 --> 02:34.380
just to sort of tell you that they're an entrepreneur kind of idea, like the whole thing of like, you know, I'm a CEO, well, when did your company start?

02:34.380 --> 02:38.340
Well, yesterday. And you're like, oh, okay, that's very interesting.

02:38.660 --> 02:50.220
And part of your paper argues, you're trying to, if I understand it right, you're trying to explain a set of sort of problems or ideas in the field,

02:51.180 --> 03:00.660
one of which is that, okay, we see that entrepreneurship leads to all sorts of good things in the economy, but largely this is driven by a few companies.

03:01.180 --> 03:10.020
And then you also see that, oh, well, actually, there's the sort of the failing entrepreneurs or people who kind of have undersized results,

03:10.020 --> 03:15.460
and there's people like Amazon, Apple, you know, all these companies that are driving the majority of the US economy.

03:16.340 --> 03:27.620
You're saying that it's actually becoming more prevalent and you're getting more and more sort of failing entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem as proportional to their successful counterparts.

03:27.620 --> 03:35.540
And you're wondering why, and you're sort of saying there's this industry around entrepreneurs? Is that basically the idea?

03:36.060 --> 03:42.300
Yes, and that's, and that's causing a particular kind of entrepreneurial firm to pop up.

03:42.340 --> 03:47.940
And the kind of firm that is causing pop up is what we call the blinding of entrepreneurs.

03:48.300 --> 03:52.860
So, so basically, it's not our observation that the quality of entrepreneurship is falling.

03:52.980 --> 04:04.420
That's from other work, which is referenced in the paper, but basically finding that, like, people tend to think that the US is incredibly entrepreneurial, and that's actually not the case by international standards.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.500
Entrepreneurship is also becoming more rare in the US.

04:09.740 --> 04:17.820
There are fewer and fewer entrepreneurial companies, in the sense that there are fewer startups, and the quality of those startups is declining.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.420
All right, all bad things.

04:21.020 --> 04:21.860
All bad things.

04:22.300 --> 04:27.940
As you say, it's true that there are like entrepreneurial companies play a potentially very big role in the economy, right?

04:27.940 --> 04:33.100
There's things that entrepreneurial, entrepreneurial companies do that establish companies don't do.

04:33.220 --> 04:39.220
So economic dynamism is very much dependent on having well-functioning entrepreneurship, right?

04:40.820 --> 04:43.700
But that is, that seems to be becoming more rare.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.580
And there are all sorts of explanations that you could have for that.

04:47.220 --> 04:52.460
You might say that, for instance, incumbent market power is increasing, right?

04:52.460 --> 05:01.740
So Google, Facebook, and Amazon are basically buying up and closing down all the really potentially promising entrepreneurial companies before they become big, right?

05:01.740 --> 05:02.900
That's one vision of it.

05:03.380 --> 05:07.980
The other is that there is, that there's just fewer good ideas to go around, right?

05:07.980 --> 05:10.140
That the good ideas are getting harder to find.

05:11.140 --> 05:16.740
And you could also say that entrepreneurship education maybe is getting worse, right?

05:16.740 --> 05:22.060
So entrepreneurs are more poorly prepared, more poorly prepared for entrepreneurship.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.700
You might say something about venture capital not working very well.

05:25.260 --> 05:32.020
All of those arguments are valid and, you know, social sciences such that usually things are really complex and things interact.

05:32.900 --> 05:47.660
The thing that we're saying with that paper is that our understanding of the decline in entrepreneurial quality has not taken into account that there has been this really rapidly growing and by now quite large entrepreneurship industry,

05:48.100 --> 05:51.060
which are companies that target entrepreneurs as their consumers, right?

05:51.060 --> 05:51.900
And, and, and, right.

05:51.900 --> 05:59.620
And purportedly help entrepreneurs to identify and develop ideas into profitable, profitable businesses.

05:59.740 --> 06:08.260
Let's maybe expand on the types of like sort of entrepreneur help that one might see in this industry, right?

06:08.820 --> 06:09.260
Yes.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.580
So you can, there are different things, right?

06:11.580 --> 06:15.420
The, you mentioned that people will have seen this at their universities, right?

06:15.420 --> 06:19.140
Many universities now have sort of these entrepreneurship hubs, right?

06:20.020 --> 06:22.900
That could be classed as a kind of entrepreneurship industry.

06:22.900 --> 06:26.700
This is something which is marketing to entrepreneurs to try to help them.

06:27.380 --> 06:30.260
There is lots of, there's a lot of academic writing on this.

06:31.460 --> 06:37.620
Books by academics, books by practitioners, like experienced entrepreneurs who then give advice.

06:37.820 --> 06:42.620
There's a lot of sort of, you would call it back office support for entrepreneurs, right?

06:42.860 --> 06:46.340
We'll do your accounting, we'll do your legal, we'll do your admin.

06:47.420 --> 06:50.020
There are lots of entrepreneurship conferences, expos.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.340
There's lots of online media.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.060
Shark Tank, stuff like that.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.740
Shark Tank on television.

06:58.540 --> 07:03.500
And then there's also like the Dutch type of business magazine, right?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.780
Wired, Fast Company, things like that.

07:06.020 --> 07:10.500
And basically a heap of books that you can get off of Amazon or anywhere else.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.420
They'll talk to you about, tell you about how to become a successful entrepreneur, right?

07:14.660 --> 07:21.380
So there's a whole sort of suite of this that all sorts, that all sort pretends to help entrepreneurs, right?

07:21.420 --> 07:30.140
Plus, of course, there are college courses, incubators, accelerators, things associated with venture capital as well.

07:30.460 --> 07:41.180
All sorts of things that are sort of trying to do this, promoting entrepreneurs, helping them identify opportunities and then turning opportunities into valuable businesses, right?

07:41.660 --> 07:49.420
And this is why I wanted to talk to you because I read this paper and I said, oh my gosh, this intersects with a lot of what I talk about.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.900
I mean, obviously, sometimes I'm talking about outright scams.

07:52.900 --> 08:05.820
But a lot of times I'm talking about people who are sort of proposing that, oh, if you're wanting to go into Facebook ads or, you know, making a little Amazon store or, you know, starting an idea, come to us.

08:06.020 --> 08:13.140
We're going to help you if you just pay some nominal fee and they make their living by basically taking these fees.

08:13.140 --> 08:23.060
So they're basically piggybacking on the entrepreneurship industry and saying, like, we are helping you guys become better, which is a fascinating take.

08:23.060 --> 08:28.180
And there could be a role for that if they are indeed making entrepreneurs better.

08:28.860 --> 08:34.140
But it seems like there's this, we actually see entrepreneurship quality, as you say, declining.

08:34.540 --> 08:38.140
And so, yeah, go ahead.

08:38.740 --> 08:42.300
Yeah, so I think it's like in a gold rush, right?

08:42.340 --> 08:45.260
It's always good to sell shovels and you need somebody to sell shovels.

08:45.260 --> 08:45.900
Yeah, you do.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.420
For sure. Otherwise, there will be no digging.

08:48.780 --> 08:53.460
The thing about the entrepreneurship industry, I mean, there's, we don't know a whole lot about this from research.

08:53.460 --> 09:00.220
But what we do know suggests that what entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.940
They increase people's confidence in their ability to become entrepreneurs so they enter, right?

09:04.940 --> 09:11.780
We can see that if you consume more goods from the entrepreneurship industry, you tend to become an entrepreneur at higher rates.

09:11.860 --> 09:12.220
Right.

09:13.220 --> 09:20.500
But the performance of those ventures that consume the most goods from the entrepreneurship industry tends to be lower.

09:21.340 --> 09:22.220
Wow.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.580
That is really interesting.

09:24.580 --> 09:31.580
So you're getting people who sort of, you're encouraging people to join and that's successful.

09:31.580 --> 09:41.420
They're successful at that, but it's maybe not so successful or it's demonstrably not as successful at getting them to succeed.

09:41.620 --> 09:48.980
And in fact, maybe it's encouraging people to go into the entrepreneurship industry who maybe should not, maybe should not be going into it.

09:49.580 --> 09:56.260
Who at least, or maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up competence.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.140
That's a great way to say it.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.500
That might be a way to say it.

09:59.500 --> 09:59.900
Right.

09:59.900 --> 10:14.140
And one thing you talk about is like also entrepreneurs, part of this new thing is it's not entrepreneurship necessarily as, you know, a job as much as it is an identity.

10:14.700 --> 10:27.220
And the way you get that identity is by buying stuff instead of doing like it used to, maybe you would think that you'd become an entrepreneurship by doing, but actually there's some people are trying to become entrepreneurs almost by buying.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.340
I think that's the right.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.660
So there are a couple of things going on.

10:32.660 --> 10:38.060
I think the fact that we have, have this celebration of entrepreneurs, right?

10:38.060 --> 10:44.220
I mean, I think that's uncontroversial that entrepreneurship is one of the most celebrated things you can probably do, right?

10:44.220 --> 10:47.540
And entrepreneurs are some of the most celebrated actors in the economy.

10:48.380 --> 10:52.660
That makes it possible to benefit from entrepreneurship simply by being an entrepreneur.

10:53.260 --> 10:59.380
Like, with, like having a company sort of get you into a, into good company, so to speak.

11:00.860 --> 11:13.940
So that it's, it's infinitely better to tell your parents that you are working on your startup than it is to have worked as a barista, which might actually pay you more because the entrepreneurship thing could actually pay you nothing, right?

11:14.580 --> 11:15.460
So that's one thing.

11:16.220 --> 11:31.860
The other thing is that because there is an entrepreneurship industry that provides goods and services, it becomes possible to consume those goods and services to, to do things that are similar to what you might call real entrepreneurs, right?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.700
I say that in square, scare quotes, right?

11:33.980 --> 11:47.580
You can consume your way into an entrepreneurial identity because we have somehow separated the being an entrepreneur from the success of the endeavor, right?

11:48.700 --> 11:50.660
And that makes a lot of sense actually, right?

11:50.660 --> 11:55.140
That's not unreasonable because success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly unlikely.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.620
It is rare, right?

11:56.620 --> 12:01.420
That is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.300
It's really rare.

12:02.900 --> 12:11.700
And so to say that you can only be an entrepreneur if you're successful would make no sense because then that'd be a huge category of people who would basically like lack a category.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.500
So, so that makes some sense.

12:13.500 --> 12:21.700
But that at the same time becomes an excuse for something which is more insidious and that is that you can basically be in this consumption practice and that can make you an entrepreneur.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.020
And that is useless to the economy.

12:26.020 --> 12:34.500
I mean, there's nothing useful going on there other than you're just spending money on things that aren't necessarily making you do anything, right?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.540
Because you're just, it's, it's just a consumption at that point.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.820
Yeah, yeah.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.380
The short answer is that it's totally unproductive, right?

12:41.380 --> 12:53.860
I mean, the term the blending entrepreneurship, some people might have had econ classes where they've, where they've heard about the blend, the blend goods, which is basically the technical jargon for luxury goods.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.540
Things that get more desirable, the more expensive they get.

12:56.540 --> 13:01.940
So oysters, champagne, cars, racehorses, stuff like that, right?

13:01.940 --> 13:02.140
Yeah.

13:03.660 --> 13:08.820
So there's a way in which, because people don't use it for the right, nobody really likes oysters, right?

13:09.540 --> 13:13.060
But people like the social signaling that eating expensive oysters can give them.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.140
So the fact that this thing is expensive is part of the value, right?

13:17.140 --> 13:19.340
The functional value is unimportant.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.260
And that's some of the idea here.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.660
It's a social signaling that, that is valuable to people.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.460
It's not the, it's not the value that the company produces.

13:28.460 --> 13:47.660
And that's so interesting because a lot of what I see, there are valuations for certain courses, masterminds, you know, these coaching calls that their, their, their cost seems to have nothing to do with any kind of objective, objective metric.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.300
It's like, Oh, how much is your mastermind?

13:50.340 --> 13:54.580
I believe them just as much if they said 2,500 as 2,500,000.

13:55.580 --> 13:58.940
Sorry, not 2,500, 250,000 because of the fact.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.500
And I've heard both, by the way, from different people.

14:01.500 --> 14:09.500
I was on a clubhouse room last night where this hypnotist was telling us that he charges $300,000 for coaching.

14:09.860 --> 14:11.540
And it was just, it's just ridiculous.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.940
So you're just thinking, well, who would buy this?

14:13.380 --> 14:23.580
But what you're saying is that there's a whole type of person who like, they sort of see, Oh, the more it costs, the more I can signal that I'm the type of person who can afford these kinds of things.

14:23.580 --> 14:33.900
Therefore, I must sort of be a big deal in a way that you'd buy a super expensive Rolex, even if you don't really like watches, because it's more about signaling that you sort of have the thing, right?

14:34.380 --> 14:34.780
Yes.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.940
Yeah, that's where the value comes from, right?

14:36.940 --> 14:50.260
And what we're saying is that there are people who become entrepreneurs, who might have a sense that they are not going to be, who have a sense that they might not be particularly likely to create enormous value, but who will still benefit from being just in the category.

14:50.380 --> 14:54.900
I mean, most people know that one does not just start a biotech company, right?

14:55.220 --> 14:56.900
But one can be an entrepreneur.

14:56.940 --> 14:59.460
You just need basically a pitch deck.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.940
And you can kind of say that you're starting a biotech company, right?

15:02.940 --> 15:04.140
We saw that with Thanos.

15:04.140 --> 15:15.980
We saw somebody just start a biotech company, and we saw, you know, the height bubble form around it where people just go, Oh, well, this must be the next big thing, because they're excited.

15:15.980 --> 15:20.380
Meanwhile, all the scientists are saying there's no way, there's just no way.

15:20.740 --> 15:25.820
And everybody else in Silicon Valley is like, Elizabeth Holmes, you're doing such a good job.

15:26.060 --> 15:43.420
And that's, we're sort of parroting the idea, but it is true that there is sort of an encouragement at all costs, positivity at all costs of this kind of field.

15:43.460 --> 15:51.020
And like you said, rightfully so sometimes, because there's so much failure that's faced, that sort of is maybe the initial impetus.

15:51.020 --> 15:57.300
But at the end of your paper, you say there might be a good reason to discourage people out of entrepreneurship.

15:57.700 --> 15:58.700
What did you mean by that?

15:59.540 --> 16:04.500
Okay, so some of the uncertainty that surrounds entrepreneurship, you can't get around, right?

16:04.780 --> 16:10.740
It was not obvious that there was a business to be built on renting out spare rooms in your house, right?

16:11.020 --> 16:13.180
And yet Airbnb became a thing, right?

16:13.740 --> 16:18.660
There was uncertainty that you couldn't sort of reduce without trying.

16:18.980 --> 16:30.980
So what I would suggest is that a lot of the hua celebration of entrepreneurship that you also mentioned, sort of says, just go and try it, right?

16:31.140 --> 16:38.260
So I think as, especially as entrepreneurship educators, we should maybe say, you know, you really need to know that there's a downside to this.

16:38.660 --> 16:42.060
You really need to know that success is very unlikely.

16:43.060 --> 16:55.220
So we should, so in that, that alone should sort of make you say, maybe you shouldn't do it once though, I mean, but still people will have ideas that it's hard to gauge whether they are valuable or not.

16:55.220 --> 16:59.700
And it's hard to gauge whether people will be capable or incapable of executing it, right?

16:59.820 --> 17:01.420
There are situations where you won't know.

17:02.180 --> 17:08.140
And so I think the approach there is to say, okay, maybe it's worth trying, but then set up, and this is not my idea.

17:08.540 --> 17:23.140
This is from a team out of Bocconi University in Milan, we're saying, maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea, right?

17:23.180 --> 17:27.340
Instead of saying, let me take this idea and see if I can make it work, right?

17:27.660 --> 17:30.940
You should do experiments that sort of prove out that the idea does not work.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.140
And if it turns out the idea does not work, you should get out of it.

17:35.020 --> 17:40.340
So sort of flipping the burden of evidence around instead of saying, let me prove that this is great, right?

17:40.380 --> 17:42.020
Assume that the idea is not good.

17:42.540 --> 17:50.060
Work as hard as you can to make it good and then do an experiment to test out whether you should just abandon.

17:50.300 --> 18:02.700
And here's why that's really important, because one of the things that is the real challenge of entrepreneurship is that part of what's lionized is going through the valley of death of like, this idea is not working, right?

18:03.020 --> 18:10.620
The problem with that is you have no idea of whether that valley of death has any kind of meaningful in for your company.

18:10.860 --> 18:19.220
So you have people who are sort of persisting in their failure and going, oh, this is what an entrepreneur goes through when maybe they should persist.

18:19.420 --> 18:26.100
But more than likely, in a lot of these cases, they should exit once they've kind of gotten their minimal viable product.

18:26.100 --> 18:30.500
They realize there's no audience for this, no consumers get out.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.580
So I do appreciate you really saying that.

18:32.580 --> 18:42.220
And because we want to give people who are hungry for, you know, they're thinking about becoming an entrepreneur or whatever, the best tools for doing that in a way that's meaningful.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.740
What I always tell people is you should know the statistics.

18:44.740 --> 18:49.860
It shouldn't discourage you from doing it, but you need to know what the real odds are.

18:49.860 --> 18:54.060
Now, you, let's talk about the cost of entrepreneurship real quick.

18:54.380 --> 19:01.140
Yeah, because I think this is actually underappreciated, the fact that there are so many costs to entrepreneurship.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.300
So just sort of the baseline one, right?

19:03.500 --> 19:08.340
I hear a lot of students saying, it'll be great for my CV to be an entrepreneur.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.820
And I and actually the evidence is quite the opposite.

19:11.940 --> 19:15.860
It's actually not easier to get a job when you have entrepreneurial experience.

19:15.860 --> 19:16.660
It's the opposite.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.100
It's harder, right?

19:19.100 --> 19:26.420
And there are lots of reasons for that that have to do with organizations often wanting people to be specialized.

19:26.620 --> 19:27.020
Right.

19:27.220 --> 19:34.780
And I would say also, if I was an organization, I probably wouldn't want somebody who was a specialist in failing and very comfortable with failing.

19:34.780 --> 19:37.740
I would want people who didn't take huge risk, right?

19:37.940 --> 19:38.780
That's one part.

19:38.980 --> 19:47.260
The other part is that people who become entrepreneurs actually have lower lifetime earnings.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.620
Then then people who who have like steady wage employment.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.620
You are blowing my audience's mind right now, by the way.

19:54.620 --> 19:57.540
Yeah, OK, so this is an underappreciated fact.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.700
And the same actually goes for working in a startup.

19:59.900 --> 20:04.540
Working in a startup does not lead to higher lifetime earnings.

20:04.740 --> 20:09.140
And Steven, I mean, we can put the links to the to the data for this in the show.

20:09.140 --> 20:15.620
Please, please, let's do that because that's actually that's actually a real thing, right?

20:15.780 --> 20:22.060
Your earnings are generally lower, whether you are an entrepreneur or whether you whether you just work in a startup.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.300
Because the big because by the way, I want to be clear.

20:25.500 --> 20:31.740
The big idea is in a lot of these cases is, hey, the man, the nine to five is holding you down.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.460
You need to escape the rat race by becoming an entrepreneur.

20:35.460 --> 20:44.620
You need to escape that, live the lifestyle you are meant for with yachts, champagne and Lamborghinis by going to become an entrepreneurship.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.820
And you know what's going to help you?

20:46.020 --> 20:52.780
My whether it be a course or whatever form of entrepreneur help, the one entrepreneur help.

20:52.980 --> 21:00.420
And they get people in, the people aren't successful and either they quit and they go back to their job, just sort of worse for the wear.

21:00.620 --> 21:06.300
Or they just like persist and they keep beating their head against the same wall and maybe go buy a bunch of other products.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.420
So I do think this is so important for people to hear.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.500
Yeah, I mean, it's one of these things, right?

21:11.500 --> 21:20.140
We know that not to be like super technical, but the distribution of entrepreneurial outcomes is such that the average doesn't actually tell you anything.

21:20.340 --> 21:28.100
Because all the gains are not all the gains, but most of the gains are concentrated in a very few super winners, right?

21:28.300 --> 21:30.860
And lots of people who are just getting zero, right?

21:31.060 --> 21:35.300
The economics of this are a little bit like professional sports or music, right?

21:35.500 --> 21:40.500
There are some people who take out, take home all the earnings and lots of people who don't, right?

21:40.500 --> 21:43.540
So average is not particularly informative.

21:43.740 --> 21:49.620
Yeah, if you take the average between myself and Jeff Bezos, we both have an income of, you know, a billion dollar net worth.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.060
That means nothing for me, right?

21:51.260 --> 21:53.940
And that's that's your point.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.820
Very true.

21:56.020 --> 21:59.460
OK, so how can we get there?

21:59.660 --> 22:01.460
There are more costs that I think are worth mentioning.

22:01.660 --> 22:02.660
Go ahead.

22:02.860 --> 22:05.220
It was the bad news before we do.

22:05.340 --> 22:06.860
Yeah.

22:07.060 --> 22:13.740
Also, it seems it seems to be the case that entrepreneurs take more

22:13.940 --> 22:17.220
anti-depressants and psychoactive drugs, right?

22:17.420 --> 22:21.020
Not in the illicit sense, but in the clinical like.

22:21.220 --> 22:25.500
Yeah, because because entrepreneurship is incredibly stressful, right?

22:25.700 --> 22:30.300
If you were prone to depression, anxiety, things like that, it gets worse.

22:30.300 --> 22:34.220
And if you weren't prone, there's a good chance that it can push you over the edge.

22:34.380 --> 22:39.660
Often, the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with being an entrepreneur,

22:39.860 --> 22:43.940
if you're not particularly successful and the anxiety that comes with it, if you are, right?

22:44.140 --> 22:46.540
Because you have employees who you're responsible to.

22:46.740 --> 22:51.620
It actually takes quite a strong toll on people's private lives as well.

22:51.820 --> 23:00.500
So divorce rates are higher, for instance, and sort of probably just like relational strain all around, right?

23:00.700 --> 23:06.460
And you can see how this can be sort of compounded when when we're dealing with not

23:06.660 --> 23:11.740
just failed innovation driven entrepreneurship, but this sort of entrepreneur thing, right?

23:11.940 --> 23:13.420
Because there's some sort of, right?

23:13.620 --> 23:17.260
You can imagine how your partner who might be supportive, if you're trying something

23:17.460 --> 23:22.620
and being very sincere about it, might, you know, might support you as you're trying

23:22.820 --> 23:25.700
to build something in addition to not fail, just not succeeding.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.860
But if your partner is seeing through this, right?

23:27.860 --> 23:29.900
And seeing that this is just identity work,

23:30.060 --> 23:34.660
you can imagine how that strain gets stronger and you can imagine how once you start

23:34.860 --> 23:39.140
reflecting, once you've had a straight streak of failure and you see yourself as

23:39.340 --> 23:45.460
an entrepreneur, the psychological trauma can be sort of quite a lot stronger.

23:45.660 --> 23:49.740
And actually some of the depressing but interesting

23:49.940 --> 23:53.620
commentary on the paper after it came out has been from people saying like,

23:53.820 --> 23:59.300
I wasn't, I was a vibranian entrepreneur and it hurt me, right?

23:59.420 --> 24:02.860
So some pretty hard wrenching essays that I've been reading on that.

24:03.060 --> 24:05.420
Guys, in the comments, please put if you were a

24:05.620 --> 24:11.660
entrepreneur, say raise your hand, say I was a entrepreneur, we want to know.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.140
So go ahead.

24:13.340 --> 24:16.220
So basically, those are sort of the big things, right?

24:16.420 --> 24:21.340
We'll we'll be testing this out, of course, more empirically over the coming years.

24:21.540 --> 24:27.220
But the facts of the matter are that entrepreneurship is not a great profession.

24:27.340 --> 24:32.380
Right? It's it is sort of like trying to become a rock star NBA player.

24:32.580 --> 24:34.780
Right? It's very unlikely to succeed.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.100
Lots of downside risk.

24:37.300 --> 24:42.260
Yeah. And most people ignore the downside risk because there's this incredible

24:42.460 --> 24:46.580
lionization of the entrepreneurship life, right?

24:46.780 --> 24:51.540
You've got the constant bombardment of successful people and you almost never

24:51.740 --> 24:55.340
hear from the people who don't succeed because they are by definition sort of

24:55.380 --> 24:58.220
excluded out from the success magazine.

24:58.420 --> 25:02.220
And so you think to yourself, well, wow, look, it looks pretty great.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.140
Looks pretty awesome to be an entrepreneur.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.660
And I really appreciate you saying that.

25:05.660 --> 25:06.860
Also, people should go look up.

25:07.060 --> 25:09.020
I mean, a lot of entrepreneurs,

25:09.220 --> 25:12.700
even people that everyone thinks of as like the most inspirational, like people

25:12.700 --> 25:15.180
think like Elon Musk, the goat, you know, all that kind of stuff.

25:15.380 --> 25:19.220
He's the guy who's saying, hey, unless you like chewing glass, maybe don't be an

25:19.220 --> 25:22.300
entrepreneur. I mean, I think he said something like to that effect.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.420
Like it's really, really, really tough.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.420
And he's right about that.

25:27.620 --> 25:28.700
And even then, right?

25:28.900 --> 25:32.340
I mean, even if you look at really successful companies,

25:32.540 --> 25:36.580
it becomes quite obvious that the fact that they were successful, of course,

25:36.580 --> 25:39.020
it has something to do with them having some talent.

25:39.220 --> 25:40.620
Of course.

25:40.820 --> 25:43.140
But they also got lucky, right?

25:43.340 --> 25:46.820
If you look into the story of Twitch, for instance,

25:47.020 --> 25:51.740
pretty obvious that, I mean, it was not like Twitch was meant to be a great

25:51.860 --> 25:52.780
success from day one.

25:52.980 --> 25:55.500
Yeah. It started as Justin.TV, right?

25:55.700 --> 25:57.300
Yes. I'm interviewing.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.420
I'm interviewing the founder soon.

26:00.620 --> 26:01.940
Oh, great. Fabulous.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.420
Do you have anything to say?

26:04.620 --> 26:09.340
No, I mean, it's just like, I mean, they were obviously able to recognize

26:09.540 --> 26:11.340
an opportunity when it came.

26:11.540 --> 26:16.540
But they recognized a lot of opportunities that weren't really good opportunities.

26:16.740 --> 26:20.900
And I think, you know, not like they did great, right?

26:21.140 --> 26:24.820
But they were lucky also, too, in some respects.

26:25.020 --> 26:27.620
I think probably he will be the first to say that.

26:27.820 --> 26:32.060
I mean, enormously, because you had to sort of be the guy catching the wave of

26:32.260 --> 26:35.900
live streaming sort of and there's no way he probably fully understood what that

26:36.100 --> 26:41.260
meant or could have foreseen some, you know, Amazon buyout in his future.

26:41.460 --> 26:45.940
But yeah, I think so that's a really great point.

26:45.980 --> 26:51.740
Is that, of course, luck is involved and a huge, hugely involved.

26:51.940 --> 26:54.700
Let's talk about like one final thing.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.860
I love this. I love the past.

26:57.060 --> 26:59.500
Right. Is that

26:59.700 --> 27:03.220
people think that young people are good entrepreneurs, actually.

27:03.420 --> 27:06.900
And that's blatantly not true, actually.

27:07.100 --> 27:07.780
That is it.

27:07.980 --> 27:11.660
I just want to sort of insert that because now we're talking about Twitch and

27:11.860 --> 27:15.380
you were mentioning some like Elon Musk and these all were successful when they

27:15.500 --> 27:19.260
were young, right? And a lot of the cast of characters are the same, right?

27:19.460 --> 27:21.940
Mark Zuckerberg was very young, dropped out of school.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.700
Actually, there's really good evidence to

27:23.900 --> 27:28.140
suggest that the most successful founders are in their 40s.

27:28.340 --> 27:29.300
You're right.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.780
45 seems to be the good age to do it.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.420
And that makes a lot of sense, right?

27:33.620 --> 27:35.100
It does.

27:35.300 --> 27:39.180
Basically, because that's the point where you actually have some experience, right?

27:39.180 --> 27:40.900
You actually know what it's like to work in a company.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.420
You might have managerial experience.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.780
You might know an industry that you're entering.

27:44.900 --> 27:49.140
There's sort of this hype around young people being successful and that

27:49.340 --> 27:52.300
sometimes you'll hear people saying, oh, you don't need industry experience to

27:52.500 --> 27:55.260
succeed in an industry. It's actually an asset to not know anything.

27:55.460 --> 27:59.500
But it's actually some good evidence also in this that if you enter an industry

27:59.700 --> 28:04.340
with no experience as an entrepreneur, your chances of succeeding are very low.

28:04.540 --> 28:05.340
Yeah, of course.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.060
Right. Of course.

28:07.260 --> 28:08.100
Right. Of course.

28:08.300 --> 28:12.540
And the way to think about it probably is that the people who

28:12.700 --> 28:16.740
become successful when they're really young would probably also have been

28:16.740 --> 28:18.380
successful when they're older, right?

28:18.380 --> 28:21.180
So the fact that they become successful at young age is because they're just

28:21.380 --> 28:23.580
incredibly talented and lucky, right?

28:23.780 --> 28:25.820
They would have been successful at other points in time, too.

28:26.020 --> 28:28.780
Most of us need some time to get gone.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.740
Need to know what we're doing.

28:30.940 --> 28:36.940
I think that's so unbelievably important to mention is that,

28:37.140 --> 28:39.100
first of all, it makes so much sense.

28:39.100 --> 28:44.180
I'm glad you're just giving us the data on, you know, success and entrepreneurship

28:44.180 --> 28:47.900
because I think there is a huge misunderstanding and I've had this in my mind.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.340
I don't think I formally held it, but it's sort of

28:50.540 --> 28:53.700
mythologizing our culture to where a lot of people feel this way, even if they

28:53.700 --> 28:57.260
don't consciously hold this, that, yeah, young people are entrepreneurs.

28:57.260 --> 28:57.820
That's what you do.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.020
Like if you want to be an entrepreneur, you start young, right?

29:00.220 --> 29:02.300
You get the you get the failures out of the way.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.340
I've definitely probably internalized that.

29:05.540 --> 29:11.700
And there is an idea, too, that you don't need domain expertise.

29:11.900 --> 29:17.100
This is a big idea that you can just sort of be Elizabeth Holmes and you can just

29:17.300 --> 29:23.660
walk into blood technology and you can just innovate because that's what Silicon Valley does.

29:24.380 --> 29:26.740
Explain to us

29:26.940 --> 29:29.980
why we need domain expertise.

29:30.180 --> 29:35.020
I mean, I get that it's a bit obvious, but maybe we should just you should just explain.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.500
Well, I mean, again, it depends on the industry, right?

29:38.700 --> 29:44.860
But I mean, very often being able to even understand the technology in a given field,

29:45.060 --> 29:48.140
right, will will be very important.

29:48.340 --> 29:52.980
Understanding the business models that underpin a given field is going to be very

29:53.180 --> 29:59.140
important very often, being able to understand the right people to hire will often be very

29:59.140 --> 30:03.500
important and be able to engage in the networks and in the industry culture will

30:03.500 --> 30:04.820
often be very important as well.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.980
I mean, you're trying to compete for the same customers, right?

30:08.180 --> 30:12.140
So having industry experience will often let you understand the customers that you're

30:12.340 --> 30:13.380
going to be dealing with, right?

30:13.580 --> 30:18.340
Or very often we find that people, right, they work in a given industry construction,

30:18.340 --> 30:21.060
for instance, and then they develop an innovation that they're going to sell to

30:21.260 --> 30:22.660
construction companies, right?

30:22.860 --> 30:26.340
Because during their work, they identify a problem and then they come up with a

30:26.540 --> 30:31.100
solution for it that they then sell to their old company and companies like it, right?

30:31.140 --> 30:34.940
So industry experience is going to let you know what are actually the problems in

30:35.140 --> 30:38.700
industry and all of that is going to be generative and it's going to help you

30:38.900 --> 30:42.820
not just get good ideas, it's also going to help you sort bad ideas from good ideas.

30:43.020 --> 30:46.260
So what are the low value things as things that are never going to fly?

30:46.460 --> 30:50.500
So what you're telling people is it can help to get that industry experience first

30:50.700 --> 30:54.780
because you're now making money instead of just like floating and probably losing money.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.860
You can do that.

30:56.060 --> 30:57.820
You can gain industry experience.

30:57.820 --> 30:59.060
You can identify a need.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.500
You can gain that domain expertise.

31:00.580 --> 31:03.220
You identify a need once you have that domain expertise.

31:03.420 --> 31:10.180
And then you launch a company later in your life when you're actually more likely

31:10.380 --> 31:13.860
to succeed due to your now you have experience.

31:14.060 --> 31:19.060
Plus at that point, you will maybe be in a different place financially.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.980
Yes, which can also be very important.

31:21.180 --> 31:25.820
Like one of the things that I find really depressing is that venture capital will

31:25.820 --> 31:29.420
often say that before you ask for venture capital, you should do friends and family

31:29.540 --> 31:33.620
around, which basically means you should ask your parents for money or your friends.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.540
Right. It's a very nice way of saying, yeah.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.940
When when when you're young, you're going to be asking your parents for money.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.460
Right. And sometimes parents will do that.

31:42.660 --> 31:46.540
Right. But often, like if you're not coming out of a very wealthy family,

31:46.740 --> 31:50.180
they will be giving you their life earnings for your idea.

31:50.380 --> 31:55.140
And you can easily imagine how that really is going to strain relationships

31:55.340 --> 31:56.420
if you don't succeed.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.900
There's a real social downside to that.

31:59.380 --> 32:03.100
The fact is, if you wait until later, the chances are that you will have friends

32:03.300 --> 32:06.860
who friends who actually have money and who understand the industry and can help

32:07.060 --> 32:09.700
you, not just with money, but also with other things.

32:09.900 --> 32:13.140
It also pains me when people like borrow against their house or something like

32:13.340 --> 32:15.500
that, right? To persist in a venture.

32:15.700 --> 32:16.940
It's very painful, right?

32:17.140 --> 32:21.300
As sort of a precautionary principle, I would if you know that entrepreneurship

32:21.500 --> 32:25.180
is really risky, right, you should think about it like buying lottery tickets.

32:25.180 --> 32:27.540
You should only bet with house money, so to speak.

32:27.580 --> 32:30.900
You should only pay with money that you can avoid to that you can that you don't

32:31.100 --> 32:32.140
mind losing. Yeah.

32:32.340 --> 32:37.540
And you should definitely set hard stops for yourself in the right sense.

32:37.740 --> 32:39.340
You can just digging. Yeah.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.580
Yeah, you can keep digging.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.780
You can keep squeezing out more, right?

32:42.980 --> 32:47.620
And but if you know that entrepreneurial success is really unlikely,

32:47.820 --> 32:48.700
you wouldn't do that.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.740
You'd be if you knew that success was rare, you would treat it.

32:52.740 --> 32:56.180
And if you knew that it was like essentially buying a lottery ticket, right?

32:56.420 --> 32:59.500
You would treat it differently than if you thought that success was just around

32:59.700 --> 33:03.180
the corner. And so that's one of the things that I would sort of push people for,

33:03.380 --> 33:08.340
right? Know that it's not very likely to succeed and treat it as such.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.220
Let's talk about entrepreneurship advice.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.980
There's this huge entrepreneurship,

33:12.180 --> 33:17.180
entrepreneur industry, which is just like constantly bombarding people with

33:17.380 --> 33:21.700
entrepreneurship advice, the blueprint to success as it were.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.620
That's the words I hear a lot.

33:23.620 --> 33:27.860
I'm sure that's not an academic term, the blueprint for success.

33:28.060 --> 33:29.820
But it does happen on the time.

33:30.020 --> 33:37.900
Now, one thing that drives me crazy to no end is that a lot of

33:38.100 --> 33:44.860
these things can be true, but sort of not helpful or like sometimes true,

33:45.060 --> 33:46.300
but not always true.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.700
How do you have a very specific circumstances?

33:48.900 --> 33:49.340
Right.

33:49.500 --> 33:56.780
How do you see entrepreneurship advice helping and hurting people with regards

33:56.980 --> 34:01.260
to this sort of one entrepreneur identity that people are cultivating?

34:01.460 --> 34:03.540
OK, so in a couple of different ways, right?

34:03.540 --> 34:06.300
I think it's worth just sort of underscoring that point, right?

34:06.500 --> 34:10.260
That a lot of the advice you get seems really sensible,

34:10.460 --> 34:13.780
sometimes counterintuitive, but sensible sometimes, right?

34:13.780 --> 34:15.020
Let's give some of that advice.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.820
Yeah. So, for instance, you should really get comfortable with failure.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.740
Right? That's like very generic, right?

34:21.940 --> 34:22.260
Yeah.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.740
Some things surrounding like the minimal viable product, for instance, right?

34:25.740 --> 34:28.860
You should this idea that you should just like try to get something together,

34:29.060 --> 34:33.700
put it in front of customers, accept that it's not very good and try to learn

34:33.900 --> 34:34.860
from the experience.

34:35.060 --> 34:35.740
Right.

34:35.940 --> 34:42.340
Other advice, like just pitch, pitch, pitch, just don't take no for an answer.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.420
Try your idea with many, many investors.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.380
If they don't give you money, keep going.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.140
Yep.

34:48.140 --> 34:51.980
Now, all those things, I think, can seem reasonable, right?

34:51.980 --> 34:56.380
And it seems to be the case that you can find successful companies that have done

34:56.380 --> 34:59.820
that, right? You can also find lots of successful companies that didn't do that.

34:59.820 --> 35:02.620
You can find successful companies that did do it, but that wasn't the reason

35:02.620 --> 35:03.340
that they succeeded.

35:03.340 --> 35:06.380
You can find lots of unsuccessful companies that did it, right?

35:06.580 --> 35:07.500
That did something similar.

35:07.700 --> 35:12.700
So if you take something like the minimal viable product, right?

35:12.900 --> 35:16.740
There's a way in which telling people to just like try to get something

35:16.740 --> 35:21.580
together, put it in front of customers, if they don't like it, right?

35:21.780 --> 35:25.940
I mean, I think it's the Reed Hoffman of LinkedIn has this idea that if you're

35:25.940 --> 35:29.180
not ashamed of the first version of your product, you're doing it wrong.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.500
I think it's important to keep in mind that failure is never good.

35:32.700 --> 35:37.020
Sometimes you need to build up a certain tolerance for failure to take risk, right?

35:37.220 --> 35:38.900
But failure is never good.

35:39.100 --> 35:43.500
It's, we should say, just to be clear, it's not good in of itself.

35:43.660 --> 35:47.380
I mean, I think a lot of times it's lionized because the examples people are

35:47.580 --> 35:51.820
using are successes that are failures that led to future successes.

35:52.020 --> 35:55.980
But people can conflate that with like, oh, it means that when I'm failing,

35:56.180 --> 35:58.060
this is like a sign of my success.

35:58.260 --> 36:01.700
And I'm doing something right, right?

36:01.900 --> 36:02.660
That's one thing.

36:02.860 --> 36:06.900
The other thing is like the pitch to investors, right?

36:06.900 --> 36:09.820
And keep pitching if they don't accept your idea, right?

36:10.020 --> 36:14.500
Well, you know, there's a way to think about getting rejected by investors,

36:14.700 --> 36:16.980
which is that maybe your idea is just bad, right?

36:17.180 --> 36:21.860
Maybe maybe that is experience and good judgment telling you that this is not the

36:22.060 --> 36:26.340
way to go, right? And maybe persisting, right?

36:26.340 --> 36:28.820
There are companies that persist and succeed.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.660
But there are also lots of companies that persist and don't succeed.

36:32.860 --> 36:37.820
I think that's sort of important to keep in mind that you sometimes you need to

36:37.820 --> 36:41.700
take no for an answer because it's because that is information that you're

36:41.700 --> 36:42.540
doing something wrong.

36:42.740 --> 36:45.740
And I think generally like the whole normalization of failure,

36:45.940 --> 36:50.300
it's actually part of why you can keep people in ventures that are not doing well,

36:50.500 --> 36:54.820
right? Saying that failure is part of the recipe and they just need to wait.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.140
The success is around the corner.

36:56.340 --> 37:00.780
I think that is it's a really counterintuitive way for most people to think.

37:00.780 --> 37:02.740
And it's good that it's counterintuitive.

37:02.940 --> 37:07.100
You should be more sort of concise about what you mean when you say the failure is

37:07.180 --> 37:13.500
good. Yeah, I think that the tricky thing is, is that for some people,

37:13.700 --> 37:18.100
that really is how they succeed is they just keep failing and they get they sort

37:18.300 --> 37:20.380
of accumulate experience through failure.

37:20.580 --> 37:24.740
And I think that's the that's the kind of meaning behind when people say this.

37:24.940 --> 37:29.740
But what you're saying is yes, but there are a lot of people who take that advice,

37:29.940 --> 37:34.260
which might be good in a corner case or in a case of, you know, this person over

37:34.260 --> 37:38.460
here for Reed Hoffman, it might be good with his minimal viable embarrassing

37:38.660 --> 37:43.140
product, but it could be really bad for a lot of other entrepreneurs.

37:43.340 --> 37:45.780
And you should be smart about

37:45.980 --> 37:49.540
taking that advice or sort of like holding it very loosely.

37:49.740 --> 37:50.980
That type of advice.

37:51.180 --> 37:56.420
Yes, you should definitely you should definitely think about how far am I willing

37:56.420 --> 37:58.980
to go and I think you should commit to that for the fact.

37:59.180 --> 38:03.300
This is the amount of time that I will spend trying to get this to work.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.860
Because people are going to have different

38:07.060 --> 38:09.980
circumstances that allow them to take more or less risk.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.780
And it's easy to just sort of get pulled in.

38:11.980 --> 38:15.940
This is what economists sometimes call the sunk cost fallacy, right?

38:16.140 --> 38:20.060
Or if I spent a year on it, I might as well spend another month, right?

38:20.260 --> 38:22.300
And I think that's definitely worth considering.

38:22.500 --> 38:27.060
And I mean, some of the advice is much more technically we call it contingent

38:27.260 --> 38:29.460
than it's given credit for, right?

38:29.660 --> 38:32.100
It might work, but it might also just not work at all.

38:32.220 --> 38:37.620
And and being smart about when that advice is going to apply is very difficult.

38:37.820 --> 38:42.420
And I think and the basic problem is this, I think people pursue.

38:42.620 --> 38:46.100
People go to ask for advice because they don't know what to do.

38:46.300 --> 38:47.420
Right? So they have a very different.

38:47.620 --> 38:52.340
So if you knew how to gauge the value of the advice, you wouldn't be asking the

38:52.540 --> 38:54.220
advice very often.

38:54.420 --> 38:58.660
So by definition, when you get the advice, you are sort of hard to know if it's good.

38:58.860 --> 39:01.460
Good advice, very hard to know if it's good advice when you get it.

39:01.540 --> 39:05.300
Because if you knew whether it was good advice, you wouldn't need good advice.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.540
That's hilarious.

39:06.740 --> 39:10.100
So I think it's very worthwhile to sort of trying to separate yourself.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.100
Right? The basic thing that you should probably do, I think, is to say,

39:13.300 --> 39:16.380
how much time and how much money am I willing to invest in this?

39:16.580 --> 39:18.300
Correct. And commit to that, right?

39:18.500 --> 39:22.020
And say it might be that success is just around the corner,

39:22.220 --> 39:23.620
but I don't know if I can wait that long.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.580
Right? That's one thing.

39:24.780 --> 39:28.500
And then the other thing is to definitely use some work to separate oneself from the

39:28.500 --> 39:35.100
hype, say, OK, I don't care if it worked for Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.340
What are the chances that this might work for me?

39:37.540 --> 39:40.580
And then treat your idea as something that you're trying to prove out that it won't

39:40.780 --> 39:43.620
work so that you can get out, right?

39:43.820 --> 39:46.700
Prove out that this is too good of an opportunity

39:46.900 --> 39:48.980
to not abandon, right?

39:49.180 --> 39:50.740
Right. I think that's the way to think about it.

39:50.940 --> 39:54.940
And don't be afraid to pick up some industry experience

39:55.140 --> 39:58.340
before you jump into your, you know, your big idea.

39:58.540 --> 40:02.460
I know every idea seems like it's pressing and it has to be done right now.

40:02.660 --> 40:07.260
But I think you made a really compelling argument to maybe hold off a bit,

40:07.460 --> 40:11.620
get some get some real world experience before you go launch

40:11.820 --> 40:14.060
your entrepreneurship career.

40:14.260 --> 40:18.780
And I mean, like not every idea is worth dropping out of school for, right?

40:18.980 --> 40:21.940
And there's a big difference between dropping out of school because you think

40:21.940 --> 40:23.340
it's too easy, right?

40:23.540 --> 40:26.780
If you're in Mark Zuckerberg and leaving Harvard because you think it's too easy,

40:26.980 --> 40:29.780
that's very different from dropping out of

40:29.980 --> 40:33.180
pretty much any other school because you're staying out quite relevant.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.980
Yeah, that's very different.

40:35.180 --> 40:39.300
And that's a very different sort of information you're getting about your potential.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.700
And to be very clear, no, no, no, absolutely.

40:42.900 --> 40:48.420
To be super clear, you can look at the outcomes of people with

40:48.500 --> 40:52.420
degrees and especially like Ivy educated degrees.

40:52.420 --> 40:56.500
And you can look at the difference between that and people who have dropped out

40:56.700 --> 41:01.980
on the list of billionaires, like 30 millionaires and up.

41:02.180 --> 41:06.940
It is just overwhelmingly dominated by people who have,

41:07.140 --> 41:12.260
you know, sunk a bunch of time into their education, regardless of whether you

41:12.460 --> 41:16.100
think education is overpriced or not.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.900
Yes, it probably is.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.940
But it's also underutilized, I think, if you sort of have the willingness

41:21.940 --> 41:26.420
in the drive to become an entrepreneur and to work as hard as some people are for that.

41:26.620 --> 41:30.140
I think there's a way to get much more out of college than most people do.

41:30.340 --> 41:31.620
But that's a separate discussion.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.020
But sure, I think that's interesting.

41:34.220 --> 41:39.500
Underutilized probably probably you mean in the sense of how you're using the resource, right?

41:39.700 --> 41:44.060
You're using the access to people who know something, how you're using the access

41:44.060 --> 41:48.340
to networks, how you're using the access to information.

41:48.340 --> 41:52.140
I mean, there's no shortage of people going to college and, you know,

41:52.340 --> 41:55.020
but and just kind of benefiting as much as they could.

41:55.220 --> 41:57.300
Yes, yes, yes, much attention.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.060
You know what?

41:58.260 --> 42:00.820
I think there needs to be a paper about the

42:01.020 --> 42:05.540
Véblenian college student because there's certainly like an identity class of like,

42:05.740 --> 42:08.140
oh, I'm just, you know, going to school.

42:08.340 --> 42:10.380
That's a separate discussion for a separate time.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.940
But but absolutely.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.020
Yeah, yeah.

42:14.220 --> 42:20.700
So one of the things you shot an email about is alternative strategies for people.

42:20.700 --> 42:21.940
You talked about Joshua Gantz.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.100
We talked about that yet at MIT.

42:24.300 --> 42:27.100
We haven't. Joshua Gantz is at Toronto

42:27.300 --> 42:32.820
and has done some interesting work with with Scott Stern at MIT.

42:33.020 --> 42:37.980
And they basically have a whole series of papers about you can actually get the book for free.

42:37.980 --> 42:41.100
It's online. If you search for entrepreneurial strategy,

42:41.300 --> 42:43.540
you will be taken to the website and you get the book for free.

42:43.740 --> 42:45.460
It's it's a really good book.

42:45.660 --> 42:46.500
Highly recommend it.

42:46.700 --> 42:51.900
One of the reasons I mentioned that in our pre pre discussion was that

42:52.100 --> 42:57.340
people sometimes have the impression that disruption is the way to be an entrepreneur.

42:57.540 --> 42:59.500
Right. Disruption is one of these things.

42:59.700 --> 43:05.660
Right. You should really go after challenging industries, upsetting the incumbents, things like that.

43:05.860 --> 43:09.780
I recommend that book because it's so helpful for thinking about different

43:09.780 --> 43:14.740
strategies and often less risky strategies to pursue with ideas.

43:14.940 --> 43:15.300
Right.

43:15.500 --> 43:19.220
There are going to be cases where disruption is probably the right path for an

43:19.420 --> 43:23.620
entrepreneur to take, but there are often alternative strategies that are worth

43:23.820 --> 43:29.420
considering and testing out that will like disruptions, probably like the most risky

43:29.620 --> 43:31.820
thing you could do. Right.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.620
Right. You're trying to change.

43:33.820 --> 43:39.420
You're trying to fundamentally change an industry unseat incumbents.

43:39.660 --> 43:44.980
And like established firms, like trying to take down Blockbuster, Ford,

43:45.180 --> 43:47.780
whichever, like name your industry incumbents.

43:47.980 --> 43:53.260
Right. And very often that is going to be an incredibly risky strategy for all kinds

43:53.460 --> 43:56.860
of obvious reasons. Their work is interesting, I think, because it can probably help people

43:57.060 --> 44:01.420
think about the value of doing some things that are less risky, but nonetheless,

44:01.620 --> 44:04.740
that are going to be lucrative and interesting for many people, especially if you have

44:04.940 --> 44:09.300
industry experience, there are going to be ways to think about any given idea.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.460
In more or less risky ways.

44:11.660 --> 44:18.940
Do you think there's a the reason that we only think largely of, you know,

44:19.140 --> 44:23.380
I guess, being an entrepreneur in terms of disruption because of the fact that all

44:23.580 --> 44:27.740
of the cases that a lot of people immediately think of when they think of like

44:27.940 --> 44:32.700
entrepreneur, they think of recent examples where you had this emerging

44:32.900 --> 44:37.460
technology that really changed everything and it made disruption very easily

44:37.500 --> 44:40.100
possible for, you know, some industries.

44:40.300 --> 44:45.540
And so you had these like monsters come out like Facebook, Tesla, all these companies,

44:45.740 --> 44:49.940
which it's like so we always think of those because those are the most,

44:50.140 --> 44:54.580
you know, the biggest examples, but maybe the most common example of the examples

44:54.580 --> 44:58.660
that actually are bearing out for a lot of people are not the disruptive cases.

44:58.660 --> 45:00.020
And that's maybe what you're saying.

45:00.220 --> 45:05.260
Exactly. The thing like lots of people will or lots of entrepreneurial companies

45:05.420 --> 45:09.140
will be faced with a choice of whether to do something that is disruptive and high

45:09.340 --> 45:14.100
risk, or maybe something that is not quite as disruptive, more oriented towards

45:14.300 --> 45:18.740
what their book calls value change strategies, where you're basically trying

45:18.940 --> 45:22.220
to help other companies do well and succeed, right?

45:22.420 --> 45:25.500
That often is something that works best if you actually have industry experience,

45:25.500 --> 45:28.780
as we talked about before, because you know the organization's in an industry

45:28.780 --> 45:32.340
and you can say, what are the pain points and how can I sort of try to solve those

45:32.340 --> 45:33.220
in an interesting way?

45:33.260 --> 45:37.540
So I'd highly recommend that for most people to sort of just broaden

45:37.740 --> 45:41.300
if you want to be an entrepreneur, if you if that is for you, right?

45:41.300 --> 45:44.620
And if you're comfortable with all the risk and all the downsides that we've talked

45:44.820 --> 45:48.900
about, right, I definitely encourage people to read that as sort of a way to

45:49.100 --> 45:54.300
broaden their imagination about how you can be an entrepreneur.

45:54.500 --> 45:56.460
Because there are many, many more ways to do it.

45:56.660 --> 45:59.500
And the Silicon Valley model is just one

45:59.700 --> 46:01.700
and it's not going to be the right one for lots of people.

46:01.900 --> 46:03.740
It's definitely a very risky one.

46:03.940 --> 46:05.580
I think that's so important.

46:05.780 --> 46:11.380
And one thing I want to remind the audience of is that neither myself

46:11.580 --> 46:15.740
nor Dr. Hartman are against entrepreneurs.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.660
No, no, quite the contrary.

46:18.860 --> 46:19.700
Quite the contrary.

46:19.900 --> 46:24.380
This is about getting people to have better outcomes by thinking more critically

46:24.580 --> 46:29.900
about being an entrepreneur, what that means, because what your your paper kind

46:29.900 --> 46:34.220
of compellingly crafts a narrative for is that there's sort of a

46:34.420 --> 46:38.700
there's an entrepreneur ideology that sort of a lot of people just sort of buy

46:38.700 --> 46:41.620
into just like the disruptive idea that everyone just sort of thinks, oh,

46:41.620 --> 46:42.620
that's the way you start a company.

46:42.820 --> 46:46.300
And of course, it's just one of the many ways you could start a company.

46:46.500 --> 46:50.380
There are a lot of useful ways to thinking about entrepreneurship, that if you're

46:50.580 --> 46:54.700
going into it, it is important to know you have to not just think, you know,

46:54.700 --> 46:55.980
only positive thoughts all the time.

46:55.980 --> 47:00.140
You have to know the risks part of being a successful entrepreneur is

47:00.340 --> 47:03.740
understanding and hedging against risk.

47:03.940 --> 47:06.540
It is so undervalued.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.940
Sorry, I don't just got a little

47:09.140 --> 47:13.580
that is an excellent summary.

47:13.780 --> 47:18.220
I think the and I think that's definitely very important to really appreciate.

47:18.420 --> 47:19.220
Is this for me?

47:19.420 --> 47:23.940
Right? Like we talked about this, that there is being an entrepreneur has something

47:23.980 --> 47:28.340
of trying to be a professional athlete about it.

47:28.540 --> 47:29.740
Right? Right?

47:29.940 --> 47:35.540
If so, that for most people should be a red flag saying, no, I'm not going to do that.

47:35.740 --> 47:38.580
If you are called to do it, right?

47:38.780 --> 47:41.340
Then you should definitely know the ins and outs of it.

47:41.340 --> 47:44.460
You should think about the different ways that you can approach this.

47:44.660 --> 47:48.220
You know about the kind of things that are really risky and the kinds of things

47:48.220 --> 47:51.100
that will get you injured and the things that will push you out of the game.

47:51.300 --> 47:51.860
Right? Yeah.

47:51.980 --> 47:54.900
And that will lead you to costs that you don't want to bear.

47:55.100 --> 47:57.620
I think that's really important.

47:57.820 --> 47:59.300
Because as you say,

47:59.500 --> 48:03.620
entrepreneurship is super important, but well functioning entrepreneurship is even

48:03.820 --> 48:07.020
more important, like the economy does not work without entrepreneurship.

48:07.220 --> 48:09.900
We tried economies without entrepreneurship.

48:09.900 --> 48:13.740
It was called the Soviet Union and it wasn't great, right?

48:13.940 --> 48:16.980
So we need entrepreneurship a lot.

48:17.180 --> 48:20.700
But we also needed to work well and we need people to not be

48:20.940 --> 48:25.660
misled about what it is and the kinds of risks that are involved for sure.

48:25.860 --> 48:30.260
And the realities of how to do better at entrepreneurship.

48:30.260 --> 48:34.020
I mean, I think the funny thing is is you are presenting us with sort of like hard

48:34.220 --> 48:38.020
data on what so many other people are promising to make you a better entrepreneur.

48:38.220 --> 48:43.460
And you're telling us what entrepreneurship success looks like in the data.

48:43.660 --> 48:48.860
And I think that's so important for people who are, you know, in the audience who are

48:48.900 --> 48:51.100
interested in that to really take the heart.

48:51.300 --> 48:56.020
So I will link, we will talk about a lot of the papers and the sources you cited

48:56.220 --> 49:00.900
for statistics related to success, you know, when you're young or when you're old.

49:01.100 --> 49:03.740
We'll talk about, you know, education.

49:03.940 --> 49:07.700
We'll have the educational strategy book linked in the show notes.

49:07.900 --> 49:14.060
And also, of course, I will be linking the paper, which I found I was such a

49:14.260 --> 49:17.540
I have cited that paper a bunch of times, sort of informally on the channel.

49:17.540 --> 49:21.780
And I knew I always wanted to do an interview about it because it's

49:21.980 --> 49:23.740
it holds a near and dear place to my heart.

49:23.940 --> 49:25.460
But let's be clear.

49:25.660 --> 49:28.380
This is a this is a theory, right?

49:28.580 --> 49:34.260
Like this is part of academia is that you are proposing a theory to fit

49:34.460 --> 49:38.740
data that you know is happening, which is like declining entrepreneur outcomes.

49:38.940 --> 49:40.860
Would you like to talk about that a bit a little bit?

49:41.060 --> 49:44.340
Like hedge a little bit about what we're talking about, right?

49:44.340 --> 49:49.980
So so I think people should read the paper, actually, because what we're doing

49:50.180 --> 49:53.740
is we're proposing a way that things might work, right?

49:53.740 --> 49:56.420
And there are different interpretations that one could make.

49:56.620 --> 49:59.980
What we're suggesting is essentially a hypothesis, right?

50:00.180 --> 50:04.820
Academic production is such that you often have what's called a conceptual paper,

50:05.020 --> 50:06.180
which lays out an idea.

50:06.380 --> 50:10.980
And then you have empirical studies that do that basically present data, right?

50:11.220 --> 50:14.300
And we're in the process of beginning those

50:14.500 --> 50:19.780
the data collection and but are producing different hypothesis, hypothesis papers.

50:19.980 --> 50:21.740
And this is one, right?

50:21.940 --> 50:24.620
The paper that you can find online now is not published yet.

50:24.820 --> 50:26.900
So it hasn't been through peer review.

50:27.100 --> 50:29.620
The peer reviewed version will be out

50:29.820 --> 50:33.820
by summer, it has been accepted for for a journal, which is called

50:34.020 --> 50:38.060
Research in the Sociology of Organizations, but that will come out.

50:38.060 --> 50:42.100
And when you say a lot of when when you talk about hard data,

50:42.100 --> 50:44.220
I should say this is not data that we have collected.

50:44.420 --> 50:47.780
This is data from other studies just sort of to be clear.

50:47.980 --> 50:48.980
Yeah, absolutely.

50:49.180 --> 50:55.140
Interpretation that we're offering is is also not a is not proven out by data.

50:55.340 --> 50:58.980
And it's not a widely accepted view, right?

50:59.180 --> 51:02.260
I mean, there's quite a lot of consensus that

51:02.460 --> 51:04.340
entrepreneurial quality is declining.

51:04.340 --> 51:09.460
It's not a unanimously help you, but it's pretty close.

51:10.060 --> 51:13.220
So that is a that is sort of a real thing.

51:13.420 --> 51:15.740
The idea that the linking of the

51:15.740 --> 51:18.740
entrepreneurship ideologies to the entrepreneurship industry to declining

51:18.940 --> 51:23.580
entrepreneurial quality is sort of that's that's our right.

51:23.780 --> 51:25.220
That's our idea and it's conjecture.

51:25.420 --> 51:27.140
I think yeah, yeah, right?

51:27.340 --> 51:29.060
Yeah, just to be clear.

51:29.260 --> 51:31.220
Oh, no, no, I appreciate it.

51:31.300 --> 51:34.260
I appreciate how careful you are.

51:34.260 --> 51:36.860
And I think that's an important part of any kind of,

51:37.060 --> 51:40.660
you know, if you're going to be in academia, that's that's part of your job.

51:40.860 --> 51:41.540
Right.

51:41.740 --> 51:45.340
Is to tell people like what's settled, what's not.

51:45.540 --> 51:47.220
And I appreciate you doing that.

51:47.420 --> 51:50.300
Dr. Hartman, thank you so much for coming on the show.

51:50.500 --> 51:55.740
I hope people got a lot of to use a loaded expression of value out of out of that.

51:55.940 --> 51:56.540
I hope so too.

51:56.740 --> 51:57.540
Absolutely.

51:57.660 --> 52:03.380
So I hope some more informed career choices will ensue.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.380
Same here. Thank you so much.

52:05.580 --> 52:07.340
Thank you for the opportunity.

52:07.540 --> 52:08.380
Have a great day.

52:08.580 --> 52:09.940
We'll see you next time.
