1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
What entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,180
Maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up confidence.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,420
Success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly likely. It is rare, right?

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,620
That is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science. It's really rare.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:27,140
Maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea, right?

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,500
Instead of saying, let me take this idea and see if I can make it work.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,100
You should do experiments and sort of prove out that the idea does not work.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,900
And if it turns out the idea does not work, you should get out of it.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,740
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Coffeezilla.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,500
Today we are talking to someone I've been kind of a fan of his work for a long time.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,220
But finally, I get to sit down and talk with him.

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,260
This is Dr. Hartman of the Copenhagen Business School.

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:07,780
He is an associate professor, and he wrote a paper about the, I'm going to totally mess this up, the Voblin, Vleblinian entrepreneur,

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,980
AKA, I just want to say, because I want to call it this during this show, the Wontrepreneur sort of thing.

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,020
And it's towards an un-entrepreneurial economy, the entrepreneurship industry and the rise of the Vleblinian entrepreneur.

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,980
Can you summarize that idea for us real quick?

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,660
Because I think it's a really interesting concept.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,540
Yeah. So the, thank you for the introduction, Stephen, by the way, and thank you for the opportunity.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:49,860
So the Vleblinian entrepreneur is a, or let's call it the Wontrepreneur, that's fine too, is our effort to sort of put a label on what I think a lot of people are seeing, right?

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:02:01,060
The fact that there is, that there are people starting entrepreneurship, not so much with the intention of actually becoming innovation-driven entrepreneurs,

21
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:09,660
but more actually to just sort of engage in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and to build up the kind of identity that comes with that.

22
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,940
So basically, is entrepreneurship pursued for identity purposes, not productive purposes?

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:26,340
You guys have all seen this at your, whether it's your university, you've seen it at these, you know, some coffee shops, it's a lot of times people are pursuing entrepreneurship,

24
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:34,380
just to sort of tell you that they're an entrepreneur kind of idea, like the whole thing of like, you know, I'm a CEO, well, when did your company start?

25
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,340
Well, yesterday. And you're like, oh, okay, that's very interesting.

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:50,220
And part of your paper argues, you're trying to, if I understand it right, you're trying to explain a set of sort of problems or ideas in the field,

27
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:00,660
one of which is that, okay, we see that entrepreneurship leads to all sorts of good things in the economy, but largely this is driven by a few companies.

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:10,020
And then you also see that, oh, well, actually, there's the sort of the failing entrepreneurs or people who kind of have undersized results,

29
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,460
and there's people like Amazon, Apple, you know, all these companies that are driving the majority of the US economy.

30
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:27,620
You're saying that it's actually becoming more prevalent and you're getting more and more sort of failing entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem as proportional to their successful counterparts.

31
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,540
And you're wondering why, and you're sort of saying there's this industry around entrepreneurs? Is that basically the idea?

32
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,300
Yes, and that's, and that's causing a particular kind of entrepreneurial firm to pop up.

33
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,940
And the kind of firm that is causing pop up is what we call the blinding of entrepreneurs.

34
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,860
So, so basically, it's not our observation that the quality of entrepreneurship is falling.

35
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:04,420
That's from other work, which is referenced in the paper, but basically finding that, like, people tend to think that the US is incredibly entrepreneurial, and that's actually not the case by international standards.

36
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,500
Entrepreneurship is also becoming more rare in the US.

37
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:17,820
There are fewer and fewer entrepreneurial companies, in the sense that there are fewer startups, and the quality of those startups is declining.

38
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,420
All right, all bad things.

39
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,860
All bad things.

40
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,940
As you say, it's true that there are like entrepreneurial companies play a potentially very big role in the economy, right?

41
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,100
There's things that entrepreneurial, entrepreneurial companies do that establish companies don't do.

42
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,220
So economic dynamism is very much dependent on having well-functioning entrepreneurship, right?

43
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,700
But that is, that seems to be becoming more rare.

44
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,580
And there are all sorts of explanations that you could have for that.

45
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,460
You might say that, for instance, incumbent market power is increasing, right?

46
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:01,740
So Google, Facebook, and Amazon are basically buying up and closing down all the really potentially promising entrepreneurial companies before they become big, right?

47
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,900
That's one vision of it.

48
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,980
The other is that there is, that there's just fewer good ideas to go around, right?

49
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,140
That the good ideas are getting harder to find.

50
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,740
And you could also say that entrepreneurship education maybe is getting worse, right?

51
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,060
So entrepreneurs are more poorly prepared, more poorly prepared for entrepreneurship.

52
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,700
You might say something about venture capital not working very well.

53
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,020
All of those arguments are valid and, you know, social sciences such that usually things are really complex and things interact.

54
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:47,660
The thing that we're saying with that paper is that our understanding of the decline in entrepreneurial quality has not taken into account that there has been this really rapidly growing and by now quite large entrepreneurship industry,

55
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,060
which are companies that target entrepreneurs as their consumers, right?

56
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,900
And, and, and, right.

57
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:59,620
And purportedly help entrepreneurs to identify and develop ideas into profitable, profitable businesses.

58
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:08,260
Let's maybe expand on the types of like sort of entrepreneur help that one might see in this industry, right?

59
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,260
Yes.

60
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,580
So you can, there are different things, right?

61
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,420
The, you mentioned that people will have seen this at their universities, right?

62
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,140
Many universities now have sort of these entrepreneurship hubs, right?

63
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,900
That could be classed as a kind of entrepreneurship industry.

64
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,700
This is something which is marketing to entrepreneurs to try to help them.

65
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,260
There is lots of, there's a lot of academic writing on this.

66
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,620
Books by academics, books by practitioners, like experienced entrepreneurs who then give advice.

67
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,620
There's a lot of sort of, you would call it back office support for entrepreneurs, right?

68
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,340
We'll do your accounting, we'll do your legal, we'll do your admin.

69
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,020
There are lots of entrepreneurship conferences, expos.

70
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,340
There's lots of online media.

71
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,060
Shark Tank, stuff like that.

72
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
Shark Tank on television.

73
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,500
And then there's also like the Dutch type of business magazine, right?

74
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,780
Wired, Fast Company, things like that.

75
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,500
And basically a heap of books that you can get off of Amazon or anywhere else.

76
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,420
They'll talk to you about, tell you about how to become a successful entrepreneur, right?

77
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,380
So there's a whole sort of suite of this that all sorts, that all sort pretends to help entrepreneurs, right?

78
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:30,140
Plus, of course, there are college courses, incubators, accelerators, things associated with venture capital as well.

79
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:41,180
All sorts of things that are sort of trying to do this, promoting entrepreneurs, helping them identify opportunities and then turning opportunities into valuable businesses, right?

80
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:49,420
And this is why I wanted to talk to you because I read this paper and I said, oh my gosh, this intersects with a lot of what I talk about.

81
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,900
I mean, obviously, sometimes I'm talking about outright scams.

82
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:05,820
But a lot of times I'm talking about people who are sort of proposing that, oh, if you're wanting to go into Facebook ads or, you know, making a little Amazon store or, you know, starting an idea, come to us.

83
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,140
We're going to help you if you just pay some nominal fee and they make their living by basically taking these fees.

84
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:23,060
So they're basically piggybacking on the entrepreneurship industry and saying, like, we are helping you guys become better, which is a fascinating take.

85
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,180
And there could be a role for that if they are indeed making entrepreneurs better.

86
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,140
But it seems like there's this, we actually see entrepreneurship quality, as you say, declining.

87
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,140
And so, yeah, go ahead.

88
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,300
Yeah, so I think it's like in a gold rush, right?

89
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,260
It's always good to sell shovels and you need somebody to sell shovels.

90
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,900
Yeah, you do.

91
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,420
For sure. Otherwise, there will be no digging.

92
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,460
The thing about the entrepreneurship industry, I mean, there's, we don't know a whole lot about this from research.

93
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:00,220
But what we do know suggests that what entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence.

94
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,940
They increase people's confidence in their ability to become entrepreneurs so they enter, right?

95
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,780
We can see that if you consume more goods from the entrepreneurship industry, you tend to become an entrepreneur at higher rates.

96
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,220
Right.

97
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:20,500
But the performance of those ventures that consume the most goods from the entrepreneurship industry tends to be lower.

98
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,220
Wow.

99
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,580
That is really interesting.

100
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:31,580
So you're getting people who sort of, you're encouraging people to join and that's successful.

101
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:41,420
They're successful at that, but it's maybe not so successful or it's demonstrably not as successful at getting them to succeed.

102
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,980
And in fact, maybe it's encouraging people to go into the entrepreneurship industry who maybe should not, maybe should not be going into it.

103
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,260
Who at least, or maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up competence.

104
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,140
That's a great way to say it.

105
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,500
That might be a way to say it.

106
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,900
Right.

107
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:14,140
And one thing you talk about is like also entrepreneurs, part of this new thing is it's not entrepreneurship necessarily as, you know, a job as much as it is an identity.

108
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:27,220
And the way you get that identity is by buying stuff instead of doing like it used to, maybe you would think that you'd become an entrepreneurship by doing, but actually there's some people are trying to become entrepreneurs almost by buying.

109
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,340
I think that's the right.

110
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,660
So there are a couple of things going on.

111
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,060
I think the fact that we have, have this celebration of entrepreneurs, right?

112
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,220
I mean, I think that's uncontroversial that entrepreneurship is one of the most celebrated things you can probably do, right?

113
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,540
And entrepreneurs are some of the most celebrated actors in the economy.

114
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,660
That makes it possible to benefit from entrepreneurship simply by being an entrepreneur.

115
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,380
Like, with, like having a company sort of get you into a, into good company, so to speak.

116
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:13,940
So that it's, it's infinitely better to tell your parents that you are working on your startup than it is to have worked as a barista, which might actually pay you more because the entrepreneurship thing could actually pay you nothing, right?

117
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,460
So that's one thing.

118
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:31,860
The other thing is that because there is an entrepreneurship industry that provides goods and services, it becomes possible to consume those goods and services to, to do things that are similar to what you might call real entrepreneurs, right?

119
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,700
I say that in square, scare quotes, right?

120
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:47,580
You can consume your way into an entrepreneurial identity because we have somehow separated the being an entrepreneur from the success of the endeavor, right?

121
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,660
And that makes a lot of sense actually, right?

122
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,140
That's not unreasonable because success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly unlikely.

123
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,620
It is rare, right?

124
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,420
That is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science.

125
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,300
It's really rare.

126
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:11,700
And so to say that you can only be an entrepreneur if you're successful would make no sense because then that'd be a huge category of people who would basically like lack a category.

127
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,500
So, so that makes some sense.

128
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:21,700
But that at the same time becomes an excuse for something which is more insidious and that is that you can basically be in this consumption practice and that can make you an entrepreneur.

129
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,020
And that is useless to the economy.

130
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:34,500
I mean, there's nothing useful going on there other than you're just spending money on things that aren't necessarily making you do anything, right?

131
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,540
Because you're just, it's, it's just a consumption at that point.

132
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,820
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,380
The short answer is that it's totally unproductive, right?

134
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:53,860
I mean, the term the blending entrepreneurship, some people might have had econ classes where they've, where they've heard about the blend, the blend goods, which is basically the technical jargon for luxury goods.

135
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,540
Things that get more desirable, the more expensive they get.

136
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,940
So oysters, champagne, cars, racehorses, stuff like that, right?

137
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,140
Yeah.

138
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,820
So there's a way in which, because people don't use it for the right, nobody really likes oysters, right?

139
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,060
But people like the social signaling that eating expensive oysters can give them.

140
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,140
So the fact that this thing is expensive is part of the value, right?

141
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,340
The functional value is unimportant.

142
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,260
And that's some of the idea here.

143
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,660
It's a social signaling that, that is valuable to people.

144
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,460
It's not the, it's not the value that the company produces.

145
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:47,660
And that's so interesting because a lot of what I see, there are valuations for certain courses, masterminds, you know, these coaching calls that their, their, their cost seems to have nothing to do with any kind of objective, objective metric.

146
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,300
It's like, Oh, how much is your mastermind?

147
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,580
I believe them just as much if they said 2,500 as 2,500,000.

148
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,940
Sorry, not 2,500, 250,000 because of the fact.

149
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,500
And I've heard both, by the way, from different people.

150
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I was on a clubhouse room last night where this hypnotist was telling us that he charges $300,000 for coaching.

151
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,540
And it was just, it's just ridiculous.

152
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,940
So you're just thinking, well, who would buy this?

153
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:23,580
But what you're saying is that there's a whole type of person who like, they sort of see, Oh, the more it costs, the more I can signal that I'm the type of person who can afford these kinds of things.

154
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:33,900
Therefore, I must sort of be a big deal in a way that you'd buy a super expensive Rolex, even if you don't really like watches, because it's more about signaling that you sort of have the thing, right?

155
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:34,780
Yes.

156
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,940
Yeah, that's where the value comes from, right?

157
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:50,260
And what we're saying is that there are people who become entrepreneurs, who might have a sense that they are not going to be, who have a sense that they might not be particularly likely to create enormous value, but who will still benefit from being just in the category.

158
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,900
I mean, most people know that one does not just start a biotech company, right?

159
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,900
But one can be an entrepreneur.

160
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,460
You just need basically a pitch deck.

161
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,940
And you can kind of say that you're starting a biotech company, right?

162
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,140
We saw that with Thanos.

163
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:15,980
We saw somebody just start a biotech company, and we saw, you know, the height bubble form around it where people just go, Oh, well, this must be the next big thing, because they're excited.

164
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,380
Meanwhile, all the scientists are saying there's no way, there's just no way.

165
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,820
And everybody else in Silicon Valley is like, Elizabeth Holmes, you're doing such a good job.

166
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:43,420
And that's, we're sort of parroting the idea, but it is true that there is sort of an encouragement at all costs, positivity at all costs of this kind of field.

167
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:51,020
And like you said, rightfully so sometimes, because there's so much failure that's faced, that sort of is maybe the initial impetus.

168
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:57,300
But at the end of your paper, you say there might be a good reason to discourage people out of entrepreneurship.

169
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
What did you mean by that?

170
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,500
Okay, so some of the uncertainty that surrounds entrepreneurship, you can't get around, right?

171
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:10,740
It was not obvious that there was a business to be built on renting out spare rooms in your house, right?

172
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,180
And yet Airbnb became a thing, right?

173
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,660
There was uncertainty that you couldn't sort of reduce without trying.

174
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:30,980
So what I would suggest is that a lot of the hua celebration of entrepreneurship that you also mentioned, sort of says, just go and try it, right?

175
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:38,260
So I think as, especially as entrepreneurship educators, we should maybe say, you know, you really need to know that there's a downside to this.

176
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,060
You really need to know that success is very unlikely.

177
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:55,220
So we should, so in that, that alone should sort of make you say, maybe you shouldn't do it once though, I mean, but still people will have ideas that it's hard to gauge whether they are valuable or not.

178
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,700
And it's hard to gauge whether people will be capable or incapable of executing it, right?

179
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,420
There are situations where you won't know.

180
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,140
And so I think the approach there is to say, okay, maybe it's worth trying, but then set up, and this is not my idea.

181
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:23,140
This is from a team out of Bocconi University in Milan, we're saying, maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea, right?

182
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,340
Instead of saying, let me take this idea and see if I can make it work, right?

183
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,940
You should do experiments that sort of prove out that the idea does not work.

184
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,140
And if it turns out the idea does not work, you should get out of it.

185
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,340
So sort of flipping the burden of evidence around instead of saying, let me prove that this is great, right?

186
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,020
Assume that the idea is not good.

187
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:50,060
Work as hard as you can to make it good and then do an experiment to test out whether you should just abandon.

188
00:17:50,300 --> 00:18:02,700
And here's why that's really important, because one of the things that is the real challenge of entrepreneurship is that part of what's lionized is going through the valley of death of like, this idea is not working, right?

189
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:10,620
The problem with that is you have no idea of whether that valley of death has any kind of meaningful in for your company.

190
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:19,220
So you have people who are sort of persisting in their failure and going, oh, this is what an entrepreneur goes through when maybe they should persist.

191
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,100
But more than likely, in a lot of these cases, they should exit once they've kind of gotten their minimal viable product.

192
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,500
They realize there's no audience for this, no consumers get out.

193
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,580
So I do appreciate you really saying that.

194
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:42,220
And because we want to give people who are hungry for, you know, they're thinking about becoming an entrepreneur or whatever, the best tools for doing that in a way that's meaningful.

195
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,740
What I always tell people is you should know the statistics.

196
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,860
It shouldn't discourage you from doing it, but you need to know what the real odds are.

197
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,060
Now, you, let's talk about the cost of entrepreneurship real quick.

198
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,140
Yeah, because I think this is actually underappreciated, the fact that there are so many costs to entrepreneurship.

199
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,300
So just sort of the baseline one, right?

200
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,340
I hear a lot of students saying, it'll be great for my CV to be an entrepreneur.

201
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,820
And I and actually the evidence is quite the opposite.

202
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,860
It's actually not easier to get a job when you have entrepreneurial experience.

203
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,660
It's the opposite.

204
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,100
It's harder, right?

205
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:26,420
And there are lots of reasons for that that have to do with organizations often wanting people to be specialized.

206
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,020
Right.

207
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,780
And I would say also, if I was an organization, I probably wouldn't want somebody who was a specialist in failing and very comfortable with failing.

208
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,740
I would want people who didn't take huge risk, right?

209
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,780
That's one part.

210
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:47,260
The other part is that people who become entrepreneurs actually have lower lifetime earnings.

211
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Then then people who who have like steady wage employment.

212
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,620
You are blowing my audience's mind right now, by the way.

213
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,540
Yeah, OK, so this is an underappreciated fact.

214
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,700
And the same actually goes for working in a startup.

215
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,540
Working in a startup does not lead to higher lifetime earnings.

216
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,140
And Steven, I mean, we can put the links to the to the data for this in the show.

217
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,620
Please, please, let's do that because that's actually that's actually a real thing, right?

218
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,060
Your earnings are generally lower, whether you are an entrepreneur or whether you whether you just work in a startup.

219
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,300
Because the big because by the way, I want to be clear.

220
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,740
The big idea is in a lot of these cases is, hey, the man, the nine to five is holding you down.

221
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,460
You need to escape the rat race by becoming an entrepreneur.

222
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:44,620
You need to escape that, live the lifestyle you are meant for with yachts, champagne and Lamborghinis by going to become an entrepreneurship.

223
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,820
And you know what's going to help you?

224
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,780
My whether it be a course or whatever form of entrepreneur help, the one entrepreneur help.

225
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:00,420
And they get people in, the people aren't successful and either they quit and they go back to their job, just sort of worse for the wear.

226
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,300
Or they just like persist and they keep beating their head against the same wall and maybe go buy a bunch of other products.

227
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,420
So I do think this is so important for people to hear.

228
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,500
Yeah, I mean, it's one of these things, right?

229
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:20,140
We know that not to be like super technical, but the distribution of entrepreneurial outcomes is such that the average doesn't actually tell you anything.

230
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:28,100
Because all the gains are not all the gains, but most of the gains are concentrated in a very few super winners, right?

231
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,860
And lots of people who are just getting zero, right?

232
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,300
The economics of this are a little bit like professional sports or music, right?

233
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
There are some people who take out, take home all the earnings and lots of people who don't, right?

234
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,540
So average is not particularly informative.

235
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,620
Yeah, if you take the average between myself and Jeff Bezos, we both have an income of, you know, a billion dollar net worth.

236
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,060
That means nothing for me, right?

237
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,940
And that's that's your point.

238
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,820
Very true.

239
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,460
OK, so how can we get there?

240
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,460
There are more costs that I think are worth mentioning.

241
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Go ahead.

242
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,220
It was the bad news before we do.

243
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,860
Yeah.

244
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:13,740
Also, it seems it seems to be the case that entrepreneurs take more

245
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,220
anti-depressants and psychoactive drugs, right?

246
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,020
Not in the illicit sense, but in the clinical like.

247
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,500
Yeah, because because entrepreneurship is incredibly stressful, right?

248
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,300
If you were prone to depression, anxiety, things like that, it gets worse.

249
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,220
And if you weren't prone, there's a good chance that it can push you over the edge.

250
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,660
Often, the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with being an entrepreneur,

251
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,940
if you're not particularly successful and the anxiety that comes with it, if you are, right?

252
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,540
Because you have employees who you're responsible to.

253
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,620
It actually takes quite a strong toll on people's private lives as well.

254
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:00,500
So divorce rates are higher, for instance, and sort of probably just like relational strain all around, right?

255
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,460
And you can see how this can be sort of compounded when when we're dealing with not

256
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,740
just failed innovation driven entrepreneurship, but this sort of entrepreneur thing, right?

257
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,420
Because there's some sort of, right?

258
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,260
You can imagine how your partner who might be supportive, if you're trying something

259
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,620
and being very sincere about it, might, you know, might support you as you're trying

260
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,700
to build something in addition to not fail, just not succeeding.

261
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,860
But if your partner is seeing through this, right?

262
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,900
And seeing that this is just identity work,

263
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,660
you can imagine how that strain gets stronger and you can imagine how once you start

264
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,140
reflecting, once you've had a straight streak of failure and you see yourself as

265
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,460
an entrepreneur, the psychological trauma can be sort of quite a lot stronger.

266
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,740
And actually some of the depressing but interesting

267
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,620
commentary on the paper after it came out has been from people saying like,

268
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,300
I wasn't, I was a vibranian entrepreneur and it hurt me, right?

269
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,860
So some pretty hard wrenching essays that I've been reading on that.

270
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,420
Guys, in the comments, please put if you were a

271
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,660
entrepreneur, say raise your hand, say I was a entrepreneur, we want to know.

272
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,140
So go ahead.

273
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,220
So basically, those are sort of the big things, right?

274
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,340
We'll we'll be testing this out, of course, more empirically over the coming years.

275
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:27,220
But the facts of the matter are that entrepreneurship is not a great profession.

276
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,380
Right? It's it is sort of like trying to become a rock star NBA player.

277
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,780
Right? It's very unlikely to succeed.

278
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,100
Lots of downside risk.

279
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,260
Yeah. And most people ignore the downside risk because there's this incredible

280
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,580
lionization of the entrepreneurship life, right?

281
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,540
You've got the constant bombardment of successful people and you almost never

282
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,340
hear from the people who don't succeed because they are by definition sort of

283
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,220
excluded out from the success magazine.

284
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,220
And so you think to yourself, well, wow, look, it looks pretty great.

285
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,140
Looks pretty awesome to be an entrepreneur.

286
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,660
And I really appreciate you saying that.

287
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,860
Also, people should go look up.

288
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,020
I mean, a lot of entrepreneurs,

289
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,700
even people that everyone thinks of as like the most inspirational, like people

290
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,180
think like Elon Musk, the goat, you know, all that kind of stuff.

291
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,220
He's the guy who's saying, hey, unless you like chewing glass, maybe don't be an

292
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,300
entrepreneur. I mean, I think he said something like to that effect.

293
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,420
Like it's really, really, really tough.

294
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,420
And he's right about that.

295
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,700
And even then, right?

296
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,340
I mean, even if you look at really successful companies,

297
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,580
it becomes quite obvious that the fact that they were successful, of course,

298
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,020
it has something to do with them having some talent.

299
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,620
Of course.

300
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,140
But they also got lucky, right?

301
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,820
If you look into the story of Twitch, for instance,

302
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,740
pretty obvious that, I mean, it was not like Twitch was meant to be a great

303
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,780
success from day one.

304
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,500
Yeah. It started as Justin.TV, right?

305
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Yes. I'm interviewing.

306
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,420
I'm interviewing the founder soon.

307
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,940
Oh, great. Fabulous.

308
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,420
Do you have anything to say?

309
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,340
No, I mean, it's just like, I mean, they were obviously able to recognize

310
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,340
an opportunity when it came.

311
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,540
But they recognized a lot of opportunities that weren't really good opportunities.

312
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,900
And I think, you know, not like they did great, right?

313
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,820
But they were lucky also, too, in some respects.

314
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,620
I think probably he will be the first to say that.

315
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,060
I mean, enormously, because you had to sort of be the guy catching the wave of

316
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,900
live streaming sort of and there's no way he probably fully understood what that

317
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,260
meant or could have foreseen some, you know, Amazon buyout in his future.

318
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,940
But yeah, I think so that's a really great point.

319
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,740
Is that, of course, luck is involved and a huge, hugely involved.

320
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,700
Let's talk about like one final thing.

321
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,860
I love this. I love the past.

322
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,500
Right. Is that

323
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,220
people think that young people are good entrepreneurs, actually.

324
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,900
And that's blatantly not true, actually.

325
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,780
That is it.

326
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,660
I just want to sort of insert that because now we're talking about Twitch and

327
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,380
you were mentioning some like Elon Musk and these all were successful when they

328
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,260
were young, right? And a lot of the cast of characters are the same, right?

329
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,940
Mark Zuckerberg was very young, dropped out of school.

330
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,700
Actually, there's really good evidence to

331
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,140
suggest that the most successful founders are in their 40s.

332
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,300
You're right.

333
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,780
45 seems to be the good age to do it.

334
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,420
And that makes a lot of sense, right?

335
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,100
It does.

336
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,180
Basically, because that's the point where you actually have some experience, right?

337
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,900
You actually know what it's like to work in a company.

338
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,420
You might have managerial experience.

339
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,780
You might know an industry that you're entering.

340
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,140
There's sort of this hype around young people being successful and that

341
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,300
sometimes you'll hear people saying, oh, you don't need industry experience to

342
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,260
succeed in an industry. It's actually an asset to not know anything.

343
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,500
But it's actually some good evidence also in this that if you enter an industry

344
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,340
with no experience as an entrepreneur, your chances of succeeding are very low.

345
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,340
Yeah, of course.

346
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,060
Right. Of course.

347
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,100
Right. Of course.

348
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,540
And the way to think about it probably is that the people who

349
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,740
become successful when they're really young would probably also have been

350
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,380
successful when they're older, right?

351
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,180
So the fact that they become successful at young age is because they're just

352
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,580
incredibly talented and lucky, right?

353
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,820
They would have been successful at other points in time, too.

354
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,780
Most of us need some time to get gone.

355
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,740
Need to know what we're doing.

356
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,940
I think that's so unbelievably important to mention is that,

357
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,100
first of all, it makes so much sense.

358
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,180
I'm glad you're just giving us the data on, you know, success and entrepreneurship

359
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,900
because I think there is a huge misunderstanding and I've had this in my mind.

360
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,340
I don't think I formally held it, but it's sort of

361
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,700
mythologizing our culture to where a lot of people feel this way, even if they

362
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,260
don't consciously hold this, that, yeah, young people are entrepreneurs.

363
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,820
That's what you do.

364
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,020
Like if you want to be an entrepreneur, you start young, right?

365
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,300
You get the you get the failures out of the way.

366
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,340
I've definitely probably internalized that.

367
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:11,700
And there is an idea, too, that you don't need domain expertise.

368
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,100
This is a big idea that you can just sort of be Elizabeth Holmes and you can just

369
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:23,660
walk into blood technology and you can just innovate because that's what Silicon Valley does.

370
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,740
Explain to us

371
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,980
why we need domain expertise.

372
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,020
I mean, I get that it's a bit obvious, but maybe we should just you should just explain.

373
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,500
Well, I mean, again, it depends on the industry, right?

374
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,860
But I mean, very often being able to even understand the technology in a given field,

375
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,140
right, will will be very important.

376
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,980
Understanding the business models that underpin a given field is going to be very

377
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:59,140
important very often, being able to understand the right people to hire will often be very

378
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,500
important and be able to engage in the networks and in the industry culture will

379
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,820
often be very important as well.

380
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,980
I mean, you're trying to compete for the same customers, right?

381
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,140
So having industry experience will often let you understand the customers that you're

382
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,380
going to be dealing with, right?

383
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,340
Or very often we find that people, right, they work in a given industry construction,

384
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,060
for instance, and then they develop an innovation that they're going to sell to

385
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,660
construction companies, right?

386
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,340
Because during their work, they identify a problem and then they come up with a

387
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,100
solution for it that they then sell to their old company and companies like it, right?

388
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,940
So industry experience is going to let you know what are actually the problems in

389
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,700
industry and all of that is going to be generative and it's going to help you

390
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,820
not just get good ideas, it's also going to help you sort bad ideas from good ideas.

391
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,260
So what are the low value things as things that are never going to fly?

392
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,500
So what you're telling people is it can help to get that industry experience first

393
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,780
because you're now making money instead of just like floating and probably losing money.

394
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,860
You can do that.

395
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,820
You can gain industry experience.

396
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,060
You can identify a need.

397
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,500
You can gain that domain expertise.

398
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,220
You identify a need once you have that domain expertise.

399
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:10,180
And then you launch a company later in your life when you're actually more likely

400
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,860
to succeed due to your now you have experience.

401
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Plus at that point, you will maybe be in a different place financially.

402
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,980
Yes, which can also be very important.

403
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,820
Like one of the things that I find really depressing is that venture capital will

404
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,420
often say that before you ask for venture capital, you should do friends and family

405
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,620
around, which basically means you should ask your parents for money or your friends.

406
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,540
Right. It's a very nice way of saying, yeah.

407
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,940
When when when you're young, you're going to be asking your parents for money.

408
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,460
Right. And sometimes parents will do that.

409
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,540
Right. But often, like if you're not coming out of a very wealthy family,

410
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,180
they will be giving you their life earnings for your idea.

411
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,140
And you can easily imagine how that really is going to strain relationships

412
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,420
if you don't succeed.

413
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,900
There's a real social downside to that.

414
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,100
The fact is, if you wait until later, the chances are that you will have friends

415
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,860
who friends who actually have money and who understand the industry and can help

416
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,700
you, not just with money, but also with other things.

417
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,140
It also pains me when people like borrow against their house or something like

418
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,500
that, right? To persist in a venture.

419
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,940
It's very painful, right?

420
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,300
As sort of a precautionary principle, I would if you know that entrepreneurship

421
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,180
is really risky, right, you should think about it like buying lottery tickets.

422
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,540
You should only bet with house money, so to speak.

423
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,900
You should only pay with money that you can avoid to that you can that you don't

424
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,140
mind losing. Yeah.

425
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,540
And you should definitely set hard stops for yourself in the right sense.

426
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,340
You can just digging. Yeah.

427
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,580
Yeah, you can keep digging.

428
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
You can keep squeezing out more, right?

429
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,620
And but if you know that entrepreneurial success is really unlikely,

430
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,700
you wouldn't do that.

431
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,740
You'd be if you knew that success was rare, you would treat it.

432
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,180
And if you knew that it was like essentially buying a lottery ticket, right?

433
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,500
You would treat it differently than if you thought that success was just around

434
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,180
the corner. And so that's one of the things that I would sort of push people for,

435
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,340
right? Know that it's not very likely to succeed and treat it as such.

436
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,220
Let's talk about entrepreneurship advice.

437
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,980
There's this huge entrepreneurship,

438
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,180
entrepreneur industry, which is just like constantly bombarding people with

439
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,700
entrepreneurship advice, the blueprint to success as it were.

440
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,620
That's the words I hear a lot.

441
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm sure that's not an academic term, the blueprint for success.

442
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,820
But it does happen on the time.

443
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:37,900
Now, one thing that drives me crazy to no end is that a lot of

444
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:44,860
these things can be true, but sort of not helpful or like sometimes true,

445
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,300
but not always true.

446
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,700
How do you have a very specific circumstances?

447
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,340
Right.

448
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:56,780
How do you see entrepreneurship advice helping and hurting people with regards

449
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,260
to this sort of one entrepreneur identity that people are cultivating?

450
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,540
OK, so in a couple of different ways, right?

451
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,300
I think it's worth just sort of underscoring that point, right?

452
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,260
That a lot of the advice you get seems really sensible,

453
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,780
sometimes counterintuitive, but sensible sometimes, right?

454
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,020
Let's give some of that advice.

455
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,820
Yeah. So, for instance, you should really get comfortable with failure.

456
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,740
Right? That's like very generic, right?

457
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,260
Yeah.

458
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,740
Some things surrounding like the minimal viable product, for instance, right?

459
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,860
You should this idea that you should just like try to get something together,

460
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,700
put it in front of customers, accept that it's not very good and try to learn

461
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,860
from the experience.

462
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,740
Right.

463
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,340
Other advice, like just pitch, pitch, pitch, just don't take no for an answer.

464
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,420
Try your idea with many, many investors.

465
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,380
If they don't give you money, keep going.

466
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,140
Yep.

467
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,980
Now, all those things, I think, can seem reasonable, right?

468
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,380
And it seems to be the case that you can find successful companies that have done

469
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,820
that, right? You can also find lots of successful companies that didn't do that.

470
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,620
You can find successful companies that did do it, but that wasn't the reason

471
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,340
that they succeeded.

472
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,380
You can find lots of unsuccessful companies that did it, right?

473
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,500
That did something similar.

474
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,700
So if you take something like the minimal viable product, right?

475
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,740
There's a way in which telling people to just like try to get something

476
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,580
together, put it in front of customers, if they don't like it, right?

477
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,940
I mean, I think it's the Reed Hoffman of LinkedIn has this idea that if you're

478
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,180
not ashamed of the first version of your product, you're doing it wrong.

479
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,500
I think it's important to keep in mind that failure is never good.

480
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,020
Sometimes you need to build up a certain tolerance for failure to take risk, right?

481
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,900
But failure is never good.

482
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,500
It's, we should say, just to be clear, it's not good in of itself.

483
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,380
I mean, I think a lot of times it's lionized because the examples people are

484
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,820
using are successes that are failures that led to future successes.

485
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,980
But people can conflate that with like, oh, it means that when I'm failing,

486
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,060
this is like a sign of my success.

487
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,700
And I'm doing something right, right?

488
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,660
That's one thing.

489
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,900
The other thing is like the pitch to investors, right?

490
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,820
And keep pitching if they don't accept your idea, right?

491
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,500
Well, you know, there's a way to think about getting rejected by investors,

492
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,980
which is that maybe your idea is just bad, right?

493
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,860
Maybe maybe that is experience and good judgment telling you that this is not the

494
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,340
way to go, right? And maybe persisting, right?

495
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,820
There are companies that persist and succeed.

496
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,660
But there are also lots of companies that persist and don't succeed.

497
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,820
I think that's sort of important to keep in mind that you sometimes you need to

498
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,700
take no for an answer because it's because that is information that you're

499
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,540
doing something wrong.

500
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,740
And I think generally like the whole normalization of failure,

501
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,300
it's actually part of why you can keep people in ventures that are not doing well,

502
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,820
right? Saying that failure is part of the recipe and they just need to wait.

503
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,140
The success is around the corner.

504
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,780
I think that is it's a really counterintuitive way for most people to think.

505
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,740
And it's good that it's counterintuitive.

506
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,100
You should be more sort of concise about what you mean when you say the failure is

507
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:13,500
good. Yeah, I think that the tricky thing is, is that for some people,

508
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,100
that really is how they succeed is they just keep failing and they get they sort

509
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,380
of accumulate experience through failure.

510
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,740
And I think that's the that's the kind of meaning behind when people say this.

511
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,740
But what you're saying is yes, but there are a lot of people who take that advice,

512
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,260
which might be good in a corner case or in a case of, you know, this person over

513
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,460
here for Reed Hoffman, it might be good with his minimal viable embarrassing

514
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,140
product, but it could be really bad for a lot of other entrepreneurs.

515
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,780
And you should be smart about

516
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,540
taking that advice or sort of like holding it very loosely.

517
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,980
That type of advice.

518
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,420
Yes, you should definitely you should definitely think about how far am I willing

519
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,980
to go and I think you should commit to that for the fact.

520
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,300
This is the amount of time that I will spend trying to get this to work.

521
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,860
Because people are going to have different

522
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,980
circumstances that allow them to take more or less risk.

523
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,780
And it's easy to just sort of get pulled in.

524
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,940
This is what economists sometimes call the sunk cost fallacy, right?

525
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,060
Or if I spent a year on it, I might as well spend another month, right?

526
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,300
And I think that's definitely worth considering.

527
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,060
And I mean, some of the advice is much more technically we call it contingent

528
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,460
than it's given credit for, right?

529
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,100
It might work, but it might also just not work at all.

530
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,620
And and being smart about when that advice is going to apply is very difficult.

531
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,420
And I think and the basic problem is this, I think people pursue.

532
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,100
People go to ask for advice because they don't know what to do.

533
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,420
Right? So they have a very different.

534
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,340
So if you knew how to gauge the value of the advice, you wouldn't be asking the

535
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,220
advice very often.

536
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,660
So by definition, when you get the advice, you are sort of hard to know if it's good.

537
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,460
Good advice, very hard to know if it's good advice when you get it.

538
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,300
Because if you knew whether it was good advice, you wouldn't need good advice.

539
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,540
That's hilarious.

540
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,100
So I think it's very worthwhile to sort of trying to separate yourself.

541
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Right? The basic thing that you should probably do, I think, is to say,

542
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,380
how much time and how much money am I willing to invest in this?

543
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,300
Correct. And commit to that, right?

544
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,020
And say it might be that success is just around the corner,

545
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,620
but I don't know if I can wait that long.

546
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,580
Right? That's one thing.

547
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,500
And then the other thing is to definitely use some work to separate oneself from the

548
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,100
hype, say, OK, I don't care if it worked for Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever.

549
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,340
What are the chances that this might work for me?

550
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,580
And then treat your idea as something that you're trying to prove out that it won't

551
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,620
work so that you can get out, right?

552
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,700
Prove out that this is too good of an opportunity

553
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,980
to not abandon, right?

554
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,740
Right. I think that's the way to think about it.

555
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,940
And don't be afraid to pick up some industry experience

556
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,340
before you jump into your, you know, your big idea.

557
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,460
I know every idea seems like it's pressing and it has to be done right now.

558
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,260
But I think you made a really compelling argument to maybe hold off a bit,

559
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,620
get some get some real world experience before you go launch

560
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,060
your entrepreneurship career.

561
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,780
And I mean, like not every idea is worth dropping out of school for, right?

562
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,940
And there's a big difference between dropping out of school because you think

563
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,340
it's too easy, right?

564
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,780
If you're in Mark Zuckerberg and leaving Harvard because you think it's too easy,

565
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,780
that's very different from dropping out of

566
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,180
pretty much any other school because you're staying out quite relevant.

567
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,980
Yeah, that's very different.

568
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,300
And that's a very different sort of information you're getting about your potential.

569
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,700
And to be very clear, no, no, no, absolutely.

570
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,420
To be super clear, you can look at the outcomes of people with

571
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,420
degrees and especially like Ivy educated degrees.

572
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,500
And you can look at the difference between that and people who have dropped out

573
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,980
on the list of billionaires, like 30 millionaires and up.

574
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,940
It is just overwhelmingly dominated by people who have,

575
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,260
you know, sunk a bunch of time into their education, regardless of whether you

576
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,100
think education is overpriced or not.

577
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,900
Yes, it probably is.

578
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,940
But it's also underutilized, I think, if you sort of have the willingness

579
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,420
in the drive to become an entrepreneur and to work as hard as some people are for that.

580
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,140
I think there's a way to get much more out of college than most people do.

581
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,620
But that's a separate discussion.

582
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,020
But sure, I think that's interesting.

583
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,500
Underutilized probably probably you mean in the sense of how you're using the resource, right?

584
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,060
You're using the access to people who know something, how you're using the access

585
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,340
to networks, how you're using the access to information.

586
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,140
I mean, there's no shortage of people going to college and, you know,

587
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,020
but and just kind of benefiting as much as they could.

588
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,300
Yes, yes, yes, much attention.

589
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,060
You know what?

590
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,820
I think there needs to be a paper about the

591
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,540
Véblenian college student because there's certainly like an identity class of like,

592
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,140
oh, I'm just, you know, going to school.

593
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,380
That's a separate discussion for a separate time.

594
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,940
But but absolutely.

595
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,020
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:20,700
So one of the things you shot an email about is alternative strategies for people.

597
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,940
You talked about Joshua Gantz.

598
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,100
We talked about that yet at MIT.

599
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,100
We haven't. Joshua Gantz is at Toronto

600
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,820
and has done some interesting work with with Scott Stern at MIT.

601
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,980
And they basically have a whole series of papers about you can actually get the book for free.

602
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,100
It's online. If you search for entrepreneurial strategy,

603
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,540
you will be taken to the website and you get the book for free.

604
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,460
It's it's a really good book.

605
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,500
Highly recommend it.

606
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,900
One of the reasons I mentioned that in our pre pre discussion was that

607
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:57,340
people sometimes have the impression that disruption is the way to be an entrepreneur.

608
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,500
Right. Disruption is one of these things.

609
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,660
Right. You should really go after challenging industries, upsetting the incumbents, things like that.

610
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,780
I recommend that book because it's so helpful for thinking about different

611
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,740
strategies and often less risky strategies to pursue with ideas.

612
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,300
Right.

613
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,220
There are going to be cases where disruption is probably the right path for an

614
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,620
entrepreneur to take, but there are often alternative strategies that are worth

615
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:29,420
considering and testing out that will like disruptions, probably like the most risky

616
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,820
thing you could do. Right.

617
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,620
Right. You're trying to change.

618
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:39,420
You're trying to fundamentally change an industry unseat incumbents.

619
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,980
And like established firms, like trying to take down Blockbuster, Ford,

620
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,780
whichever, like name your industry incumbents.

621
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,260
Right. And very often that is going to be an incredibly risky strategy for all kinds

622
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,860
of obvious reasons. Their work is interesting, I think, because it can probably help people

623
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,420
think about the value of doing some things that are less risky, but nonetheless,

624
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,740
that are going to be lucrative and interesting for many people, especially if you have

625
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,300
industry experience, there are going to be ways to think about any given idea.

626
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,460
In more or less risky ways.

627
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:18,940
Do you think there's a the reason that we only think largely of, you know,

628
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,380
I guess, being an entrepreneur in terms of disruption because of the fact that all

629
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,740
of the cases that a lot of people immediately think of when they think of like

630
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,700
entrepreneur, they think of recent examples where you had this emerging

631
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,460
technology that really changed everything and it made disruption very easily

632
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,100
possible for, you know, some industries.

633
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,540
And so you had these like monsters come out like Facebook, Tesla, all these companies,

634
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,940
which it's like so we always think of those because those are the most,

635
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,580
you know, the biggest examples, but maybe the most common example of the examples

636
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,660
that actually are bearing out for a lot of people are not the disruptive cases.

637
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,020
And that's maybe what you're saying.

638
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,260
Exactly. The thing like lots of people will or lots of entrepreneurial companies

639
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,140
will be faced with a choice of whether to do something that is disruptive and high

640
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,100
risk, or maybe something that is not quite as disruptive, more oriented towards

641
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,740
what their book calls value change strategies, where you're basically trying

642
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,220
to help other companies do well and succeed, right?

643
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,500
That often is something that works best if you actually have industry experience,

644
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,780
as we talked about before, because you know the organization's in an industry

645
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,340
and you can say, what are the pain points and how can I sort of try to solve those

646
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,220
in an interesting way?

647
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,540
So I'd highly recommend that for most people to sort of just broaden

648
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,300
if you want to be an entrepreneur, if you if that is for you, right?

649
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,620
And if you're comfortable with all the risk and all the downsides that we've talked

650
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,900
about, right, I definitely encourage people to read that as sort of a way to

651
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:54,300
broaden their imagination about how you can be an entrepreneur.

652
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,460
Because there are many, many more ways to do it.

653
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,500
And the Silicon Valley model is just one

654
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,700
and it's not going to be the right one for lots of people.

655
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,740
It's definitely a very risky one.

656
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,580
I think that's so important.

657
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,380
And one thing I want to remind the audience of is that neither myself

658
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,740
nor Dr. Hartman are against entrepreneurs.

659
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,660
No, no, quite the contrary.

660
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,700
Quite the contrary.

661
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,380
This is about getting people to have better outcomes by thinking more critically

662
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,900
about being an entrepreneur, what that means, because what your your paper kind

663
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,220
of compellingly crafts a narrative for is that there's sort of a

664
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,700
there's an entrepreneur ideology that sort of a lot of people just sort of buy

665
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,620
into just like the disruptive idea that everyone just sort of thinks, oh,

666
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,620
that's the way you start a company.

667
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,300
And of course, it's just one of the many ways you could start a company.

668
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,380
There are a lot of useful ways to thinking about entrepreneurship, that if you're

669
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,700
going into it, it is important to know you have to not just think, you know,

670
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,980
only positive thoughts all the time.

671
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,140
You have to know the risks part of being a successful entrepreneur is

672
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,740
understanding and hedging against risk.

673
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,540
It is so undervalued.

674
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,940
Sorry, I don't just got a little

675
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,580
that is an excellent summary.

676
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,220
I think the and I think that's definitely very important to really appreciate.

677
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,220
Is this for me?

678
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,940
Right? Like we talked about this, that there is being an entrepreneur has something

679
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,340
of trying to be a professional athlete about it.

680
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,740
Right? Right?

681
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,540
If so, that for most people should be a red flag saying, no, I'm not going to do that.

682
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,580
If you are called to do it, right?

683
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,340
Then you should definitely know the ins and outs of it.

684
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,460
You should think about the different ways that you can approach this.

685
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,220
You know about the kind of things that are really risky and the kinds of things

686
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,100
that will get you injured and the things that will push you out of the game.

687
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:51,860
Right? Yeah.

688
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,900
And that will lead you to costs that you don't want to bear.

689
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,620
I think that's really important.

690
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,300
Because as you say,

691
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,620
entrepreneurship is super important, but well functioning entrepreneurship is even

692
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,020
more important, like the economy does not work without entrepreneurship.

693
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,900
We tried economies without entrepreneurship.

694
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,740
It was called the Soviet Union and it wasn't great, right?

695
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,980
So we need entrepreneurship a lot.

696
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,700
But we also needed to work well and we need people to not be

697
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,660
misled about what it is and the kinds of risks that are involved for sure.

698
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,260
And the realities of how to do better at entrepreneurship.

699
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,020
I mean, I think the funny thing is is you are presenting us with sort of like hard

700
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,020
data on what so many other people are promising to make you a better entrepreneur.

701
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:43,460
And you're telling us what entrepreneurship success looks like in the data.

702
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,860
And I think that's so important for people who are, you know, in the audience who are

703
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,100
interested in that to really take the heart.

704
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,020
So I will link, we will talk about a lot of the papers and the sources you cited

705
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,900
for statistics related to success, you know, when you're young or when you're old.

706
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,740
We'll talk about, you know, education.

707
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,700
We'll have the educational strategy book linked in the show notes.

708
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:14,060
And also, of course, I will be linking the paper, which I found I was such a

709
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,540
I have cited that paper a bunch of times, sort of informally on the channel.

710
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,780
And I knew I always wanted to do an interview about it because it's

711
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,740
it holds a near and dear place to my heart.

712
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,460
But let's be clear.

713
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,380
This is a this is a theory, right?

714
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:34,260
Like this is part of academia is that you are proposing a theory to fit

715
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,740
data that you know is happening, which is like declining entrepreneur outcomes.

716
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,860
Would you like to talk about that a bit a little bit?

717
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,340
Like hedge a little bit about what we're talking about, right?

718
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:49,980
So so I think people should read the paper, actually, because what we're doing

719
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,740
is we're proposing a way that things might work, right?

720
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,420
And there are different interpretations that one could make.

721
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,980
What we're suggesting is essentially a hypothesis, right?

722
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,820
Academic production is such that you often have what's called a conceptual paper,

723
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,180
which lays out an idea.

724
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,980
And then you have empirical studies that do that basically present data, right?

725
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,300
And we're in the process of beginning those

726
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:19,780
the data collection and but are producing different hypothesis, hypothesis papers.

727
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,740
And this is one, right?

728
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,620
The paper that you can find online now is not published yet.

729
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,900
So it hasn't been through peer review.

730
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,620
The peer reviewed version will be out

731
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,820
by summer, it has been accepted for for a journal, which is called

732
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:38,060
Research in the Sociology of Organizations, but that will come out.

733
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,100
And when you say a lot of when when you talk about hard data,

734
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,220
I should say this is not data that we have collected.

735
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,780
This is data from other studies just sort of to be clear.

736
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,980
Yeah, absolutely.

737
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:55,140
Interpretation that we're offering is is also not a is not proven out by data.

738
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,980
And it's not a widely accepted view, right?

739
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,260
I mean, there's quite a lot of consensus that

740
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,340
entrepreneurial quality is declining.

741
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,460
It's not a unanimously help you, but it's pretty close.

742
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,220
So that is a that is sort of a real thing.

743
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,740
The idea that the linking of the

744
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,740
entrepreneurship ideologies to the entrepreneurship industry to declining

745
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,580
entrepreneurial quality is sort of that's that's our right.

746
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,220
That's our idea and it's conjecture.

747
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,140
I think yeah, yeah, right?

748
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,060
Yeah, just to be clear.

749
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,220
Oh, no, no, I appreciate it.

750
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,260
I appreciate how careful you are.

751
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,860
And I think that's an important part of any kind of,

752
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,660
you know, if you're going to be in academia, that's that's part of your job.

753
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,540
Right.

754
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,340
Is to tell people like what's settled, what's not.

755
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,220
And I appreciate you doing that.

756
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,300
Dr. Hartman, thank you so much for coming on the show.

757
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,740
I hope people got a lot of to use a loaded expression of value out of out of that.

758
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,540
I hope so too.

759
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,540
Absolutely.

760
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,380
So I hope some more informed career choices will ensue.

761
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,380
Same here. Thank you so much.

762
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,340
Thank you for the opportunity.

763
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,380
Have a great day.

764
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,940
We'll see you next time.
