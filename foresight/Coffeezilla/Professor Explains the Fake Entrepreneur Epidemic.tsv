0	4740	What entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence?
4860	9180	Maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up confidence.
9460	13420	Success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly likely. It is rare, right?
13420	18620	That is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science. It's really rare.
18940	27140	Maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea, right?
27220	30500	Instead of saying, let me take this idea and see if I can make it work.
30860	34100	You should do experiments and sort of prove out that the idea does not work.
34540	36900	And if it turns out the idea does not work, you should get out of it.
42620	44740	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Coffeezilla.
44740	50500	Today we are talking to someone I've been kind of a fan of his work for a long time.
50500	53220	But finally, I get to sit down and talk with him.
53220	56260	This is Dr. Hartman of the Copenhagen Business School.
56260	67780	He is an associate professor, and he wrote a paper about the, I'm going to totally mess this up, the Voblin, Vleblinian entrepreneur,
67780	72980	AKA, I just want to say, because I want to call it this during this show, the Wontrepreneur sort of thing.
73860	81020	And it's towards an un-entrepreneurial economy, the entrepreneurship industry and the rise of the Vleblinian entrepreneur.
81580	83980	Can you summarize that idea for us real quick?
83980	87660	Because I think it's a really interesting concept.
88060	94540	Yeah. So the, thank you for the introduction, Stephen, by the way, and thank you for the opportunity.
94780	109860	So the Vleblinian entrepreneur is a, or let's call it the Wontrepreneur, that's fine too, is our effort to sort of put a label on what I think a lot of people are seeing, right?
109940	121060	The fact that there is, that there are people starting entrepreneurship, not so much with the intention of actually becoming innovation-driven entrepreneurs,
121060	129660	but more actually to just sort of engage in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and to build up the kind of identity that comes with that.
131260	135940	So basically, is entrepreneurship pursued for identity purposes, not productive purposes?
136260	146340	You guys have all seen this at your, whether it's your university, you've seen it at these, you know, some coffee shops, it's a lot of times people are pursuing entrepreneurship,
146340	154380	just to sort of tell you that they're an entrepreneur kind of idea, like the whole thing of like, you know, I'm a CEO, well, when did your company start?
154380	158340	Well, yesterday. And you're like, oh, okay, that's very interesting.
158660	170220	And part of your paper argues, you're trying to, if I understand it right, you're trying to explain a set of sort of problems or ideas in the field,
171180	180660	one of which is that, okay, we see that entrepreneurship leads to all sorts of good things in the economy, but largely this is driven by a few companies.
181180	190020	And then you also see that, oh, well, actually, there's the sort of the failing entrepreneurs or people who kind of have undersized results,
190020	195460	and there's people like Amazon, Apple, you know, all these companies that are driving the majority of the US economy.
196340	207620	You're saying that it's actually becoming more prevalent and you're getting more and more sort of failing entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem as proportional to their successful counterparts.
207620	215540	And you're wondering why, and you're sort of saying there's this industry around entrepreneurs? Is that basically the idea?
216060	222300	Yes, and that's, and that's causing a particular kind of entrepreneurial firm to pop up.
222340	227940	And the kind of firm that is causing pop up is what we call the blinding of entrepreneurs.
228300	232860	So, so basically, it's not our observation that the quality of entrepreneurship is falling.
232980	244420	That's from other work, which is referenced in the paper, but basically finding that, like, people tend to think that the US is incredibly entrepreneurial, and that's actually not the case by international standards.
245820	248500	Entrepreneurship is also becoming more rare in the US.
249740	257820	There are fewer and fewer entrepreneurial companies, in the sense that there are fewer startups, and the quality of those startups is declining.
258620	260420	All right, all bad things.
261020	261860	All bad things.
262300	267940	As you say, it's true that there are like entrepreneurial companies play a potentially very big role in the economy, right?
267940	273100	There's things that entrepreneurial, entrepreneurial companies do that establish companies don't do.
273220	279220	So economic dynamism is very much dependent on having well-functioning entrepreneurship, right?
280820	283700	But that is, that seems to be becoming more rare.
283820	286580	And there are all sorts of explanations that you could have for that.
287220	292460	You might say that, for instance, incumbent market power is increasing, right?
292460	301740	So Google, Facebook, and Amazon are basically buying up and closing down all the really potentially promising entrepreneurial companies before they become big, right?
301740	302900	That's one vision of it.
303380	307980	The other is that there is, that there's just fewer good ideas to go around, right?
307980	310140	That the good ideas are getting harder to find.
311140	316740	And you could also say that entrepreneurship education maybe is getting worse, right?
316740	322060	So entrepreneurs are more poorly prepared, more poorly prepared for entrepreneurship.
322060	324700	You might say something about venture capital not working very well.
325260	332020	All of those arguments are valid and, you know, social sciences such that usually things are really complex and things interact.
332900	347660	The thing that we're saying with that paper is that our understanding of the decline in entrepreneurial quality has not taken into account that there has been this really rapidly growing and by now quite large entrepreneurship industry,
348100	351060	which are companies that target entrepreneurs as their consumers, right?
351060	351900	And, and, and, right.
351900	359620	And purportedly help entrepreneurs to identify and develop ideas into profitable, profitable businesses.
359740	368260	Let's maybe expand on the types of like sort of entrepreneur help that one might see in this industry, right?
368820	369260	Yes.
369780	371580	So you can, there are different things, right?
371580	375420	The, you mentioned that people will have seen this at their universities, right?
375420	379140	Many universities now have sort of these entrepreneurship hubs, right?
380020	382900	That could be classed as a kind of entrepreneurship industry.
382900	386700	This is something which is marketing to entrepreneurs to try to help them.
387380	390260	There is lots of, there's a lot of academic writing on this.
391460	397620	Books by academics, books by practitioners, like experienced entrepreneurs who then give advice.
397820	402620	There's a lot of sort of, you would call it back office support for entrepreneurs, right?
402860	406340	We'll do your accounting, we'll do your legal, we'll do your admin.
407420	410020	There are lots of entrepreneurship conferences, expos.
410580	413340	There's lots of online media.
414580	416060	Shark Tank, stuff like that.
416220	417740	Shark Tank on television.
418540	423500	And then there's also like the Dutch type of business magazine, right?
423500	425780	Wired, Fast Company, things like that.
426020	430500	And basically a heap of books that you can get off of Amazon or anywhere else.
430500	434420	They'll talk to you about, tell you about how to become a successful entrepreneur, right?
434660	441380	So there's a whole sort of suite of this that all sorts, that all sort pretends to help entrepreneurs, right?
441420	450140	Plus, of course, there are college courses, incubators, accelerators, things associated with venture capital as well.
450460	461180	All sorts of things that are sort of trying to do this, promoting entrepreneurs, helping them identify opportunities and then turning opportunities into valuable businesses, right?
461660	469420	And this is why I wanted to talk to you because I read this paper and I said, oh my gosh, this intersects with a lot of what I talk about.
469420	472900	I mean, obviously, sometimes I'm talking about outright scams.
472900	485820	But a lot of times I'm talking about people who are sort of proposing that, oh, if you're wanting to go into Facebook ads or, you know, making a little Amazon store or, you know, starting an idea, come to us.
486020	493140	We're going to help you if you just pay some nominal fee and they make their living by basically taking these fees.
493140	503060	So they're basically piggybacking on the entrepreneurship industry and saying, like, we are helping you guys become better, which is a fascinating take.
503060	508180	And there could be a role for that if they are indeed making entrepreneurs better.
508860	514140	But it seems like there's this, we actually see entrepreneurship quality, as you say, declining.
514540	518140	And so, yeah, go ahead.
518740	522300	Yeah, so I think it's like in a gold rush, right?
522340	525260	It's always good to sell shovels and you need somebody to sell shovels.
525260	525900	Yeah, you do.
526460	528420	For sure. Otherwise, there will be no digging.
528780	533460	The thing about the entrepreneurship industry, I mean, there's, we don't know a whole lot about this from research.
533460	540220	But what we do know suggests that what entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence.
540500	544940	They increase people's confidence in their ability to become entrepreneurs so they enter, right?
544940	551780	We can see that if you consume more goods from the entrepreneurship industry, you tend to become an entrepreneur at higher rates.
551860	552220	Right.
553220	560500	But the performance of those ventures that consume the most goods from the entrepreneurship industry tends to be lower.
561340	562220	Wow.
562860	564580	That is really interesting.
564580	571580	So you're getting people who sort of, you're encouraging people to join and that's successful.
571580	581420	They're successful at that, but it's maybe not so successful or it's demonstrably not as successful at getting them to succeed.
581620	588980	And in fact, maybe it's encouraging people to go into the entrepreneurship industry who maybe should not, maybe should not be going into it.
589580	596260	Who at least, or maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up competence.
597180	598140	That's a great way to say it.
598140	599500	That might be a way to say it.
599500	599900	Right.
599900	614140	And one thing you talk about is like also entrepreneurs, part of this new thing is it's not entrepreneurship necessarily as, you know, a job as much as it is an identity.
614700	627220	And the way you get that identity is by buying stuff instead of doing like it used to, maybe you would think that you'd become an entrepreneurship by doing, but actually there's some people are trying to become entrepreneurs almost by buying.
628140	630340	I think that's the right.
630340	632660	So there are a couple of things going on.
632660	638060	I think the fact that we have, have this celebration of entrepreneurs, right?
638060	644220	I mean, I think that's uncontroversial that entrepreneurship is one of the most celebrated things you can probably do, right?
644220	647540	And entrepreneurs are some of the most celebrated actors in the economy.
648380	652660	That makes it possible to benefit from entrepreneurship simply by being an entrepreneur.
653260	659380	Like, with, like having a company sort of get you into a, into good company, so to speak.
660860	673940	So that it's, it's infinitely better to tell your parents that you are working on your startup than it is to have worked as a barista, which might actually pay you more because the entrepreneurship thing could actually pay you nothing, right?
674580	675460	So that's one thing.
676220	691860	The other thing is that because there is an entrepreneurship industry that provides goods and services, it becomes possible to consume those goods and services to, to do things that are similar to what you might call real entrepreneurs, right?
691900	693700	I say that in square, scare quotes, right?
693980	707580	You can consume your way into an entrepreneurial identity because we have somehow separated the being an entrepreneur from the success of the endeavor, right?
708700	710660	And that makes a lot of sense actually, right?
710660	715140	That's not unreasonable because success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly unlikely.
715500	716620	It is rare, right?
716620	721420	That is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science.
721420	722300	It's really rare.
722900	731700	And so to say that you can only be an entrepreneur if you're successful would make no sense because then that'd be a huge category of people who would basically like lack a category.
732020	733500	So, so that makes some sense.
733500	741700	But that at the same time becomes an excuse for something which is more insidious and that is that you can basically be in this consumption practice and that can make you an entrepreneur.
743660	746020	And that is useless to the economy.
746020	754500	I mean, there's nothing useful going on there other than you're just spending money on things that aren't necessarily making you do anything, right?
754500	757540	Because you're just, it's, it's just a consumption at that point.
757540	758820	Yeah, yeah.
758820	761380	The short answer is that it's totally unproductive, right?
761380	773860	I mean, the term the blending entrepreneurship, some people might have had econ classes where they've, where they've heard about the blend, the blend goods, which is basically the technical jargon for luxury goods.
774020	776540	Things that get more desirable, the more expensive they get.
776540	781940	So oysters, champagne, cars, racehorses, stuff like that, right?
781940	782140	Yeah.
783660	788820	So there's a way in which, because people don't use it for the right, nobody really likes oysters, right?
789540	793060	But people like the social signaling that eating expensive oysters can give them.
793460	797140	So the fact that this thing is expensive is part of the value, right?
797140	799340	The functional value is unimportant.
799980	802260	And that's some of the idea here.
802260	805660	It's a social signaling that, that is valuable to people.
805660	808460	It's not the, it's not the value that the company produces.
808460	827660	And that's so interesting because a lot of what I see, there are valuations for certain courses, masterminds, you know, these coaching calls that their, their, their cost seems to have nothing to do with any kind of objective, objective metric.
827660	830300	It's like, Oh, how much is your mastermind?
830340	834580	I believe them just as much if they said 2,500 as 2,500,000.
835580	838940	Sorry, not 2,500, 250,000 because of the fact.
838940	841500	And I've heard both, by the way, from different people.
841500	849500	I was on a clubhouse room last night where this hypnotist was telling us that he charges $300,000 for coaching.
849860	851540	And it was just, it's just ridiculous.
851540	852940	So you're just thinking, well, who would buy this?
853380	863580	But what you're saying is that there's a whole type of person who like, they sort of see, Oh, the more it costs, the more I can signal that I'm the type of person who can afford these kinds of things.
863580	873900	Therefore, I must sort of be a big deal in a way that you'd buy a super expensive Rolex, even if you don't really like watches, because it's more about signaling that you sort of have the thing, right?
874380	874780	Yes.
875100	876940	Yeah, that's where the value comes from, right?
876940	890260	And what we're saying is that there are people who become entrepreneurs, who might have a sense that they are not going to be, who have a sense that they might not be particularly likely to create enormous value, but who will still benefit from being just in the category.
890380	894900	I mean, most people know that one does not just start a biotech company, right?
895220	896900	But one can be an entrepreneur.
896940	899460	You just need basically a pitch deck.
899620	902940	And you can kind of say that you're starting a biotech company, right?
902940	904140	We saw that with Thanos.
904140	915980	We saw somebody just start a biotech company, and we saw, you know, the height bubble form around it where people just go, Oh, well, this must be the next big thing, because they're excited.
915980	920380	Meanwhile, all the scientists are saying there's no way, there's just no way.
920740	925820	And everybody else in Silicon Valley is like, Elizabeth Holmes, you're doing such a good job.
926060	943420	And that's, we're sort of parroting the idea, but it is true that there is sort of an encouragement at all costs, positivity at all costs of this kind of field.
943460	951020	And like you said, rightfully so sometimes, because there's so much failure that's faced, that sort of is maybe the initial impetus.
951020	957300	But at the end of your paper, you say there might be a good reason to discourage people out of entrepreneurship.
957700	958700	What did you mean by that?
959540	964500	Okay, so some of the uncertainty that surrounds entrepreneurship, you can't get around, right?
964780	970740	It was not obvious that there was a business to be built on renting out spare rooms in your house, right?
971020	973180	And yet Airbnb became a thing, right?
973740	978660	There was uncertainty that you couldn't sort of reduce without trying.
978980	990980	So what I would suggest is that a lot of the hua celebration of entrepreneurship that you also mentioned, sort of says, just go and try it, right?
991140	998260	So I think as, especially as entrepreneurship educators, we should maybe say, you know, you really need to know that there's a downside to this.
998660	1002060	You really need to know that success is very unlikely.
1003060	1015220	So we should, so in that, that alone should sort of make you say, maybe you shouldn't do it once though, I mean, but still people will have ideas that it's hard to gauge whether they are valuable or not.
1015220	1019700	And it's hard to gauge whether people will be capable or incapable of executing it, right?
1019820	1021420	There are situations where you won't know.
1022180	1028140	And so I think the approach there is to say, okay, maybe it's worth trying, but then set up, and this is not my idea.
1028540	1043140	This is from a team out of Bocconi University in Milan, we're saying, maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea, right?
1043180	1047340	Instead of saying, let me take this idea and see if I can make it work, right?
1047660	1050940	You should do experiments that sort of prove out that the idea does not work.
1051700	1054140	And if it turns out the idea does not work, you should get out of it.
1055020	1060340	So sort of flipping the burden of evidence around instead of saying, let me prove that this is great, right?
1060380	1062020	Assume that the idea is not good.
1062540	1070060	Work as hard as you can to make it good and then do an experiment to test out whether you should just abandon.
1070300	1082700	And here's why that's really important, because one of the things that is the real challenge of entrepreneurship is that part of what's lionized is going through the valley of death of like, this idea is not working, right?
1083020	1090620	The problem with that is you have no idea of whether that valley of death has any kind of meaningful in for your company.
1090860	1099220	So you have people who are sort of persisting in their failure and going, oh, this is what an entrepreneur goes through when maybe they should persist.
1099420	1106100	But more than likely, in a lot of these cases, they should exit once they've kind of gotten their minimal viable product.
1106100	1110500	They realize there's no audience for this, no consumers get out.
1110500	1112580	So I do appreciate you really saying that.
1112580	1122220	And because we want to give people who are hungry for, you know, they're thinking about becoming an entrepreneur or whatever, the best tools for doing that in a way that's meaningful.
1122220	1124740	What I always tell people is you should know the statistics.
1124740	1129860	It shouldn't discourage you from doing it, but you need to know what the real odds are.
1129860	1134060	Now, you, let's talk about the cost of entrepreneurship real quick.
1134380	1141140	Yeah, because I think this is actually underappreciated, the fact that there are so many costs to entrepreneurship.
1141140	1143300	So just sort of the baseline one, right?
1143500	1148340	I hear a lot of students saying, it'll be great for my CV to be an entrepreneur.
1148540	1151820	And I and actually the evidence is quite the opposite.
1151940	1155860	It's actually not easier to get a job when you have entrepreneurial experience.
1155860	1156660	It's the opposite.
1156660	1158100	It's harder, right?
1159100	1166420	And there are lots of reasons for that that have to do with organizations often wanting people to be specialized.
1166620	1167020	Right.
1167220	1174780	And I would say also, if I was an organization, I probably wouldn't want somebody who was a specialist in failing and very comfortable with failing.
1174780	1177740	I would want people who didn't take huge risk, right?
1177940	1178780	That's one part.
1178980	1187260	The other part is that people who become entrepreneurs actually have lower lifetime earnings.
1187620	1191620	Then then people who who have like steady wage employment.
1191980	1194620	You are blowing my audience's mind right now, by the way.
1194620	1197540	Yeah, OK, so this is an underappreciated fact.
1197540	1199700	And the same actually goes for working in a startup.
1199900	1204540	Working in a startup does not lead to higher lifetime earnings.
1204740	1209140	And Steven, I mean, we can put the links to the to the data for this in the show.
1209140	1215620	Please, please, let's do that because that's actually that's actually a real thing, right?
1215780	1222060	Your earnings are generally lower, whether you are an entrepreneur or whether you whether you just work in a startup.
1222340	1225300	Because the big because by the way, I want to be clear.
1225500	1231740	The big idea is in a lot of these cases is, hey, the man, the nine to five is holding you down.
1231940	1235460	You need to escape the rat race by becoming an entrepreneur.
1235460	1244620	You need to escape that, live the lifestyle you are meant for with yachts, champagne and Lamborghinis by going to become an entrepreneurship.
1244620	1245820	And you know what's going to help you?
1246020	1252780	My whether it be a course or whatever form of entrepreneur help, the one entrepreneur help.
1252980	1260420	And they get people in, the people aren't successful and either they quit and they go back to their job, just sort of worse for the wear.
1260620	1266300	Or they just like persist and they keep beating their head against the same wall and maybe go buy a bunch of other products.
1266500	1269420	So I do think this is so important for people to hear.
1269620	1271500	Yeah, I mean, it's one of these things, right?
1271500	1280140	We know that not to be like super technical, but the distribution of entrepreneurial outcomes is such that the average doesn't actually tell you anything.
1280340	1288100	Because all the gains are not all the gains, but most of the gains are concentrated in a very few super winners, right?
1288300	1290860	And lots of people who are just getting zero, right?
1291060	1295300	The economics of this are a little bit like professional sports or music, right?
1295500	1300500	There are some people who take out, take home all the earnings and lots of people who don't, right?
1300500	1303540	So average is not particularly informative.
1303740	1309620	Yeah, if you take the average between myself and Jeff Bezos, we both have an income of, you know, a billion dollar net worth.
1309820	1311060	That means nothing for me, right?
1311260	1313940	And that's that's your point.
1314140	1315820	Very true.
1316020	1319460	OK, so how can we get there?
1319660	1321460	There are more costs that I think are worth mentioning.
1321660	1322660	Go ahead.
1322860	1325220	It was the bad news before we do.
1325340	1326860	Yeah.
1327060	1333740	Also, it seems it seems to be the case that entrepreneurs take more
1333940	1337220	anti-depressants and psychoactive drugs, right?
1337420	1341020	Not in the illicit sense, but in the clinical like.
1341220	1345500	Yeah, because because entrepreneurship is incredibly stressful, right?
1345700	1350300	If you were prone to depression, anxiety, things like that, it gets worse.
1350300	1354220	And if you weren't prone, there's a good chance that it can push you over the edge.
1354380	1359660	Often, the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with being an entrepreneur,
1359860	1363940	if you're not particularly successful and the anxiety that comes with it, if you are, right?
1364140	1366540	Because you have employees who you're responsible to.
1366740	1371620	It actually takes quite a strong toll on people's private lives as well.
1371820	1380500	So divorce rates are higher, for instance, and sort of probably just like relational strain all around, right?
1380700	1386460	And you can see how this can be sort of compounded when when we're dealing with not
1386660	1391740	just failed innovation driven entrepreneurship, but this sort of entrepreneur thing, right?
1391940	1393420	Because there's some sort of, right?
1393620	1397260	You can imagine how your partner who might be supportive, if you're trying something
1397460	1402620	and being very sincere about it, might, you know, might support you as you're trying
1402820	1405700	to build something in addition to not fail, just not succeeding.
1405900	1407860	But if your partner is seeing through this, right?
1407860	1409900	And seeing that this is just identity work,
1410060	1414660	you can imagine how that strain gets stronger and you can imagine how once you start
1414860	1419140	reflecting, once you've had a straight streak of failure and you see yourself as
1419340	1425460	an entrepreneur, the psychological trauma can be sort of quite a lot stronger.
1425660	1429740	And actually some of the depressing but interesting
1429940	1433620	commentary on the paper after it came out has been from people saying like,
1433820	1439300	I wasn't, I was a vibranian entrepreneur and it hurt me, right?
1439420	1442860	So some pretty hard wrenching essays that I've been reading on that.
1443060	1445420	Guys, in the comments, please put if you were a
1445620	1451660	entrepreneur, say raise your hand, say I was a entrepreneur, we want to know.
1451860	1453140	So go ahead.
1453340	1456220	So basically, those are sort of the big things, right?
1456420	1461340	We'll we'll be testing this out, of course, more empirically over the coming years.
1461540	1467220	But the facts of the matter are that entrepreneurship is not a great profession.
1467340	1472380	Right? It's it is sort of like trying to become a rock star NBA player.
1472580	1474780	Right? It's very unlikely to succeed.
1474980	1477100	Lots of downside risk.
1477300	1482260	Yeah. And most people ignore the downside risk because there's this incredible
1482460	1486580	lionization of the entrepreneurship life, right?
1486780	1491540	You've got the constant bombardment of successful people and you almost never
1491740	1495340	hear from the people who don't succeed because they are by definition sort of
1495380	1498220	excluded out from the success magazine.
1498420	1502220	And so you think to yourself, well, wow, look, it looks pretty great.
1502220	1504140	Looks pretty awesome to be an entrepreneur.
1504340	1505660	And I really appreciate you saying that.
1505660	1506860	Also, people should go look up.
1507060	1509020	I mean, a lot of entrepreneurs,
1509220	1512700	even people that everyone thinks of as like the most inspirational, like people
1512700	1515180	think like Elon Musk, the goat, you know, all that kind of stuff.
1515380	1519220	He's the guy who's saying, hey, unless you like chewing glass, maybe don't be an
1519220	1522300	entrepreneur. I mean, I think he said something like to that effect.
1522300	1525420	Like it's really, really, really tough.
1525620	1527420	And he's right about that.
1527620	1528700	And even then, right?
1528900	1532340	I mean, even if you look at really successful companies,
1532540	1536580	it becomes quite obvious that the fact that they were successful, of course,
1536580	1539020	it has something to do with them having some talent.
1539220	1540620	Of course.
1540820	1543140	But they also got lucky, right?
1543340	1546820	If you look into the story of Twitch, for instance,
1547020	1551740	pretty obvious that, I mean, it was not like Twitch was meant to be a great
1551860	1552780	success from day one.
1552980	1555500	Yeah. It started as Justin.TV, right?
1555700	1557300	Yes. I'm interviewing.
1557500	1560420	I'm interviewing the founder soon.
1560620	1561940	Oh, great. Fabulous.
1562140	1564420	Do you have anything to say?
1564620	1569340	No, I mean, it's just like, I mean, they were obviously able to recognize
1569540	1571340	an opportunity when it came.
1571540	1576540	But they recognized a lot of opportunities that weren't really good opportunities.
1576740	1580900	And I think, you know, not like they did great, right?
1581140	1584820	But they were lucky also, too, in some respects.
1585020	1587620	I think probably he will be the first to say that.
1587820	1592060	I mean, enormously, because you had to sort of be the guy catching the wave of
1592260	1595900	live streaming sort of and there's no way he probably fully understood what that
1596100	1601260	meant or could have foreseen some, you know, Amazon buyout in his future.
1601460	1605940	But yeah, I think so that's a really great point.
1605980	1611740	Is that, of course, luck is involved and a huge, hugely involved.
1611940	1614700	Let's talk about like one final thing.
1614900	1616860	I love this. I love the past.
1617060	1619500	Right. Is that
1619700	1623220	people think that young people are good entrepreneurs, actually.
1623420	1626900	And that's blatantly not true, actually.
1627100	1627780	That is it.
1627980	1631660	I just want to sort of insert that because now we're talking about Twitch and
1631860	1635380	you were mentioning some like Elon Musk and these all were successful when they
1635500	1639260	were young, right? And a lot of the cast of characters are the same, right?
1639460	1641940	Mark Zuckerberg was very young, dropped out of school.
1642140	1643700	Actually, there's really good evidence to
1643900	1648140	suggest that the most successful founders are in their 40s.
1648340	1649300	You're right.
1649500	1651780	45 seems to be the good age to do it.
1651980	1653420	And that makes a lot of sense, right?
1653620	1655100	It does.
1655300	1659180	Basically, because that's the point where you actually have some experience, right?
1659180	1660900	You actually know what it's like to work in a company.
1660900	1662420	You might have managerial experience.
1662420	1664780	You might know an industry that you're entering.
1664900	1669140	There's sort of this hype around young people being successful and that
1669340	1672300	sometimes you'll hear people saying, oh, you don't need industry experience to
1672500	1675260	succeed in an industry. It's actually an asset to not know anything.
1675460	1679500	But it's actually some good evidence also in this that if you enter an industry
1679700	1684340	with no experience as an entrepreneur, your chances of succeeding are very low.
1684540	1685340	Yeah, of course.
1685540	1687060	Right. Of course.
1687260	1688100	Right. Of course.
1688300	1692540	And the way to think about it probably is that the people who
1692700	1696740	become successful when they're really young would probably also have been
1696740	1698380	successful when they're older, right?
1698380	1701180	So the fact that they become successful at young age is because they're just
1701380	1703580	incredibly talented and lucky, right?
1703780	1705820	They would have been successful at other points in time, too.
1706020	1708780	Most of us need some time to get gone.
1708980	1710740	Need to know what we're doing.
1710940	1716940	I think that's so unbelievably important to mention is that,
1717140	1719100	first of all, it makes so much sense.
1719100	1724180	I'm glad you're just giving us the data on, you know, success and entrepreneurship
1724180	1727900	because I think there is a huge misunderstanding and I've had this in my mind.
1728100	1730340	I don't think I formally held it, but it's sort of
1730540	1733700	mythologizing our culture to where a lot of people feel this way, even if they
1733700	1737260	don't consciously hold this, that, yeah, young people are entrepreneurs.
1737260	1737820	That's what you do.
1737820	1740020	Like if you want to be an entrepreneur, you start young, right?
1740220	1742300	You get the you get the failures out of the way.
1742500	1745340	I've definitely probably internalized that.
1745540	1751700	And there is an idea, too, that you don't need domain expertise.
1751900	1757100	This is a big idea that you can just sort of be Elizabeth Holmes and you can just
1757300	1763660	walk into blood technology and you can just innovate because that's what Silicon Valley does.
1764380	1766740	Explain to us
1766940	1769980	why we need domain expertise.
1770180	1775020	I mean, I get that it's a bit obvious, but maybe we should just you should just explain.
1775140	1778500	Well, I mean, again, it depends on the industry, right?
1778700	1784860	But I mean, very often being able to even understand the technology in a given field,
1785060	1788140	right, will will be very important.
1788340	1792980	Understanding the business models that underpin a given field is going to be very
1793180	1799140	important very often, being able to understand the right people to hire will often be very
1799140	1803500	important and be able to engage in the networks and in the industry culture will
1803500	1804820	often be very important as well.
1805020	1807980	I mean, you're trying to compete for the same customers, right?
1808180	1812140	So having industry experience will often let you understand the customers that you're
1812340	1813380	going to be dealing with, right?
1813580	1818340	Or very often we find that people, right, they work in a given industry construction,
1818340	1821060	for instance, and then they develop an innovation that they're going to sell to
1821260	1822660	construction companies, right?
1822860	1826340	Because during their work, they identify a problem and then they come up with a
1826540	1831100	solution for it that they then sell to their old company and companies like it, right?
1831140	1834940	So industry experience is going to let you know what are actually the problems in
1835140	1838700	industry and all of that is going to be generative and it's going to help you
1838900	1842820	not just get good ideas, it's also going to help you sort bad ideas from good ideas.
1843020	1846260	So what are the low value things as things that are never going to fly?
1846460	1850500	So what you're telling people is it can help to get that industry experience first
1850700	1854780	because you're now making money instead of just like floating and probably losing money.
1854980	1855860	You can do that.
1856060	1857820	You can gain industry experience.
1857820	1859060	You can identify a need.
1859060	1860500	You can gain that domain expertise.
1860580	1863220	You identify a need once you have that domain expertise.
1863420	1870180	And then you launch a company later in your life when you're actually more likely
1870380	1873860	to succeed due to your now you have experience.
1874060	1879060	Plus at that point, you will maybe be in a different place financially.
1879260	1880980	Yes, which can also be very important.
1881180	1885820	Like one of the things that I find really depressing is that venture capital will
1885820	1889420	often say that before you ask for venture capital, you should do friends and family
1889540	1893620	around, which basically means you should ask your parents for money or your friends.
1893820	1895540	Right. It's a very nice way of saying, yeah.
1895740	1899940	When when when you're young, you're going to be asking your parents for money.
1900140	1902460	Right. And sometimes parents will do that.
1902660	1906540	Right. But often, like if you're not coming out of a very wealthy family,
1906740	1910180	they will be giving you their life earnings for your idea.
1910380	1915140	And you can easily imagine how that really is going to strain relationships
1915340	1916420	if you don't succeed.
1916620	1918900	There's a real social downside to that.
1919380	1923100	The fact is, if you wait until later, the chances are that you will have friends
1923300	1926860	who friends who actually have money and who understand the industry and can help
1927060	1929700	you, not just with money, but also with other things.
1929900	1933140	It also pains me when people like borrow against their house or something like
1933340	1935500	that, right? To persist in a venture.
1935700	1936940	It's very painful, right?
1937140	1941300	As sort of a precautionary principle, I would if you know that entrepreneurship
1941500	1945180	is really risky, right, you should think about it like buying lottery tickets.
1945180	1947540	You should only bet with house money, so to speak.
1947580	1950900	You should only pay with money that you can avoid to that you can that you don't
1951100	1952140	mind losing. Yeah.
1952340	1957540	And you should definitely set hard stops for yourself in the right sense.
1957740	1959340	You can just digging. Yeah.
1959540	1960580	Yeah, you can keep digging.
1960780	1962780	You can keep squeezing out more, right?
1962980	1967620	And but if you know that entrepreneurial success is really unlikely,
1967820	1968700	you wouldn't do that.
1968900	1972740	You'd be if you knew that success was rare, you would treat it.
1972740	1976180	And if you knew that it was like essentially buying a lottery ticket, right?
1976420	1979500	You would treat it differently than if you thought that success was just around
1979700	1983180	the corner. And so that's one of the things that I would sort of push people for,
1983380	1988340	right? Know that it's not very likely to succeed and treat it as such.
1988540	1990220	Let's talk about entrepreneurship advice.
1990420	1991980	There's this huge entrepreneurship,
1992180	1997180	entrepreneur industry, which is just like constantly bombarding people with
1997380	2001700	entrepreneurship advice, the blueprint to success as it were.
2001900	2003620	That's the words I hear a lot.
2003620	2007860	I'm sure that's not an academic term, the blueprint for success.
2008060	2009820	But it does happen on the time.
2010020	2017900	Now, one thing that drives me crazy to no end is that a lot of
2018100	2024860	these things can be true, but sort of not helpful or like sometimes true,
2025060	2026300	but not always true.
2026500	2028700	How do you have a very specific circumstances?
2028900	2029340	Right.
2029500	2036780	How do you see entrepreneurship advice helping and hurting people with regards
2036980	2041260	to this sort of one entrepreneur identity that people are cultivating?
2041460	2043540	OK, so in a couple of different ways, right?
2043540	2046300	I think it's worth just sort of underscoring that point, right?
2046500	2050260	That a lot of the advice you get seems really sensible,
2050460	2053780	sometimes counterintuitive, but sensible sometimes, right?
2053780	2055020	Let's give some of that advice.
2055220	2058820	Yeah. So, for instance, you should really get comfortable with failure.
2059060	2061740	Right? That's like very generic, right?
2061940	2062260	Yeah.
2062460	2065740	Some things surrounding like the minimal viable product, for instance, right?
2065740	2068860	You should this idea that you should just like try to get something together,
2069060	2073700	put it in front of customers, accept that it's not very good and try to learn
2073900	2074860	from the experience.
2075060	2075740	Right.
2075940	2082340	Other advice, like just pitch, pitch, pitch, just don't take no for an answer.
2082540	2084420	Try your idea with many, many investors.
2084620	2086380	If they don't give you money, keep going.
2086580	2087140	Yep.
2088140	2091980	Now, all those things, I think, can seem reasonable, right?
2091980	2096380	And it seems to be the case that you can find successful companies that have done
2096380	2099820	that, right? You can also find lots of successful companies that didn't do that.
2099820	2102620	You can find successful companies that did do it, but that wasn't the reason
2102620	2103340	that they succeeded.
2103340	2106380	You can find lots of unsuccessful companies that did it, right?
2106580	2107500	That did something similar.
2107700	2112700	So if you take something like the minimal viable product, right?
2112900	2116740	There's a way in which telling people to just like try to get something
2116740	2121580	together, put it in front of customers, if they don't like it, right?
2121780	2125940	I mean, I think it's the Reed Hoffman of LinkedIn has this idea that if you're
2125940	2129180	not ashamed of the first version of your product, you're doing it wrong.
2129380	2132500	I think it's important to keep in mind that failure is never good.
2132700	2137020	Sometimes you need to build up a certain tolerance for failure to take risk, right?
2137220	2138900	But failure is never good.
2139100	2143500	It's, we should say, just to be clear, it's not good in of itself.
2143660	2147380	I mean, I think a lot of times it's lionized because the examples people are
2147580	2151820	using are successes that are failures that led to future successes.
2152020	2155980	But people can conflate that with like, oh, it means that when I'm failing,
2156180	2158060	this is like a sign of my success.
2158260	2161700	And I'm doing something right, right?
2161900	2162660	That's one thing.
2162860	2166900	The other thing is like the pitch to investors, right?
2166900	2169820	And keep pitching if they don't accept your idea, right?
2170020	2174500	Well, you know, there's a way to think about getting rejected by investors,
2174700	2176980	which is that maybe your idea is just bad, right?
2177180	2181860	Maybe maybe that is experience and good judgment telling you that this is not the
2182060	2186340	way to go, right? And maybe persisting, right?
2186340	2188820	There are companies that persist and succeed.
2189020	2192660	But there are also lots of companies that persist and don't succeed.
2192860	2197820	I think that's sort of important to keep in mind that you sometimes you need to
2197820	2201700	take no for an answer because it's because that is information that you're
2201700	2202540	doing something wrong.
2202740	2205740	And I think generally like the whole normalization of failure,
2205940	2210300	it's actually part of why you can keep people in ventures that are not doing well,
2210500	2214820	right? Saying that failure is part of the recipe and they just need to wait.
2214820	2216140	The success is around the corner.
2216340	2220780	I think that is it's a really counterintuitive way for most people to think.
2220780	2222740	And it's good that it's counterintuitive.
2222940	2227100	You should be more sort of concise about what you mean when you say the failure is
2227180	2233500	good. Yeah, I think that the tricky thing is, is that for some people,
2233700	2238100	that really is how they succeed is they just keep failing and they get they sort
2238300	2240380	of accumulate experience through failure.
2240580	2244740	And I think that's the that's the kind of meaning behind when people say this.
2244940	2249740	But what you're saying is yes, but there are a lot of people who take that advice,
2249940	2254260	which might be good in a corner case or in a case of, you know, this person over
2254260	2258460	here for Reed Hoffman, it might be good with his minimal viable embarrassing
2258660	2263140	product, but it could be really bad for a lot of other entrepreneurs.
2263340	2265780	And you should be smart about
2265980	2269540	taking that advice or sort of like holding it very loosely.
2269740	2270980	That type of advice.
2271180	2276420	Yes, you should definitely you should definitely think about how far am I willing
2276420	2278980	to go and I think you should commit to that for the fact.
2279180	2283300	This is the amount of time that I will spend trying to get this to work.
2283500	2286860	Because people are going to have different
2287060	2289980	circumstances that allow them to take more or less risk.
2289980	2291780	And it's easy to just sort of get pulled in.
2291980	2295940	This is what economists sometimes call the sunk cost fallacy, right?
2296140	2300060	Or if I spent a year on it, I might as well spend another month, right?
2300260	2302300	And I think that's definitely worth considering.
2302500	2307060	And I mean, some of the advice is much more technically we call it contingent
2307260	2309460	than it's given credit for, right?
2309660	2312100	It might work, but it might also just not work at all.
2312220	2317620	And and being smart about when that advice is going to apply is very difficult.
2317820	2322420	And I think and the basic problem is this, I think people pursue.
2322620	2326100	People go to ask for advice because they don't know what to do.
2326300	2327420	Right? So they have a very different.
2327620	2332340	So if you knew how to gauge the value of the advice, you wouldn't be asking the
2332540	2334220	advice very often.
2334420	2338660	So by definition, when you get the advice, you are sort of hard to know if it's good.
2338860	2341460	Good advice, very hard to know if it's good advice when you get it.
2341540	2345300	Because if you knew whether it was good advice, you wouldn't need good advice.
2345500	2346540	That's hilarious.
2346740	2350100	So I think it's very worthwhile to sort of trying to separate yourself.
2350100	2353100	Right? The basic thing that you should probably do, I think, is to say,
2353300	2356380	how much time and how much money am I willing to invest in this?
2356580	2358300	Correct. And commit to that, right?
2358500	2362020	And say it might be that success is just around the corner,
2362220	2363620	but I don't know if I can wait that long.
2363820	2364580	Right? That's one thing.
2364780	2368500	And then the other thing is to definitely use some work to separate oneself from the
2368500	2375100	hype, say, OK, I don't care if it worked for Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever.
2375300	2377340	What are the chances that this might work for me?
2377540	2380580	And then treat your idea as something that you're trying to prove out that it won't
2380780	2383620	work so that you can get out, right?
2383820	2386700	Prove out that this is too good of an opportunity
2386900	2388980	to not abandon, right?
2389180	2390740	Right. I think that's the way to think about it.
2390940	2394940	And don't be afraid to pick up some industry experience
2395140	2398340	before you jump into your, you know, your big idea.
2398540	2402460	I know every idea seems like it's pressing and it has to be done right now.
2402660	2407260	But I think you made a really compelling argument to maybe hold off a bit,
2407460	2411620	get some get some real world experience before you go launch
2411820	2414060	your entrepreneurship career.
2414260	2418780	And I mean, like not every idea is worth dropping out of school for, right?
2418980	2421940	And there's a big difference between dropping out of school because you think
2421940	2423340	it's too easy, right?
2423540	2426780	If you're in Mark Zuckerberg and leaving Harvard because you think it's too easy,
2426980	2429780	that's very different from dropping out of
2429980	2433180	pretty much any other school because you're staying out quite relevant.
2433380	2434980	Yeah, that's very different.
2435180	2439300	And that's a very different sort of information you're getting about your potential.
2439500	2442700	And to be very clear, no, no, no, absolutely.
2442900	2448420	To be super clear, you can look at the outcomes of people with
2448500	2452420	degrees and especially like Ivy educated degrees.
2452420	2456500	And you can look at the difference between that and people who have dropped out
2456700	2461980	on the list of billionaires, like 30 millionaires and up.
2462180	2466940	It is just overwhelmingly dominated by people who have,
2467140	2472260	you know, sunk a bunch of time into their education, regardless of whether you
2472460	2476100	think education is overpriced or not.
2476300	2477900	Yes, it probably is.
2477900	2481940	But it's also underutilized, I think, if you sort of have the willingness
2481940	2486420	in the drive to become an entrepreneur and to work as hard as some people are for that.
2486620	2490140	I think there's a way to get much more out of college than most people do.
2490340	2491620	But that's a separate discussion.
2491820	2494020	But sure, I think that's interesting.
2494220	2499500	Underutilized probably probably you mean in the sense of how you're using the resource, right?
2499700	2504060	You're using the access to people who know something, how you're using the access
2504060	2508340	to networks, how you're using the access to information.
2508340	2512140	I mean, there's no shortage of people going to college and, you know,
2512340	2515020	but and just kind of benefiting as much as they could.
2515220	2517300	Yes, yes, yes, much attention.
2517500	2518060	You know what?
2518260	2520820	I think there needs to be a paper about the
2521020	2525540	Véblenian college student because there's certainly like an identity class of like,
2525740	2528140	oh, I'm just, you know, going to school.
2528340	2530380	That's a separate discussion for a separate time.
2530580	2532940	But but absolutely.
2533060	2534020	Yeah, yeah.
2534220	2540700	So one of the things you shot an email about is alternative strategies for people.
2540700	2541940	You talked about Joshua Gantz.
2541940	2544100	We talked about that yet at MIT.
2544300	2547100	We haven't. Joshua Gantz is at Toronto
2547300	2552820	and has done some interesting work with with Scott Stern at MIT.
2553020	2557980	And they basically have a whole series of papers about you can actually get the book for free.
2557980	2561100	It's online. If you search for entrepreneurial strategy,
2561300	2563540	you will be taken to the website and you get the book for free.
2563740	2565460	It's it's a really good book.
2565660	2566500	Highly recommend it.
2566700	2571900	One of the reasons I mentioned that in our pre pre discussion was that
2572100	2577340	people sometimes have the impression that disruption is the way to be an entrepreneur.
2577540	2579500	Right. Disruption is one of these things.
2579700	2585660	Right. You should really go after challenging industries, upsetting the incumbents, things like that.
2585860	2589780	I recommend that book because it's so helpful for thinking about different
2589780	2594740	strategies and often less risky strategies to pursue with ideas.
2594940	2595300	Right.
2595500	2599220	There are going to be cases where disruption is probably the right path for an
2599420	2603620	entrepreneur to take, but there are often alternative strategies that are worth
2603820	2609420	considering and testing out that will like disruptions, probably like the most risky
2609620	2611820	thing you could do. Right.
2612020	2613620	Right. You're trying to change.
2613820	2619420	You're trying to fundamentally change an industry unseat incumbents.
2619660	2624980	And like established firms, like trying to take down Blockbuster, Ford,
2625180	2627780	whichever, like name your industry incumbents.
2627980	2633260	Right. And very often that is going to be an incredibly risky strategy for all kinds
2633460	2636860	of obvious reasons. Their work is interesting, I think, because it can probably help people
2637060	2641420	think about the value of doing some things that are less risky, but nonetheless,
2641620	2644740	that are going to be lucrative and interesting for many people, especially if you have
2644940	2649300	industry experience, there are going to be ways to think about any given idea.
2649500	2651460	In more or less risky ways.
2651660	2658940	Do you think there's a the reason that we only think largely of, you know,
2659140	2663380	I guess, being an entrepreneur in terms of disruption because of the fact that all
2663580	2667740	of the cases that a lot of people immediately think of when they think of like
2667940	2672700	entrepreneur, they think of recent examples where you had this emerging
2672900	2677460	technology that really changed everything and it made disruption very easily
2677500	2680100	possible for, you know, some industries.
2680300	2685540	And so you had these like monsters come out like Facebook, Tesla, all these companies,
2685740	2689940	which it's like so we always think of those because those are the most,
2690140	2694580	you know, the biggest examples, but maybe the most common example of the examples
2694580	2698660	that actually are bearing out for a lot of people are not the disruptive cases.
2698660	2700020	And that's maybe what you're saying.
2700220	2705260	Exactly. The thing like lots of people will or lots of entrepreneurial companies
2705420	2709140	will be faced with a choice of whether to do something that is disruptive and high
2709340	2714100	risk, or maybe something that is not quite as disruptive, more oriented towards
2714300	2718740	what their book calls value change strategies, where you're basically trying
2718940	2722220	to help other companies do well and succeed, right?
2722420	2725500	That often is something that works best if you actually have industry experience,
2725500	2728780	as we talked about before, because you know the organization's in an industry
2728780	2732340	and you can say, what are the pain points and how can I sort of try to solve those
2732340	2733220	in an interesting way?
2733260	2737540	So I'd highly recommend that for most people to sort of just broaden
2737740	2741300	if you want to be an entrepreneur, if you if that is for you, right?
2741300	2744620	And if you're comfortable with all the risk and all the downsides that we've talked
2744820	2748900	about, right, I definitely encourage people to read that as sort of a way to
2749100	2754300	broaden their imagination about how you can be an entrepreneur.
2754500	2756460	Because there are many, many more ways to do it.
2756660	2759500	And the Silicon Valley model is just one
2759700	2761700	and it's not going to be the right one for lots of people.
2761900	2763740	It's definitely a very risky one.
2763940	2765580	I think that's so important.
2765780	2771380	And one thing I want to remind the audience of is that neither myself
2771580	2775740	nor Dr. Hartman are against entrepreneurs.
2775940	2778660	No, no, quite the contrary.
2778860	2779700	Quite the contrary.
2779900	2784380	This is about getting people to have better outcomes by thinking more critically
2784580	2789900	about being an entrepreneur, what that means, because what your your paper kind
2789900	2794220	of compellingly crafts a narrative for is that there's sort of a
2794420	2798700	there's an entrepreneur ideology that sort of a lot of people just sort of buy
2798700	2801620	into just like the disruptive idea that everyone just sort of thinks, oh,
2801620	2802620	that's the way you start a company.
2802820	2806300	And of course, it's just one of the many ways you could start a company.
2806500	2810380	There are a lot of useful ways to thinking about entrepreneurship, that if you're
2810580	2814700	going into it, it is important to know you have to not just think, you know,
2814700	2815980	only positive thoughts all the time.
2815980	2820140	You have to know the risks part of being a successful entrepreneur is
2820340	2823740	understanding and hedging against risk.
2823940	2826540	It is so undervalued.
2826740	2828940	Sorry, I don't just got a little
2829140	2833580	that is an excellent summary.
2833780	2838220	I think the and I think that's definitely very important to really appreciate.
2838420	2839220	Is this for me?
2839420	2843940	Right? Like we talked about this, that there is being an entrepreneur has something
2843980	2848340	of trying to be a professional athlete about it.
2848540	2849740	Right? Right?
2849940	2855540	If so, that for most people should be a red flag saying, no, I'm not going to do that.
2855740	2858580	If you are called to do it, right?
2858780	2861340	Then you should definitely know the ins and outs of it.
2861340	2864460	You should think about the different ways that you can approach this.
2864660	2868220	You know about the kind of things that are really risky and the kinds of things
2868220	2871100	that will get you injured and the things that will push you out of the game.
2871300	2871860	Right? Yeah.
2871980	2874900	And that will lead you to costs that you don't want to bear.
2875100	2877620	I think that's really important.
2877820	2879300	Because as you say,
2879500	2883620	entrepreneurship is super important, but well functioning entrepreneurship is even
2883820	2887020	more important, like the economy does not work without entrepreneurship.
2887220	2889900	We tried economies without entrepreneurship.
2889900	2893740	It was called the Soviet Union and it wasn't great, right?
2893940	2896980	So we need entrepreneurship a lot.
2897180	2900700	But we also needed to work well and we need people to not be
2900940	2905660	misled about what it is and the kinds of risks that are involved for sure.
2905860	2910260	And the realities of how to do better at entrepreneurship.
2910260	2914020	I mean, I think the funny thing is is you are presenting us with sort of like hard
2914220	2918020	data on what so many other people are promising to make you a better entrepreneur.
2918220	2923460	And you're telling us what entrepreneurship success looks like in the data.
2923660	2928860	And I think that's so important for people who are, you know, in the audience who are
2928900	2931100	interested in that to really take the heart.
2931300	2936020	So I will link, we will talk about a lot of the papers and the sources you cited
2936220	2940900	for statistics related to success, you know, when you're young or when you're old.
2941100	2943740	We'll talk about, you know, education.
2943940	2947700	We'll have the educational strategy book linked in the show notes.
2947900	2954060	And also, of course, I will be linking the paper, which I found I was such a
2954260	2957540	I have cited that paper a bunch of times, sort of informally on the channel.
2957540	2961780	And I knew I always wanted to do an interview about it because it's
2961980	2963740	it holds a near and dear place to my heart.
2963940	2965460	But let's be clear.
2965660	2968380	This is a this is a theory, right?
2968580	2974260	Like this is part of academia is that you are proposing a theory to fit
2974460	2978740	data that you know is happening, which is like declining entrepreneur outcomes.
2978940	2980860	Would you like to talk about that a bit a little bit?
2981060	2984340	Like hedge a little bit about what we're talking about, right?
2984340	2989980	So so I think people should read the paper, actually, because what we're doing
2990180	2993740	is we're proposing a way that things might work, right?
2993740	2996420	And there are different interpretations that one could make.
2996620	2999980	What we're suggesting is essentially a hypothesis, right?
3000180	3004820	Academic production is such that you often have what's called a conceptual paper,
3005020	3006180	which lays out an idea.
3006380	3010980	And then you have empirical studies that do that basically present data, right?
3011220	3014300	And we're in the process of beginning those
3014500	3019780	the data collection and but are producing different hypothesis, hypothesis papers.
3019980	3021740	And this is one, right?
3021940	3024620	The paper that you can find online now is not published yet.
3024820	3026900	So it hasn't been through peer review.
3027100	3029620	The peer reviewed version will be out
3029820	3033820	by summer, it has been accepted for for a journal, which is called
3034020	3038060	Research in the Sociology of Organizations, but that will come out.
3038060	3042100	And when you say a lot of when when you talk about hard data,
3042100	3044220	I should say this is not data that we have collected.
3044420	3047780	This is data from other studies just sort of to be clear.
3047980	3048980	Yeah, absolutely.
3049180	3055140	Interpretation that we're offering is is also not a is not proven out by data.
3055340	3058980	And it's not a widely accepted view, right?
3059180	3062260	I mean, there's quite a lot of consensus that
3062460	3064340	entrepreneurial quality is declining.
3064340	3069460	It's not a unanimously help you, but it's pretty close.
3070060	3073220	So that is a that is sort of a real thing.
3073420	3075740	The idea that the linking of the
3075740	3078740	entrepreneurship ideologies to the entrepreneurship industry to declining
3078940	3083580	entrepreneurial quality is sort of that's that's our right.
3083780	3085220	That's our idea and it's conjecture.
3085420	3087140	I think yeah, yeah, right?
3087340	3089060	Yeah, just to be clear.
3089260	3091220	Oh, no, no, I appreciate it.
3091300	3094260	I appreciate how careful you are.
3094260	3096860	And I think that's an important part of any kind of,
3097060	3100660	you know, if you're going to be in academia, that's that's part of your job.
3100860	3101540	Right.
3101740	3105340	Is to tell people like what's settled, what's not.
3105540	3107220	And I appreciate you doing that.
3107420	3110300	Dr. Hartman, thank you so much for coming on the show.
3110500	3115740	I hope people got a lot of to use a loaded expression of value out of out of that.
3115940	3116540	I hope so too.
3116740	3117540	Absolutely.
3117660	3123380	So I hope some more informed career choices will ensue.
3123580	3125380	Same here. Thank you so much.
3125580	3127340	Thank you for the opportunity.
3127540	3128380	Have a great day.
