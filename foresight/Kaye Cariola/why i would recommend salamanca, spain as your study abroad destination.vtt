Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. My name is Kay and today I'm going to be talking

00:12.160 --> 00:19.080
to you about the 7 reasons why I would recommend Salamanca, Spain as your study abroad destination.

00:19.080 --> 00:25.280
So I studied abroad in Salamanca the summer of 2018 and I went with ISA, otherwise known

00:25.280 --> 00:32.840
as International Studies Abroad and through them I took a 5 week summer intensive course

00:32.840 --> 00:39.880
in which I was able to study at the University of Salamanca. I took 4 courses and was able

00:39.880 --> 00:43.640
to transfer the credit that I earned from there back to my home university towards

00:43.640 --> 00:49.680
my degree. And overall my study abroad experience highly exceeded my expectations. If you're

00:49.680 --> 00:53.680
thinking about studying abroad anywhere in the world I would just highly recommend it

00:53.680 --> 01:00.200
because it's just a positive experience where you learn a lot, you have fun, you meet new

01:00.200 --> 01:06.680
people and it's just an entirely different experience that's outside of your comfort

01:06.680 --> 01:12.320
zone and that if you give it a chance that you can learn a lot from and grow a lot from.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.000
So I'm going to get into the reasons why I would recommend Salamanca as your destination.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.640
Salamanca is an ideal place to practice speaking Spanish and Salamanca is often referred to

01:23.640 --> 01:30.400
as La Ciudad del EspaÃ±ol which is the city for learning Spanish and a lot of international

01:30.400 --> 01:39.000
students come to Salamanca to learn Spanish and along with their other studies and from

01:39.000 --> 01:48.580
what I gather, El Castellano, Castilian Spanish is the kind of standard Spanish that's most

01:48.580 --> 01:54.820
widely spoken and that has spread around the world. So the Spanish that you hear in other

01:54.820 --> 02:00.300
countries most resembles Castilian Spanish is what I gathered from that. And during my

02:00.300 --> 02:08.100
time there I tried to speak as much Spanish as possible with my host family, with my university

02:08.100 --> 02:14.980
professors and just when you're out in the street in your daily life. And in my experience

02:15.060 --> 02:19.620
the majority of people are really helpful and encouraging when you want to practice speaking

02:19.620 --> 02:27.780
Spanish for them. I haven't had any instances where someone will speak English to me when

02:27.780 --> 02:34.660
I'm trying to speak Spanish to them which I know can happen a lot in different places

02:34.660 --> 02:41.420
around the world. But yeah usually people are really patient and if you try to speak

02:41.420 --> 02:48.380
whatever you know then they'll usually just be really understanding and respond back to

02:48.380 --> 02:56.220
you nicely. And I think what's most important is that you try and be sincere about it and

02:56.220 --> 03:01.180
people will generally respond positively. And you don't have to be a completely fluent

03:01.180 --> 03:05.260
Spanish speaker to come study in Salamanca because there are different universities that

03:05.260 --> 03:11.900
offer various levels of courses from beginning to superior. So whether you know a little bit

03:11.900 --> 03:17.100
of Spanish or you know a lot of Spanish or if you're fluent then you can come and just continue

03:17.100 --> 03:22.940
your studies here. The second reason is that Universidad de Salamanca, the University of Salamanca

03:23.660 --> 03:30.060
is one of the top universities in the world. It is the oldest in Spain and one of the most

03:30.060 --> 03:35.820
prestigious in the world. And overall I'd say the education that I got there was really good.

03:35.820 --> 03:42.620
For my Spanish language and culture curriculum I took four courses so I took Spanish language,

03:43.260 --> 03:49.980
Spanish history, Spanish literature, and Spanish art. I found that all my professors were just very

03:50.700 --> 03:56.620
interested and passionate about what they were teaching. I feel like my Spanish language course

03:56.620 --> 04:03.420
was the one that I learned the most in because we were taught practical information that you

04:03.420 --> 04:09.740
could use like outside in the real world. So our professor taught us stuff like how to order a

04:09.740 --> 04:14.860
pinto at a bar or to ask how much something costs to the grocery store or ask like where the bus

04:14.860 --> 04:19.980
station is and just like stuff like that. I would say overall that the courses aren't extremely

04:19.980 --> 04:26.940
difficult. I feel like as long as you put effort in you participate and you listen then you're

04:26.940 --> 04:33.340
going to pass with a high grade. And the third reason why I would recommend Salamanca is because

04:33.340 --> 04:40.220
it's beautiful there. It has so many incredibly picturesque places. So many of the major sites

04:40.220 --> 04:45.820
are really beautiful but there are also some I feel like lesser known hidden places that are

04:46.540 --> 04:52.860
also equally as beautiful. Whenever I would go out and explore the city whether it was alone or

04:52.860 --> 04:59.980
with my friends we just found these really beautiful places and a lot of them were free to go to and

04:59.980 --> 05:06.780
just visit and living there for a time just really made me inspired and appreciative of the scenery

05:06.780 --> 05:11.900
that I was able to see every day. And the fourth reason why I would recommend Salamanca to study

05:11.900 --> 05:18.540
abroad in is because it's a student-friendly city. Because of the Universidad de Salamanca and other

05:19.100 --> 05:24.620
universities in the city there's a lot of young people there. There's a lot of people studying

05:24.620 --> 05:30.860
abroad as well. So you find a lot of young people. The city has a really young vibe. There's lots of

05:31.980 --> 05:37.500
bars, cafes like just lots of places to hang out and where you see a lot of people just

05:38.460 --> 05:43.740
hanging out together. And one thing you'll always hear about Salamanca from your advisors or

05:44.940 --> 05:51.660
your professors is that the city is completely walkable and it is. Also the city is student

05:51.660 --> 05:58.780
budget friendly. It's really cheap to go out for a pincho or a tapa or get a drink either in between

05:58.780 --> 06:03.100
your classes or like during the afternoon when you want to hang out with some friends or grab a snack

06:03.100 --> 06:08.860
or anything. Usually for like a small plate of food or like a pastry or something it's usually

06:08.860 --> 06:14.060
less than five euros. And if you get a drink that's usually like three or four. In between my morning

06:14.060 --> 06:20.620
classes I had a 30 minute break so I would always stop at the same cafe and get a fresh squeezed

06:20.620 --> 06:27.900
orange juice. And a little pastry just for a little something before the rest of my classes

06:27.900 --> 06:32.780
during the day. And it was always cheap too. And another good reason to study abroad in Salamanca

06:32.780 --> 06:40.540
is because Salamanca is safe. I was constantly reassured by my professors and my ISA directors

06:40.540 --> 06:47.500
that it's a very safe city especially for young people to be in. You always see people walking

06:47.500 --> 06:52.940
out in the streets. The main areas are always well lit. Like you see a lot of people like

06:52.940 --> 07:00.940
going out either to eat or like going out to the club or the bar. And like people are generally like

07:01.900 --> 07:05.900
just friendly or if you like mind your own business then you know you're not bothered.

07:05.900 --> 07:11.660
Whenever I went out to explore the city I was usually out during the daytime or I was with a

07:11.660 --> 07:18.380
group of friends and if I went out at night then I wasn't alone. And there are taxis that are always

07:18.380 --> 07:22.300
available to take you home if you feel like you need it. And in my experience I never had any

07:22.300 --> 07:28.700
encounters where I felt unsafe. But with that being said it's always a smart idea to be aware

07:28.780 --> 07:35.020
of your surroundings. To be with your friends or other people when you can. Trust your gut feeling

07:35.020 --> 07:39.340
if something doesn't feel right. And if you can just have a backup plan so just in case you're

07:39.340 --> 07:41.740
in a situation you don't want to be in then you're taken care of.

07:49.980 --> 07:57.340
Salamanca has lots of activities, things to do and events that are usually really inexpensive

07:57.420 --> 08:01.980
or they are free. When I was there there were a couple of different events that were being held

08:02.540 --> 08:10.940
like the fiste of San Juan de Sao, which is Salamanca's patron saint. And they have a fireworks

08:10.940 --> 08:17.900
show that's over the Rio Tormes, the Tormes River. Yeah just a really special occasion to go out and

08:17.900 --> 08:23.980
celebrate something local. And another really cool exhibition was the Festival de Luz y Van

08:23.980 --> 08:32.620
Guadalhas, which was an art festival featuring lights, projections, and installations that were

08:32.620 --> 08:38.060
exhibited on some of Salamanca's most famous buildings. It was just really cool. There are

08:38.060 --> 08:45.500
plenty of places to sightsee. There's lots of historical buildings, museums, cultural places,

08:46.300 --> 08:50.860
places of religious significance, and lots of places to learn about Salamanca's history and

08:50.860 --> 08:58.860
culture. I will leave a link in the description below to my blog post that has a list of recommendations

08:58.860 --> 09:07.260
for free things to do, things to go see that you can go to for like a small fee. And these places

09:07.260 --> 09:13.500
usually have student discounts so that's even cheaper. Yeah just a list of recommendations

09:13.500 --> 09:20.140
I would suggest to people going to go visit. And the last reason I would recommend Salamanca as

09:20.140 --> 09:26.220
your study abroad destination is because it's a great place to make friends and meet new people.

09:26.220 --> 09:33.420
The city has a very young vibe and there are lots of events and activities and opportunities to

09:33.420 --> 09:37.980
meet new people and to find others to share your study abroad experience with. If you're going

09:37.980 --> 09:43.500
with a study abroad program like ISA, then you already have a group of people that you can

09:43.500 --> 09:48.300
connect with even before you get to the city. Obviously you'll meet people through your classes,

09:48.300 --> 09:54.940
there are organized events that the university will hold or your study abroad program will hold

09:54.940 --> 10:01.900
to either meet with locals or just like cultural classes that you can take together. And I think

10:02.540 --> 10:07.500
like experiences like these are really important to just put yourself out there and to like

10:07.500 --> 10:11.900
just participate in because it'll make your experience that much more enjoyable and language

10:11.900 --> 10:16.860
exchange programs are fantastic because you get the opportunity to practice speaking Spanish

10:16.860 --> 10:24.300
usually with locals. You can meet people that are from the city or from Spain or from like

10:24.300 --> 10:29.340
even like different places around the world and just practice speaking your Spanish together.

10:29.340 --> 10:33.020
And you'll also get to know each other and make friends and that's also a good thing too.

10:33.900 --> 10:39.820
And most of the people I met usually is just really nice and just fun to be around and always

10:40.540 --> 10:47.260
up for an adventure or chilling or just spending some time together. And those are my top reasons

10:47.260 --> 10:51.660
why I would recommend Salamanca Spain as your study abroad destination. Let me know in the

10:51.660 --> 10:57.420
