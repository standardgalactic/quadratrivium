0	12160	Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. My name is Kay and today I'm going to be talking
12160	19080	to you about the 7 reasons why I would recommend Salamanca, Spain as your study abroad destination.
19080	25280	So I studied abroad in Salamanca the summer of 2018 and I went with ISA, otherwise known
25280	32840	as International Studies Abroad and through them I took a 5 week summer intensive course
32840	39880	in which I was able to study at the University of Salamanca. I took 4 courses and was able
39880	43640	to transfer the credit that I earned from there back to my home university towards
43640	49680	my degree. And overall my study abroad experience highly exceeded my expectations. If you're
49680	53680	thinking about studying abroad anywhere in the world I would just highly recommend it
53680	60200	because it's just a positive experience where you learn a lot, you have fun, you meet new
60200	66680	people and it's just an entirely different experience that's outside of your comfort
66680	72320	zone and that if you give it a chance that you can learn a lot from and grow a lot from.
72320	78000	So I'm going to get into the reasons why I would recommend Salamanca as your destination.
78000	83640	Salamanca is an ideal place to practice speaking Spanish and Salamanca is often referred to
83640	90400	as La Ciudad del Espa√±ol which is the city for learning Spanish and a lot of international
90400	99000	students come to Salamanca to learn Spanish and along with their other studies and from
99000	108580	what I gather, El Castellano, Castilian Spanish is the kind of standard Spanish that's most
108580	114820	widely spoken and that has spread around the world. So the Spanish that you hear in other
114820	120300	countries most resembles Castilian Spanish is what I gathered from that. And during my
120300	128100	time there I tried to speak as much Spanish as possible with my host family, with my university
128100	134980	professors and just when you're out in the street in your daily life. And in my experience
135060	139620	the majority of people are really helpful and encouraging when you want to practice speaking
139620	147780	Spanish for them. I haven't had any instances where someone will speak English to me when
147780	154660	I'm trying to speak Spanish to them which I know can happen a lot in different places
154660	161420	around the world. But yeah usually people are really patient and if you try to speak
161420	168380	whatever you know then they'll usually just be really understanding and respond back to
168380	176220	you nicely. And I think what's most important is that you try and be sincere about it and
176220	181180	people will generally respond positively. And you don't have to be a completely fluent
181180	185260	Spanish speaker to come study in Salamanca because there are different universities that
185260	191900	offer various levels of courses from beginning to superior. So whether you know a little bit
191900	197100	of Spanish or you know a lot of Spanish or if you're fluent then you can come and just continue
197100	202940	your studies here. The second reason is that Universidad de Salamanca, the University of Salamanca
203660	210060	is one of the top universities in the world. It is the oldest in Spain and one of the most
210060	215820	prestigious in the world. And overall I'd say the education that I got there was really good.
215820	222620	For my Spanish language and culture curriculum I took four courses so I took Spanish language,
223260	229980	Spanish history, Spanish literature, and Spanish art. I found that all my professors were just very
230700	236620	interested and passionate about what they were teaching. I feel like my Spanish language course
236620	243420	was the one that I learned the most in because we were taught practical information that you
243420	249740	could use like outside in the real world. So our professor taught us stuff like how to order a
249740	254860	pinto at a bar or to ask how much something costs to the grocery store or ask like where the bus
254860	259980	station is and just like stuff like that. I would say overall that the courses aren't extremely
259980	266940	difficult. I feel like as long as you put effort in you participate and you listen then you're
266940	273340	going to pass with a high grade. And the third reason why I would recommend Salamanca is because
273340	280220	it's beautiful there. It has so many incredibly picturesque places. So many of the major sites
280220	285820	are really beautiful but there are also some I feel like lesser known hidden places that are
286540	292860	also equally as beautiful. Whenever I would go out and explore the city whether it was alone or
292860	299980	with my friends we just found these really beautiful places and a lot of them were free to go to and
299980	306780	just visit and living there for a time just really made me inspired and appreciative of the scenery
306780	311900	that I was able to see every day. And the fourth reason why I would recommend Salamanca to study
311900	318540	abroad in is because it's a student-friendly city. Because of the Universidad de Salamanca and other
319100	324620	universities in the city there's a lot of young people there. There's a lot of people studying
324620	330860	abroad as well. So you find a lot of young people. The city has a really young vibe. There's lots of
331980	337500	bars, cafes like just lots of places to hang out and where you see a lot of people just
338460	343740	hanging out together. And one thing you'll always hear about Salamanca from your advisors or
344940	351660	your professors is that the city is completely walkable and it is. Also the city is student
351660	358780	budget friendly. It's really cheap to go out for a pincho or a tapa or get a drink either in between
358780	363100	your classes or like during the afternoon when you want to hang out with some friends or grab a snack
363100	368860	or anything. Usually for like a small plate of food or like a pastry or something it's usually
368860	374060	less than five euros. And if you get a drink that's usually like three or four. In between my morning
374060	380620	classes I had a 30 minute break so I would always stop at the same cafe and get a fresh squeezed
380620	387900	orange juice. And a little pastry just for a little something before the rest of my classes
387900	392780	during the day. And it was always cheap too. And another good reason to study abroad in Salamanca
392780	400540	is because Salamanca is safe. I was constantly reassured by my professors and my ISA directors
400540	407500	that it's a very safe city especially for young people to be in. You always see people walking
407500	412940	out in the streets. The main areas are always well lit. Like you see a lot of people like
412940	420940	going out either to eat or like going out to the club or the bar. And like people are generally like
421900	425900	just friendly or if you like mind your own business then you know you're not bothered.
425900	431660	Whenever I went out to explore the city I was usually out during the daytime or I was with a
431660	438380	group of friends and if I went out at night then I wasn't alone. And there are taxis that are always
438380	442300	available to take you home if you feel like you need it. And in my experience I never had any
442300	448700	encounters where I felt unsafe. But with that being said it's always a smart idea to be aware
448780	455020	of your surroundings. To be with your friends or other people when you can. Trust your gut feeling
455020	459340	if something doesn't feel right. And if you can just have a backup plan so just in case you're
459340	461740	in a situation you don't want to be in then you're taken care of.
469980	477340	Salamanca has lots of activities, things to do and events that are usually really inexpensive
477420	481980	or they are free. When I was there there were a couple of different events that were being held
482540	490940	like the fiste of San Juan de Sao, which is Salamanca's patron saint. And they have a fireworks
490940	497900	show that's over the Rio Tormes, the Tormes River. Yeah just a really special occasion to go out and
497900	503980	celebrate something local. And another really cool exhibition was the Festival de Luz y Van
503980	512620	Guadalhas, which was an art festival featuring lights, projections, and installations that were
512620	518060	exhibited on some of Salamanca's most famous buildings. It was just really cool. There are
518060	525500	plenty of places to sightsee. There's lots of historical buildings, museums, cultural places,
526300	530860	places of religious significance, and lots of places to learn about Salamanca's history and
530860	538860	culture. I will leave a link in the description below to my blog post that has a list of recommendations
538860	547260	for free things to do, things to go see that you can go to for like a small fee. And these places
547260	553500	usually have student discounts so that's even cheaper. Yeah just a list of recommendations
553500	560140	I would suggest to people going to go visit. And the last reason I would recommend Salamanca as
560140	566220	your study abroad destination is because it's a great place to make friends and meet new people.
566220	573420	The city has a very young vibe and there are lots of events and activities and opportunities to
573420	577980	meet new people and to find others to share your study abroad experience with. If you're going
577980	583500	with a study abroad program like ISA, then you already have a group of people that you can
583500	588300	connect with even before you get to the city. Obviously you'll meet people through your classes,
588300	594940	there are organized events that the university will hold or your study abroad program will hold
594940	601900	to either meet with locals or just like cultural classes that you can take together. And I think
602540	607500	like experiences like these are really important to just put yourself out there and to like
607500	611900	just participate in because it'll make your experience that much more enjoyable and language
611900	616860	exchange programs are fantastic because you get the opportunity to practice speaking Spanish
616860	624300	usually with locals. You can meet people that are from the city or from Spain or from like
624300	629340	even like different places around the world and just practice speaking your Spanish together.
629340	633020	And you'll also get to know each other and make friends and that's also a good thing too.
633900	639820	And most of the people I met usually is just really nice and just fun to be around and always
640540	647260	up for an adventure or chilling or just spending some time together. And those are my top reasons
647260	651660	why I would recommend Salamanca Spain as your study abroad destination. Let me know in the
651660	657420	comments below if you've been to Salamanca whether it's for study abroad or not and if there are any
657420	662860	recommendations that you would leave for places to go around the city, things to do, stuff like that.
662860	668140	Also let me know if you've studied abroad and where you went and if you would recommend it or not.
