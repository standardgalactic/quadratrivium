00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. My name is Kay and today I'm going to be talking

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,080
to you about the 7 reasons why I would recommend Salamanca, Spain as your study abroad destination.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,280
So I studied abroad in Salamanca the summer of 2018 and I went with ISA, otherwise known

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,840
as International Studies Abroad and through them I took a 5 week summer intensive course

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,880
in which I was able to study at the University of Salamanca. I took 4 courses and was able

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,640
to transfer the credit that I earned from there back to my home university towards

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,680
my degree. And overall my study abroad experience highly exceeded my expectations. If you're

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,680
thinking about studying abroad anywhere in the world I would just highly recommend it

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,200
because it's just a positive experience where you learn a lot, you have fun, you meet new

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,680
people and it's just an entirely different experience that's outside of your comfort

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,320
zone and that if you give it a chance that you can learn a lot from and grow a lot from.

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,000
So I'm going to get into the reasons why I would recommend Salamanca as your destination.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,640
Salamanca is an ideal place to practice speaking Spanish and Salamanca is often referred to

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,400
as La Ciudad del EspaÃ±ol which is the city for learning Spanish and a lot of international

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,000
students come to Salamanca to learn Spanish and along with their other studies and from

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,580
what I gather, El Castellano, Castilian Spanish is the kind of standard Spanish that's most

17
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,820
widely spoken and that has spread around the world. So the Spanish that you hear in other

18
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,300
countries most resembles Castilian Spanish is what I gathered from that. And during my

19
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:08,100
time there I tried to speak as much Spanish as possible with my host family, with my university

20
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,980
professors and just when you're out in the street in your daily life. And in my experience

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,620
the majority of people are really helpful and encouraging when you want to practice speaking

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:27,780
Spanish for them. I haven't had any instances where someone will speak English to me when

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,660
I'm trying to speak Spanish to them which I know can happen a lot in different places

24
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,420
around the world. But yeah usually people are really patient and if you try to speak

25
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,380
whatever you know then they'll usually just be really understanding and respond back to

26
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:56,220
you nicely. And I think what's most important is that you try and be sincere about it and

27
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,180
people will generally respond positively. And you don't have to be a completely fluent

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,260
Spanish speaker to come study in Salamanca because there are different universities that

29
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,900
offer various levels of courses from beginning to superior. So whether you know a little bit

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,100
of Spanish or you know a lot of Spanish or if you're fluent then you can come and just continue

31
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,940
your studies here. The second reason is that Universidad de Salamanca, the University of Salamanca

32
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,060
is one of the top universities in the world. It is the oldest in Spain and one of the most

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,820
prestigious in the world. And overall I'd say the education that I got there was really good.

34
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,620
For my Spanish language and culture curriculum I took four courses so I took Spanish language,

35
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,980
Spanish history, Spanish literature, and Spanish art. I found that all my professors were just very

36
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,620
interested and passionate about what they were teaching. I feel like my Spanish language course

37
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:03,420
was the one that I learned the most in because we were taught practical information that you

38
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,740
could use like outside in the real world. So our professor taught us stuff like how to order a

39
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,860
pinto at a bar or to ask how much something costs to the grocery store or ask like where the bus

40
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,980
station is and just like stuff like that. I would say overall that the courses aren't extremely

41
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:26,940
difficult. I feel like as long as you put effort in you participate and you listen then you're

42
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,340
going to pass with a high grade. And the third reason why I would recommend Salamanca is because

43
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,220
it's beautiful there. It has so many incredibly picturesque places. So many of the major sites

44
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,820
are really beautiful but there are also some I feel like lesser known hidden places that are

45
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,860
also equally as beautiful. Whenever I would go out and explore the city whether it was alone or

46
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,980
with my friends we just found these really beautiful places and a lot of them were free to go to and

47
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,780
just visit and living there for a time just really made me inspired and appreciative of the scenery

48
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,900
that I was able to see every day. And the fourth reason why I would recommend Salamanca to study

49
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,540
abroad in is because it's a student-friendly city. Because of the Universidad de Salamanca and other

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,620
universities in the city there's a lot of young people there. There's a lot of people studying

51
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,860
abroad as well. So you find a lot of young people. The city has a really young vibe. There's lots of

52
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,500
bars, cafes like just lots of places to hang out and where you see a lot of people just

53
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,740
hanging out together. And one thing you'll always hear about Salamanca from your advisors or

54
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,660
your professors is that the city is completely walkable and it is. Also the city is student

55
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,780
budget friendly. It's really cheap to go out for a pincho or a tapa or get a drink either in between

56
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,100
your classes or like during the afternoon when you want to hang out with some friends or grab a snack

57
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,860
or anything. Usually for like a small plate of food or like a pastry or something it's usually

58
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,060
less than five euros. And if you get a drink that's usually like three or four. In between my morning

59
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,620
classes I had a 30 minute break so I would always stop at the same cafe and get a fresh squeezed

60
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,900
orange juice. And a little pastry just for a little something before the rest of my classes

61
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,780
during the day. And it was always cheap too. And another good reason to study abroad in Salamanca

62
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:40,540
is because Salamanca is safe. I was constantly reassured by my professors and my ISA directors

63
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,500
that it's a very safe city especially for young people to be in. You always see people walking

64
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,940
out in the streets. The main areas are always well lit. Like you see a lot of people like

65
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,940
going out either to eat or like going out to the club or the bar. And like people are generally like

66
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,900
just friendly or if you like mind your own business then you know you're not bothered.

67
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,660
Whenever I went out to explore the city I was usually out during the daytime or I was with a

68
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:18,380
group of friends and if I went out at night then I wasn't alone. And there are taxis that are always

69
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,300
available to take you home if you feel like you need it. And in my experience I never had any

70
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,700
encounters where I felt unsafe. But with that being said it's always a smart idea to be aware

71
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:35,020
of your surroundings. To be with your friends or other people when you can. Trust your gut feeling

72
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,340
if something doesn't feel right. And if you can just have a backup plan so just in case you're

73
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,740
in a situation you don't want to be in then you're taken care of.

74
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:57,340
Salamanca has lots of activities, things to do and events that are usually really inexpensive

75
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,980
or they are free. When I was there there were a couple of different events that were being held

76
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:10,940
like the fiste of San Juan de Sao, which is Salamanca's patron saint. And they have a fireworks

77
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,900
show that's over the Rio Tormes, the Tormes River. Yeah just a really special occasion to go out and

78
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,980
celebrate something local. And another really cool exhibition was the Festival de Luz y Van

79
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:32,620
Guadalhas, which was an art festival featuring lights, projections, and installations that were

80
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,060
exhibited on some of Salamanca's most famous buildings. It was just really cool. There are

81
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:45,500
plenty of places to sightsee. There's lots of historical buildings, museums, cultural places,

82
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,860
places of religious significance, and lots of places to learn about Salamanca's history and

83
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,860
culture. I will leave a link in the description below to my blog post that has a list of recommendations

84
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:07,260
for free things to do, things to go see that you can go to for like a small fee. And these places

85
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,500
usually have student discounts so that's even cheaper. Yeah just a list of recommendations

86
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,140
I would suggest to people going to go visit. And the last reason I would recommend Salamanca as

87
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,220
your study abroad destination is because it's a great place to make friends and meet new people.

88
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:33,420
The city has a very young vibe and there are lots of events and activities and opportunities to

89
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,980
meet new people and to find others to share your study abroad experience with. If you're going

90
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,500
with a study abroad program like ISA, then you already have a group of people that you can

91
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,300
connect with even before you get to the city. Obviously you'll meet people through your classes,

92
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,940
there are organized events that the university will hold or your study abroad program will hold

93
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,900
to either meet with locals or just like cultural classes that you can take together. And I think

94
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,500
like experiences like these are really important to just put yourself out there and to like

95
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,900
just participate in because it'll make your experience that much more enjoyable and language

96
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,860
exchange programs are fantastic because you get the opportunity to practice speaking Spanish

97
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,300
usually with locals. You can meet people that are from the city or from Spain or from like

98
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,340
even like different places around the world and just practice speaking your Spanish together.

99
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,020
And you'll also get to know each other and make friends and that's also a good thing too.

100
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,820
And most of the people I met usually is just really nice and just fun to be around and always

101
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,260
up for an adventure or chilling or just spending some time together. And those are my top reasons

102
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,660
why I would recommend Salamanca Spain as your study abroad destination. Let me know in the
