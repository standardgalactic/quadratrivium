1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so how did you discover the spherical standing wave structure?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I was curious. In 1955, I took a course in quantum mechanics.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And this was a graduate course.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I had never had a course, any course, in quantum mechanics.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I assumed I was very stupid.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I never understood the origin of de Broglie waves,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which says that a particle goes along like this,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and has a wave which is inversely proportional to its momentum.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Planck's constant divided by the mass times the velocity.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's what it called the de Broglie wavelength,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because de Broglie first proposed it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Of course, de Broglie didn't know where it came from, either.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Nobody ever knew.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I didn't know that they didn't know.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I thought you thought you were really stupid.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I just thought I was stupid. I never opened my mouth in a class.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thirty years later, I just kept thinking about that thing,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and it just bothered me all the time.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One day, I was reading a book called All About Waves by a professor at Harvard.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It suddenly occurred to me that there must be some kind of a complicated Doppler going on.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I wrote down a few equations.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I discovered that only, if you have a combination of an inward wave and an outward wave,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
do you get the de Broglie wavelengths.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You were talking about a combination of an inward wave and an outward wave of two different particles.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, yeah, two different particles.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So you're talking about an interaction of four waves.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's a particle here, a particle there.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One's moving relative to the other.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So there is a relative motion.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Therefore, if you write these equations out, you get that the de Broglie wavelength is there.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I was also amazed to discover that Einstein's increase of mass was there.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All the things which happened with relative velocity showed up.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I said to myself, this is so simple.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't think I'd discovered anything.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I must admit, when you tell me this, my life sort of gives a shiver down my spine.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh yeah.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Because what you're telling me is that you've united quantum theory with Einstein's special relativity.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In that one equation.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, I did.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's what you're telling me, isn't it?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But this seems so simple to me because these simple bits of algebra weren't all that complicated.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I says, yeah, yeah, this is a natural result.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sure somebody else has already found this because people investigated quantum theory and waves.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And people had been using it in outweighs for 30 years.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They always thought they were imaginary, though, not real.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I went back and I searched for six months.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And little by little, I realized nobody had ever found this.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I must be the only one.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But it took several months for me to realize that.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When I realized it, I said, gee, I really got something.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I kept on studying and investigating it.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And of course, the result is this book just tells all of that work.
