 The narrative you've described is associated with Richard E. Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, and his discovery of the spherical standing wave structure of the electron, which he made in 1955. Here's a summary of how he came to this realization:

1. **Background**: Feynman took a graduate course in quantum mechanics in 1955, despite not having prior exposure to the subject. He struggled with the concept of de Broglie waves, which represent particles as wave-like entities with a wavelength proportional to their momentum ( Planck's constant divided by the product of mass and velocity).

2. **Initial Confusion**: Feynman assumed he was not understanding the concepts correctly because he did not understand where the de Broglie wavelength came from. He felt stupid and did not contribute to discussions in class, thinking that everyone else understood it but him.

3. **Realization**: Years later, while reading a book on waves, Feynman had an epiphany. He realized that the de Broglie wavelength emerged from a combination of an inward wave (a wave moving towards the particle) and an outward wave (a wave moving away from the particle). This interaction, involving four waves due to the relative motion between two particles, led to the emergence of the de Broglie wavelength.

4. **Discovery**: Feynman discovered that his equations also accounted for Einstein's theory of mass increase due to relative velocity. He was surprised by how simple and elegant the solution was, especially since he had thought that someone else must have already made this connection.

5. **Verification and Publication**: After verifying that his discovery was novel and not previously recognized, Feynman worked on understanding the implications of this unification of quantum mechanics and special relativity for the electron's structure. His work led to the realization that electrons exhibit a spherical standing wave pattern, which is a fundamental aspect of their nature.

6. **Publication and Impact**: Feynman detailed his findings in a book, "The Feynman Lectures on Physics," where he explained the spherical standing wave structure of the electron and its implications for the understanding of quantum mechanics and special relativity.

Feynman's discovery was groundbreaking because it provided a new way to look at the electron, not as a point particle but as a wave that extends in space, with a well-defined wavelength that is consistent with both quantum mechanics and special relativity. This understanding has profound implications for the field of physics and continues to be relevant in modern theoretical and applied physics research.
