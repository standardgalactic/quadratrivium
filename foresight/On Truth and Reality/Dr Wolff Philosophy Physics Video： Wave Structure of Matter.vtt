00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay, so how did you discover the spherical standing wave structure?

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
I was curious. In 1955, I took a course in quantum mechanics.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
And this was a graduate course.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
And I had never had a course, any course, in quantum mechanics.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I assumed I was very stupid.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
I never understood the origin of de Broglie waves,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
which says that a particle goes along like this,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
and has a wave which is inversely proportional to its momentum.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Planck's constant divided by the mass times the velocity.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
That's what it called the de Broglie wavelength,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
because de Broglie first proposed it.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Of course, de Broglie didn't know where it came from, either.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Nobody ever knew.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
But I didn't know that they didn't know.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I thought you thought you were really stupid.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
I just thought I was stupid. I never opened my mouth in a class.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Thirty years later, I just kept thinking about that thing,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
and it just bothered me all the time.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
One day, I was reading a book called All About Waves by a professor at Harvard.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
It suddenly occurred to me that there must be some kind of a complicated Doppler going on.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I wrote down a few equations.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I discovered that only, if you have a combination of an inward wave and an outward wave,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
do you get the de Broglie wavelengths.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
You were talking about a combination of an inward wave and an outward wave of two different particles.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, yeah, two different particles.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
So you're talking about an interaction of four waves.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
There's a particle here, a particle there.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
One's moving relative to the other.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
So there is a relative motion.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Therefore, if you write these equations out, you get that the de Broglie wavelength is there.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
And I was also amazed to discover that Einstein's increase of mass was there.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
All the things which happened with relative velocity showed up.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And I said to myself, this is so simple.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I didn't think I'd discovered anything.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I must admit, when you tell me this, my life sort of gives a shiver down my spine.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh yeah.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Because what you're telling me is that you've united quantum theory with Einstein's special relativity.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
In that one equation.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, I did.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
That's what you're telling me, isn't it?

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
But this seems so simple to me because these simple bits of algebra weren't all that complicated.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
So I says, yeah, yeah, this is a natural result.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm sure somebody else has already found this because people investigated quantum theory and waves.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
And people had been using it in outweighs for 30 years.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
They always thought they were imaginary, though, not real.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I went back and I searched for six months.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
And little by little, I realized nobody had ever found this.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I must be the only one.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
But it took several months for me to realize that.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
When I realized it, I said, gee, I really got something.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
So I kept on studying and investigating it.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
And of course, the result is this book just tells all of that work.
