0	5000	Okay, so how did you discover the spherical standing wave structure?
5000	11000	I was curious. In 1955, I took a course in quantum mechanics.
11000	13000	And this was a graduate course.
13000	18000	And I had never had a course, any course, in quantum mechanics.
18000	20000	I assumed I was very stupid.
20000	24000	I never understood the origin of de Broglie waves,
24000	27000	which says that a particle goes along like this,
27000	31000	and has a wave which is inversely proportional to its momentum.
31000	35000	Planck's constant divided by the mass times the velocity.
35000	37000	That's what it called the de Broglie wavelength,
37000	39000	because de Broglie first proposed it.
39000	42000	Of course, de Broglie didn't know where it came from, either.
42000	43000	Nobody ever knew.
43000	45000	But I didn't know that they didn't know.
45000	47000	I thought you thought you were really stupid.
47000	50000	I just thought I was stupid. I never opened my mouth in a class.
50000	54000	Thirty years later, I just kept thinking about that thing,
54000	56000	and it just bothered me all the time.
56000	61000	One day, I was reading a book called All About Waves by a professor at Harvard.
61000	66000	It suddenly occurred to me that there must be some kind of a complicated Doppler going on.
66000	68000	I wrote down a few equations.
68000	74000	I discovered that only, if you have a combination of an inward wave and an outward wave,
74000	76000	do you get the de Broglie wavelengths.
76000	81000	You were talking about a combination of an inward wave and an outward wave of two different particles.
81000	82000	Yeah, yeah, two different particles.
82000	85000	So you're talking about an interaction of four waves.
85000	87000	There's a particle here, a particle there.
87000	88000	One's moving relative to the other.
88000	90000	So there is a relative motion.
90000	96000	Therefore, if you write these equations out, you get that the de Broglie wavelength is there.
96000	102000	And I was also amazed to discover that Einstein's increase of mass was there.
102000	107000	All the things which happened with relative velocity showed up.
107000	110000	And I said to myself, this is so simple.
110000	112000	I didn't think I'd discovered anything.
112000	115000	I must admit, when you tell me this, my life sort of gives a shiver down my spine.
115000	116000	Oh yeah.
116000	121000	Because what you're telling me is that you've united quantum theory with Einstein's special relativity.
121000	122000	Yeah.
122000	123000	In that one equation.
123000	124000	Yeah, I did.
124000	125000	That's what you're telling me, isn't it?
125000	132000	But this seems so simple to me because these simple bits of algebra weren't all that complicated.
132000	134000	So I says, yeah, yeah, this is a natural result.
134000	140000	I'm sure somebody else has already found this because people investigated quantum theory and waves.
140000	143000	And people had been using it in outweighs for 30 years.
143000	146000	They always thought they were imaginary, though, not real.
146000	149000	I went back and I searched for six months.
149000	154000	And little by little, I realized nobody had ever found this.
154000	156000	I must be the only one.
156000	159000	But it took several months for me to realize that.
159000	163000	When I realized it, I said, gee, I really got something.
163000	166000	So I kept on studying and investigating it.
166000	173000	And of course, the result is this book just tells all of that work.
