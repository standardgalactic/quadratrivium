0	5400	You're on a hike, trying to figure out how far away you are from your destination.
5400	11120	You pull out a map whose bar scale tells you that 1 inch equals half a mile, and, measuring
11120	16240	2 inches between your current location and your destination, you conclude that you're
16240	19520	1 mile out.
19520	24720	Basic math, sure, but whether you realize it or not, you've just utilized a form of
24720	30760	the metric tensor, one of the most revolutionary revisions to our modern geometry.
30760	36600	But what is this idea exactly, and how has it come to play such a crucial role in the
36600	40000	theory of general relativity?
40000	54600	This is Dialect, and today, we're demystifying the metric tensor.
54600	59920	The equations of general relativity tell us that matter and energy alter the metric
59920	66600	of spacetime, resulting in a four-dimensional curvature that's synonymous with gravity.
66600	72080	The key to understanding general relativity, then, is locked away somewhere in this notion
72080	78240	of a metric, which at every point across space and time is characterized by 10 numbers in
78240	82920	the form of a mathematical object called a tensor.
82920	87040	But how can we get a deeper intuition about this abstract idea?
87040	93800	Well, let's start by taking an approach to cartography.
93800	99040	This is a military-grade topographical map of Fort Rucker in Alabama.
99040	104720	The lines and grids covering it are a coordinate system that allows for the precise distinguishing
104720	109880	and pinpointing of different locations across the map.
110840	116560	Now, the map's bar scale will tell us how to convert from the distances on the map to
116560	119680	actual distances on the Earth.
119680	125320	For instance, two centimeters on the map corresponds to one kilometer on the ground.
125320	129920	The bar scale is thus the map's metric, or the mathematical object which functions to
129920	136080	convert the map's coordinate intervals to real distances on the ground.
136080	142440	The value or component of this metric is simply the ratio given by the bar scale.
142440	148480	In this case, that ratio is 1 to 50,000, since one centimeter on the map corresponds to
148480	152000	50,000 actual centimeters.
152000	158400	Now, viewed as a whole, that's all a metric really is, a bar scale.
158400	164000	It's when we want to be more precise that the need for a tensor arises.
164000	169200	On our map, for instance, it's not actually true that everywhere two centimeters will
169200	171280	equal one kilometer.
171280	177000	This will only be the case wherever the topography of the terrain is relatively flat.
177000	182920	Otherwise, if it's hilly or mountainous, then all sorts of extra distances are going
182920	188120	to be thrown in depending on how high the elevation and how steep the grade of the local
188120	190760	topography is.
190760	196000	If we're near a cliff or a steep mountain, for instance, traversing one kilometer of
196000	202280	horizontal distance requires climbing a good deal of vertical distance as well.
202280	208120	Thus, in certain locations on our map, two centimeters will actually correspond to a
208120	212600	distance greater than one kilometer.
212600	219360	What this means is that the value of the metric is actually going to change in certain locations.
219360	225240	Being nearly one in 50,000 in locations that are relatively flat, but being one in more
225240	231440	than 50,000 wherever terrain exhibits significant curvature.
231440	237000	Most topographical maps encode such varying metrics via the use of contour lines.
237000	242160	On our Fort Rucker map, for instance, crossing from one contour line to the next indicates
242160	245000	an elevation change of 10 meters.
245440	250000	Thus, for a given path on the map, to find the total distance covered on the ground,
250000	255000	you have to not only convert the coordinate distance of the path into real-world horizontal
255000	261320	distance, but you also have to count the number of contour lines crossed by the path to determine
261320	265680	that path's change in vertical distance.
265680	272920	You can then estimate the path's total distance via a simple Pythagorean relation.
272920	277880	The ratio of the original coordinate distance to this final distance is what yields the
277880	282960	true value of the metric over the path traveled.
282960	287600	Of course, to make this metric as accurate as possible, you have to keep making the path
287600	293840	size smaller and smaller so that variances in local topography are accounted for.
293840	299040	Essentially, you can cut the map into very small pieces and then assign a metric value
299040	301600	to each piece.
301600	306880	This is like giving each little tiny patch on the map its own different bar scale.
306880	313680	Then, as we travel across different patches on the map, we can sum over those bar scales
313680	318880	to determine how the actual distance on the ground changes with respect to any specified
318880	321920	change in coordinates.
321920	326840	The usefulness of this is, of course, that one can determine one's real-world distance
326840	336200	traveled simply by knowing the coordinate path traveled on the map.
336200	340560	So now we have a better understanding of what the metric does.
340560	343200	Assigns a bar scale to each piece of the map.
343200	347440	But where do all these extra numbers of the tensor come from?
347440	353120	Well, maybe you noticed that our Fort Rucker map required two components at each point
353120	355160	to define its metric.
355160	361840	One for the horizontal distance conversion and one for the vertical distance conversion.
361840	368240	So for a two-dimensional surface or manifold, it might seem like you need two numbers to
368240	372280	characterize your metric.
372280	377080	But a map like Fort Rucker actually takes advantage of certain symmetries in order
377080	382560	to reduce the number of components needed to describe its metric.
382560	388280	After making a map of the Earth, if, like our Fort Rucker map, you approach it from
388280	395200	a sort of top-down projection, you'll end up with a map that looks like this.
395200	399720	Notice that the lines of latitude here play the same role as the contour lines did in
399720	402160	our Fort Rucker map.
402160	407960	The closer they are together, the steeper the topography is relative to our projection.
408360	413560	Thus, the value of our metric grows smaller and smaller the closer we get towards the
413560	419240	equator, because more and more real-world distance is traversed by the same amount of
419240	422160	coordinate distance.
422160	429680	Consequently, the shape of land masses near the equator gets squashed and distorted.
429680	436600	Now, because this map has a unique radial symmetry, you'd actually only need to specify
436600	442960	one number or parameter to characterize the metric at any point.
442960	447720	But if we want a map of the entire Earth, this obviously won't suffice.
447720	452680	Instead, we would need a projection more like this.
452680	457720	This Robinson projection is different from the other maps we've been looking at so far.
457720	459560	Why?
459560	465600	Because not only does it distort distances, making land masses like Greenland or Antarctica,
465600	470440	which are further away from the equator, appear larger than they actually are, but it also
470440	472480	distorts angles.
472480	477840	Notice, for instance, that along this line of latitude near the North Pole, the lines
477840	482520	of longitude all intersect it at different angles.
482520	488920	Yet, if you looked at the same lines on a globe, you would see that they all intersect
488920	492440	at right angles, or 90 degrees.
493280	497960	Thus, at each of these points on the map, if you wanted to give the value of the real
497960	503200	angle between the coordinate lines, you would need a sort of angle metric to convey the
503200	506440	amount of coordinate skew.
506440	511560	This gives us an idea of what our third and final component of the metric must do.
511560	520600	Somehow, it must indicate to us how our angles change across different points of the map.
520600	524880	But to be precise, and really figure out how each of these metric components relates
524880	529520	to the other, we need to look at the process that actually goes into making these types
529520	531520	of maps.
531520	537440	That is, let's ask, how do we take a curved surface like that of a globe and make it into
537440	541160	a flat surface like that of a map?
541160	545960	Well, the method is pretty simple, and it works like this.
545960	550720	We take the sphere or curved surface that we are trying to depict, and start by dividing
550720	556440	it into many small pieces that are most nearly flat.
556440	562400	Then we surgically cut all those pieces apart and put them back together on a flat surface,
562400	565560	like pieces of a puzzle.
565560	569840	At this point, however, the puzzle pieces won't fit together all that well, and there
569840	572520	will be many gaps and holes.
572520	577320	To get rid of those gaps, we perform a simple operation upon each of the pieces.
577320	582280	We stretch and or skew the piece until it fits into place.
582280	587480	Then we can assemble our map into a contiguous hole.
587480	595200	Now, the operations of stretching and skewing are pretty easy to describe mathematically.
595200	599120	Stretching merely assigns a new scale to your coordinate intervals.
599120	604600	Stretching, meanwhile, turns coordinate squares into coordinate parallelograms, and consequently
604600	610320	write triangles into obtuse or acute triangles.
610320	615560	So your distance element goes from being the hypotenuse of a right triangle to being one
615560	620080	of the sides in an obtuse or an acute triangle.
620080	625160	And if you remember the extension of the Pythagorean theorem from basic geometry, you'll know that
625160	631680	you need exactly three numbers to calculate the length of the side of a non-right triangle.
631680	636880	You need the length of the first side, the length of the second side, and the cosine
636880	639800	of the angle between them.
639800	646560	And voila, this is where your three values of the metric come from.
646560	652360	So for each tiny region of our map, we need one number, or bar scale, to tell us how much
652480	655920	our x-axis has been stretched or shrunk.
655920	660800	One number, or bar scale, to tell us how much our y-axis has been stretched or shrunk,
660800	669440	and one number to tell us how much the angle between the axes has been skewed.
669440	674520	The tinier we make these regions, the more accurate our metric will become, and the better
674520	678400	we can describe our curved surface.
678400	683520	The list of these three numbers put together is called the metric tensor, and it is easily
683520	689760	generalized to higher dimensions by adding one more bar scale for each new dimension,
689760	697480	plus one new cosine angle value for every pairing of dimensions that can be skewed.
697480	703000	Geometrically, we can interpret the number of metric components as being the number of
703000	709240	sides and angles you'd need to specify in order to determine the length of the diagonal
709240	713600	of an nth dimensional parallelogram.
713600	717840	So in two dimensions, you'll need three numbers at each point on your map to characterize
717840	720040	the metric.
720040	724800	While in three dimensions, you'll need six numbers.
724800	729840	And for four dimensions, like that of general relativity's space time, you'll need four
729840	738640	lengths and six angles, or ten numbers total, to fully characterize the metric at any point.
738640	743400	Together these numbers give us that final desired value, the value of the bar scale
743400	748360	we need for each patch of our map.
748360	754240	And as we stated at the beginning of our video, that's all the metric tensor really is, just
754240	758440	a fancy bar scale.
758440	763280	An important note to make here is that the framework of the metric tensor treats coordinate
763280	771960	systems and the surfaces or manifolds that they describe as fundamentally distinct entities.
771960	775960	And although so far we've been dealing with metrics that go between different coordinate
775960	781520	systems on different manifolds, you can also have metrics which describe different coordinate
781520	785280	systems on the same manifold.
785280	790160	An example of this would be going between Cartesian and polar coordinates on a flat
790160	791720	manifold.
791720	797240	Because your initially Cartesian surface, once cut into many small pieces and then stretched,
797240	803280	skewed, and rearranged according to a polar coordinate ordering, still retains its original
803280	805840	flatness.
805840	810280	This separation between coordinate systems and manifolds can be an intuitively difficult
810280	812600	pill to swallow.
812600	817160	But it's a crucial idea which ultimately leads to the more sophisticated concept of
817160	820520	curvature.
820520	825240	For the moment however, the main takeaway here is that the metric tensor becomes involved
825240	831720	whenever you're using some type of map, meaning the representation of one surface by that
831720	834400	of another.
834400	840080	The trick to understanding general relativity then is to realize that not all maps are two
840080	844440	dimensional pieces of paper you can hold in your hand.
844440	850320	So if you're planning on taking a hike through, say, a black hole, you're going to need something
850320	853200	of a four dimensional map.
853200	856120	But more on that in future videos.
856120	858680	This has been Dialect, thanks for watching.
