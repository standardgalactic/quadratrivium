1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
You're on a hike, trying to figure out how far away you are from your destination.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,120
You pull out a map whose bar scale tells you that 1 inch equals half a mile, and, measuring

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,240
2 inches between your current location and your destination, you conclude that you're

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,520
1 mile out.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,720
Basic math, sure, but whether you realize it or not, you've just utilized a form of

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,760
the metric tensor, one of the most revolutionary revisions to our modern geometry.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,600
But what is this idea exactly, and how has it come to play such a crucial role in the

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,000
theory of general relativity?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:54,600
This is Dialect, and today, we're demystifying the metric tensor.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,920
The equations of general relativity tell us that matter and energy alter the metric

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,600
of spacetime, resulting in a four-dimensional curvature that's synonymous with gravity.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,080
The key to understanding general relativity, then, is locked away somewhere in this notion

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,240
of a metric, which at every point across space and time is characterized by 10 numbers in

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,920
the form of a mathematical object called a tensor.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,040
But how can we get a deeper intuition about this abstract idea?

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,800
Well, let's start by taking an approach to cartography.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,040
This is a military-grade topographical map of Fort Rucker in Alabama.

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,720
The lines and grids covering it are a coordinate system that allows for the precise distinguishing

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,880
and pinpointing of different locations across the map.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Now, the map's bar scale will tell us how to convert from the distances on the map to

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
actual distances on the Earth.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,320
For instance, two centimeters on the map corresponds to one kilometer on the ground.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,920
The bar scale is thus the map's metric, or the mathematical object which functions to

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,080
convert the map's coordinate intervals to real distances on the ground.

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,440
The value or component of this metric is simply the ratio given by the bar scale.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,480
In this case, that ratio is 1 to 50,000, since one centimeter on the map corresponds to

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,000
50,000 actual centimeters.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Now, viewed as a whole, that's all a metric really is, a bar scale.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,000
It's when we want to be more precise that the need for a tensor arises.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,200
On our map, for instance, it's not actually true that everywhere two centimeters will

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
equal one kilometer.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,000
This will only be the case wherever the topography of the terrain is relatively flat.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,920
Otherwise, if it's hilly or mountainous, then all sorts of extra distances are going

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,120
to be thrown in depending on how high the elevation and how steep the grade of the local

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,760
topography is.

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,000
If we're near a cliff or a steep mountain, for instance, traversing one kilometer of

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,280
horizontal distance requires climbing a good deal of vertical distance as well.

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Thus, in certain locations on our map, two centimeters will actually correspond to a

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,600
distance greater than one kilometer.

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,360
What this means is that the value of the metric is actually going to change in certain locations.

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,240
Being nearly one in 50,000 in locations that are relatively flat, but being one in more

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,440
than 50,000 wherever terrain exhibits significant curvature.

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,000
Most topographical maps encode such varying metrics via the use of contour lines.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,160
On our Fort Rucker map, for instance, crossing from one contour line to the next indicates

45
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,000
an elevation change of 10 meters.

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,000
Thus, for a given path on the map, to find the total distance covered on the ground,

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you have to not only convert the coordinate distance of the path into real-world horizontal

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,320
distance, but you also have to count the number of contour lines crossed by the path to determine

49
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,680
that path's change in vertical distance.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,920
You can then estimate the path's total distance via a simple Pythagorean relation.

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,880
The ratio of the original coordinate distance to this final distance is what yields the

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,960
true value of the metric over the path traveled.

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Of course, to make this metric as accurate as possible, you have to keep making the path

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,840
size smaller and smaller so that variances in local topography are accounted for.

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,040
Essentially, you can cut the map into very small pieces and then assign a metric value

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
to each piece.

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,880
This is like giving each little tiny patch on the map its own different bar scale.

58
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,680
Then, as we travel across different patches on the map, we can sum over those bar scales

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,880
to determine how the actual distance on the ground changes with respect to any specified

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,920
change in coordinates.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,840
The usefulness of this is, of course, that one can determine one's real-world distance

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:36,200
traveled simply by knowing the coordinate path traveled on the map.

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,560
So now we have a better understanding of what the metric does.

64
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,200
Assigns a bar scale to each piece of the map.

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,440
But where do all these extra numbers of the tensor come from?

66
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,120
Well, maybe you noticed that our Fort Rucker map required two components at each point

67
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,160
to define its metric.

68
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,840
One for the horizontal distance conversion and one for the vertical distance conversion.

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,240
So for a two-dimensional surface or manifold, it might seem like you need two numbers to

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,280
characterize your metric.

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,080
But a map like Fort Rucker actually takes advantage of certain symmetries in order

72
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,560
to reduce the number of components needed to describe its metric.

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,280
After making a map of the Earth, if, like our Fort Rucker map, you approach it from

74
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,200
a sort of top-down projection, you'll end up with a map that looks like this.

75
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,720
Notice that the lines of latitude here play the same role as the contour lines did in

76
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,160
our Fort Rucker map.

77
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,960
The closer they are together, the steeper the topography is relative to our projection.

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,560
Thus, the value of our metric grows smaller and smaller the closer we get towards the

79
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,240
equator, because more and more real-world distance is traversed by the same amount of

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,160
coordinate distance.

81
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,680
Consequently, the shape of land masses near the equator gets squashed and distorted.

82
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,600
Now, because this map has a unique radial symmetry, you'd actually only need to specify

83
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,960
one number or parameter to characterize the metric at any point.

84
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,720
But if we want a map of the entire Earth, this obviously won't suffice.

85
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,680
Instead, we would need a projection more like this.

86
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,720
This Robinson projection is different from the other maps we've been looking at so far.

87
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Why?

88
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,600
Because not only does it distort distances, making land masses like Greenland or Antarctica,

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,440
which are further away from the equator, appear larger than they actually are, but it also

90
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,480
distorts angles.

91
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,840
Notice, for instance, that along this line of latitude near the North Pole, the lines

92
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,520
of longitude all intersect it at different angles.

93
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,920
Yet, if you looked at the same lines on a globe, you would see that they all intersect

94
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,440
at right angles, or 90 degrees.

95
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,960
Thus, at each of these points on the map, if you wanted to give the value of the real

96
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,200
angle between the coordinate lines, you would need a sort of angle metric to convey the

97
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,440
amount of coordinate skew.

98
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,560
This gives us an idea of what our third and final component of the metric must do.

99
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:40,600
Somehow, it must indicate to us how our angles change across different points of the map.

100
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,880
But to be precise, and really figure out how each of these metric components relates

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,520
to the other, we need to look at the process that actually goes into making these types

102
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
of maps.

103
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,440
That is, let's ask, how do we take a curved surface like that of a globe and make it into

104
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,160
a flat surface like that of a map?

105
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,960
Well, the method is pretty simple, and it works like this.

106
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,720
We take the sphere or curved surface that we are trying to depict, and start by dividing

107
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,440
it into many small pieces that are most nearly flat.

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,400
Then we surgically cut all those pieces apart and put them back together on a flat surface,

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,560
like pieces of a puzzle.

110
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,840
At this point, however, the puzzle pieces won't fit together all that well, and there

111
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,520
will be many gaps and holes.

112
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,320
To get rid of those gaps, we perform a simple operation upon each of the pieces.

113
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,280
We stretch and or skew the piece until it fits into place.

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,480
Then we can assemble our map into a contiguous hole.

115
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Now, the operations of stretching and skewing are pretty easy to describe mathematically.

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,120
Stretching merely assigns a new scale to your coordinate intervals.

117
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Stretching, meanwhile, turns coordinate squares into coordinate parallelograms, and consequently

118
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,320
write triangles into obtuse or acute triangles.

119
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,560
So your distance element goes from being the hypotenuse of a right triangle to being one

120
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,080
of the sides in an obtuse or an acute triangle.

121
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,160
And if you remember the extension of the Pythagorean theorem from basic geometry, you'll know that

122
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,680
you need exactly three numbers to calculate the length of the side of a non-right triangle.

123
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,880
You need the length of the first side, the length of the second side, and the cosine

124
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,800
of the angle between them.

125
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,560
And voila, this is where your three values of the metric come from.

126
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,360
So for each tiny region of our map, we need one number, or bar scale, to tell us how much

127
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,920
our x-axis has been stretched or shrunk.

128
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,800
One number, or bar scale, to tell us how much our y-axis has been stretched or shrunk,

129
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:09,440
and one number to tell us how much the angle between the axes has been skewed.

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,520
The tinier we make these regions, the more accurate our metric will become, and the better

131
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,400
we can describe our curved surface.

132
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,520
The list of these three numbers put together is called the metric tensor, and it is easily

133
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,760
generalized to higher dimensions by adding one more bar scale for each new dimension,

134
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,480
plus one new cosine angle value for every pairing of dimensions that can be skewed.

135
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,000
Geometrically, we can interpret the number of metric components as being the number of

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,240
sides and angles you'd need to specify in order to determine the length of the diagonal

137
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,600
of an nth dimensional parallelogram.

138
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,840
So in two dimensions, you'll need three numbers at each point on your map to characterize

139
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,040
the metric.

140
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,800
While in three dimensions, you'll need six numbers.

141
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,840
And for four dimensions, like that of general relativity's space time, you'll need four

142
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:18,640
lengths and six angles, or ten numbers total, to fully characterize the metric at any point.

143
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,400
Together these numbers give us that final desired value, the value of the bar scale

144
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,360
we need for each patch of our map.

145
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,240
And as we stated at the beginning of our video, that's all the metric tensor really is, just

146
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,440
a fancy bar scale.

147
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,280
An important note to make here is that the framework of the metric tensor treats coordinate

148
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:51,960
systems and the surfaces or manifolds that they describe as fundamentally distinct entities.

149
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,960
And although so far we've been dealing with metrics that go between different coordinate

150
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,520
systems on different manifolds, you can also have metrics which describe different coordinate

151
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,280
systems on the same manifold.

152
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,160
An example of this would be going between Cartesian and polar coordinates on a flat

153
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,720
manifold.

154
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,240
Because your initially Cartesian surface, once cut into many small pieces and then stretched,

155
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,280
skewed, and rearranged according to a polar coordinate ordering, still retains its original

156
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,840
flatness.

157
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,280
This separation between coordinate systems and manifolds can be an intuitively difficult

158
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,600
pill to swallow.

159
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,160
But it's a crucial idea which ultimately leads to the more sophisticated concept of

160
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,520
curvature.

161
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,240
For the moment however, the main takeaway here is that the metric tensor becomes involved

162
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,720
whenever you're using some type of map, meaning the representation of one surface by that

163
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,400
of another.

164
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,080
The trick to understanding general relativity then is to realize that not all maps are two

165
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,440
dimensional pieces of paper you can hold in your hand.

166
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,320
So if you're planning on taking a hike through, say, a black hole, you're going to need something

167
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,200
of a four dimensional map.

168
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,120
But more on that in future videos.

169
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,680
