00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
You're on a hike, trying to figure out how far away you are from your destination.

00:05.400 --> 00:11.120
You pull out a map whose bar scale tells you that 1 inch equals half a mile, and, measuring

00:11.120 --> 00:16.240
2 inches between your current location and your destination, you conclude that you're

00:16.240 --> 00:19.520
1 mile out.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.720
Basic math, sure, but whether you realize it or not, you've just utilized a form of

00:24.720 --> 00:30.760
the metric tensor, one of the most revolutionary revisions to our modern geometry.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.600
But what is this idea exactly, and how has it come to play such a crucial role in the

00:36.600 --> 00:40.000
theory of general relativity?

00:40.000 --> 00:54.600
This is Dialect, and today, we're demystifying the metric tensor.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.920
The equations of general relativity tell us that matter and energy alter the metric

00:59.920 --> 01:06.600
of spacetime, resulting in a four-dimensional curvature that's synonymous with gravity.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.080
The key to understanding general relativity, then, is locked away somewhere in this notion

01:12.080 --> 01:18.240
of a metric, which at every point across space and time is characterized by 10 numbers in

01:18.240 --> 01:22.920
the form of a mathematical object called a tensor.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.040
But how can we get a deeper intuition about this abstract idea?

01:27.040 --> 01:33.800
Well, let's start by taking an approach to cartography.

01:33.800 --> 01:39.040
This is a military-grade topographical map of Fort Rucker in Alabama.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.720
The lines and grids covering it are a coordinate system that allows for the precise distinguishing

01:44.720 --> 01:49.880
and pinpointing of different locations across the map.

01:50.840 --> 01:56.560
Now, the map's bar scale will tell us how to convert from the distances on the map to

01:56.560 --> 01:59.680
actual distances on the Earth.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.320
For instance, two centimeters on the map corresponds to one kilometer on the ground.

02:05.320 --> 02:09.920
The bar scale is thus the map's metric, or the mathematical object which functions to

02:09.920 --> 02:16.080
convert the map's coordinate intervals to real distances on the ground.

02:16.080 --> 02:22.440
The value or component of this metric is simply the ratio given by the bar scale.

02:22.440 --> 02:28.480
In this case, that ratio is 1 to 50,000, since one centimeter on the map corresponds to

02:28.480 --> 02:32.000
50,000 actual centimeters.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.400
Now, viewed as a whole, that's all a metric really is, a bar scale.

02:38.400 --> 02:44.000
It's when we want to be more precise that the need for a tensor arises.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.200
On our map, for instance, it's not actually true that everywhere two centimeters will

02:49.200 --> 02:51.280
equal one kilometer.

02:51.280 --> 02:57.000
This will only be the case wherever the topography of the terrain is relatively flat.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.920
Otherwise, if it's hilly or mountainous, then all sorts of extra distances are going

03:02.920 --> 03:08.120
to be thrown in depending on how high the elevation and how steep the grade of the local

03:08.120 --> 03:10.760
topography is.

03:10.760 --> 03:16.000
If we're near a cliff or a steep mountain, for instance, traversing one kilometer of

03:16.000 --> 03:22.280
horizontal distance requires climbing a good deal of vertical distance as well.

03:22.280 --> 03:28.120
Thus, in certain locations on our map, two centimeters will actually correspond to a

03:28.120 --> 03:32.600
distance greater than one kilometer.

03:32.600 --> 03:39.360
What this means is that the value of the metric is actually going to change in certain locations.

03:39.360 --> 03:45.240
Being nearly one in 50,000 in locations that are relatively flat, but being one in more

03:45.240 --> 03:51.440
than 50,000 wherever terrain exhibits significant curvature.

03:51.440 --> 03:57.000
Most topographical maps encode such varying metrics via the use of contour lines.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.160
On our Fort Rucker map, for instance, crossing from one contour line to the next indicates

04:02.160 --> 04:05.000
an elevation change of 10 meters.

04:05.440 --> 04:10.000
Thus, for a given path on the map, to find the total distance covered on the ground,

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
you have to not only convert the coordinate distance of the path into real-world horizontal

04:15.000 --> 04:21.320
distance, but you also have to count the number of contour lines crossed by the path to determine

04:21.320 --> 04:25.680
that path's change in vertical distance.

04:25.680 --> 04:32.920
You can then estimate the path's total distance via a simple Pythagorean relation.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.880
The ratio of the original coordinate distance to this final distance is what yields the

04:37.880 --> 04:42.960
true value of the metric over the path traveled.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.600
Of course, to make this metric as accurate as possible, you have to keep making the path

04:47.600 --> 04:53.840
size smaller and smaller so that variances in local topography are accounted for.

04:53.840 --> 04:59.040
Essentially, you can cut the map into very small pieces and then assign a metric value

04:59.040 --> 05:01.600
to each piece.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.880
This is like giving each little tiny patch on the map its own different bar scale.

05:06.880 --> 05:13.680
Then, as we travel across different patches on the map, we can sum over those bar scales

05:13.680 --> 05:18.880
to determine how the actual distance on the ground changes with respect to any specified

05:18.880 --> 05:21.920
change in coordinates.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.840
The usefulness of this is, of course, that one can determine one's real-world distance

05:26.840 --> 05:36.200
traveled simply by knowing the coordinate path traveled on the map.

05:36.200 --> 05:40.560
So now we have a better understanding of what the metric does.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.200
Assigns a bar scale to each piece of the map.

05:43.200 --> 05:47.440
But where do all these extra numbers of the tensor come from?

05:47.440 --> 05:53.120
Well, maybe you noticed that our Fort Rucker map required two components at each point

05:53.120 --> 05:55.160
to define its metric.

05:55.160 --> 06:01.840
One for the horizontal distance conversion and one for the vertical distance conversion.

06:01.840 --> 06:08.240
So for a two-dimensional surface or manifold, it might seem like you need two numbers to

06:08.240 --> 06:12.280
characterize your metric.

06:12.280 --> 06:17.080
But a map like Fort Rucker actually takes advantage of certain symmetries in order

06:17.080 --> 06:22.560
to reduce the number of components needed to describe its metric.

06:22.560 --> 06:28.280
After making a map of the Earth, if, like our Fort Rucker map, you approach it from

06:28.280 --> 06:35.200
a sort of top-down projection, you'll end up with a map that looks like this.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.720
Notice that the lines of latitude here play the same role as the contour lines did in

06:39.720 --> 06:42.160
our Fort Rucker map.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.960
The closer they are together, the steeper the topography is relative to our projection.

06:48.360 --> 06:53.560
Thus, the value of our metric grows smaller and smaller the closer we get towards the

06:53.560 --> 06:59.240
equator, because more and more real-world distance is traversed by the same amount of

06:59.240 --> 07:02.160
coordinate distance.

07:02.160 --> 07:09.680
Consequently, the shape of land masses near the equator gets squashed and distorted.

07:09.680 --> 07:16.600
Now, because this map has a unique radial symmetry, you'd actually only need to specify

07:16.600 --> 07:22.960
one number or parameter to characterize the metric at any point.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.720
But if we want a map of the entire Earth, this obviously won't suffice.

07:27.720 --> 07:32.680
Instead, we would need a projection more like this.

07:32.680 --> 07:37.720
This Robinson projection is different from the other maps we've been looking at so far.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.560
Why?

07:39.560 --> 07:45.600
Because not only does it distort distances, making land masses like Greenland or Antarctica,

07:45.600 --> 07:50.440
which are further away from the equator, appear larger than they actually are, but it also

07:50.440 --> 07:52.480
distorts angles.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.840
Notice, for instance, that along this line of latitude near the North Pole, the lines

07:57.840 --> 08:02.520
of longitude all intersect it at different angles.

08:02.520 --> 08:08.920
Yet, if you looked at the same lines on a globe, you would see that they all intersect

08:08.920 --> 08:12.440
at right angles, or 90 degrees.

08:13.280 --> 08:17.960
Thus, at each of these points on the map, if you wanted to give the value of the real

08:17.960 --> 08:23.200
angle between the coordinate lines, you would need a sort of angle metric to convey the

08:23.200 --> 08:26.440
amount of coordinate skew.

08:26.440 --> 08:31.560
This gives us an idea of what our third and final component of the metric must do.

08:31.560 --> 08:40.600
Somehow, it must indicate to us how our angles change across different points of the map.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.880
But to be precise, and really figure out how each of these metric components relates

08:44.880 --> 08:49.520
to the other, we need to look at the process that actually goes into making these types

08:49.520 --> 08:51.520
of maps.

08:51.520 --> 08:57.440
That is, let's ask, how do we take a curved surface like that of a globe and make it into

08:57.440 --> 09:01.160
a flat surface like that of a map?

09:01.160 --> 09:05.960
Well, the method is pretty simple, and it works like this.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.720
We take the sphere or curved surface that we are trying to depict, and start by dividing

09:10.720 --> 09:16.440
it into many small pieces that are most nearly flat.

09:16.440 --> 09:22.400
Then we surgically cut all those pieces apart and put them back together on a flat surface,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.560
like pieces of a puzzle.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.840
At this point, however, the puzzle pieces won't fit together all that well, and there

09:29.840 --> 09:32.520
will be many gaps and holes.

09:32.520 --> 09:37.320
To get rid of those gaps, we perform a simple operation upon each of the pieces.

09:37.320 --> 09:42.280
We stretch and or skew the piece until it fits into place.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.480
Then we can assemble our map into a contiguous hole.

09:47.480 --> 09:55.200
Now, the operations of stretching and skewing are pretty easy to describe mathematically.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.120
Stretching merely assigns a new scale to your coordinate intervals.

09:59.120 --> 10:04.600
Stretching, meanwhile, turns coordinate squares into coordinate parallelograms, and consequently

10:04.600 --> 10:10.320
write triangles into obtuse or acute triangles.

10:10.320 --> 10:15.560
So your distance element goes from being the hypotenuse of a right triangle to being one

10:15.560 --> 10:20.080
of the sides in an obtuse or an acute triangle.

10:20.080 --> 10:25.160
And if you remember the extension of the Pythagorean theorem from basic geometry, you'll know that

10:25.160 --> 10:31.680
you need exactly three numbers to calculate the length of the side of a non-right triangle.

10:31.680 --> 10:36.880
You need the length of the first side, the length of the second side, and the cosine

10:36.880 --> 10:39.800
of the angle between them.

10:39.800 --> 10:46.560
And voila, this is where your three values of the metric come from.

10:46.560 --> 10:52.360
So for each tiny region of our map, we need one number, or bar scale, to tell us how much

10:52.480 --> 10:55.920
our x-axis has been stretched or shrunk.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.800
One number, or bar scale, to tell us how much our y-axis has been stretched or shrunk,

11:00.800 --> 11:09.440
and one number to tell us how much the angle between the axes has been skewed.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.520
The tinier we make these regions, the more accurate our metric will become, and the better

11:14.520 --> 11:18.400
we can describe our curved surface.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.520
The list of these three numbers put together is called the metric tensor, and it is easily

11:23.520 --> 11:29.760
generalized to higher dimensions by adding one more bar scale for each new dimension,

11:29.760 --> 11:37.480
plus one new cosine angle value for every pairing of dimensions that can be skewed.

11:37.480 --> 11:43.000
Geometrically, we can interpret the number of metric components as being the number of

11:43.000 --> 11:49.240
sides and angles you'd need to specify in order to determine the length of the diagonal

11:49.240 --> 11:53.600
of an nth dimensional parallelogram.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.840
So in two dimensions, you'll need three numbers at each point on your map to characterize

11:57.840 --> 12:00.040
the metric.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.800
While in three dimensions, you'll need six numbers.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.840
And for four dimensions, like that of general relativity's space time, you'll need four

12:09.840 --> 12:18.640
lengths and six angles, or ten numbers total, to fully characterize the metric at any point.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.400
Together these numbers give us that final desired value, the value of the bar scale

12:23.400 --> 12:28.360
we need for each patch of our map.

12:28.360 --> 12:34.240
And as we stated at the beginning of our video, that's all the metric tensor really is, just

12:34.240 --> 12:38.440
a fancy bar scale.

12:38.440 --> 12:43.280
An important note to make here is that the framework of the metric tensor treats coordinate

12:43.280 --> 12:51.960
systems and the surfaces or manifolds that they describe as fundamentally distinct entities.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.960
And although so far we've been dealing with metrics that go between different coordinate

12:55.960 --> 13:01.520
systems on different manifolds, you can also have metrics which describe different coordinate

13:01.520 --> 13:05.280
systems on the same manifold.

13:05.280 --> 13:10.160
An example of this would be going between Cartesian and polar coordinates on a flat

13:10.160 --> 13:11.720
manifold.

13:11.720 --> 13:17.240
Because your initially Cartesian surface, once cut into many small pieces and then stretched,

13:17.240 --> 13:23.280
skewed, and rearranged according to a polar coordinate ordering, still retains its original

13:23.280 --> 13:25.840
flatness.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.280
This separation between coordinate systems and manifolds can be an intuitively difficult

13:30.280 --> 13:32.600
pill to swallow.

13:32.600 --> 13:37.160
But it's a crucial idea which ultimately leads to the more sophisticated concept of

13:37.160 --> 13:40.520
curvature.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.240
For the moment however, the main takeaway here is that the metric tensor becomes involved

13:45.240 --> 13:51.720
whenever you're using some type of map, meaning the representation of one surface by that

13:51.720 --> 13:54.400
of another.

13:54.400 --> 14:00.080
The trick to understanding general relativity then is to realize that not all maps are two

14:00.080 --> 14:04.440
dimensional pieces of paper you can hold in your hand.

14:04.440 --> 14:10.320
So if you're planning on taking a hike through, say, a black hole, you're going to need something

14:10.320 --> 14:13.200
of a four dimensional map.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.120
But more on that in future videos.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.680
This has been Dialect, thanks for watching.
