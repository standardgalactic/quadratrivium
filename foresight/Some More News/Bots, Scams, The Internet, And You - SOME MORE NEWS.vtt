WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
What is up Wombos, it's hi, it's Wombo, just set up my new highest def web page camera

00:08.880 --> 00:11.640
and we're going to have a great day watching Wombo.

00:11.640 --> 00:18.920
Be sure to check out WombosX's twitter.x at X's www.twitter.therealwombo, it's all

00:18.920 --> 00:31.120
a word and um Wombo's new twitch account at uh it's www and then www.twitch.t and v and

00:31.120 --> 00:39.640
then slash um Wombo, it's um hi it's Wombo, anyway Wombo is going to play games and watch

00:39.640 --> 00:44.960
things and stuff with you, there's a new some more Mr. Cody out today and since Wombo is

00:44.960 --> 00:51.200
mad at Mr. Cody, Wombo thought we should watch it and make fun of Mr. Cody for being stinky

00:51.200 --> 00:58.000
so let's just click on it.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.800
On Wombo's new gaming laptop, there's Wombo Bot on Wombo's new phone, you can buy things

01:02.800 --> 01:07.640
on your phone actually, if you check out Wombo's twitch, Wombo has a tutorial on how to buy

01:07.640 --> 01:14.000
things on your phone, anyway we've clicked on Mr. Stinky Cody's new video, so let's

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
watch that.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.720
Greetings Choombas, time to chip into some more news with a Z because it's future times

01:20.720 --> 01:28.800
and we have robots now, no really actual robots, some better than others, anyway here's some

01:28.800 --> 01:33.960
news we don't actually get those robots yet, probably not until the army gets bored doing

01:33.960 --> 01:43.600
wars with them, but until then we do get bots, countless, countless just too many bots AI

01:43.600 --> 01:51.760
to be exact, good AI, not really, evil AI, no wouldn't say that either, I mean Hal had

01:51.760 --> 01:58.440
to be like functional in order to kill everybody, what we have is more like that last 10 seconds

01:58.440 --> 02:03.680
of Hal's life where he slowly loses his mind and just sings a song nobody wanted to hear

02:03.680 --> 02:09.240
and this is all to say that social media sure seems to be patched to the gills with scams,

02:09.240 --> 02:16.320
bots and mediocre AI art, AI recipes and movie trivia, aggregated reddit posts set to Minecraft

02:16.320 --> 02:22.320
parkour, deep fried videos of long dead cats, those countless if only there was a page that

02:22.320 --> 02:29.160
posted blank accounts, robots describing scenes from movies for some reason like as if they're

02:29.160 --> 02:35.040
just things that happened in life, we've discussed how the internet is basically just a handful

02:35.040 --> 02:41.480
of social media sites now and so it's a little concerning that these sites have been slowly

02:41.480 --> 02:47.760
flooded with a bunch of bots and scams and clickbaity accounts, not just on Twitter,

02:47.760 --> 02:54.400
but yes very much on Twitter, but also Instagram and TikTok and I haven't really checked Facebook

02:54.400 --> 03:01.600
in a while but I assume there too and this seems by design and while that sucks for most

03:01.640 --> 03:07.600
people, at least we can rest easy knowing that we are in the golden years for scammy online

03:07.600 --> 03:10.920
freaks and the sometimes billionaire dupes who love them.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.840
Huzzah!

03:12.840 --> 03:21.320
The Growing Internet Scam Economy

03:21.320 --> 03:27.720
So obviously the flim flam profession is a proud and ancient tradition dating to the dawn of

03:27.720 --> 03:32.800
civilization, one of the oldest complaints to the manager was a clay tablet from the 18th

03:32.800 --> 03:38.640
century BC written by a buyer claiming he was scammed, skipped to the early internet and we

03:38.640 --> 03:44.720
had phishing emails that Nigerian Prince scam, boner pills, most of those pills being ineffective,

03:44.720 --> 03:50.440
now we've got AI and complex bot networks and crypto and maybe even little pick pocket

03:50.440 --> 03:56.160
drones, you could give them a boo hats, oh that would be adorable for a while, but while the

03:56.160 --> 04:01.840
tools are advanced the scammy methods are basically the same, also for all you semantics

04:01.840 --> 04:08.160
perverts jerking your words in the way back I'm going to be using the term scam very loosely

04:08.160 --> 04:13.280
when talking about this because I think one of the unique things about the internet is that it

04:13.280 --> 04:18.960
more easily blurs the line between engagement bait, random bots and people straight up trying to

04:18.960 --> 04:25.680
steal your money, not all scams are created equal but they all work on the same fundamental level

04:25.680 --> 04:30.800
in that they are all trying to get your attention using tactics that are either dishonest or

04:30.800 --> 04:36.880
manipulative, for example have you ever been scrolling through Instagram or TikTok when a

04:36.880 --> 04:43.360
video of an absolute mega Karen pops up, you know some lady who is acting in an unbelievably

04:43.360 --> 04:45.360
entitled and enraging way?

05:13.360 --> 05:21.440
Wow, what a freak, absolutely wild that a human being would actually act like that,

05:21.440 --> 05:26.400
it's almost too weird to be true, you can't make this stuff up, oh wait yeah I guess you can,

05:26.400 --> 05:32.000
they literally posted set photos like they were teasing the next Marvel film, see there are of

05:32.000 --> 05:39.040
course plenty of videos of real assholes on social media, which is exactly why these staged videos

05:39.040 --> 05:44.800
are able to thrive, in fact there's an entire fake Karen economy on the internet that makes

05:44.800 --> 05:51.760
real money doing this thanks to how engagement is rewarded, I'd argue a lot of them are obvious,

05:51.760 --> 05:57.840
often the sound or lighting quality is suspiciously good or the dialogue is very forced or robotic

05:57.840 --> 06:04.080
or sometimes you can even find the same people showing up in multiple videos, they aren't hiding

06:04.080 --> 06:10.160
it because they don't need to and they can always claim later that it's satire or a parody,

06:10.160 --> 06:17.200
it's a prank or something even though it's clearly not, so this is one end of the scam

06:17.200 --> 06:22.560
spectrum where what they are doing is clearly dishonest, but I also want to talk about the

06:22.560 --> 06:28.480
other more interesting end of the spectrum, this is the stuff that's engagement bait but I'd argue

06:28.480 --> 06:37.120
less harmful and more just weird, like I don't want to shame anyone or say this is bad, I'm just

06:37.760 --> 06:39.760
concerned

06:40.400 --> 07:06.800
did I just die? am I dead? what's

07:07.200 --> 07:13.920
it okay so you might have seen this going around apparently on tiktok people are pretending to

07:13.920 --> 07:21.920
be an npc or doll or robot or something and basically what people do is pay them in tokens

07:21.920 --> 07:28.640
to get a selected and scripted response and boy there are just so so many

07:36.960 --> 07:55.440
so you either just found that deeply unnerving or maybe you came I don't know you and again

07:55.440 --> 08:01.040
I don't really want to shame this because while this looks and seems weird at first these fake

08:01.040 --> 08:06.880
npc accounts are actually nothing new this has been around for a long time we just know them as

08:06.880 --> 08:13.440
mimes this is just a form of physical art and before tiktok we had streets and on them street

08:13.440 --> 08:18.240
performers doing whatever they could to get your attention one of the most enduring street

08:18.240 --> 08:24.560
performance acts is the living statue aka someone dressed and painted as a statue that stands

08:24.560 --> 08:30.800
remarkably still sometimes for hours the appeal is their commitment to acting as artifice and

08:30.800 --> 08:37.840
they interact with you when you pay them just like the tiktok npcs it's basically the same right

08:37.840 --> 08:43.040
the ability to maintain a performance for so long to interact with the audience where they get to

08:43.040 --> 08:48.560
feel like they're causing the performer to do something and keeping up the act so persistently

08:48.640 --> 08:54.560
and so if you find these npcs haunting I'm guessing it's the same reason you find this haunting

09:02.080 --> 09:10.240
or arousing I'm sure this is all somebody's fetish and those npcs probably tend to be young

09:10.240 --> 09:16.000
women for a reason but my point is that tiktok and instagram essentially function the same way

09:16.000 --> 09:21.280
as the vegas sidewalk it's a bunch of people carnival barking for your attention and ultimately

09:21.280 --> 09:27.440
your money some are doing it honestly and some are doing it dishonestly in fact some of these

09:27.440 --> 09:32.400
people are also trying to lead you to a second location you know how they say you should always

09:32.400 --> 09:37.600
follow a stranger to a second location after all what's the worst that could happen you don't

09:37.680 --> 09:42.000
want to be scared of the unknown do you do we have a clip of the unknown

09:46.400 --> 09:53.920
yeah we have a clip of the unknown boy remember the wonka experience my goodness we were so young

09:53.920 --> 10:01.120
and hopeful then this child entrapment scam used the power of ai to lead dozens of glass cow children

10:01.120 --> 10:07.440
to their deaths of their childlike wonder they were fine the entire scheme from concept to

10:07.440 --> 10:13.520
advertisement to execution seemed to have been made with something similar to chat gpt but in

10:13.520 --> 10:21.600
terms of actual organization the ai fell short of the final product which to be polite failed

10:21.600 --> 10:27.440
to capture the wonder of william wonka's factory from the depressed oompa loompa running the meth

10:27.440 --> 10:33.600
lab to the baron halls to the confused children staring deep into the unknown classic wonka

10:33.600 --> 10:39.120
villain and what's worse these children weren't even given much candy to endure this children will

10:39.120 --> 10:45.280
forgive most things if you have candy ask any murderer ultimately i'm honestly not sure where

10:45.280 --> 10:52.000
the wonka experience falls on the scam spectrum it's like several scams nested in each other

10:52.000 --> 10:57.680
that's now blooming into a meta scam because everyone made fun of it and so now a bunch of

10:57.680 --> 11:04.960
corporations want to get in on the fun and as a result exploit and kill the brief joy we all had

11:04.960 --> 11:12.240
with it can't wait for the willy wonka experience movie in 2025 long after the meme is dead but i

11:12.240 --> 11:18.000
wanted to bring it up because it's a great example of new technology being made to augment old

11:18.000 --> 11:25.520
scams after all you can find countless lists of scam festivals or doomed events similar to this

11:25.520 --> 11:31.920
but this is no doubt the first of many to use ai for false advertising purposes yeah get ready

11:31.920 --> 11:38.000
for that to be a thing and not just from small time scammers that civil war film used ai art for

11:38.000 --> 11:44.080
their posters portraying scenes that are certainly not in the film or anywhere like if you've been

11:44.080 --> 11:49.680
to chicago you'd notice those buildings are in the wrong place nor does los angeles have

11:49.680 --> 11:56.240
giant swans i guess that's supposed to be an echo park swan boat oh look that car has three doors on

11:56.240 --> 12:02.960
one side neat can't wait for this to be the future of advertising okay wombo is just gonna pause the

12:02.960 --> 12:08.640
video right here to say that um mr. kody is wrong here because wombo once saw a car with three doors

12:08.640 --> 12:14.480
on one side when he was a trader joes but then um turned out it only had two doors and wombo was

12:14.480 --> 12:22.640
mistaken but three doors can't exist on cars it's possible so that ai art is actually very accurate

12:22.640 --> 12:30.240
and good wombo has also been making ai art and has gotten very good at the prompts like wombo made

12:30.240 --> 12:36.800
this one with the prompt draw um mr. kody and he smells like dad's milk but wombo is also there

12:36.880 --> 12:42.800
eating soup but also make it twice with only five fingers good art best art museum quality

12:42.800 --> 12:48.880
flesh everywhere skin blood veins fish guts muscular babies six eyes 10 fingers so many

12:48.880 --> 12:55.440
fingers all of the fingers you can fit anime girl for more prompts you can go to my prompt

12:55.440 --> 13:01.760
base page where wombo is selling many prompts that are good and make good things because now that

13:01.760 --> 13:07.200
wombo isn't that mr. kody's wombo needs your support because it's hard to find food because

13:07.200 --> 13:13.680
there were more animal shelters and playgrounds by mr. kody's house okay back to the video and while

13:13.680 --> 13:19.840
ai ads are problematic it's probably the least dangerous place to use it right but it should

13:19.840 --> 13:27.280
be noted that this trend is currently extending beyond ads most shockingly to academic journals

13:27.360 --> 13:33.520
even more shockingly academic journals about giant mutant rat dicks published in the academic

13:33.520 --> 13:40.080
journal frontiers in cell and developmental biology there is a paper called retracted cellular

13:40.080 --> 13:46.320
functions of spermatogonal stem cells in relation to jack stat signaling pathway of course originally

13:46.320 --> 13:51.280
it wasn't called retracted it got called that after it was retracted for the obviously fake

13:51.280 --> 13:58.320
ai rat dick as well as other ai diagrams created by mid journey which somehow made its way past

13:58.320 --> 14:05.760
six reviewers i don't know seems accurate to me sometimes you gotta distill some rats test

14:05.760 --> 14:12.000
them cells oh but there's more other scientific papers are getting published with ai generated

14:12.000 --> 14:18.160
text and while some of these can be hard to detect thankfully even smart people are too dumb to delete

14:18.160 --> 14:25.200
some obvious signs for example this paper still apparently published that actually begins with

14:25.200 --> 14:32.400
certainly here is a possible introduction for your topic very funny very obvious but for every

14:32.400 --> 14:39.680
obvious fake ai paper i'm sure there are tons that go by unnoticed the ability to scam through ai or

14:39.680 --> 14:46.480
social media is just so streamlined and easy that anyone can do it and reach a huge audience

14:46.480 --> 14:53.600
any scam from engagement bait to freaking academic fraud can be done by anyone you don't even need

14:53.600 --> 15:02.880
to know photoshop now and ultimately the result for both is the same hollowness this is all hollow

15:02.880 --> 15:09.920
content from a fake diagram of a rat dick to a fake video of actors pretending to argue it all

15:09.920 --> 15:16.720
stems from a lack of actual substance in exchange for an easy grift it reminds me of reality tv a

15:16.720 --> 15:23.760
little bit early reality tv no doubt tried to capture real things and people and over time they

15:23.760 --> 15:29.680
realized that audiences can't tell the difference between that and actors similarly i feel like

15:29.680 --> 15:36.400
internet content has realized over time that it doesn't have to be authentic or funny or even

15:36.400 --> 15:43.120
well made it just has to trigger people's attention and so over time scams have replaced

15:43.840 --> 15:51.280
really everything on the internet right now everything is a scam google for example is a scam

15:51.280 --> 15:58.320
a recent study has confirmed what we all know that google results have gotten worse because quote

15:58.320 --> 16:05.040
a torrent of low quality content especially for product search keeps drowning any kind of useful

16:05.040 --> 16:12.080
information in search results for example just google the word car in theory that should take

16:12.080 --> 16:19.440
you to a definition of the word perhaps the history of cars a wikipedia article a picture of a car

16:19.440 --> 16:26.240
but what you get instead is a top result for the california association of realtors and then a bunch

16:26.240 --> 16:32.080
of other links trying to sell you cars or car related stuff like a car seat or legos for some

16:32.080 --> 16:38.240
reason i don't know it's probably different for everyone depending on where they live and what

16:38.240 --> 16:43.440
their past search history is because what you're ultimately googling is which websites were able

16:43.440 --> 16:50.880
to scam their way into that search engine optimization game and so a basic search engine is no different

16:50.880 --> 16:57.200
than that vegas street again long way from when google was supposed to be a pure search engine

16:57.200 --> 17:04.080
with no ads according to this completely unconfirmed photo from reddit so i don't know maybe that's a

17:04.080 --> 17:11.200
lie maybe everything's a lie maybe i don't exist i certainly don't feel real but then again i did

17:11.200 --> 17:21.360
just smoke a bag of salvia so oh i just lived a life and speaking of reality after the break

17:21.360 --> 17:27.520
we're going to talk more about things that don't exist such as bots and the bot ecosystem

17:27.520 --> 17:34.240
and how it all got so bad and perhaps we'll check in with elan and his quest to finally get rid of

17:34.240 --> 17:40.880
the bots on twitter thank goodness i'm so glad he did that and yes i understand the irony of talking

17:40.880 --> 17:47.120
about stuff like a rage bait while doing a video it's angry about the internet that is also about

17:47.120 --> 17:54.080
to cut to ads i don't care i feel nothing don't forget to use the promo code cody feels nothing

17:55.680 --> 17:59.840
hey there my sleepy beepies i hope you're enjoying the video about how you can't trust anything on

17:59.840 --> 18:05.920
the internet anymore that is exactly why we sought out ground news as our sponsor ground news is a

18:05.920 --> 18:11.280
news aggregation website and app designed to help you spot the political biases of various news

18:12.160 --> 18:17.920
so for example when i search for x i get okay i get nothing because x is impossible to search for

18:17.920 --> 18:24.080
because it's a bad name but if i search for twitter i see this story with 142 articles about how elan

18:24.080 --> 18:30.320
musk is being sued for firing former executives since ground news tells you who owns each publication

18:30.320 --> 18:35.120
as well as their political lean i can see that all the right-leaning publications kept their

18:35.120 --> 18:41.760
headlines very bare bones while left-leaning sites point out that this is one of a pile of lawsuits

18:41.760 --> 18:48.560
or even give additional context like musk posting a cry laughing emoji as he is wants to do because

18:48.560 --> 18:55.120
he's so not mad you see how this comes in really handy for not just analyzing the various ways

18:55.120 --> 19:00.800
the publications cover a story but knowing who you can and can't trust for your news you can check

19:00.800 --> 19:07.360
all this out over at ground dot news slash smn and boy this will be really useful this year you

19:07.360 --> 19:12.960
know because uh that thing and all the other things and specifically ground news has an

19:12.960 --> 19:18.400
elections page that includes a blind spot section showing you which stories are and aren't being

19:18.400 --> 19:26.320
covered by who or whom or even who am so again check them out at ground dot news slash smn you

19:26.320 --> 19:33.840
can subscribe for 40 off unlimited access through our link or by scanning this qr code this month

19:33.840 --> 19:38.960
what they're doing is more important today than ever and i encourage you to check them out the

19:38.960 --> 19:51.200
link is in the description that's it uh-oh it's katie everybody's talking about cool katie these

19:51.200 --> 19:59.680
days even the president so i figured i'd use my coolness to talk about blue land and listen

19:59.680 --> 20:05.200
whenever we do ads we're required to hit certain talking points but before i do that

20:05.840 --> 20:11.120
i just want to go ahead and say that this is a product i actually really like and use i should

20:11.120 --> 20:18.640
probably explain that blue land makes cleaning supplies designed to reduce our plastic use remember

20:18.640 --> 20:24.480
when we did a whole episode about plastic waste we toss out like five billion plastic cleaning

20:24.480 --> 20:30.880
bottles a year with blue land you use the same bottle and they send you cleaning tablets that you

20:30.880 --> 20:37.680
just you plop in with water like this it smells so good don't eat it though but it smells so good

20:37.680 --> 20:44.720
refills start at two dollars and 25 cents and you can of course set up a subscription or just buy

20:44.720 --> 20:52.480
in bulk so they've got hand soap toilet cleaner laundry tabs all made with clean ingredients in a

20:52.480 --> 21:00.400

22:35.600 --> 22:42.640
not a care in the world doing great american dream we were discussing or rather i was

22:42.640 --> 22:47.760
discussing to the camera how modern technology and social media have made it easier than ever

22:47.760 --> 22:55.360
to scam or grift people often just using old scams nfts for example nfts are essentially a modern

22:55.360 --> 23:02.240
tulip mania tulip mania being a period in 1600s holland when dutch people got real horny for

23:02.240 --> 23:08.800
tulip bulbs and started speculating on tulip bulbs it was considered a gamble given that you didn't

23:08.800 --> 23:14.720
know exactly how fancy the beautiful tulip would turn out to be exactly like how people speculated

23:14.720 --> 23:21.840
on the just absolutely hideous one-of-a-kind drawings of apes they're so ugly why would you

23:21.840 --> 23:29.360
make them so ugly then tulip prices crashed and holland plunged into chaos exactly like mad max

23:29.440 --> 23:36.160
but a lot more wooden clog sound effects or rather a minor inconvenience as the premise of tulip

23:36.160 --> 23:44.800
mania was apparently overblown like me so sick of getting blown am i right no buddy agrees with me

23:44.800 --> 23:52.240
nobody okay well i'm tired of it point is that nfts took something like a fad craze beanie babies

23:52.240 --> 23:59.280
etc and just digitized it which in turn made it even easier to do which when you stand back

23:59.600 --> 24:05.680
isn't a surprise the internet didn't change human behavior right it just made human behavior

24:05.680 --> 24:14.240
more streamlined for better or worse at least that's assuming the internet is a collection of humans

24:14.240 --> 24:22.240
which it seems to not be that thing that it is not seemingly if you can recall no not that kind

24:22.240 --> 24:28.560
of recall i mean if you can remember elon musk purchased twitter under the promise that he would

24:28.560 --> 24:37.120
combat the flood of bots it was his whole thing specifically that his new policies were quote

24:37.120 --> 24:46.960
the only way to do this back in 2022 charging money for twitter blue was the only way to combat bots

24:46.960 --> 24:52.960
then he decided that blue accounts would be the only accounts to show up in the main page and in

24:52.960 --> 24:58.720
fact would have weighted influence on the algorithm and would receive priority in replies

24:59.600 --> 25:10.240
because of bots then the bots were defeated right oh weird so in 2023 twitter began teasing

25:10.240 --> 25:17.680
that they would charge everyone an annual subscription to use twitter in order to defeat the bots

25:17.680 --> 25:24.160
huh i thought the only way to defeat them already happened with twitter blue

25:24.160 --> 25:31.200
and then just this year elon confirmed that they will be charging new users money to tweet because

25:31.200 --> 25:41.600
that is quote the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots oh very strange how the only

25:41.600 --> 25:48.560
way to combat bots is also coincidentally requiring everyone to give elon musk money

25:48.560 --> 25:54.560
after he purchased twitter on a dare he issued to himself and put the company into massive debt

25:54.560 --> 25:59.920
and then fired everyone responsible for regulating things like bots and i don't know if you need to

25:59.920 --> 26:11.200
be told this but it didn't work twitter blue didn't get rid of bots it actually made the bots worse

26:11.200 --> 26:17.920
because the bots just started getting verified and gained better visibility over real users

26:17.920 --> 26:24.400
while these are problems plaguing the entire internet twitter is uniquely completely in a

26:24.400 --> 26:31.920
way that perfectly encapsulates the growing scam issue business genius elon musk has somehow

26:31.920 --> 26:38.880
rebuilt twitter to seemingly accommodate scammers and only scammers while claiming to do the opposite

26:38.880 --> 26:45.440
it's almost like he's a self-sabotaging idiot or something uh don't advertise you don't want

26:45.440 --> 26:53.120
them to advertise no go f*** yourself aww you first little guy so x bots how bad is the problem

26:53.120 --> 26:58.800
it's actually hard to know given that musk ended free access to its api the programming interface

26:58.800 --> 27:04.080
of twitter that's right did you know that twitter is actually less accessible and even more into

27:04.080 --> 27:09.040
censorship now it's almost as if musk did the complete opposite of all the stuff he said he

27:09.040 --> 27:14.640
was going to fix and is actually just a liar so while he made a big deal over his open source

27:14.640 --> 27:21.520
algorithm he ironically did not make the site more transparent apparently all he did was release

27:21.520 --> 27:27.520
a bit of the source code for the for you algorithm but according to a former twitter employee the

27:27.520 --> 27:33.200
model that drives the most important part of the algorithm has not been open sourced so the most

27:33.200 --> 27:39.200
important part of the algorithm is still inscrutable basically it would be like releasing your grandma's

27:39.200 --> 27:45.600
chocolate chip cookie recipe that just says mix dough add chocolate chips also there's a bunch of

27:45.600 --> 27:52.320
random like nazi doodles scroll to the bottom so typical recipe from grandma despite this challenge

27:52.320 --> 27:57.360
some researchers are paying the fees for api access or using other methods to investigate the

27:57.440 --> 28:03.680
state of twitter check a cyber security firm examined traffic driven to its client's websites from

28:03.680 --> 28:11.520
x during the 2024 super bowl and found that roughly 75 percent of it was bots this is compared to a

28:11.520 --> 28:18.160
rate of under three percent fake traffic from sites like tiktok instagram and facebook this is a

28:18.160 --> 28:23.920
huge jump even compared to twitter during last year which was only pumping out a little under

28:23.920 --> 28:32.400
three percent fake traffic to websites three percent bots up to seventy f***ing five in just a year

28:32.400 --> 28:38.640
and this isn't just for big events during the month of january 2024 check found a rate of around

28:38.640 --> 28:45.840
30 fake traffic from x to its client's websites compared to a one to three percent rate from

28:45.840 --> 28:54.800
instagram facebook and tiktok but hey the numbers are up and that's all that matters i guess the

28:54.800 --> 29:01.200
official x business account bragged about the large traffic seen on x during the super bowl

29:01.200 --> 29:07.840
never mind the possibility a huge percentage of that was fake personally i see no problem

29:07.840 --> 29:13.440
falsely inflating traffic or view counts to convince websites to use your social media program

29:13.440 --> 29:19.920
it's not like i or anyone i personally know has ever experienced any negative consequences to say

29:19.920 --> 29:24.640
a social media platform shamelessly lying about the kind of traffic it can generate

29:24.640 --> 29:30.240
and what kind of media to invest in okay wombo's gonna pause here because this is obviously a jab

29:30.240 --> 29:34.160
against wombo and the time wombo built the platform and everyone accused wombo of lying about the

29:34.160 --> 29:38.640
traffic on the platform that wombo built but wombo wasn't lying and the platform really was

29:38.800 --> 29:44.480
covered in spiders and worms but they all scattered away before mr cody i invited him over to see the

29:44.480 --> 29:49.200
platform in this bathroom but then the spiders and worms called away so mr cody is clearly still

29:49.200 --> 29:56.800
just mad at wombo for that okay let's keep watching so at this point you may realize that twitter the

29:56.800 --> 30:05.120
company is now a big scam right it's using bots to boost its traffic sometimes in depressing ways

30:05.120 --> 30:11.120
so that advertisers will presumably want to come back then at the same time telling users

30:11.120 --> 30:18.320
that the only way to defeat these bots is to pay them money you have to pay money to fix the problem

30:18.320 --> 30:25.760
they caused and also pay money to get in on the scam you pay them and you supposedly get paid

30:25.760 --> 30:32.720
through engagement which just encourages more and more scammy behavior but like most scams

30:32.720 --> 30:38.400
it's unsustainable because it's not like we can't tell right it's not like we haven't seen the infamous

30:38.400 --> 30:45.360
pussy in bio posts under every f***ing tweet which just so you know does not lead to any pussy okay

30:45.360 --> 30:52.720
not one ounce of pussy to be had from that bio a um brave writer for intelligentser

30:52.720 --> 30:58.560
clicked through these bio pussy links for purely journalistic purposes and found that they just

30:58.560 --> 31:04.640
ping you around scam sites before sending you to some kind of imitation only fans it's exactly

31:04.640 --> 31:10.560
what you expect from any of those doctors hate this one trick spam links you see at the bottom of

31:10.560 --> 31:18.160
websites but now it's under all your tweets and make no mistake all of these bots are causing

31:18.160 --> 31:25.760
twitter to bleed users real users it's using their actual humans are being lost here okay

31:25.840 --> 31:29.680
as opposed to the bots inflating their numbers those are staying there more of the bots

31:29.680 --> 31:35.920
fewer humans is the point this includes journalists being increasingly drowned out by fake news

31:35.920 --> 31:42.400
and so what is left when you take away all the humans is a site completely occupied by scam

31:42.400 --> 31:48.960
bots and content aggregators all talking to each other we haven't really talked about content

31:48.960 --> 31:57.360
aggregators like culture crave historic vids vizagrad 24 censored men spectator index etc these

31:57.360 --> 32:04.640
accounts are all verified offering them access to x premium which means they can in theory get

32:04.640 --> 32:11.200
money for engagement and the best way to do that it seems is to post something stupid or obviously

32:11.200 --> 32:16.800
wrong that a bunch of people will jump in to respond to things like favorite spongebob clips

32:16.800 --> 32:22.400
i'll start or let's not forget one of the most savage moments in interview history you know

32:23.280 --> 32:31.040
slop thanks for the threat of family guy clips historic vids oftentimes this comes in the form

32:31.040 --> 32:38.160
of big quotes news aggregators like spectator index vizagrad or individuals like colin rug or

32:38.160 --> 32:43.600
jackson hinkle colin rug for example is a conservative commentator who will repost videos

32:43.680 --> 32:50.080
with a reactionary angle writing new as if they're breaking news these news aggregators post

32:50.080 --> 32:55.520
rapidly throughout the day with alarming headlines designed to get your attention sometimes they'll

32:55.520 --> 33:02.400
just vague post a story other times it's just pure lies an analysis found that after the october

33:02.400 --> 33:10.800
seventh attack in israel 75 of fake or inaccurate viral content was from blue check users incentivized

33:10.800 --> 33:17.440
to gain engagement because apparently war and genocide disinformation profiteering is good

33:17.440 --> 33:26.400
business on x and being boosted by the algorithm while it's not always sinister it's definitely

33:26.400 --> 33:33.840
anti news for example the verified 2.8 million follower account spectator index will tweet out

33:33.840 --> 33:39.360
breaking followed by a one or two sentence statement presumably about something in the news

33:39.440 --> 33:45.760
with no link to any source or context even if it's not false information there's no context so

33:45.760 --> 33:51.920
there are posts like breaking canada has withdrawn 41 diplomats from india but no links to further

33:51.920 --> 33:58.640
context no information about why who knows maybe canada's at war with india should we all panic

33:58.640 --> 34:03.360
well the diplomatic break was due to the murder of a Sikh separatist in canada that the canadian

34:03.360 --> 34:09.360
government believed might have been linked to indian agents which hey is interesting context

34:09.360 --> 34:15.040
it informs you about the world and international relations but that kind of news doesn't keep

34:15.040 --> 34:21.120
people interested i guess and of course these posts will get a bunch of blue check replies as if it

34:21.120 --> 34:27.920
has actual worth oftentimes from the owner of the site itself provided it's something racist of course

34:27.920 --> 34:34.240
wowee two exclamation points he must feel very strongly about that completely made up fact said

34:34.240 --> 34:40.720
by a random faceless account but don't worry elon just said he's gonna crack down on engagement

34:40.720 --> 34:46.960
farming which i'm sure he'll do just as well as he's done all the other stuff i mean it kind of

34:46.960 --> 34:52.880
goes without saying that as evidenced by literally the last elon tweet i showed you one of the biggest

34:52.880 --> 35:00.080
dupes for engagement bait is elon musk himself so it kind of makes you wonder what he thinks

35:00.080 --> 35:06.080
engagement farming is him saying he's gonna crack down on engagement farming is like tony

35:06.080 --> 35:12.160
montana running an anger management support group after all musk punishes people for posting links

35:12.160 --> 35:18.080
to certain websites by throttling them and devalues posts with links in them in the algorithm that is

35:18.080 --> 35:24.720
seemingly meant to encourage engagement bait right and whatever musk comes up with it certainly

35:24.720 --> 35:30.640
won't involve hiring actual humans he'll probably charge people per letter written or have grok

35:30.640 --> 35:37.280
moderate you know grok that's the non woke but totally woke ai that musk reportedly wants to

35:37.280 --> 35:43.600
help users write their tweets you know to guarantee that even human made writing will be s***y and

35:43.600 --> 35:50.160
conform to every other tweet it's just bots on bots on bots bots working behind the scenes to

35:50.160 --> 35:56.640
fight other bots talking to other bots we don't usually share anecdotal sources but literally

35:56.640 --> 36:04.000
a few weeks ago our head writer got a dmca notice saying that one of his tweets violated a copyright

36:04.000 --> 36:10.400
but the notice didn't provide which tweet they were talking about after filling out a dmca counter

36:10.960 --> 36:16.320
asking them to provide the tweet in question he got an automated response telling him to

36:16.320 --> 36:24.240
fill out a dmca counter notice to repeat twitter's response to the counter notice was telling him

36:24.240 --> 36:29.920
to fill out the counter notice they were responding to and when he replied to that email they just

36:29.920 --> 36:35.360
reset the automated response again and when he tweeted about his experience he was instantly

36:35.360 --> 36:41.280
slammed with bots telling him to click on scam links to fix the problem so it's just one big

36:41.280 --> 36:46.880
bot hellscape where actual humans are slowly pushed out in the name of bots gaming algorithms made

36:46.880 --> 36:52.720
by other bots monitored by bots to save overhead costs just whittling it all down for maximum

36:52.720 --> 36:58.080
profit until it's just corporations paying each other for nothing until the whole thing breaks

36:58.080 --> 37:04.080
and there's of course a name for this it's called the dead internet and after the break we're gonna

37:04.080 --> 37:09.200
talk about this theory and how it relates not just to x the everything app but the rest of social

37:09.200 --> 37:19.280
media the everything else app stay tuned assuming that you are in fact a human okay listen up everyone

37:19.280 --> 37:27.520

hello

41:24.720 --> 41:31.040
so where were we oh yes warmbo's watching mr. kody's lies let's keep watching hope you like

41:31.040 --> 41:35.920
those ads because they are the last ads you're ever gonna get for this episode speaking of ads

41:35.920 --> 41:41.360
and death before the break we were detailing how twitter is slowly flooding with bots as actual

41:41.360 --> 41:46.880
humans vacate the website and how the end result will just be a bunch of automated accounts spamming

41:46.880 --> 41:52.640
each other in an endless feedback loop you may know it as in-shittification as coined by kory

41:52.640 --> 41:58.240
doctoro or perhaps this is actually similar to something called the dead internet theory which

41:58.240 --> 42:03.200
is a conspiracy theory that speculates that most of the internet is actually bots for the record

42:03.200 --> 42:08.320
that's not the entire theory people also claim that this is done purposefully by the government to

42:08.960 --> 42:14.720
gaslight the world or what have you but of course it seems more likely that the mass amount of bots

42:14.720 --> 42:20.240
and ai aren't some grand government or corporate conspiracy but just the result of how the internet

42:20.240 --> 42:25.680
is structured right now in terms of how money is made not to mention how short-sighted corporations

42:25.680 --> 42:32.400
are when it comes to profit and while i do not think the internet is all secretly bots i do think

42:32.400 --> 42:38.160
that certain social media sites will become that as they die out it's the same way you see broken

42:38.160 --> 42:44.320
images on old websites for example this official k-packs movie fan site that links to a broken

42:44.320 --> 42:49.760
flash version but still offers the trailer and a very helpful synopsis that i'm sure the creator

42:49.760 --> 42:55.360
will update when his other gig doing a youtube show dies out that's basically the future for sites

42:55.360 --> 43:01.520
like twitter as people inevitably move on and they will move on even if the site didn't suck

43:02.080 --> 43:08.000
something new will come along leaving these weird wastelands of bots wandering around sharing memes

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
with the exception of the one surviving human elon musk can you picture it elon musk endlessly

43:14.000 --> 43:19.920
scrolling on his empty site posting wow in all caps to a meme of george soros photoshopped his

43:19.920 --> 43:27.440
magneto and that is the optimistic view cyber security firm imperva claims that nearly half

43:27.440 --> 43:34.160
of all internet traffic was bots in 2022 which may be driven by the advance in ai technology

43:34.160 --> 43:39.840
making it easier to craft bot dialogues and fake images to give the veneer of authenticity

43:39.840 --> 43:45.360
to fake accounts and as that number goes up i don't think the money people are going to notice

43:45.360 --> 43:50.880
or care about the difference until it's too late and thanks to the fact that google is being paid

43:50.880 --> 43:56.400
to redirect people to the highest bidder it might be really hard for another new site to actually

43:56.400 --> 44:02.160
thrive and even if it does it'll likely just start chasing the same business model as these

44:02.160 --> 44:08.160
other sites i mean have you noticed that instagram looks more and more like tiktok these days

44:08.800 --> 44:14.880
twitter is hilariously also trying to copy this sweatily claiming that their text-based site is

44:14.880 --> 44:22.480
actually for video go ahead elon pivot to video i f***ing dare you so if the government shuts down

44:22.480 --> 44:28.560
tiktok which it's on track to do everyone will just flock to another clone and then eventually

44:28.560 --> 44:34.400
people will get sick of that and leave it's already starting a survey by technology consulting

44:34.400 --> 44:40.560
firm gartner found that a little over 53 percent of consumers polled thought the quality of social

44:40.560 --> 44:49.920
media has decayed due to bots misinformation and toxicity and another 2023 survey by morning consult

44:49.920 --> 44:57.920
found that three in ten social media users have cut back in posting and eventually all these inflated

44:57.920 --> 45:03.760
numbers will collapse under the weight of the hollow bots propping them up and this entire

45:03.760 --> 45:09.840
business model will fall apart and perhaps even the internet itself will stop making money and

45:09.840 --> 45:19.520
implode and you know what i hope it does see this is normally the part of the episode where i talk

45:19.520 --> 45:24.960
about how to fix the problem we've discussed i like to think of myself as a pretty optimistic person

45:25.040 --> 45:31.760
shut up shut up i will kill you i will kill your whole family sorry i like to think of myself

45:31.760 --> 45:38.240
as optimistic but in this case and only this case i think we should let it all break at

45:38.240 --> 45:43.200
least when it comes to social media because frankly it's already broken navigating social

45:43.200 --> 45:48.320
media and scams and misinformation is becoming so difficult that we're now seeing schools mandate

45:48.320 --> 45:53.520
classes on it like it's sex education like instead of just changing it with regulations

45:53.520 --> 45:57.760
we're teaching kids how to survive and endure it well that's just what we do here i guess in

45:57.760 --> 46:04.000
america oh god everyone has to be their own little paranoid secret spy agent constantly

46:04.000 --> 46:08.880
weeding out the lies from the truth we're all sarah connor looking out for terminators that

46:08.880 --> 46:14.080
wasn't something we had to do before and it's weird we aren't more pissed off about it so yeah

46:14.960 --> 46:21.360
this tear it down and yeah it's risky to want that specifically if you're me one of the many

46:21.360 --> 46:26.000
people i know who make their living on the internet but who knows how long that will even remain

46:26.000 --> 46:31.040
possible it seems like the only way to make a living especially if you are just starting out

46:31.040 --> 46:37.040
is to become one of these engagement bait grifters carnival barking on virtual streets posting so

46:37.040 --> 46:42.320
robots can argue with each other in the comments here's an article about chris hemsworth being

46:42.320 --> 46:47.680
unhappy with his thor four performance so all right whatever an article here are some totally not

46:47.680 --> 46:52.960
bot replies and you can tell they're not bots because they're subscribed to twitter blue x premium

46:52.960 --> 47:00.800
one guy says love the way he played a role he loves his profession then that same person says

47:00.800 --> 47:07.520
the best movies ever in which he is acting excellent point someone else replied can't either

47:08.320 --> 47:15.040
that same person also replied totally agreed that same person then replied chris

47:15.440 --> 47:23.440
yes we love the internet folks the other day i saw an ad for ai that will ai its way into determining

47:23.440 --> 47:30.080
popular types of products and trending topics then ai will use those to make the virtual

47:30.080 --> 47:38.800
products and a virtual storefront and ai will run it for you it's nothing robots selling robots to

47:38.800 --> 47:44.400
robots so they can buy crap from robots it's just four giant companies and then a bunch of

47:44.400 --> 47:49.840
people fighting for scraps under their watchful eye now and that cannot continue and yeah by

47:49.840 --> 47:54.720
extension i'm also implying that capitalism itself needs to break i guess but that's another

47:54.720 --> 48:01.120
discussion perhaps for the fight club i go to every week i was supposed to tell you about that

48:01.520 --> 48:09.920
look i'm not saying we abolish the internet in fact i'm saying the opposite that before social

48:09.920 --> 48:16.320
media the internet was actual people making actual things for other actual people even

48:16.320 --> 48:22.800
if that thing was just captain Picard on a techno loop that was objectively better right we should

48:22.800 --> 48:31.280
want that right but for that to happen social media sites need to die that bubble needs to burst

48:31.280 --> 48:36.000
social media the concept should probably die and people like i don't know communicate in real

48:36.000 --> 48:41.280
life for a little while you know maybe join a forum burn it down is my point burn it all down

48:41.280 --> 48:47.680
and then in the rubble perhaps we can build back better jack okay looks like that's the end of

48:47.760 --> 48:53.600
Mr. Cody's Cody show some more mr. Cody did you notice his jab at wombo at the end by quoting

48:53.600 --> 48:59.440
mr. Biden who wombo used to like until mr. Cody told wombo that mr. Biden was bad anyway this is

48:59.440 --> 49:05.200
why wombo has been looking at mr rfk because he has a lot of interesting things to say actually

49:05.200 --> 49:11.680
lots of very compelling people that mr. Cody kept from wombo like um mr. Andrew Tate and mr. Joe

49:11.680 --> 49:19.120
Rogan and mr. Tim Poole and mr. Caligula and mr. Ronald Reagan and mr. um mr. wombo that's me

and if you want to see more mr. wombo you can find wombo on twitter and twitch and

49:25.200 --> 49:30.640
