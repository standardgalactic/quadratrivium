Be sure to check out WombosX's twitter.x at X's www.twitter.therealwombo, it's all

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:31,120

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,640
then slash um Wombo, it's um hi it's Wombo, anyway Wombo is going to play games and watch

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,960
things and stuff with you, there's a new some more Mr. Cody out today and since Wombo is

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,200
mad at Mr. Cody, Wombo thought we should watch it and make fun of Mr. Cody for being stinky

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,000
so let's just click on it.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
On Wombo's new gaming laptop, there's Wombo Bot on Wombo's new phone, you can buy things

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,640
on your phone actually, if you check out Wombo's twitch, Wombo has a tutorial on how to buy

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,000
things on your phone, anyway we've clicked on Mr. Stinky Cody's new video, so let's

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
watch that.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
Greetings Choombas, time to chip into some more news with a Z because it's future times

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,800
and we have robots now, no really actual robots, some better than others, anyway here's some

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,960
news we don't actually get those robots yet, probably not until the army gets bored doing

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:43,600
wars with them, but until then we do get bots, countless, countless just too many bots AI

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,760
to be exact, good AI, not really, evil AI, no wouldn't say that either, I mean Hal had

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,440
to be like functional in order to kill everybody, what we have is more like that last 10 seconds

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,680
of Hal's life where he slowly loses his mind and just sings a song nobody wanted to hear

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,240
and this is all to say that social media sure seems to be patched to the gills with scams,

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,320
bots and mediocre AI art, AI recipes and movie trivia, aggregated reddit posts set to Minecraft

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,320
parkour, deep fried videos of long dead cats, those countless if only there was a page that

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,160
posted blank accounts, robots describing scenes from movies for some reason like as if they're

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,040
just things that happened in life, we've discussed how the internet is basically just a handful

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,480
of social media sites now and so it's a little concerning that these sites have been slowly

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,760
flooded with a bunch of bots and scams and clickbaity accounts, not just on Twitter,

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,400
but yes very much on Twitter, but also Instagram and TikTok and I haven't really checked Facebook

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,600
in a while but I assume there too and this seems by design and while that sucks for most

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,600
people, at least we can rest easy knowing that we are in the golden years for scammy online

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,920
freaks and the sometimes billionaire dupes who love them.

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,840
Huzzah!

32
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:21,320
The Growing Internet Scam Economy

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,720
So obviously the flim flam profession is a proud and ancient tradition dating to the dawn of

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,800
civilization, one of the oldest complaints to the manager was a clay tablet from the 18th

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,640
century BC written by a buyer claiming he was scammed, skipped to the early internet and we

36
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,720
had phishing emails that Nigerian Prince scam, boner pills, most of those pills being ineffective,

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,440
now we've got AI and complex bot networks and crypto and maybe even little pick pocket

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,160
drones, you could give them a boo hats, oh that would be adorable for a while, but while the

39
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,840
tools are advanced the scammy methods are basically the same, also for all you semantics

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,160
perverts jerking your words in the way back I'm going to be using the term scam very loosely

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,280
when talking about this because I think one of the unique things about the internet is that it

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,960
more easily blurs the line between engagement bait, random bots and people straight up trying to

43
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,680
steal your money, not all scams are created equal but they all work on the same fundamental level

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,800
in that they are all trying to get your attention using tactics that are either dishonest or

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,880
manipulative, for example have you ever been scrolling through Instagram or TikTok when a

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,360
video of an absolute mega Karen pops up, you know some lady who is acting in an unbelievably

47
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
entitled and enraging way?

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,440
Wow, what a freak, absolutely wild that a human being would actually act like that,

49
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,400
it's almost too weird to be true, you can't make this stuff up, oh wait yeah I guess you can,

50
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,000
they literally posted set photos like they were teasing the next Marvel film, see there are of

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,040
course plenty of videos of real assholes on social media, which is exactly why these staged videos

52
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,800
are able to thrive, in fact there's an entire fake Karen economy on the internet that makes

53
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,760
real money doing this thanks to how engagement is rewarded, I'd argue a lot of them are obvious,

54
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,840
often the sound or lighting quality is suspiciously good or the dialogue is very forced or robotic

55
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,080
or sometimes you can even find the same people showing up in multiple videos, they aren't hiding

56
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,160
it because they don't need to and they can always claim later that it's satire or a parody,

57
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,200
it's a prank or something even though it's clearly not, so this is one end of the scam

58
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,560
spectrum where what they are doing is clearly dishonest, but I also want to talk about the

59
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,480
other more interesting end of the spectrum, this is the stuff that's engagement bait but I'd argue

60
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:37,120
less harmful and more just weird, like I don't want to shame anyone or say this is bad, I'm just

61
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
concerned

62
00:06:40,400 --> 00:07:06,800
did I just die? am I dead? what's

63
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,920
it okay so you might have seen this going around apparently on tiktok people are pretending to

64
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:21,920
be an npc or doll or robot or something and basically what people do is pay them in tokens

65
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,640
to get a selected and scripted response and boy there are just so so many

66
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:55,440
so you either just found that deeply unnerving or maybe you came I don't know you and again

67
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,040
I don't really want to shame this because while this looks and seems weird at first these fake

68
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,880
npc accounts are actually nothing new this has been around for a long time we just know them as

69
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,440
mimes this is just a form of physical art and before tiktok we had streets and on them street

70
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
performers doing whatever they could to get your attention one of the most enduring street

71
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,560
performance acts is the living statue aka someone dressed and painted as a statue that stands

72
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,800
remarkably still sometimes for hours the appeal is their commitment to acting as artifice and

73
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,840
they interact with you when you pay them just like the tiktok npcs it's basically the same right

74
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,040
the ability to maintain a performance for so long to interact with the audience where they get to

75
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,560
feel like they're causing the performer to do something and keeping up the act so persistently

76
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,560
and so if you find these npcs haunting I'm guessing it's the same reason you find this haunting

77
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:10,240
or arousing I'm sure this is all somebody's fetish and those npcs probably tend to be young

78
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,000
women for a reason but my point is that tiktok and instagram essentially function the same way

79
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,280
as the vegas sidewalk it's a bunch of people carnival barking for your attention and ultimately

80
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,440
your money some are doing it honestly and some are doing it dishonestly in fact some of these

81
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,400
people are also trying to lead you to a second location you know how they say you should always

82
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,600
follow a stranger to a second location after all what's the worst that could happen you don't

83
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,000
want to be scared of the unknown do you do we have a clip of the unknown

84
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:53,920
yeah we have a clip of the unknown boy remember the wonka experience my goodness we were so young

85
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,120
and hopeful then this child entrapment scam used the power of ai to lead dozens of glass cow children

86
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,440
to their deaths of their childlike wonder they were fine the entire scheme from concept to

87
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,520
advertisement to execution seemed to have been made with something similar to chat gpt but in

88
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:21,600
terms of actual organization the ai fell short of the final product which to be polite failed

89
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,440
to capture the wonder of william wonka's factory from the depressed oompa loompa running the meth

90
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,600
lab to the baron halls to the confused children staring deep into the unknown classic wonka

91
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
villain and what's worse these children weren't even given much candy to endure this children will

92
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,280
forgive most things if you have candy ask any murderer ultimately i'm honestly not sure where

93
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,000
the wonka experience falls on the scam spectrum it's like several scams nested in each other

94
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,680
that's now blooming into a meta scam because everyone made fun of it and so now a bunch of

95
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,960
corporations want to get in on the fun and as a result exploit and kill the brief joy we all had

96
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,240
with it can't wait for the willy wonka experience movie in 2025 long after the meme is dead but i

97
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,000
wanted to bring it up because it's a great example of new technology being made to augment old

98
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,520
scams after all you can find countless lists of scam festivals or doomed events similar to this

99
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,920
but this is no doubt the first of many to use ai for false advertising purposes yeah get ready

100
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,000
for that to be a thing and not just from small time scammers that civil war film used ai art for

101
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,080
their posters portraying scenes that are certainly not in the film or anywhere like if you've been

102
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,680
to chicago you'd notice those buildings are in the wrong place nor does los angeles have

103
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,240
giant swans i guess that's supposed to be an echo park swan boat oh look that car has three doors on

104
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,960
one side neat can't wait for this to be the future of advertising okay wombo is just gonna pause the

105
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,640
video right here to say that um mr. kody is wrong here because wombo once saw a car with three doors

106
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,480
on one side when he was a trader joes but then um turned out it only had two doors and wombo was

107
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:22,640
mistaken but three doors can't exist on cars it's possible so that ai art is actually very accurate

108
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:30,240
and good wombo has also been making ai art and has gotten very good at the prompts like wombo made

109
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,800
this one with the prompt draw um mr. kody and he smells like dad's milk but wombo is also there

110
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,800
eating soup but also make it twice with only five fingers good art best art museum quality

111
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,880
flesh everywhere skin blood veins fish guts muscular babies six eyes 10 fingers so many

112
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,440
fingers all of the fingers you can fit anime girl for more prompts you can go to my prompt

113
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,760
base page where wombo is selling many prompts that are good and make good things because now that

114
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,200
wombo isn't that mr. kody's wombo needs your support because it's hard to find food because

115
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,680
there were more animal shelters and playgrounds by mr. kody's house okay back to the video and while

116
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,840
ai ads are problematic it's probably the least dangerous place to use it right but it should

117
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:27,280
be noted that this trend is currently extending beyond ads most shockingly to academic journals

118
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,520
even more shockingly academic journals about giant mutant rat dicks published in the academic

119
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,080
journal frontiers in cell and developmental biology there is a paper called retracted cellular

120
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,320
functions of spermatogonal stem cells in relation to jack stat signaling pathway of course originally

121
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,280
it wasn't called retracted it got called that after it was retracted for the obviously fake

122
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,320
ai rat dick as well as other ai diagrams created by mid journey which somehow made its way past

123
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,760
six reviewers i don't know seems accurate to me sometimes you gotta distill some rats test

124
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,000
them cells oh but there's more other scientific papers are getting published with ai generated

125
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,160
text and while some of these can be hard to detect thankfully even smart people are too dumb to delete

126
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,200
some obvious signs for example this paper still apparently published that actually begins with

127
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,400
certainly here is a possible introduction for your topic very funny very obvious but for every

128
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,680
obvious fake ai paper i'm sure there are tons that go by unnoticed the ability to scam through ai or

129
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,480
social media is just so streamlined and easy that anyone can do it and reach a huge audience

130
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,600
any scam from engagement bait to freaking academic fraud can be done by anyone you don't even need

131
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,880
to know photoshop now and ultimately the result for both is the same hollowness this is all hollow

132
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,920
content from a fake diagram of a rat dick to a fake video of actors pretending to argue it all

133
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,720
stems from a lack of actual substance in exchange for an easy grift it reminds me of reality tv a

134
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,760
little bit early reality tv no doubt tried to capture real things and people and over time they

135
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,680
realized that audiences can't tell the difference between that and actors similarly i feel like

136
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,400
internet content has realized over time that it doesn't have to be authentic or funny or even

137
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:43,120
well made it just has to trigger people's attention and so over time scams have replaced

138
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:51,280
really everything on the internet right now everything is a scam google for example is a scam

139
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,320
a recent study has confirmed what we all know that google results have gotten worse because quote

140
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,040
a torrent of low quality content especially for product search keeps drowning any kind of useful

141
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,080
information in search results for example just google the word car in theory that should take

142
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:19,440
you to a definition of the word perhaps the history of cars a wikipedia article a picture of a car

143
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,240
but what you get instead is a top result for the california association of realtors and then a bunch

144
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,080
of other links trying to sell you cars or car related stuff like a car seat or legos for some

145
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,240
reason i don't know it's probably different for everyone depending on where they live and what

146
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
their past search history is because what you're ultimately googling is which websites were able

147
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,880
to scam their way into that search engine optimization game and so a basic search engine is no different

148
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,200
than that vegas street again long way from when google was supposed to be a pure search engine

149
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,080
with no ads according to this completely unconfirmed photo from reddit so i don't know maybe that's a

150
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:11,200
lie maybe everything's a lie maybe i don't exist i certainly don't feel real but then again i did

151
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:21,360
just smoke a bag of salvia so oh i just lived a life and speaking of reality after the break

152
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,520
we're going to talk more about things that don't exist such as bots and the bot ecosystem

153
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,240
and how it all got so bad and perhaps we'll check in with elan and his quest to finally get rid of

154
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,880
the bots on twitter thank goodness i'm so glad he did that and yes i understand the irony of talking

155
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,120
about stuff like a rage bait while doing a video it's angry about the internet that is also about

156
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,080
to cut to ads i don't care i feel nothing don't forget to use the promo code cody feels nothing

157
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,840
hey there my sleepy beepies i hope you're enjoying the video about how you can't trust anything on

158
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,920
the internet anymore that is exactly why we sought out ground news as our sponsor ground news is a

159
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,280
news aggregation website and app designed to help you spot the political biases of various news

160
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,920
so for example when i search for x i get okay i get nothing because x is impossible to search for

161
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,080
because it's a bad name but if i search for twitter i see this story with 142 articles about how elan

162
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,320
musk is being sued for firing former executives since ground news tells you who owns each publication

163
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,120
as well as their political lean i can see that all the right-leaning publications kept their

164
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,760
headlines very bare bones while left-leaning sites point out that this is one of a pile of lawsuits

165
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,560
or even give additional context like musk posting a cry laughing emoji as he is wants to do because

166
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,120
he's so not mad you see how this comes in really handy for not just analyzing the various ways

167
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,800
the publications cover a story but knowing who you can and can't trust for your news you can check

168
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,360
all this out over at ground dot news slash smn and boy this will be really useful this year you

169
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,960

170
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,400
elections page that includes a blind spot section showing you which stories are and aren't being

171
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:26,320
covered by who or whom or even who am so again check them out at ground dot news slash smn you

175
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,680
days even the president so i figured i'd use my coolness to talk about blue land and listen

176
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,200
whenever we do ads we're required to hit certain talking points but before i do that

177
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,120
i just want to go ahead and say that this is a product i actually really like and use i should

178
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,640
probably explain that blue land makes cleaning supplies designed to reduce our plastic use remember

179
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,480
when we did a whole episode about plastic waste we toss out like five billion plastic cleaning

180
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,880
bottles a year with blue land you use the same bottle and they send you cleaning tablets that you

181
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,680
just you plop in with water like this it smells so good don't eat it though but it smells so good

182
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,720

183
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:52,480

184
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,400
really great variety of sense blue land is trusted in over one million homes including mine seriously

185
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,560

198
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,640
not a care in the world doing great american dream we were discussing or rather i was

199
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,760
discussing to the camera how modern technology and social media have made it easier than ever

200
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,360
to scam or grift people often just using old scams nfts for example nfts are essentially a modern

201
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:02,240
tulip mania tulip mania being a period in 1600s holland when dutch people got real horny for

202
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,800
tulip bulbs and started speculating on tulip bulbs it was considered a gamble given that you didn't

203
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,720
know exactly how fancy the beautiful tulip would turn out to be exactly like how people speculated

204
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,840
on the just absolutely hideous one-of-a-kind drawings of apes they're so ugly why would you

205
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:29,360
make them so ugly then tulip prices crashed and holland plunged into chaos exactly like mad max

206
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,160
but a lot more wooden clog sound effects or rather a minor inconvenience as the premise of tulip

207
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:44,800
mania was apparently overblown like me so sick of getting blown am i right no buddy agrees with me

208
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:52,240
nobody okay well i'm tired of it point is that nfts took something like a fad craze beanie babies

209
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,280
etc and just digitized it which in turn made it even easier to do which when you stand back

210
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,680
isn't a surprise the internet didn't change human behavior right it just made human behavior

211
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:14,240
more streamlined for better or worse at least that's assuming the internet is a collection of humans

212
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,240
which it seems to not be that thing that it is not seemingly if you can recall no not that kind

213
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,560
of recall i mean if you can remember elon musk purchased twitter under the promise that he would

214
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:37,120
combat the flood of bots it was his whole thing specifically that his new policies were quote

215
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:46,960
the only way to do this back in 2022 charging money for twitter blue was the only way to combat bots

216
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,960
then he decided that blue accounts would be the only accounts to show up in the main page and in

217
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,720
fact would have weighted influence on the algorithm and would receive priority in replies

218
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:10,240
because of bots then the bots were defeated right oh weird so in 2023 twitter began teasing

219
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,680
that they would charge everyone an annual subscription to use twitter in order to defeat the bots

220
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,160
huh i thought the only way to defeat them already happened with twitter blue

221
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,200
and then just this year elon confirmed that they will be charging new users money to tweet because

222
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:41,600
that is quote the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots oh very strange how the only

223
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,560
way to combat bots is also coincidentally requiring everyone to give elon musk money

224
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,560
after he purchased twitter on a dare he issued to himself and put the company into massive debt

225
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,920
and then fired everyone responsible for regulating things like bots and i don't know if you need to

226
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:11,200
be told this but it didn't work twitter blue didn't get rid of bots it actually made the bots worse

227
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,920
because the bots just started getting verified and gained better visibility over real users

228
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,400
while these are problems plaguing the entire internet twitter is uniquely completely in a

229
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,920
way that perfectly encapsulates the growing scam issue business genius elon musk has somehow

230
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,880
rebuilt twitter to seemingly accommodate scammers and only scammers while claiming to do the opposite

231
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,440
it's almost like he's a self-sabotaging idiot or something uh don't advertise you don't want

232
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,120
them to advertise no go f*** yourself aww you first little guy so x bots how bad is the problem

233
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,800
it's actually hard to know given that musk ended free access to its api the programming interface

234
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,080
of twitter that's right did you know that twitter is actually less accessible and even more into

235
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,040
censorship now it's almost as if musk did the complete opposite of all the stuff he said he

236
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,640
was going to fix and is actually just a liar so while he made a big deal over his open source

237
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,520
algorithm he ironically did not make the site more transparent apparently all he did was release

238
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,520
a bit of the source code for the for you algorithm but according to a former twitter employee the

239
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,200
model that drives the most important part of the algorithm has not been open sourced so the most

240
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,200
important part of the algorithm is still inscrutable basically it would be like releasing your grandma's

241
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,600
chocolate chip cookie recipe that just says mix dough add chocolate chips also there's a bunch of

242
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,320
random like nazi doodles scroll to the bottom so typical recipe from grandma despite this challenge

243
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,360
some researchers are paying the fees for api access or using other methods to investigate the

244
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,680
state of twitter check a cyber security firm examined traffic driven to its client's websites from

245
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:11,520
x during the 2024 super bowl and found that roughly 75 percent of it was bots this is compared to a

246
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:18,160
rate of under three percent fake traffic from sites like tiktok instagram and facebook this is a

247
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,920
huge jump even compared to twitter during last year which was only pumping out a little under

248
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:32,400
three percent fake traffic to websites three percent bots up to seventy f***ing five in just a year

249
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,640
and this isn't just for big events during the month of january 2024 check found a rate of around

250
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,840
30 fake traffic from x to its client's websites compared to a one to three percent rate from

251
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:54,800
instagram facebook and tiktok but hey the numbers are up and that's all that matters i guess the

252
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:01,200
official x business account bragged about the large traffic seen on x during the super bowl

253
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,840
never mind the possibility a huge percentage of that was fake personally i see no problem

254
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,440
falsely inflating traffic or view counts to convince websites to use your social media program

255
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,920
it's not like i or anyone i personally know has ever experienced any negative consequences to say

256
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,640
a social media platform shamelessly lying about the kind of traffic it can generate

257
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,240
and what kind of media to invest in okay wombo's gonna pause here because this is obviously a jab

258
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,160
against wombo and the time wombo built the platform and everyone accused wombo of lying about the

259
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,640
traffic on the platform that wombo built but wombo wasn't lying and the platform really was

260
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,480
covered in spiders and worms but they all scattered away before mr cody i invited him over to see the

261
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,200
platform in this bathroom but then the spiders and worms called away so mr cody is clearly still

262
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,800
just mad at wombo for that okay let's keep watching so at this point you may realize that twitter the

263
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:05,120
company is now a big scam right it's using bots to boost its traffic sometimes in depressing ways

264
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,120
so that advertisers will presumably want to come back then at the same time telling users

265
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,320
that the only way to defeat these bots is to pay them money you have to pay money to fix the problem

266
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,760
they caused and also pay money to get in on the scam you pay them and you supposedly get paid

267
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,720
through engagement which just encourages more and more scammy behavior but like most scams

268
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,400
it's unsustainable because it's not like we can't tell right it's not like we haven't seen the infamous

269
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,360
pussy in bio posts under every f***ing tweet which just so you know does not lead to any pussy okay

270
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,720
not one ounce of pussy to be had from that bio a um brave writer for intelligentser

271
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,560
clicked through these bio pussy links for purely journalistic purposes and found that they just

272
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,640
ping you around scam sites before sending you to some kind of imitation only fans it's exactly

273
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,560
what you expect from any of those doctors hate this one trick spam links you see at the bottom of

274
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:18,160
websites but now it's under all your tweets and make no mistake all of these bots are causing

275
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:25,760
twitter to bleed users real users it's using their actual humans are being lost here okay

276
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,680
as opposed to the bots inflating their numbers those are staying there more of the bots

277
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,920
fewer humans is the point this includes journalists being increasingly drowned out by fake news

278
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,400
and so what is left when you take away all the humans is a site completely occupied by scam

279
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,960
bots and content aggregators all talking to each other we haven't really talked about content

280
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:57,360
aggregators like culture crave historic vids vizagrad 24 censored men spectator index etc these

281
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,640
accounts are all verified offering them access to x premium which means they can in theory get

282
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,200
money for engagement and the best way to do that it seems is to post something stupid or obviously

283
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,800
wrong that a bunch of people will jump in to respond to things like favorite spongebob clips

284
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,400
i'll start or let's not forget one of the most savage moments in interview history you know

285
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:31,040
slop thanks for the threat of family guy clips historic vids oftentimes this comes in the form

286
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:38,160
of big quotes news aggregators like spectator index vizagrad or individuals like colin rug or

287
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,600
jackson hinkle colin rug for example is a conservative commentator who will repost videos

288
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:50,080
with a reactionary angle writing new as if they're breaking news these news aggregators post

289
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,520
rapidly throughout the day with alarming headlines designed to get your attention sometimes they'll

290
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:02,400
just vague post a story other times it's just pure lies an analysis found that after the october

291
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:10,800
seventh attack in israel 75 of fake or inaccurate viral content was from blue check users incentivized

292
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:17,440
to gain engagement because apparently war and genocide disinformation profiteering is good

293
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:26,400
business on x and being boosted by the algorithm while it's not always sinister it's definitely

294
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,840
anti news for example the verified 2.8 million follower account spectator index will tweet out

295
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,360
breaking followed by a one or two sentence statement presumably about something in the news

296
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,760
with no link to any source or context even if it's not false information there's no context so

297
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,920
there are posts like breaking canada has withdrawn 41 diplomats from india but no links to further

298
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:58,640
context no information about why who knows maybe canada's at war with india should we all panic

299
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,360
well the diplomatic break was due to the murder of a Sikh separatist in canada that the canadian

300
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,360
government believed might have been linked to indian agents which hey is interesting context

301
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,040
it informs you about the world and international relations but that kind of news doesn't keep

302
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,120
people interested i guess and of course these posts will get a bunch of blue check replies as if it

303
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,920
has actual worth oftentimes from the owner of the site itself provided it's something racist of course

304
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,240
wowee two exclamation points he must feel very strongly about that completely made up fact said

305
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,720
by a random faceless account but don't worry elon just said he's gonna crack down on engagement

306
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,960
farming which i'm sure he'll do just as well as he's done all the other stuff i mean it kind of

307
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,880
goes without saying that as evidenced by literally the last elon tweet i showed you one of the biggest

308
00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:00,080
dupes for engagement bait is elon musk himself so it kind of makes you wonder what he thinks

309
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,080
engagement farming is him saying he's gonna crack down on engagement farming is like tony

310
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,160
montana running an anger management support group after all musk punishes people for posting links

311
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,080
to certain websites by throttling them and devalues posts with links in them in the algorithm that is

312
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,720
seemingly meant to encourage engagement bait right and whatever musk comes up with it certainly

313
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,640
won't involve hiring actual humans he'll probably charge people per letter written or have grok

314
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,280
moderate you know grok that's the non woke but totally woke ai that musk reportedly wants to

315
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,600
help users write their tweets you know to guarantee that even human made writing will be s***y and

316
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,160
conform to every other tweet it's just bots on bots on bots bots working behind the scenes to

317
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,640
fight other bots talking to other bots we don't usually share anecdotal sources but literally

318
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:04,000
a few weeks ago our head writer got a dmca notice saying that one of his tweets violated a copyright

319
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,400
but the notice didn't provide which tweet they were talking about after filling out a dmca counter

320
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,320
asking them to provide the tweet in question he got an automated response telling him to

321
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:24,240
fill out a dmca counter notice to repeat twitter's response to the counter notice was telling him

322
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,920
to fill out the counter notice they were responding to and when he replied to that email they just

323
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,360
reset the automated response again and when he tweeted about his experience he was instantly

324
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,280
slammed with bots telling him to click on scam links to fix the problem so it's just one big

325
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,880
bot hellscape where actual humans are slowly pushed out in the name of bots gaming algorithms made

326
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,720
by other bots monitored by bots to save overhead costs just whittling it all down for maximum

327
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,080
profit until it's just corporations paying each other for nothing until the whole thing breaks

328
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,080
and there's of course a name for this it's called the dead internet and after the break we're gonna

329
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,200
talk about this theory and how it relates not just to x the everything app but the rest of social

330
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:19,280
media the everything else app stay tuned assuming that you are in fact a human okay listen up everyone

331
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:27,520
settle down settle down find your seats hi i'm katie you know memorial day is coming up a day where

hello

361
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,040
so where were we oh yes warmbo's watching mr. kody's lies let's keep watching hope you like

362
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,920
those ads because they are the last ads you're ever gonna get for this episode speaking of ads

363
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,360
and death before the break we were detailing how twitter is slowly flooding with bots as actual

364
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,880
humans vacate the website and how the end result will just be a bunch of automated accounts spamming

365
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,640
each other in an endless feedback loop you may know it as in-shittification as coined by kory

366
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,240
doctoro or perhaps this is actually similar to something called the dead internet theory which

367
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,200
is a conspiracy theory that speculates that most of the internet is actually bots for the record

368
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,320
that's not the entire theory people also claim that this is done purposefully by the government to

369
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,720
gaslight the world or what have you but of course it seems more likely that the mass amount of bots

370
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,240
and ai aren't some grand government or corporate conspiracy but just the result of how the internet

371
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,680
is structured right now in terms of how money is made not to mention how short-sighted corporations

372
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,400
are when it comes to profit and while i do not think the internet is all secretly bots i do think

373
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,160
that certain social media sites will become that as they die out it's the same way you see broken

374
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,320
images on old websites for example this official k-packs movie fan site that links to a broken

375
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,760
flash version but still offers the trailer and a very helpful synopsis that i'm sure the creator

376
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,360
will update when his other gig doing a youtube show dies out that's basically the future for sites

377
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,520
like twitter as people inevitably move on and they will move on even if the site didn't suck

378
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,000
something new will come along leaving these weird wastelands of bots wandering around sharing memes

379
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
with the exception of the one surviving human elon musk can you picture it elon musk endlessly

380
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,920
scrolling on his empty site posting wow in all caps to a meme of george soros photoshopped his

381
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,440
magneto and that is the optimistic view cyber security firm imperva claims that nearly half

382
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,160
of all internet traffic was bots in 2022 which may be driven by the advance in ai technology

383
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,840
making it easier to craft bot dialogues and fake images to give the veneer of authenticity

384
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,360
to fake accounts and as that number goes up i don't think the money people are going to notice

385
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,880
or care about the difference until it's too late and thanks to the fact that google is being paid

386
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,400
to redirect people to the highest bidder it might be really hard for another new site to actually

387
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,160
thrive and even if it does it'll likely just start chasing the same business model as these

388
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,160
other sites i mean have you noticed that instagram looks more and more like tiktok these days

389
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,880
twitter is hilariously also trying to copy this sweatily claiming that their text-based site is

390
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:22,480
actually for video go ahead elon pivot to video i f***ing dare you so if the government shuts down

391
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,560
tiktok which it's on track to do everyone will just flock to another clone and then eventually

392
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,400
people will get sick of that and leave it's already starting a survey by technology consulting

393
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,560
firm gartner found that a little over 53 percent of consumers polled thought the quality of social

394
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:49,920
media has decayed due to bots misinformation and toxicity and another 2023 survey by morning consult

395
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,920
found that three in ten social media users have cut back in posting and eventually all these inflated

396
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,760
numbers will collapse under the weight of the hollow bots propping them up and this entire

397
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,840
business model will fall apart and perhaps even the internet itself will stop making money and

398
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:19,520
implode and you know what i hope it does see this is normally the part of the episode where i talk

399
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,960
about how to fix the problem we've discussed i like to think of myself as a pretty optimistic person

400
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,760
shut up shut up i will kill you i will kill your whole family sorry i like to think of myself

401
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,240
as optimistic but in this case and only this case i think we should let it all break at

402
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,200
least when it comes to social media because frankly it's already broken navigating social

403
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,320
media and scams and misinformation is becoming so difficult that we're now seeing schools mandate

404
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,520
classes on it like it's sex education like instead of just changing it with regulations

405
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,760
we're teaching kids how to survive and endure it well that's just what we do here i guess in

406
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,000
america oh god everyone has to be their own little paranoid secret spy agent constantly

407
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,880
weeding out the lies from the truth we're all sarah connor looking out for terminators that

408
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,080
wasn't something we had to do before and it's weird we aren't more pissed off about it so yeah

409
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,360
this tear it down and yeah it's risky to want that specifically if you're me one of the many

410
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,000
people i know who make their living on the internet but who knows how long that will even remain

411
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,040
possible it seems like the only way to make a living especially if you are just starting out

412
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,040
is to become one of these engagement bait grifters carnival barking on virtual streets posting so

413
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,320
robots can argue with each other in the comments here's an article about chris hemsworth being

414
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,680
unhappy with his thor four performance so all right whatever an article here are some totally not

415
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,960
bot replies and you can tell they're not bots because they're subscribed to twitter blue x premium

416
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:00,800
one guy says love the way he played a role he loves his profession then that same person says

417
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:07,520
the best movies ever in which he is acting excellent point someone else replied can't either

418
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:15,040
that same person also replied totally agreed that same person then replied chris

419
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:23,440
yes we love the internet folks the other day i saw an ad for ai that will ai its way into determining

420
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,080
popular types of products and trending topics then ai will use those to make the virtual

421
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:38,800
products and a virtual storefront and ai will run it for you it's nothing robots selling robots to

422
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,400
robots so they can buy crap from robots it's just four giant companies and then a bunch of

423
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,840
people fighting for scraps under their watchful eye now and that cannot continue and yeah by

424
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,720
extension i'm also implying that capitalism itself needs to break i guess but that's another

425
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,120
discussion perhaps for the fight club i go to every week i was supposed to tell you about that

426
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:09,920
look i'm not saying we abolish the internet in fact i'm saying the opposite that before social

427
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,320
media the internet was actual people making actual things for other actual people even

428
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,800
if that thing was just captain Picard on a techno loop that was objectively better right we should

429
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:31,280
want that right but for that to happen social media sites need to die that bubble needs to burst

430
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,000
social media the concept should probably die and people like i don't know communicate in real

431
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,280
life for a little while you know maybe join a forum burn it down is my point burn it all down

432
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,680
and then in the rubble perhaps we can build back better jack okay looks like that's the end of

433
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,600
Mr. Cody's Cody show some more mr. Cody did you notice his jab at wombo at the end by quoting

434
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,440
mr. Biden who wombo used to like until mr. Cody told wombo that mr. Biden was bad anyway this is

435
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,200
why wombo has been looking at mr rfk because he has a lot of interesting things to say actually

436
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,680
lots of very compelling people that mr. Cody kept from wombo like um mr. Andrew Tate and mr. Joe
