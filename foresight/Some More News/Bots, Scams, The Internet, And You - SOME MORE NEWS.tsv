0	8880	What is up Wombos, it's hi, it's Wombo, just set up my new highest def web page camera
8880	11640	and we're going to have a great day watching Wombo.
11640	18920	Be sure to check out WombosX's twitter.x at X's www.twitter.therealwombo, it's all
18920	31120	a word and um Wombo's new twitch account at uh it's www and then www.twitch.t and v and
31120	39640	then slash um Wombo, it's um hi it's Wombo, anyway Wombo is going to play games and watch
39640	44960	things and stuff with you, there's a new some more Mr. Cody out today and since Wombo is
44960	51200	mad at Mr. Cody, Wombo thought we should watch it and make fun of Mr. Cody for being stinky
51200	58000	so let's just click on it.
58000	62800	On Wombo's new gaming laptop, there's Wombo Bot on Wombo's new phone, you can buy things
62800	67640	on your phone actually, if you check out Wombo's twitch, Wombo has a tutorial on how to buy
67640	74000	things on your phone, anyway we've clicked on Mr. Stinky Cody's new video, so let's
74000	76000	watch that.
76000	80720	Greetings Choombas, time to chip into some more news with a Z because it's future times
80720	88800	and we have robots now, no really actual robots, some better than others, anyway here's some
88800	93960	news we don't actually get those robots yet, probably not until the army gets bored doing
93960	103600	wars with them, but until then we do get bots, countless, countless just too many bots AI
103600	111760	to be exact, good AI, not really, evil AI, no wouldn't say that either, I mean Hal had
111760	118440	to be like functional in order to kill everybody, what we have is more like that last 10 seconds
118440	123680	of Hal's life where he slowly loses his mind and just sings a song nobody wanted to hear
123680	129240	and this is all to say that social media sure seems to be patched to the gills with scams,
129240	136320	bots and mediocre AI art, AI recipes and movie trivia, aggregated reddit posts set to Minecraft
136320	142320	parkour, deep fried videos of long dead cats, those countless if only there was a page that
142320	149160	posted blank accounts, robots describing scenes from movies for some reason like as if they're
149160	155040	just things that happened in life, we've discussed how the internet is basically just a handful
155040	161480	of social media sites now and so it's a little concerning that these sites have been slowly
161480	167760	flooded with a bunch of bots and scams and clickbaity accounts, not just on Twitter,
167760	174400	but yes very much on Twitter, but also Instagram and TikTok and I haven't really checked Facebook
174400	181600	in a while but I assume there too and this seems by design and while that sucks for most
181640	187600	people, at least we can rest easy knowing that we are in the golden years for scammy online
187600	190920	freaks and the sometimes billionaire dupes who love them.
190920	192840	Huzzah!
192840	201320	The Growing Internet Scam Economy
201320	207720	So obviously the flim flam profession is a proud and ancient tradition dating to the dawn of
207720	212800	civilization, one of the oldest complaints to the manager was a clay tablet from the 18th
212800	218640	century BC written by a buyer claiming he was scammed, skipped to the early internet and we
218640	224720	had phishing emails that Nigerian Prince scam, boner pills, most of those pills being ineffective,
224720	230440	now we've got AI and complex bot networks and crypto and maybe even little pick pocket
230440	236160	drones, you could give them a boo hats, oh that would be adorable for a while, but while the
236160	241840	tools are advanced the scammy methods are basically the same, also for all you semantics
241840	248160	perverts jerking your words in the way back I'm going to be using the term scam very loosely
248160	253280	when talking about this because I think one of the unique things about the internet is that it
253280	258960	more easily blurs the line between engagement bait, random bots and people straight up trying to
258960	265680	steal your money, not all scams are created equal but they all work on the same fundamental level
265680	270800	in that they are all trying to get your attention using tactics that are either dishonest or
270800	276880	manipulative, for example have you ever been scrolling through Instagram or TikTok when a
276880	283360	video of an absolute mega Karen pops up, you know some lady who is acting in an unbelievably
283360	285360	entitled and enraging way?
313360	321440	Wow, what a freak, absolutely wild that a human being would actually act like that,
321440	326400	it's almost too weird to be true, you can't make this stuff up, oh wait yeah I guess you can,
326400	332000	they literally posted set photos like they were teasing the next Marvel film, see there are of
332000	339040	course plenty of videos of real assholes on social media, which is exactly why these staged videos
339040	344800	are able to thrive, in fact there's an entire fake Karen economy on the internet that makes
344800	351760	real money doing this thanks to how engagement is rewarded, I'd argue a lot of them are obvious,
351760	357840	often the sound or lighting quality is suspiciously good or the dialogue is very forced or robotic
357840	364080	or sometimes you can even find the same people showing up in multiple videos, they aren't hiding
364080	370160	it because they don't need to and they can always claim later that it's satire or a parody,
370160	377200	it's a prank or something even though it's clearly not, so this is one end of the scam
377200	382560	spectrum where what they are doing is clearly dishonest, but I also want to talk about the
382560	388480	other more interesting end of the spectrum, this is the stuff that's engagement bait but I'd argue
388480	397120	less harmful and more just weird, like I don't want to shame anyone or say this is bad, I'm just
397760	399760	concerned
400400	426800	did I just die? am I dead? what's
427200	433920	it okay so you might have seen this going around apparently on tiktok people are pretending to
433920	441920	be an npc or doll or robot or something and basically what people do is pay them in tokens
441920	448640	to get a selected and scripted response and boy there are just so so many
456960	475440	so you either just found that deeply unnerving or maybe you came I don't know you and again
475440	481040	I don't really want to shame this because while this looks and seems weird at first these fake
481040	486880	npc accounts are actually nothing new this has been around for a long time we just know them as
486880	493440	mimes this is just a form of physical art and before tiktok we had streets and on them street
493440	498240	performers doing whatever they could to get your attention one of the most enduring street
498240	504560	performance acts is the living statue aka someone dressed and painted as a statue that stands
504560	510800	remarkably still sometimes for hours the appeal is their commitment to acting as artifice and
510800	517840	they interact with you when you pay them just like the tiktok npcs it's basically the same right
517840	523040	the ability to maintain a performance for so long to interact with the audience where they get to
523040	528560	feel like they're causing the performer to do something and keeping up the act so persistently
528640	534560	and so if you find these npcs haunting I'm guessing it's the same reason you find this haunting
542080	550240	or arousing I'm sure this is all somebody's fetish and those npcs probably tend to be young
550240	556000	women for a reason but my point is that tiktok and instagram essentially function the same way
556000	561280	as the vegas sidewalk it's a bunch of people carnival barking for your attention and ultimately
561280	567440	your money some are doing it honestly and some are doing it dishonestly in fact some of these
567440	572400	people are also trying to lead you to a second location you know how they say you should always
572400	577600	follow a stranger to a second location after all what's the worst that could happen you don't
577680	582000	want to be scared of the unknown do you do we have a clip of the unknown
586400	593920	yeah we have a clip of the unknown boy remember the wonka experience my goodness we were so young
593920	601120	and hopeful then this child entrapment scam used the power of ai to lead dozens of glass cow children
601120	607440	to their deaths of their childlike wonder they were fine the entire scheme from concept to
607440	613520	advertisement to execution seemed to have been made with something similar to chat gpt but in
613520	621600	terms of actual organization the ai fell short of the final product which to be polite failed
621600	627440	to capture the wonder of william wonka's factory from the depressed oompa loompa running the meth
627440	633600	lab to the baron halls to the confused children staring deep into the unknown classic wonka
633600	639120	villain and what's worse these children weren't even given much candy to endure this children will
639120	645280	forgive most things if you have candy ask any murderer ultimately i'm honestly not sure where
645280	652000	the wonka experience falls on the scam spectrum it's like several scams nested in each other
652000	657680	that's now blooming into a meta scam because everyone made fun of it and so now a bunch of
657680	664960	corporations want to get in on the fun and as a result exploit and kill the brief joy we all had
664960	672240	with it can't wait for the willy wonka experience movie in 2025 long after the meme is dead but i
672240	678000	wanted to bring it up because it's a great example of new technology being made to augment old
678000	685520	scams after all you can find countless lists of scam festivals or doomed events similar to this
685520	691920	but this is no doubt the first of many to use ai for false advertising purposes yeah get ready
691920	698000	for that to be a thing and not just from small time scammers that civil war film used ai art for
698000	704080	their posters portraying scenes that are certainly not in the film or anywhere like if you've been
704080	709680	to chicago you'd notice those buildings are in the wrong place nor does los angeles have
709680	716240	giant swans i guess that's supposed to be an echo park swan boat oh look that car has three doors on
716240	722960	one side neat can't wait for this to be the future of advertising okay wombo is just gonna pause the
722960	728640	video right here to say that um mr. kody is wrong here because wombo once saw a car with three doors
728640	734480	on one side when he was a trader joes but then um turned out it only had two doors and wombo was
734480	742640	mistaken but three doors can't exist on cars it's possible so that ai art is actually very accurate
742640	750240	and good wombo has also been making ai art and has gotten very good at the prompts like wombo made
750240	756800	this one with the prompt draw um mr. kody and he smells like dad's milk but wombo is also there
756880	762800	eating soup but also make it twice with only five fingers good art best art museum quality
762800	768880	flesh everywhere skin blood veins fish guts muscular babies six eyes 10 fingers so many
768880	775440	fingers all of the fingers you can fit anime girl for more prompts you can go to my prompt
775440	781760	base page where wombo is selling many prompts that are good and make good things because now that
781760	787200	wombo isn't that mr. kody's wombo needs your support because it's hard to find food because
787200	793680	there were more animal shelters and playgrounds by mr. kody's house okay back to the video and while
793680	799840	ai ads are problematic it's probably the least dangerous place to use it right but it should
799840	807280	be noted that this trend is currently extending beyond ads most shockingly to academic journals
807360	813520	even more shockingly academic journals about giant mutant rat dicks published in the academic
813520	820080	journal frontiers in cell and developmental biology there is a paper called retracted cellular
820080	826320	functions of spermatogonal stem cells in relation to jack stat signaling pathway of course originally
826320	831280	it wasn't called retracted it got called that after it was retracted for the obviously fake
831280	838320	ai rat dick as well as other ai diagrams created by mid journey which somehow made its way past
838320	845760	six reviewers i don't know seems accurate to me sometimes you gotta distill some rats test
845760	852000	them cells oh but there's more other scientific papers are getting published with ai generated
852000	858160	text and while some of these can be hard to detect thankfully even smart people are too dumb to delete
858160	865200	some obvious signs for example this paper still apparently published that actually begins with
865200	872400	certainly here is a possible introduction for your topic very funny very obvious but for every
872400	879680	obvious fake ai paper i'm sure there are tons that go by unnoticed the ability to scam through ai or
879680	886480	social media is just so streamlined and easy that anyone can do it and reach a huge audience
886480	893600	any scam from engagement bait to freaking academic fraud can be done by anyone you don't even need
893600	902880	to know photoshop now and ultimately the result for both is the same hollowness this is all hollow
902880	909920	content from a fake diagram of a rat dick to a fake video of actors pretending to argue it all
909920	916720	stems from a lack of actual substance in exchange for an easy grift it reminds me of reality tv a
916720	923760	little bit early reality tv no doubt tried to capture real things and people and over time they
923760	929680	realized that audiences can't tell the difference between that and actors similarly i feel like
929680	936400	internet content has realized over time that it doesn't have to be authentic or funny or even
936400	943120	well made it just has to trigger people's attention and so over time scams have replaced
943840	951280	really everything on the internet right now everything is a scam google for example is a scam
951280	958320	a recent study has confirmed what we all know that google results have gotten worse because quote
958320	965040	a torrent of low quality content especially for product search keeps drowning any kind of useful
965040	972080	information in search results for example just google the word car in theory that should take
972080	979440	you to a definition of the word perhaps the history of cars a wikipedia article a picture of a car
979440	986240	but what you get instead is a top result for the california association of realtors and then a bunch
986240	992080	of other links trying to sell you cars or car related stuff like a car seat or legos for some
992080	998240	reason i don't know it's probably different for everyone depending on where they live and what
998240	1003440	their past search history is because what you're ultimately googling is which websites were able
1003440	1010880	to scam their way into that search engine optimization game and so a basic search engine is no different
1010880	1017200	than that vegas street again long way from when google was supposed to be a pure search engine
1017200	1024080	with no ads according to this completely unconfirmed photo from reddit so i don't know maybe that's a
1024080	1031200	lie maybe everything's a lie maybe i don't exist i certainly don't feel real but then again i did
1031200	1041360	just smoke a bag of salvia so oh i just lived a life and speaking of reality after the break
1041360	1047520	we're going to talk more about things that don't exist such as bots and the bot ecosystem
1047520	1054240	and how it all got so bad and perhaps we'll check in with elan and his quest to finally get rid of
1054240	1060880	the bots on twitter thank goodness i'm so glad he did that and yes i understand the irony of talking
1060880	1067120	about stuff like a rage bait while doing a video it's angry about the internet that is also about
1067120	1074080	to cut to ads i don't care i feel nothing don't forget to use the promo code cody feels nothing
1075680	1079840	hey there my sleepy beepies i hope you're enjoying the video about how you can't trust anything on
1079840	1085920	the internet anymore that is exactly why we sought out ground news as our sponsor ground news is a
1085920	1091280	news aggregation website and app designed to help you spot the political biases of various news
1092160	1097920	so for example when i search for x i get okay i get nothing because x is impossible to search for
1097920	1104080	because it's a bad name but if i search for twitter i see this story with 142 articles about how elan
1104080	1110320	musk is being sued for firing former executives since ground news tells you who owns each publication
1110320	1115120	as well as their political lean i can see that all the right-leaning publications kept their
1115120	1121760	headlines very bare bones while left-leaning sites point out that this is one of a pile of lawsuits
1121760	1128560	or even give additional context like musk posting a cry laughing emoji as he is wants to do because
1128560	1135120	he's so not mad you see how this comes in really handy for not just analyzing the various ways
1135120	1140800	the publications cover a story but knowing who you can and can't trust for your news you can check
1140800	1147360	all this out over at ground dot news slash smn and boy this will be really useful this year you
1147360	1152960	know because uh that thing and all the other things and specifically ground news has an
1152960	1158400	elections page that includes a blind spot section showing you which stories are and aren't being
1158400	1166320	covered by who or whom or even who am so again check them out at ground dot news slash smn you

1199680	1205200	whenever we do ads we're required to hit certain talking points but before i do that
1205840	1211120	i just want to go ahead and say that this is a product i actually really like and use i should
1211120	1218640	probably explain that blue land makes cleaning supplies designed to reduce our plastic use remember

1355600	1362640	not a care in the world doing great american dream we were discussing or rather i was
1362640	1367760	discussing to the camera how modern technology and social media have made it easier than ever
1367760	1375360	to scam or grift people often just using old scams nfts for example nfts are essentially a modern
1375360	1382240	tulip mania tulip mania being a period in 1600s holland when dutch people got real horny for
1382240	1388800	tulip bulbs and started speculating on tulip bulbs it was considered a gamble given that you didn't
1388800	1394720	know exactly how fancy the beautiful tulip would turn out to be exactly like how people speculated
1394720	1401840	on the just absolutely hideous one-of-a-kind drawings of apes they're so ugly why would you
1401840	1409360	make them so ugly then tulip prices crashed and holland plunged into chaos exactly like mad max
1409440	1416160	but a lot more wooden clog sound effects or rather a minor inconvenience as the premise of tulip
1416160	1424800	mania was apparently overblown like me so sick of getting blown am i right no buddy agrees with me
1424800	1432240	nobody okay well i'm tired of it point is that nfts took something like a fad craze beanie babies
1432240	1439280	etc and just digitized it which in turn made it even easier to do which when you stand back
1439600	1445680	isn't a surprise the internet didn't change human behavior right it just made human behavior
1445680	1454240	more streamlined for better or worse at least that's assuming the internet is a collection of humans
1454240	1462240	which it seems to not be that thing that it is not seemingly if you can recall no not that kind
1462240	1468560	of recall i mean if you can remember elon musk purchased twitter under the promise that he would
1468560	1477120	combat the flood of bots it was his whole thing specifically that his new policies were quote
1477120	1486960	the only way to do this back in 2022 charging money for twitter blue was the only way to combat bots
1486960	1492960	then he decided that blue accounts would be the only accounts to show up in the main page and in
1492960	1498720	fact would have weighted influence on the algorithm and would receive priority in replies
1499600	1510240	because of bots then the bots were defeated right oh weird so in 2023 twitter began teasing
1510240	1517680	that they would charge everyone an annual subscription to use twitter in order to defeat the bots
1517680	1524160	huh i thought the only way to defeat them already happened with twitter blue
1524160	1531200	and then just this year elon confirmed that they will be charging new users money to tweet because
1531200	1541600	that is quote the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots oh very strange how the only
1541600	1548560	way to combat bots is also coincidentally requiring everyone to give elon musk money
1548560	1554560	after he purchased twitter on a dare he issued to himself and put the company into massive debt
1554560	1559920	and then fired everyone responsible for regulating things like bots and i don't know if you need to
1559920	1571200	be told this but it didn't work twitter blue didn't get rid of bots it actually made the bots worse
1571200	1577920	because the bots just started getting verified and gained better visibility over real users
1577920	1584400	while these are problems plaguing the entire internet twitter is uniquely completely in a
1584400	1591920	way that perfectly encapsulates the growing scam issue business genius elon musk has somehow
1591920	1598880	rebuilt twitter to seemingly accommodate scammers and only scammers while claiming to do the opposite
1598880	1605440	it's almost like he's a self-sabotaging idiot or something uh don't advertise you don't want
1605440	1613120	them to advertise no go f*** yourself aww you first little guy so x bots how bad is the problem
1613120	1618800	it's actually hard to know given that musk ended free access to its api the programming interface
1618800	1624080	of twitter that's right did you know that twitter is actually less accessible and even more into
1624080	1629040	censorship now it's almost as if musk did the complete opposite of all the stuff he said he
1629040	1634640	was going to fix and is actually just a liar so while he made a big deal over his open source
1634640	1641520	algorithm he ironically did not make the site more transparent apparently all he did was release
1641520	1647520	a bit of the source code for the for you algorithm but according to a former twitter employee the
1647520	1653200	model that drives the most important part of the algorithm has not been open sourced so the most
1653200	1659200	important part of the algorithm is still inscrutable basically it would be like releasing your grandma's
1659200	1665600	chocolate chip cookie recipe that just says mix dough add chocolate chips also there's a bunch of
1665600	1672320	random like nazi doodles scroll to the bottom so typical recipe from grandma despite this challenge
1672320	1677360	some researchers are paying the fees for api access or using other methods to investigate the
1677440	1683680	state of twitter check a cyber security firm examined traffic driven to its client's websites from
1683680	1691520	x during the 2024 super bowl and found that roughly 75 percent of it was bots this is compared to a
1691520	1698160	rate of under three percent fake traffic from sites like tiktok instagram and facebook this is a
1698160	1703920	huge jump even compared to twitter during last year which was only pumping out a little under
1703920	1712400	three percent fake traffic to websites three percent bots up to seventy f***ing five in just a year
1712400	1718640	and this isn't just for big events during the month of january 2024 check found a rate of around
1718640	1725840	30 fake traffic from x to its client's websites compared to a one to three percent rate from
1725840	1734800	instagram facebook and tiktok but hey the numbers are up and that's all that matters i guess the
1734800	1741200	official x business account bragged about the large traffic seen on x during the super bowl
1741200	1747840	never mind the possibility a huge percentage of that was fake personally i see no problem
1747840	1753440	falsely inflating traffic or view counts to convince websites to use your social media program
1753440	1759920	it's not like i or anyone i personally know has ever experienced any negative consequences to say
1759920	1764640	a social media platform shamelessly lying about the kind of traffic it can generate
1764640	1770240	and what kind of media to invest in okay wombo's gonna pause here because this is obviously a jab
1770240	1774160	against wombo and the time wombo built the platform and everyone accused wombo of lying about the
1774160	1778640	traffic on the platform that wombo built but wombo wasn't lying and the platform really was
1778800	1784480	covered in spiders and worms but they all scattered away before mr cody i invited him over to see the
1784480	1789200	platform in this bathroom but then the spiders and worms called away so mr cody is clearly still
1789200	1796800	just mad at wombo for that okay let's keep watching so at this point you may realize that twitter the
1796800	1805120	company is now a big scam right it's using bots to boost its traffic sometimes in depressing ways
1805120	1811120	so that advertisers will presumably want to come back then at the same time telling users
1811120	1818320	that the only way to defeat these bots is to pay them money you have to pay money to fix the problem
1818320	1825760	they caused and also pay money to get in on the scam you pay them and you supposedly get paid
1825760	1832720	through engagement which just encourages more and more scammy behavior but like most scams
1832720	1838400	it's unsustainable because it's not like we can't tell right it's not like we haven't seen the infamous
1838400	1845360	pussy in bio posts under every f***ing tweet which just so you know does not lead to any pussy okay
1845360	1852720	not one ounce of pussy to be had from that bio a um brave writer for intelligentser
1852720	1858560	clicked through these bio pussy links for purely journalistic purposes and found that they just
1858560	1864640	ping you around scam sites before sending you to some kind of imitation only fans it's exactly
1864640	1870560	what you expect from any of those doctors hate this one trick spam links you see at the bottom of
1870560	1878160	websites but now it's under all your tweets and make no mistake all of these bots are causing
1878160	1885760	twitter to bleed users real users it's using their actual humans are being lost here okay
1885840	1889680	as opposed to the bots inflating their numbers those are staying there more of the bots
1889680	1895920	fewer humans is the point this includes journalists being increasingly drowned out by fake news
1895920	1902400	and so what is left when you take away all the humans is a site completely occupied by scam
1902400	1908960	bots and content aggregators all talking to each other we haven't really talked about content
1908960	1917360	aggregators like culture crave historic vids vizagrad 24 censored men spectator index etc these
1917360	1924640	accounts are all verified offering them access to x premium which means they can in theory get
1924640	1931200	money for engagement and the best way to do that it seems is to post something stupid or obviously
1931200	1936800	wrong that a bunch of people will jump in to respond to things like favorite spongebob clips
1936800	1942400	i'll start or let's not forget one of the most savage moments in interview history you know
1943280	1951040	slop thanks for the threat of family guy clips historic vids oftentimes this comes in the form
1951040	1958160	of big quotes news aggregators like spectator index vizagrad or individuals like colin rug or
1958160	1963600	jackson hinkle colin rug for example is a conservative commentator who will repost videos
1963680	1970080	with a reactionary angle writing new as if they're breaking news these news aggregators post
1970080	1975520	rapidly throughout the day with alarming headlines designed to get your attention sometimes they'll
1975520	1982400	just vague post a story other times it's just pure lies an analysis found that after the october
1982400	1990800	seventh attack in israel 75 of fake or inaccurate viral content was from blue check users incentivized
1990800	1997440	to gain engagement because apparently war and genocide disinformation profiteering is good
1997440	2006400	business on x and being boosted by the algorithm while it's not always sinister it's definitely
2006400	2013840	anti news for example the verified 2.8 million follower account spectator index will tweet out
2013840	2019360	breaking followed by a one or two sentence statement presumably about something in the news
2019440	2025760	with no link to any source or context even if it's not false information there's no context so
2025760	2031920	there are posts like breaking canada has withdrawn 41 diplomats from india but no links to further
2031920	2038640	context no information about why who knows maybe canada's at war with india should we all panic
2038640	2043360	well the diplomatic break was due to the murder of a Sikh separatist in canada that the canadian
2043360	2049360	government believed might have been linked to indian agents which hey is interesting context
2049360	2055040	it informs you about the world and international relations but that kind of news doesn't keep
2055040	2061120	people interested i guess and of course these posts will get a bunch of blue check replies as if it
2061120	2067920	has actual worth oftentimes from the owner of the site itself provided it's something racist of course
2067920	2074240	wowee two exclamation points he must feel very strongly about that completely made up fact said
2074240	2080720	by a random faceless account but don't worry elon just said he's gonna crack down on engagement
2080720	2086960	farming which i'm sure he'll do just as well as he's done all the other stuff i mean it kind of
2086960	2092880	goes without saying that as evidenced by literally the last elon tweet i showed you one of the biggest
2092880	2100080	dupes for engagement bait is elon musk himself so it kind of makes you wonder what he thinks
2100080	2106080	engagement farming is him saying he's gonna crack down on engagement farming is like tony
2106080	2112160	montana running an anger management support group after all musk punishes people for posting links
2112160	2118080	to certain websites by throttling them and devalues posts with links in them in the algorithm that is
2118080	2124720	seemingly meant to encourage engagement bait right and whatever musk comes up with it certainly
2124720	2130640	won't involve hiring actual humans he'll probably charge people per letter written or have grok
2130640	2137280	moderate you know grok that's the non woke but totally woke ai that musk reportedly wants to
2137280	2143600	help users write their tweets you know to guarantee that even human made writing will be s***y and
2143600	2150160	conform to every other tweet it's just bots on bots on bots bots working behind the scenes to
2150160	2156640	fight other bots talking to other bots we don't usually share anecdotal sources but literally
2156640	2164000	a few weeks ago our head writer got a dmca notice saying that one of his tweets violated a copyright
2164000	2170400	but the notice didn't provide which tweet they were talking about after filling out a dmca counter
2170960	2176320	asking them to provide the tweet in question he got an automated response telling him to
2176320	2184240	fill out a dmca counter notice to repeat twitter's response to the counter notice was telling him
2184240	2189920	to fill out the counter notice they were responding to and when he replied to that email they just
2189920	2195360	reset the automated response again and when he tweeted about his experience he was instantly
2195360	2201280	slammed with bots telling him to click on scam links to fix the problem so it's just one big
2201280	2206880	bot hellscape where actual humans are slowly pushed out in the name of bots gaming algorithms made
2206880	2212720	by other bots monitored by bots to save overhead costs just whittling it all down for maximum
2212720	2218080	profit until it's just corporations paying each other for nothing until the whole thing breaks
2218080	2224080	and there's of course a name for this it's called the dead internet and after the break we're gonna
2224080	2229200	talk about this theory and how it relates not just to x the everything app but the rest of social
2229200	2239280	media the everything else app stay tuned assuming that you are in fact a human okay listen up everyone

2477280	2481200	hello
2484720	2491040	so where were we oh yes warmbo's watching mr. kody's lies let's keep watching hope you like
2491040	2495920	those ads because they are the last ads you're ever gonna get for this episode speaking of ads
2495920	2501360	and death before the break we were detailing how twitter is slowly flooding with bots as actual
2501360	2506880	humans vacate the website and how the end result will just be a bunch of automated accounts spamming
2506880	2512640	each other in an endless feedback loop you may know it as in-shittification as coined by kory
2512640	2518240	doctoro or perhaps this is actually similar to something called the dead internet theory which
2518240	2523200	is a conspiracy theory that speculates that most of the internet is actually bots for the record
2523200	2528320	that's not the entire theory people also claim that this is done purposefully by the government to
2528960	2534720	gaslight the world or what have you but of course it seems more likely that the mass amount of bots
2534720	2540240	and ai aren't some grand government or corporate conspiracy but just the result of how the internet
2540240	2545680	is structured right now in terms of how money is made not to mention how short-sighted corporations
2545680	2552400	are when it comes to profit and while i do not think the internet is all secretly bots i do think
2552400	2558160	that certain social media sites will become that as they die out it's the same way you see broken
2558160	2564320	images on old websites for example this official k-packs movie fan site that links to a broken
2564320	2569760	flash version but still offers the trailer and a very helpful synopsis that i'm sure the creator
2569760	2575360	will update when his other gig doing a youtube show dies out that's basically the future for sites
2575360	2581520	like twitter as people inevitably move on and they will move on even if the site didn't suck
2582080	2588000	something new will come along leaving these weird wastelands of bots wandering around sharing memes
2588000	2594000	with the exception of the one surviving human elon musk can you picture it elon musk endlessly
2594000	2599920	scrolling on his empty site posting wow in all caps to a meme of george soros photoshopped his
2599920	2607440	magneto and that is the optimistic view cyber security firm imperva claims that nearly half
2607440	2614160	of all internet traffic was bots in 2022 which may be driven by the advance in ai technology
2614160	2619840	making it easier to craft bot dialogues and fake images to give the veneer of authenticity
2619840	2625360	to fake accounts and as that number goes up i don't think the money people are going to notice
2625360	2630880	or care about the difference until it's too late and thanks to the fact that google is being paid
2630880	2636400	to redirect people to the highest bidder it might be really hard for another new site to actually
2636400	2642160	thrive and even if it does it'll likely just start chasing the same business model as these
2642160	2648160	other sites i mean have you noticed that instagram looks more and more like tiktok these days
2648800	2654880	twitter is hilariously also trying to copy this sweatily claiming that their text-based site is
2654880	2662480	actually for video go ahead elon pivot to video i f***ing dare you so if the government shuts down
2662480	2668560	tiktok which it's on track to do everyone will just flock to another clone and then eventually
2668560	2674400	people will get sick of that and leave it's already starting a survey by technology consulting
2674400	2680560	firm gartner found that a little over 53 percent of consumers polled thought the quality of social
2680560	2689920	media has decayed due to bots misinformation and toxicity and another 2023 survey by morning consult
2689920	2697920	found that three in ten social media users have cut back in posting and eventually all these inflated
2697920	2703760	numbers will collapse under the weight of the hollow bots propping them up and this entire
2703760	2709840	business model will fall apart and perhaps even the internet itself will stop making money and
2709840	2719520	implode and you know what i hope it does see this is normally the part of the episode where i talk
2719520	2724960	about how to fix the problem we've discussed i like to think of myself as a pretty optimistic person
2725040	2731760	shut up shut up i will kill you i will kill your whole family sorry i like to think of myself
2731760	2738240	as optimistic but in this case and only this case i think we should let it all break at
2738240	2743200	least when it comes to social media because frankly it's already broken navigating social
2743200	2748320	media and scams and misinformation is becoming so difficult that we're now seeing schools mandate
2748320	2753520	classes on it like it's sex education like instead of just changing it with regulations
2753520	2757760	we're teaching kids how to survive and endure it well that's just what we do here i guess in
2757760	2764000	america oh god everyone has to be their own little paranoid secret spy agent constantly
2764000	2768880	weeding out the lies from the truth we're all sarah connor looking out for terminators that
2768880	2774080	wasn't something we had to do before and it's weird we aren't more pissed off about it so yeah
2774960	2781360	this tear it down and yeah it's risky to want that specifically if you're me one of the many
2781360	2786000	people i know who make their living on the internet but who knows how long that will even remain
2786000	2791040	possible it seems like the only way to make a living especially if you are just starting out
2791040	2797040	is to become one of these engagement bait grifters carnival barking on virtual streets posting so
2797040	2802320	robots can argue with each other in the comments here's an article about chris hemsworth being
2802320	2807680	unhappy with his thor four performance so all right whatever an article here are some totally not
2807680	2812960	bot replies and you can tell they're not bots because they're subscribed to twitter blue x premium
2812960	2820800	one guy says love the way he played a role he loves his profession then that same person says
2820800	2827520	the best movies ever in which he is acting excellent point someone else replied can't either
2828320	2835040	that same person also replied totally agreed that same person then replied chris
2835440	2843440	yes we love the internet folks the other day i saw an ad for ai that will ai its way into determining
2843440	2850080	popular types of products and trending topics then ai will use those to make the virtual
2850080	2858800	products and a virtual storefront and ai will run it for you it's nothing robots selling robots to
2858800	2864400	robots so they can buy crap from robots it's just four giant companies and then a bunch of
2864400	2869840	people fighting for scraps under their watchful eye now and that cannot continue and yeah by
2869840	2874720	extension i'm also implying that capitalism itself needs to break i guess but that's another
2874720	2881120	discussion perhaps for the fight club i go to every week i was supposed to tell you about that
2881520	2889920	look i'm not saying we abolish the internet in fact i'm saying the opposite that before social
2889920	2896320	media the internet was actual people making actual things for other actual people even
2896320	2902800	if that thing was just captain Picard on a techno loop that was objectively better right we should
2902800	2911280	want that right but for that to happen social media sites need to die that bubble needs to burst
2911280	2916000	social media the concept should probably die and people like i don't know communicate in real
