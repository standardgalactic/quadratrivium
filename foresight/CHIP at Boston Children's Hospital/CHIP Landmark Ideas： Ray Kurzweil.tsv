0	10600	Alright. As folks join the Zoom, I'm going to get started. Welcome everyone to the CHIP
10600	18240	Landmark Ideas series. Today we'll be hearing about rewriting biology with artificial intelligence
18240	25680	for Ray Kurzweil, an inventor and futurist. I'm Ken Mandel. I direct the Computational
25680	31920	Health Informatics program at Boston Children's Hospital. The program was founded in 1994
31920	37560	for a multidisciplinary applied research and education program. To learn more you can
37560	45520	visit www.chip.org. The Landmark Ideas series is an event series featuring thought leaders
45520	57720	across healthcare, informatics, IT, big science, innovation, and more. Dr. Kurzweil is one
57720	66120	of the world's leading inventors, thinkers, and futurists. He creates and predicts using
66120	72560	tools and ideas from the field of pattern recognition. He invented many technologies
72560	79820	familiar to us today, including flatbed scanning, optical character recognition, and text-to-speech
79820	86320	synthesis. He won a Grammy for creating a music synthesizer used by Stevie Wonder that
86320	92920	was capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments. He was awarded
92920	99840	the National Medal of Technology. His best-selling books include the New York Times bestsellers
99840	105320	The Singularity is Near and How to Create a Mind. Larry Page brought Kurzweil into
105320	115520	Google as a principal researcher and AI visionary. I'll just mention one connection to Chip.
115520	122520	Ben Rice, a faculty member, when he was a student at MIT, worked with Ray to develop
122520	130960	a text-to-speech interface for that synthesizer so that Stevie Wonder and other non-sided musicians
130960	139200	could interact with the extensive visual navigation interface. The Singularity is a very important
139200	146040	idea of Dr. Kurzweil. This is the point in time when artificial intelligence will surpass
146040	155760	human intelligence, resulting in rapid technological growth that will fundamentally change civilization.
155760	163520	And in order to understand when machines surpass biology, Ray has delved deeply into an understanding
163520	170600	of biology, and we're immensely looking forward to hearing and learning and joining him in
170600	181000	that understanding today. You've got us all looking forward, and the chat and the Q&A have
181000	189880	lit up. Let me start with one question. You're joining us for the seminar five days after
189880	198480	the release of OpenAI's chat GPT, which astounded many across the world in its ability to synthesize
198480	204840	natural language responses to really complicated questions and assignments. And if you've gotten
204840	211880	to glimpse this technology, could you place it on the Kurzweil map toward the Singularity?
211880	220040	Is this a step forward? Is it a distraction? Is it related in any way?
220040	228640	Large language models occurred three years ago, and they seemed quite compelling. They weren't totally
228640	243320	fully there. You could chat with it, and sometimes it would kind of break down. The amount of new
243400	251360	ideas that are going into large language models has been astounding. And so it's like every other
251360	257920	week there's a new large language model and some new variation that's more and more realistic.
257920	272320	So that's going to continue to happen. And so this is just another issue. I mean, there are some
272360	284200	things I think that aren't quite right with that particular model you mentioned. But people have
284200	290040	actually interacted with these things and some people say they're sentient. I don't actually think
290040	295080	they're sentient yet, but I think they're actually moving in that direction. And that's actually
295080	303120	not a scientific issue. It's actually a philosophical issue as to what you consider sentient or not.
303120	311120	Although it's a very important issue, because I would chat with Marvin Minsky, who is my mentor for
311120	317920	50 years, and he said that sentience is not scientific, so therefore forget it, it's an illusion.
318920	327000	That's not my opinion. If you have a world that had no sentience in it, it may well not exist.
327000	335560	But yes, there was a sizable advance, but there's more to come.
336560	346640	Let me ask a question from Charlotte, please. A philosopher, an AI-informed philosopher.
346640	353680	What do you make of the criticism that there's more to intelligence than brute processing speed and
353680	360000	pattern recognition? That if we want to pass the Turing test, we need to learn more about our own
361000	374440	intelligence evolved. And I'll just paraphrase you in The Singularity is Near, comparing cognition to
374440	381840	chaotic computing models where unpredictable interaction of millions of processes, many of which
381840	389760	contain random and unpredictable elements, provide unexpected and appropriate answers to subtle
389760	400240	questions of recognition. And so in this chaotic computing, how can you address Charlotte's question
401280	411920	about our own intelligence and the path forward AI? It is a good observation,
412080	425840	but chaos and unpredictability can also be simulated in computers. Large language models do that,
425840	434640	because you can't always predict how it's going to answer. And a lot of these models,
434640	439720	you can actually ask the same question multiple times and get different answers. So it depends
439800	447400	on kind of the mood of the large language model at that time. And to make it more realistic,
447400	464560	it does have to take that level into account when it answers. At first, we could ask a question and
464640	469680	give you a paragraph that could answer your question. Now, it can actually give you several
469680	482080	pages. It can't, though, give you a whole novel that can be coherent and answer your question. So
482080	489040	it's not able to do what humans can do. Not many humans can do it, but some humans can write a
489040	495760	whole novel that would answer a question. So that's the answer. It has to actually
497040	508320	cover a large amount of material, have an unpredictable element, but also all be coherent
509120	524000	as one work. And we're seeing that happen gradually. Each new large language model is able
524000	533120	to actually cover a much broader array of material. But it definitely can handle stuff that is not
534080	541360	it's not just giving you a predictable amount of
547120	554640	it's it has a way that is not really totally predictable.
556960	562800	So along those lines, let me pose Jane Bernstein's question, which is what is your definition
562880	563680	of intelligence?
569520	575040	I mean, intelligence is to solve difficult problems
580400	588400	with limitations of resources, including time. So you can't take, you know, a million years to solve
588400	600000	a problem. If you can solve it quickly, then you're showing intelligence. And that's why
600000	603520	somebody who's more intelligent might be able to solve problems more quickly.
606480	613520	But we're seeing that in area after area. I mean, Alpha Fold, for example, can actually do things
613520	623920	that humans can't do very quickly or to play something like Go. It goes way beyond what humans
623920	632560	can do. In fact, Lisa Dahl, who's the best human player in Go in the world, says he's not going
632560	639920	to play Go anymore because machines can play it so much better than he can. But that's actually
640000	643200	not my view that it's going to replace us. I think we're going to actually make ourselves
643200	652480	smarter by merging with it, as I said. So I'll ask a question from Sharon Weinstock,
652480	659840	with AI taking over physical and intellectual achievements and individuals living longer.
659840	666160	Do you have thoughts on society and whether individuals risk lacking a purpose?
670240	672240	Well, it's good to hear from you, Sharon.
677920	685840	That's the whole point of our merging with intelligence. I mean, if AI with something
685840	695200	separate from us, it's definitely going to do everything that go way beyond what humans can do.
695920	703520	So we really have to merge with them to make ourselves smarter. But that's why we create these
703520	713360	things. I mean, we're separate from other animals and that we can think of a solution
714240	723280	implemented and then make ourselves better. So if you take what human beings were doing
724000	734800	for work 200 years ago, 80% had to do with creating food. That's now down to 2%.
736560	740560	And so if I were to say, oh, well, you know, all these jobs are going to go away
740560	745360	and machines are going to do them, people say, oh, well, there's nothing for us to do.
746240	753040	But actually, the percentage of people that are employed has gone way up.
754080	757520	The amount of money that we're making per hour has gone way up.
760320	765760	And they say, well, okay, but what are we going to be doing? I said, well, you're going to be doing
765760	771440	IT engineering and protein folding. And no one would have any idea what we're talking about,
772320	777600	because those ideas didn't exist. So we're going to make ourselves smarter.
778800	785680	That's why we create these capabilities. And so it's not going to be us versus AI.
785680	791840	AI is going to go inside of us and make us much smarter than we were before.
793200	799040	So yes, I think if we did not do that, then it would be very difficult to know what you and
799040	802240	beings would be doing, because machines would be doing everything better.
804000	807120	But we're going to be doing it because the AI is going to work through us.
810560	816720	Ronald Wilkinson has a question that relates to your idea of whether it's a dystopian
818560	827040	society or other. But really more specific, he says that he would expect people with various
827040	833440	political and or personal agendas to harness the increasing power of AI for their own purposes.
833440	840080	It will not necessarily be to the long-term benefit of humankind as a whole. So how does this balance
840080	846880	out? Could you go through that again? I don't quite understand. Individuals
847600	855120	with political and personal agendas may use AI for purposes that are not
856800	862000	beneficial to mankind. How does that balance out?
863520	871440	Well, I mean, every new technology has positive and negative aspects. The railroad did tremendous
872160	881680	destruction, but it also benefited society. So it's not that technology is always positive,
882560	888080	social networks. I mean, there's certainly a lot of commentary as to how it is negative,
889040	895760	and that's true. But no one actually would want to do completely without social networks.
896720	911200	And I make the case that we're actually using technology and measuring the kinds of things
911200	922560	that we associate with positive social benefit is actually increasing as the technology gets
922560	928880	better. And that's actually not known. I mean, if you ask a poll as to whether these things are
928880	933360	getting better or worse, people will say they're getting worse, whereas they're actually getting
933360	941680	better. But it's not that everything is positive. I mean, there are negative aspects of it,
941680	946080	and that's why we need to keep working on how we use these technologies.
947040	957520	Here's a question from Mark. The singularity is near. In that book, you speculated that the risk
957520	963760	of bioterrorism, engineering of viruses will become an existential threat.
965040	970400	Since then, do you think this risk to humanity has increased or decreased?
976800	986640	I don't think it's increased. I mean, I have a chapter in singularity is near,
986640	995920	and there's also another one in singularity is nearer on risks. And all of these technologies
996880	1000080	have risks, and they could also do us in.
1005120	1014960	And I don't think the likelihood of that has increased, but I remain optimistic.
1016160	1019360	And if you look at the actual history of how we use technology,
1019600	1028320	you could point to various things that should have gone wrong. Like every single job that
1028320	1038560	we had in 1900, a year ago, a century ago, is gone, and yet we're still working and making
1038560	1050800	actually more money. So the way we've used technology has been very beneficial to you
1050800	1059360	in being so far. From Greganus Ova, one of our faculty, Professor at Harvard Medical School,
1060080	1067440	AI comes with large energy resource demands and rare mineral material needs to build the hardware.
1067440	1071840	How do you see these international global tensions, especially the interaction
1071840	1079040	pervasive AI and the climate? I mean, computers don't use that much energy.
1082720	1089600	In fact, that's the least of our energy needs. And that's a whole other issue we didn't get into,
1089600	1102240	but the creation of renewable energy sources is on an exponential, a very good chart that shows
1103520	1108960	all of the renewable energies, and it's on an exponential. And if you follow that out,
1110000	1114880	we'll be able to provide all of our energy needs on a renewable basis in 10 years.
1115520	1129440	And at that point, we'll be using one part out of 5,000 parts of the sunlight that hits the earth.
1129440	1137840	So we have plenty of headroom in that. So we'll actually be able to deal with climate change
1138320	1149360	through renewable sources. But in terms of what we're using, computers are not that expensive.
1152880	1160720	From Tim Miller, will the singularity lead to a decrease in class conflict? Much of the gain
1160720	1165760	in productivity and wealth in the last 50 years has been concentrated in the 1 percent
1166560	1172720	as inflation adjusted earnings in the working class have stagnated. Are you concerned about
1172720	1181520	gains in productivity due to AI being unevenly distributed? And Don Goldman similarly comes in
1181520	1190880	with this related question about inequities that, for example, we saw exacerbated during the COVID
1190880	1201280	pandemic. I mean, my observation is that more and more people from more and more backgrounds are
1201280	1210560	participating, which didn't used to third world countries like in Africa, South America, and so on
1211680	1219600	did not participate to the same extent, whereas they are participating far more dramatically today.
1220960	1230240	Countries that were really under the weather in terms of being able to participate in these types
1230240	1244800	of advances are now participating to very smart, very large extent. So I mean, that's my view.
1245520	1252640	Question from Bill Akava, one of our faculty. A machine can easily beat the best human player
1252640	1258000	at computer chess, but even a young child can move pieces on the physical board better than
1258000	1264320	any general purpose robot can. Do you imagine embodied machines will ever pass a physical
1264320	1267520	Turing test in the real physical world? And if so, when?
1267520	1277440	Yeah, we're making less progress with robotic machines, but that's also coming along.
1278320	1284480	And it can also use the same type of machine learning. And we're going to see, I think,
1284480	1289440	tremendous amount of advances in robotics over the next 10 years.
1289760	1298400	And for a science fiction a question from Ju Chang, how do you envision society once
1298400	1304880	individual brains can interface with a cloud? Will individuality still exist? It seems you
1304880	1309760	imagine human intelligence coalescing into a singular consciousness.
1312320	1316560	Yes, definitely. I mean, that's one of the requirements of being able to connect to the
1316560	1323200	cloud is that this is your portion of the cloud and other people can't access it.
1324240	1332080	And we're actually doing very well on that. And all of our phones connect to the cloud,
1332960	1337680	and we don't see people complain that other people are getting access to it.
1339600	1345120	So we're actually doing pretty well on that. But definitely you'll be able to maintain your own
1346880	1352400	level of personality and differences.
1356240	1359920	And I think we'll actually be more different than we are today,
1361520	1365760	given the kinds of skills that we'll be able to develop.
1366720	1380400	Great. Well, Ray, this has been a spectacular hour we've gotten to spend with you. And I can tell
1380400	1388400	you that in the lead up to it, I was contacted by many of the folks who were on this webinar
1388400	1396240	with us today, very excited to meet a celebrity. They never thought they'd have the opportunity to
1396240	1405360	interact with this closely. So I thank you very kindly. And I also thank you for doing this later
1405360	1414560	in the evening as you're out at Oxford giving, entertaining the students there as well.
1415360	1419520	Yeah, it's been great to interact with you and all of your colleagues. It's been,
1420880	1429440	I've enjoyed it a great deal. Great. Thank you. Let me therefore thank you again,
1429440	1440640	and I'm going to return to the slides for just a moment to remind people of our upcoming talks
1440640	1448080	in the series, including I'll highlight Rich Minor next month inventor of the
1448080	1458640	Android operating system. Also, a Googler who actually resides a lot of the time here in New
1458640	1469920	England. And the blind folks to be sure to reach out to us at CHIC. If you're interested in
1470640	1480800	training, directing, researching, teaching, being in our seminar series. Thank you very much.
1480800	1486960	And we will see you next month.
