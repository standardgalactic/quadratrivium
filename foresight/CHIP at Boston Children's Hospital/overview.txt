1. **Energy Usage of Computers**: The energy used by computers is relatively small compared to the world's total energy consumption. Renewable energy sources are rapidly increasing and could potentially meet all of humanity's energy needs in the next decade, using only a small fraction of the sunlight that hits Earth.

2. **Impact of AI on Class Conflict**: There is a concern that gains in productivity due to AI may be unevenly distributed, with the wealth gap potentially widening as it has over the past 50 years. However, there is also evidence that participation in technological advancements is becoming more widespread globally, including in countries that were traditionally less involved.

3. **Physical Turing Test for Robots**: While computers can easily beat humans at chess, robots struggle with simple tasks like moving pieces on a physical board. However, advancements in robotics are expected to be significant over the next 10 years, potentially passing a physical Turing test.

4. **Human Brains Interfacing with Cloud Computing**: The ability for individual brains to interface with cloud computing does not necessarily mean a loss of individuality. Technological advancements will likely enhance personal differences and skills.

5. **Future Society with Cloud Connectivity**: In a future where human intelligence is interconnected with the cloud, individuality and personality are expected to be more pronounced due to the diverse range of skills and knowledge that individuals can develop.
