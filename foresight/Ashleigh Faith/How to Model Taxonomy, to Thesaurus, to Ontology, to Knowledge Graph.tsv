0	5440	Hey everybody, so today we are going to be walking through the evolution and how do you
5440	14080	model the evolution of a taxonomy to a thesaurus, to an ontology, to a knowledge graph.
14080	19220	And just like with any modeling project, your end use case is your guiding light.
19220	23680	So the decisions I make in this video may not be the same decisions that you make.
23680	28120	And I'm going to walk through why I am making some of those decisions so you can think about
28120	32000	what you need to do when you are going through this same process.
32000	36200	And just like your end use case, you don't necessarily have to get to the end of this
36200	37440	evolutionary stage.
37440	41800	If you don't need to make a knowledge graph, you're perfectly fine with just an ontology
41800	46680	or maybe you're just wanting to make your taxonomy a little bit more robust so that you have
46680	48640	a thesaurus instead.
48640	50200	And why is that useful?
50200	52800	All of those things I am also going to cover in this video.
52800	55640	So if this sounds interesting to you, keep on watching.
55680	61960	All right, so starting out, we need to look at what is the use case, and then we need
61960	66520	to go and look at what data do we need to supply for this use case.
66520	73160	Now you could jump to any one of the models we're going to talk about today in order to
73160	74920	answer this question.
74920	79720	Some are going to be able to answer this question a lot easier than others.
79720	83400	But for the sake of this video, I'm going to be starting with a taxonomy.
83400	90120	So in our scenario, this manufacturer does not have a taxonomy and they really need to
90120	97160	understand which pieces and parts and components go into any one of their vehicles.
97160	98720	So let's start there.
98720	102880	Now each of these models can have a much deeper dive associated with them.
102880	106160	I cannot do all of those in one whole video.
106160	111720	So I have linked every model and corresponding videos that I've done in the past for a deeper
111720	114880	dive in each of them if you want to go and check those out.
114880	122840	In our scenario, we already have tags, let's assume, on the content and or processes or
122840	130240	whatever it is in our, our plants, our manufacturing plants that we can then identify what's going
130240	132080	on in each of those plants.
132080	133720	The problem is those are just tags.
133720	135880	They have no organization to them.
135880	141440	So the very first thing we're going to do is we're thinking about how like-minded things
141440	142880	go together.
142880	153040	Now normally a taxonomy is looking at broader and narrower parent, child or whole part relations.
153040	159200	And so you can see here that passenger vehicles have narrower types, right?
159200	164560	So another relationship here is type of, and these are not explicit relations.
164560	167560	We'll get into that later in other models.
167560	173240	Right now these are more inherent by the hierarchy the taxonomy takes on.
173240	181040	So here passenger vehicles is the broader or parent of a sport vehicle.
181040	186600	And then if we look at the different sports vehicles, there are Mustangs and Raptors because
186600	190400	we're looking at all Ford vehicles in this example.
190400	197200	You can also see in parts how parts is kind of generic, but it is a container of all of
197200	201600	the different parts that would be components in a vehicle.
201600	205680	And you can break this up into whatever makes sense for your organization.
205680	211480	So for instance, if you want mechanical parts versus nuts and bolts, which are not mechanical
211480	214640	in nature, then you can divide them up that way.
214640	218240	You really have to keep your end use in mind while you're doing this.
218240	223920	For us, we really just need to understand which of these vehicles have specific electric
223920	225000	motors in them.
225000	232600	Now you are going to notice there is a heavy emphasis in every model on the metadata and
232600	236560	the relationships that the model is representing.
236560	241380	So these are going to come in handy as we evolve this model into something else.
241380	245880	So right now we do not have additional attributes.
245880	252720	These taxonomy terms may have unique IDs, but other than the hierarchical look to them,
252720	253880	they don't have anything else.
253880	259880	This is just adding context by the placement that they have in the tree structure of a
259880	267120	taxonomy, as well as how these tags are then connected to the end assets, whether it's
267120	269680	a document or an actual component.
269680	270680	All right.
270680	275360	So now we're building on top of stage one.
275360	280640	So everything that we've developed with our taxonomy, the hierarchy, the types of relations
280640	286880	that are inherent from that hierarchy are also going to be helpful with the thesaurus.
286880	289960	So here we're adding more connective tissue.
289960	296720	Every single step in these stages is adding more context, more relations, more of that
296720	302500	metadata to help humans and machines make better decisions based on this data.
302500	308200	So here we are now adding things like use for those are synonyms and those can be synonyms
308200	313040	from different catalogs, different pieces of metadata you're bringing in from different
313040	314040	databases.
314040	317000	It can be the natural language of your end user.
317000	323480	If you're using this taxonomy and thesaurus for search enhancements, you also get things
323480	325040	with see also.
325040	329640	Now that's going to be really important for ontology and knowledge graph building because
329640	335680	see also is a generic form of, oh, hey, there's other things that go along with this that
335680	340120	are not pure hierarchical in nature.
340120	345480	And so those see also are going to be really helpful in later stages in in all of this.
345480	355000	See also is basically looking at how certain clusters of things or branches in your taxonomy
355000	357960	are starting to play with others.
357960	364120	So for instance, if you are looking at a vehicle, well, a logical representation of a vehicle
364120	371880	is all of the different things that go into how that vehicle is constructed, how it goes.
371880	376320	So that could be the motor, it could be the fuel, it could be, you know, how those things
376320	382440	are supplied as in a pumping station or a charging station, if it's an electric vehicle,
382440	385440	think of it almost as composition.
385440	394520	If you are composing a room, what things go into any specific room?
394520	399600	So if you're looking at a living room, it could be a television, it could be a couch,
399600	403440	it could be, you know, wall hangings, it could be speakers.
403440	409320	What are all the things that go together to define a living room?
409320	410320	Same with a vehicle.
410320	415400	What are all of the things that go into defining all of the different aspects of a vehicle?
415400	419160	These are going to be incredibly important when we get to the next stage.
419160	424520	Other things that are represented in a Thesaurus are looking at definitions.
424520	430400	Sometimes you will see things also like scope notes, and that's for human and or computer
430400	438120	automated tagging of specific assets or behaviors, if you're looking at a manufacturing plant.
438120	444640	It's understanding how these things are contextualized in your specific use case and your specific
444640	446200	company.
446200	453320	So the jump from a taxonomy to a Thesaurus is not as large as a Thesaurus to an ontology
453320	456720	or a Thesaurus to an oligarch for that matter.
456720	463400	And a big reason for that is they are representing the world in different ways, where the first
463400	471760	two are points, they are tags on specific assets, and the relation between things is
471760	477840	a little fuzzy if you're talking about a Thesaurus or implicit, which is more on the
477840	479880	hierarchy of a taxonomy.
479880	486560	And ontology is starting to make the connective tissue, the contextualization of how two things
486560	491560	are related and the network of those things way more explicit.
491560	496080	So the very first thing that you're going to want to think about here is what is the
496080	498560	focal point of your model?
498560	501920	So here you can see that I have done this in three different ways.
501920	509120	So our use case today is a catalog of products for the Ford Motor Company.
509120	515620	And so therefore the center of a catalog is the product itself, in this case a vehicle.
515620	522040	But if I am doing an ontology that is focused on the transactional, the purchasing or the
522040	529160	selling or the manufacturing of something, then maybe the VIN number is the center of
529160	535080	my transaction, because that is the thing that is the individual specific thing being
535080	540480	manufactured or sold connected to the customer, because that's the actual transaction that
540480	542360	I am trying to track.
542360	549280	Or if I'm looking at a supply chain, maybe where something is manufactured and what
549280	554080	they are manufacturing is the center of my model.
554080	559900	And identifying this early is really crucial to understand how your model is going to shape
559900	563640	up to answer the questions that you are interested in.
563640	568400	So once you've identified that, you want to look at the universal containers.
568400	570200	That's what ontology is.
570200	575640	It's a framework to house things and how those things are related to one another.
575640	585320	Now a taxonomy is identifying a universal topic or thing that could be an engine.
585320	588360	There is a universal understanding of engine.
588360	591920	But once you get into the lower levels of the taxonomy and thesaurus, where it's talking
591920	598040	about very specific engines, that might not be part of the ontology.
598040	602480	That actually might be an indicator that's part of the knowledge graph portion.
602480	606960	It's talking about a very specific instance of an engine.
606960	615160	So the way that I like to think about this process is the first to third levels of your
615160	624560	taxonomy are usually more of the categorical universal containers of things in your asset
624560	626320	or your catalog.
626320	631040	And so that's a good indicator that maybe start with those first while you're doing
631040	632040	your modeling.
632120	637480	As you go, you're going to refine your understanding and you're going to refine what you had from
637480	643680	the taxonomy at thesaurus stages because honestly, you might not need all of those nodes from
643680	645320	the previous stages.
645320	648480	That's part of this modeling process.
648480	654640	So when you are looking at those universal categories, there's a really great thing in
654640	655640	there.
655640	663920	Your instance data, maybe your sub-sub-subclasses in your taxonomy, are going to be mapped.
663920	667960	They roll up to those broader level categories.
667960	675200	So in a way, you're pre-mapping a ton of your catalog to your ontology, which is a beautiful
675200	682280	thing and that's why doing this as an evolution is a really powerful thing if you can do it.
682280	687280	The next thing you need to think about is the lowest level of universal data that you
687280	689120	need for your use case.
689120	696480	So that could be in our use case, we're trying to identify specific electric motors.
696480	700640	So maybe I only need to go as low as an electric motor.
700640	705960	And by the way, you don't want to create your entire ontology based on only one very unique
705960	712240	specific problem statement, but it is a good place to start, but just don't stop there.
712240	720120	And with an electric vehicle, that is connected to the electric motor.
720120	725200	Maybe that's all the farther I need to go, but if I do need to go even lower and look
725200	730880	at specific types of electric motors, let's say there are different brand names, then
730880	735720	maybe that's the lowest level of data I need to have for the ontology.
735720	740240	So I have a whole nother video going into a deep dive on how to determine something
740240	743400	as a class or an instance, and I will leave that down below.
743400	747600	But a good rule of thumb is to think about it from this perspective.
747600	750400	There is a universal understanding of cat.
750400	758360	It is furry, it has whiskers, it meows, it sits in your lap and it lives in your home.
758360	766440	But my cat Garfield is a different instance of cat than your cat named Otis.
766440	769800	They're both cats, but those are instances of cats.
769800	771480	So think of it from that perspective.
771480	779520	Anything that has to be very unique and is to the cellular level unique, that's probably
779520	784120	an instance and you don't necessarily want that in your ontology.
784120	790640	So once you've determined that, you want to then start to look at those broader and narrower
790640	796880	relationships that you had from previous steps and you want to make them more explicit.
796880	804120	Now you saw that in those previous steps, we did have things like whole part, has part,
804120	808960	that sort of thing, that you can just transfer back over into the ontology.
808960	810760	Those work really well.
810760	814760	But when you're talking about things that are just broader and narrower, you have no
814760	818720	idea what the relationship is between those two things.
818720	824720	So in that case, here you can see that with parts and engines.
824720	829960	In our taxonomy and our thesaurus, they were just nested, right?
829960	832700	The engine was nested underneath parts.
832700	836080	We didn't really know why they related to each other.
836080	837760	Now we're being very explicit.
837760	840920	We're saying it is has part, part of.
840920	848400	And that also allows us to use that specific relation with any other parts that are in
848400	852200	our asset and our catalog data.
852200	857880	This is also your opportunity to craft unique relations.
857880	867160	And those are like manufactured in these are oftentimes business specific, or these also
867160	871800	can be mined from your thesaurus definitions or the assets themselves.
871800	878680	So for instance, if you're looking at a description of a product, what other things in your catalog
878680	880840	are being mentioned in that description?
880840	884800	It's probably a good indicator that they're related in some way.
884800	888160	Now the last thing you're going to be looking at are is twofold.
888160	893840	So first, you are going to add in additional nodes to flesh out that network.
893840	897840	And these are things that are not always found in one table.
897840	900240	So this might be something that you'd have to join together.
900240	904880	So this could be customer data or transactional data in general.
904880	909920	Adding those in fleshes out your network so you don't have to do as many joins, right?
909920	912360	This is the beauty of an ontology.
912360	918760	It makes those relations inherent rather than having you have to depend on others and your
918760	922800	specialized knowledge to make those kinds of relations.
922800	927840	Also which is pretty critical for making sure your machine learning and mapping and matching
927840	934840	projects go smoother is making sure those used for incentives are added in as attributes.
934840	940880	I also just want to note here that some of the nodes that I have in my model, for instance,
940880	947320	the class of vehicle, that could be an attribute on the vehicle node.
947320	950480	I decided to break it out, but that's part of the modeling process.
950480	956480	You have to decide which pieces of information can be descriptors of a node or things that
956480	959200	need to be standalone nodes on their own.
959200	964080	So one thing I want to just point out is you don't necessarily have to have an ontology
964080	965280	to have a knowledge graph.
965280	972080	There are other ways to get to knowledge graph outside of an ontology, but think of the ontology
972080	976240	stage as you are creating that, again, that framework.
976240	983440	It doesn't necessarily have to be a true ontology like an RDF ontology, but it is a representation
983440	988720	of the global entities so that you can then get to the knowledge graph stage where you
988720	995160	are populating the instance or the very specifics of your graph.
995160	998800	Populating your graph can come in a few different forms.
998800	1005480	In this situation, we are going to be taking all of the things that we identified as instance
1005480	1011200	data from our taxonomy and thesaurus, remember it rolled up into the universal classes that
1011200	1018640	we identified, we are going to be able to populate those as instance very quickly.
1018640	1023760	Sometimes you are going to realize that your model is not quite right and that's because
1023760	1031120	the things that in a taxonomy and thesaurus generally rolled up to the same category don't
1031120	1035600	necessarily work the way you want them to work when you get to the knowledge graph space
1035600	1041080	because now when you start to look at the individual entities, there are some exceptions
1041080	1045400	to the rule and sometimes that means you are going to have to split classes and make a
1045400	1049080	subclass, this is part of that refinement stage.
1049080	1053400	So dovetailing into that, you do want to check a subset of the instance data to verify the
1053400	1055920	logic is sound.
1055920	1059760	This is something I like to use a visual for because then you can see if there is some
1059760	1066840	weird circular logic which by the way happens constantly when you take a taxonomy or a thesaurus
1066840	1070360	and you turn it into an ontology or a knowledge graph.
1070360	1078320	Another thing to watch out for sort of in that same vein is looking at the actual definition
1078320	1085000	of these nodes versus how it is applied to the actual assets or behaviors in your systems
1085000	1089440	just making sure that that logic all checks out and that they align with your business
1089440	1097360	needs because I've seen that taxonomies and thesaurus are not necessarily structured to
1097360	1102720	be used in machine learning or knowledge graphs and therefore some of that logic doesn't always
1102720	1107200	check out once you start to morph these and involve these into other forms.
1107200	1109360	So just be aware of that.
1109360	1115200	You also want to add in some inferred hidden relations.
1115200	1118560	You can identify some of these with things like shortest path.
1118560	1126160	It's basically showing how once you really identify a network of things and how they're
1127000	1132120	you can see the dotted line to additional nodes that you did not even know existed and
1132120	1136240	that's a really powerful piece of knowledge graph and you definitely want to add that
1136240	1137920	in if you can.
1137920	1143760	You also want to identify those exceptions and add cardinality and when you're talking
1143760	1148680	about exceptions you do want to watch out for things like adding orphan nodes you want
1148680	1155360	to avoid orphans as much as possible because after a while orphan nodes will start to accumulate
1155360	1160880	and if you're not going back and trying to merge and dedupe because that's normally why
1160880	1165840	those show up is because they're an accidental whoops that's the same thing but we didn't
1165840	1168560	really identify it as such.
1168560	1172760	It will create that storm cloud of data above you that you just do not want.
1172760	1174760	It'll add technical debt.
1174760	1181040	It will add so much more process to any mapping and matching projects that you have.
1182000	1187920	Just definitely try to avoid any of the orphan nodes if possible.
1187920	1192520	Also checking the shape of your knowledge graph.
1192520	1199680	Some of those hidden relations might have to be explicitly defined in order to do certain
1199680	1201880	graph ML.
1201880	1208440	This would be like if you needed a bipartite graph to do certain network analysis that
1208440	1209960	sort of thing.
1209960	1217440	Once you have even a small portion of your graph you can start to predict missing nodes
1217440	1224720	which is interesting because you might have dropped nodes along this evolutionary path.
1224720	1229400	Remember there was the part node that we may or may not have needed that came from the
1229400	1233440	taxonomy and we dropped it maybe in the ontology stage.
1233440	1237560	Well maybe we actually do need that for doing some of the machine learning or maybe you
1237560	1242840	are starting to identify some of the attributes that you made a decision on in the ontology
1242840	1243840	stage.
1243840	1245120	Maybe they actually do need to be nodes.
1245120	1247920	This is a great place to start to identify that.
1247920	1252840	You're also going to start to identify dense clusters of really like-minded things.
1252840	1257280	Things that are highly, highly connected and things that are more on the peripheral.
1257280	1263360	These are really good to also identify gaps or where your catalog is stronger or weaker.
1263360	1265440	You can also identify things like bottlenecks.
1265440	1270760	If you are doing things in the supply chain space where is everything going?
1270760	1274960	If there's one node that's connecting a lot of other nodes that might be a bottleneck.
1274960	1277360	You need to maybe look at that.
1277360	1281960	There's a lot of other data intelligence that you can start to derive once you have this
1281960	1286000	graph in a true network like state.
1286000	1288120	So that is this in summary.
1288440	1290520	It has been a long video.
1290520	1292880	I am sorry for the length.
1292880	1296920	But to get through each of these, I know I even glossed over a lot of things in this.
1296920	1301400	So again, make sure you check down below for some of the links to additional videos to
1301400	1303480	kind of flesh out more of this.
1303480	1306120	But this has been a highly requested video.
1306120	1308040	I really hope that you've enjoyed this.
1308040	1312400	And if there's anything that you have a question about in any of this, please make sure to reach
1312400	1317280	out to me on LinkedIn in my email, which is listed in the description box below, or leave
1317280	1319320	a comment on this video.
1319320	1322560	And so with that, I want to thank you very much and I'll catch you next time.
