1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Between 1990 and 2003, the Human Genome Project sequenced our entire genetic code,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
or as they like to call it, the human blueprint.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,440
During the mid-90s, the hopes for the project were high.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,800
Science journalist Laurie Garrett imagined that by 2020,

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,760
everyone would be carrying around their own little genome cards,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
so if you ever ended up in hospital,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
doctors would be able to swipe your card to see which mutation was causing the problem,

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,560
and you'd then be sent off for gene therapy to be cured.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,680
Easy peasy.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,480
That was the promise of the Human Genome Project,

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,120
but 2020 was now three years ago, and no one's carrying around a genome card.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,640
The harsh reality for the project was that the link between our DNA and who we are

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,120
is way more complicated than we imagined.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
For the vast majority of characteristics that make you, you,

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,880
there just isn't a direct connection between gene and trait.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,520
That seems to go against what we get taught at school,

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
and what we've seen in the media,

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
where it seems as though there's genes for blue eyes,

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,560
genes for red hair, genes for Scottishness.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,880
My DNA comes from Scotland and Ireland.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,240
Genes for sexuality, even genes for dog ownership.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,440
It's all encoded in the programming language of life.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,600
So what's wrong with this picture?

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,080
The father of genetics was Gregor Mendel,

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
an Augustinian friar who also had a keen interest in science.

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,480
Although he initially wanted to become a teacher,

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,160
his highly relatable fear of oral presentations

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,440
caused him to fail the certification exam twice.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,080
With the teaching career seemingly out of grasp,

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,440
he decided to go about conducting his own research in the monastery garden in Burno.

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,600
Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel used over 28,000 pea plants to study plant hybridization,

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
and his results are familiar to anyone who's studied high school genetics today.

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,520
He found that the hybridization of different colored peas,

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,480
as well as other traits, followed regular patterns.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,400
For instance, if a yellow pea plant was crossed to a green pea plant,

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,080
all the offspring would be yellow.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,440
You might remember this from school as yellow being a dominant trait,

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
and green being a recessive one.

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,960
The offspring of these hybrid yellow plants, when crossed to each other,

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,040
would then have a three to one ratio of yellow peas to green ones.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,720
This is the origin of the infamous concept of skipping a generation.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Green was present in the first generation, disappeared in the second,

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
only to reappear in the third.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,400
Another common example of this kind of inheritance is eye color.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
Much like Mendel's peas, brown eyes are dominant to blue ones,

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,560
and using special tables known as punnet squares,

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,080
we can quickly find out that it's possible for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
because they happen to carry hidden or recessive blue genes,

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,280
but it's impossible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
Altogether, Mendel's picture of inheritance, as it was interpreted by his followers,

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,240
gave the following picture of genetics.

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,960
One, genes are tightly linked to traits and act like blueprints.

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,840
If you find a specific gene in your genetic blueprint,

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,160
you know exactly what trait will occur.

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,400
Two, inheritance can be easily tracked using Mendel's laws of inheritance,

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,520
giving us phenomena like the famous three to one ratio.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Three, the impact of the environment is minimal.

58
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,640
Traits can be determined using punnet squares in any environmental context.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,680
But none of those things are actually true.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,800
Not even for a seemingly simple trait like eye color.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,960
For one, eyes can come in all shades of blue, brown, gray, multicolored, two different colors,

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,200
and can even change throughout your lifetime,

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,760
with some babies being born with blue eyes and going on to develop brown eyes.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
Discrete categories like blue and brown

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,240
are actually decided pretty arbitrarily by ignoring all other variation.

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,120
In reality, eye color is the product of many genes acting together,

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,720
not a single gene with two forms that can be modeled with a punnet square.

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,520
As a result, it's entirely possible for blue-eyed parents to have brown-eyed children.

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,960
This fact is not really surprising to geneticists and has been well known for over 100 years,

70
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,440
but it doesn't fail to freak parents out.

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,800
But if Mendel's story doesn't even work for eye color,

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,160
then what is the right way to think about how genes work in humans and other organisms?

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,760
In 1957, Conrad Hall Waddington published The Strategy of the Genes,

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,040
whose key argument can be summarized in these two figures.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Waddington suggests that we should think of genes not in terms of blueprints or punnet squares,

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,760
but as a complex system of pegs and guy ropes that hold up a surface like a circus tent.

77
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,720
The traits that we develop, like blue or brown eyes,

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,000
are then the result of a marble rolling down this complicated landscape into one of the valleys.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
As Waddington himself admits, following this three-dimensional metaphor is tricky,

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,520
so to make things clearer, I've simplified his argument down to something familiar.

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
Here I've built a Steve Mould style 2D version of the Waddington landscape,

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
and it ends up looking like the classic Marble Drop Carnival game,

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,920
where you place a marble at the top and try to aim it into the highest score at the bottom.

84
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,600
In this modified version of Waddington's metaphor,

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
genes are the paddles in the middle,

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,680
and the bins at the bottom are different traits, like different possible eye colors.

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,440
The ball falling then represents the process of development, from single-celled embryo to adult.

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,040
As for the environment, Waddington was a little inconsistent in conceptualizing its role,

89
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,120
but at least in one instance, another figure in the strategy of the genes,

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,480
he uses an arrow to show an environmental stimulus bumping the marble in a particular direction.

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,200
That'll do for us, and we can simulate it with a push from this hairdryer.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840
Waddington's landscape gives us quite a few useful insights that are missed by the Mendelian

93
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,200
picture. First and foremost, we can clearly see that every trait has to be the product of many

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,080
genes working together to funnel the marble down a particular path. You can imagine how

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,800
complex this marble run would have to be to determine things like cardiovascular disease,

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
as illustrated beautifully by this figure from the genetics pedagogies project,

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,040
more on them later. Or take the Y chromosome that's often considered to determine the male sex,

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,960
XY chromosomes in your genetic blueprint give a male person, and XX chromosomes give a female.

99
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,240
We can visualize this on Waddington's landscape with this red paddle being the Y chromosome.

100
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,720
When it's there, the marble always goes into the male bin, and when it's not there,

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,480
the marble always goes into the female bin. But from cases like South African runner Castor

102
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,160
Semenya, a woman with XY chromosomes, we already know that this picture is too simple. This is

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,520
because the Y chromosome has to function in concert with many other genes to collectively

104
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,480
determine sex. But if these other genes were altered in some way, or if different amounts

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,720
of hormones are present through development, the landscape could shift in complex ways to

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,880
get different sexual patternings. So the Y chromosome is hardly the only important factor

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,800
in determining sex. Even without changing the landscape, randomness can also arise naturally

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,640
by the marble happening to fall into a different bin by pure chance. This is partly what happens

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,840
when identical twins who have the same genetics end up with different handedness, different eye

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,600
colors, different neurological conditions like schizophrenia, even different sexes. Of course,

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,560
differing environments also play a role in generating variation between identical twins too.

112
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,600
But either way, we can now see why it's misleading to call the Y chromosome, or specifically

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,760
SY, the gene for maleness. It can certainly make a big difference in how genetic characteristics

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,440
are determined, but it can't act alone, and it doesn't guarantee anything. Really, we shouldn't

115
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,560
talk about genes for anything, because the structure of all traits looks similar to sex.

116
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,200
They're the product of complex networks of genes acting together with the environment.

117
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,840
Even traits that are supposedly under the control of a single gene, like cystic fibrosis,

118
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,600
PKD, and Huntington's disease, can be modified in their severity by several other genes and

119
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,280
environmental factors, again highlighting the convoluted relationship between gene and trait.

120
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,880
It's a little annoying that Mendelian genetics follows such nice rules, and it would seem as though

121
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,480
Waddington's landscape lacks the mathematical niceties of genotype ratios and punnett squares.

122
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,280
But in the past few years, this has begun to change, with the landscape moving from being

123
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,880
a mere metaphor to inspiring mathematically rigorous models that describe real developmental

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,080
patterns. This has also been helped along by the development of new technologies, particularly those

125
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,120
that allow us to study the gene expression of individual cells. For instance, James DeFrisco

126
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
and Yogi Yeager have shown that the exact same genes in the exact same network of interactions

127
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,440
can actually result in significantly different morphological patterns in flies.

128
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,320
The reason behind this is a little hard to show on my 2D marble run diagram,

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,520
but in Waddington's original figure, this is because the genes, the pegs, can pull with

130
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,400
different tensions on the guy ropes to affect the landscape, where the tensions in the ropes

131
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,360
represent the strengths, timings, and rates of interaction in the gap gene network.

132
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,880
The result of all this pulling of guy ropes are qualitative changes in the genetic landscape.

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
For instance, it's possible for a bi-stable regime, where the marble can only roll down into

134
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,240
two valleys, to turn into a multi-stable one, where more valleys open up for the marble to roll into.

135
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
This opens up the possibility for new traits to emerge in the population.

136
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,280
And visually, we can imagine how loosening the slack in this imaginary guy rope

137
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,480
could turn the landscape on the left into the one on the right.

138
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,040
All of this does leave one big historical question unturned.

139
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,000
How did Mendel end up with such nice results, despite all of this complexity?

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Well, the truth is that Mendel's peas were actually pretty special.

141
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,720
When other biologists tried to replicate Mendel's results, like Raphael Weldon tried to do in 1902,

142
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
their peas looked nothing at all like Mendel's.

143
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,920
Weldon found that pea color actually existed on a spectrum, from yellow to green.

144
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,480
It definitely didn't seem like a binary trait, like we see in today's textbooks or Mendel's

145
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,760
original paper. Weldon wrote in a letter to statistician Carl Pearson, that Mendel must

146
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,760
either be a truly astonishing man, or a black liar. But this is being a little harsh on Mendel,

147
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,480
because remember, he was only directly interested in plant hybridization, not heredity itself.

148
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,880
And to study hybrids, he first had to purify his pea plants to remove any intermediate variation.

149
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
This wasn't easy and took him two years of artificial breeding to get

150
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,080
pure bred lines that maintain their color across generations.

151
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,760
Unknowingly, Mendel was essentially fudging the Waddington landscape of the pea color genes

152
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,840
to the very boring case of a marble going into the same bin every time.

153
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,080
And once he'd done that, the patterns we retrospectively call

154
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,680
Mendel's laws of inheritance do indeed emerge, but only in this very particular context.

155
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,160
To quote Annie Jameson and Greg Radick,

156
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,400
These patterns do arise, but they arise only under special conditions, notably when humans,

157
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,760
like Mendel, have engineered artificially purified lineages into being by deliberately

158
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,760
excluding unwanted variability. It's therefore a pretty big mistake, you could even call it a

159
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,160
misinterpretation of Mendel's experiments to extend his results to the entire biological world

160
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,360
in the wild. I can hear some of you saying, Jake, this is the second video you've done critiquing

161
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,720
models in biology that have been hugely successful. Yes, okay, they have their flaws, but aren't we

162
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,160
supposed to teach students the oversimplified model first? And to that, I'll respond with the resounding

163
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,440
no. This line of thinking is based on the idea that students are these silly little naive souls

164
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,480
that are only ready for the truth once they're grown up. Truth is, students are extremely receptive

165
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,200
to being taught a more accurate and modern genetics curriculum. The genetics pedagogies

166
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,960
project did just that. They created an introductory genetics course that placed the entangled nature

167
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,800
of genes, environments, and organisms front and center and contextualized Mendelian traits as

168
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,560
a rare special case. And compared to students who took the more traditional course, the 28 students

169
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,920
taught the new curriculum, emerged as less believing of genetic determinism and better

170
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,960
prepared to understand the subtleties of modern genetics. Surely the point of a good scientific

171
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,320
education should be to do just that, to teach students modern science, not dwell in outdated

172
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,600
paradigms. Anyone that can understand how a marble run works is capable of understanding how our

173
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,520
genetics actually work. There's no need to lie. Plus, even if we eventually teach students the

174
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,160
modern picture of genetics in later courses, there's a very good chance that students never

175
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,880
get exposed to these subtleties because they never end up taking the more advanced courses.

176
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,520
I'm sure the vast majority of you only got exposed to the Mendel's P-style of genetics at

177
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,480
school, and that was it. With the Mendelian blueprint picture firmly ingrained in the minds

178
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,520
of most students, the public at large is much more prone to believe questionable headlines like

179
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,040
genes determine how young use internet and social media, and scientists find 24 golden

180
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,320
genes that help you get rich. If instead we place better metaphors, like Waddington's landscape,

181
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
in the curriculum from the beginning, these headlines would be quickly dismissed as nonsense.

182
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,280
Hopefully most of you realize that there's something dodgy going on with the claim that

183
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,480
something as complex as income could be determined by a genetics. Not to mention how deterministic

184
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,000
thinking like this can easily move across into talk of good genes and bad genes, and then blaming

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,040
the poor for being poor because of some innate genetic characteristics, and we've mindlessly

186
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,000
just slid into eugenics territory. It's actually Mendel's 200th birthday this year, and it might

187
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
seem like a pretty rotten birthday present to suggest jettisoning his ideas out from the

188
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,200
genetics curriculum. But as Greg Radick points out, if we want to honor Mendel, then let us read

189
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,160
him seriously, which is to say historically, without back projecting the doctrinaire

190
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,200
mentalism that came later. Study Mendel, but let him be a part of his time.
