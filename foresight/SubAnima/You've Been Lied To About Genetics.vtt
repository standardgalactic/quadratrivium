00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Between 1990 and 2003, the Human Genome Project sequenced our entire genetic code,

00:06.160 --> 00:08.720
or as they like to call it, the human blueprint.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.440
During the mid-90s, the hopes for the project were high.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.800
Science journalist Laurie Garrett imagined that by 2020,

00:14.800 --> 00:17.760
everyone would be carrying around their own little genome cards,

00:17.760 --> 00:19.840
so if you ever ended up in hospital,

00:19.840 --> 00:23.840
doctors would be able to swipe your card to see which mutation was causing the problem,

00:23.840 --> 00:26.560
and you'd then be sent off for gene therapy to be cured.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.680
Easy peasy.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.480
That was the promise of the Human Genome Project,

00:30.480 --> 00:35.120
but 2020 was now three years ago, and no one's carrying around a genome card.

00:35.120 --> 00:40.640
The harsh reality for the project was that the link between our DNA and who we are

00:40.640 --> 00:43.120
is way more complicated than we imagined.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.120
For the vast majority of characteristics that make you, you,

00:47.120 --> 00:50.880
there just isn't a direct connection between gene and trait.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.520
That seems to go against what we get taught at school,

00:53.520 --> 00:55.120
and what we've seen in the media,

00:55.120 --> 00:57.920
where it seems as though there's genes for blue eyes,

00:57.920 --> 01:00.560
genes for red hair, genes for Scottishness.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.880
My DNA comes from Scotland and Ireland.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.240
Genes for sexuality, even genes for dog ownership.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.440
It's all encoded in the programming language of life.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.600
So what's wrong with this picture?

01:11.600 --> 01:14.080
The father of genetics was Gregor Mendel,

01:14.080 --> 01:17.840
an Augustinian friar who also had a keen interest in science.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.480
Although he initially wanted to become a teacher,

01:20.480 --> 01:24.160
his highly relatable fear of oral presentations

01:24.160 --> 01:27.440
caused him to fail the certification exam twice.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.080
With the teaching career seemingly out of grasp,

01:30.080 --> 01:35.440
he decided to go about conducting his own research in the monastery garden in Burno.

01:35.440 --> 01:43.600
Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel used over 28,000 pea plants to study plant hybridization,

01:43.600 --> 01:48.240
and his results are familiar to anyone who's studied high school genetics today.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.520
He found that the hybridization of different colored peas,

01:51.600 --> 01:54.480
as well as other traits, followed regular patterns.

01:54.480 --> 01:58.400
For instance, if a yellow pea plant was crossed to a green pea plant,

01:58.400 --> 02:00.080
all the offspring would be yellow.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.440
You might remember this from school as yellow being a dominant trait,

02:03.440 --> 02:05.440
and green being a recessive one.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.960
The offspring of these hybrid yellow plants, when crossed to each other,

02:08.960 --> 02:13.040
would then have a three to one ratio of yellow peas to green ones.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.720
This is the origin of the infamous concept of skipping a generation.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.960
Green was present in the first generation, disappeared in the second,

02:20.960 --> 02:22.960
only to reappear in the third.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.400
Another common example of this kind of inheritance is eye color.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.920
Much like Mendel's peas, brown eyes are dominant to blue ones,

02:29.920 --> 02:32.560
and using special tables known as punnet squares,

02:32.560 --> 02:38.080
we can quickly find out that it's possible for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child

02:38.080 --> 02:41.200
because they happen to carry hidden or recessive blue genes,

02:41.200 --> 02:45.280
but it's impossible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.400
Altogether, Mendel's picture of inheritance, as it was interpreted by his followers,

02:50.400 --> 02:52.240
gave the following picture of genetics.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.960
One, genes are tightly linked to traits and act like blueprints.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.840
If you find a specific gene in your genetic blueprint,

02:59.840 --> 03:02.160
you know exactly what trait will occur.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.400
Two, inheritance can be easily tracked using Mendel's laws of inheritance,

03:06.400 --> 03:09.520
giving us phenomena like the famous three to one ratio.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.320
Three, the impact of the environment is minimal.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.640
Traits can be determined using punnet squares in any environmental context.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.680
But none of those things are actually true.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.800
Not even for a seemingly simple trait like eye color.

03:22.800 --> 03:28.960
For one, eyes can come in all shades of blue, brown, gray, multicolored, two different colors,

03:28.960 --> 03:31.200
and can even change throughout your lifetime,

03:31.200 --> 03:35.760
with some babies being born with blue eyes and going on to develop brown eyes.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.000
Discrete categories like blue and brown

03:38.000 --> 03:42.240
are actually decided pretty arbitrarily by ignoring all other variation.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.120
In reality, eye color is the product of many genes acting together,

03:47.120 --> 03:50.720
not a single gene with two forms that can be modeled with a punnet square.

03:50.720 --> 03:55.520
As a result, it's entirely possible for blue-eyed parents to have brown-eyed children.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.960
This fact is not really surprising to geneticists and has been well known for over 100 years,

04:00.960 --> 04:03.440
but it doesn't fail to freak parents out.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.800
But if Mendel's story doesn't even work for eye color,

04:06.800 --> 04:12.160
then what is the right way to think about how genes work in humans and other organisms?

04:12.880 --> 04:17.760
In 1957, Conrad Hall Waddington published The Strategy of the Genes,

04:17.760 --> 04:21.040
whose key argument can be summarized in these two figures.

04:21.040 --> 04:25.920
Waddington suggests that we should think of genes not in terms of blueprints or punnet squares,

04:25.920 --> 04:31.760
but as a complex system of pegs and guy ropes that hold up a surface like a circus tent.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.720
The traits that we develop, like blue or brown eyes,

04:34.720 --> 04:40.000
are then the result of a marble rolling down this complicated landscape into one of the valleys.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.800
As Waddington himself admits, following this three-dimensional metaphor is tricky,

04:44.800 --> 04:49.520
so to make things clearer, I've simplified his argument down to something familiar.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.080
Here I've built a Steve Mould style 2D version of the Waddington landscape,

04:54.080 --> 04:57.360
and it ends up looking like the classic Marble Drop Carnival game,

04:57.360 --> 05:01.920
where you place a marble at the top and try to aim it into the highest score at the bottom.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.600
In this modified version of Waddington's metaphor,

05:05.600 --> 05:07.520
genes are the paddles in the middle,

05:07.520 --> 05:11.680
and the bins at the bottom are different traits, like different possible eye colors.

05:11.680 --> 05:17.440
The ball falling then represents the process of development, from single-celled embryo to adult.

05:17.440 --> 05:23.040
As for the environment, Waddington was a little inconsistent in conceptualizing its role,

05:23.040 --> 05:27.120
but at least in one instance, another figure in the strategy of the genes,

05:27.120 --> 05:32.480
he uses an arrow to show an environmental stimulus bumping the marble in a particular direction.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.200
That'll do for us, and we can simulate it with a push from this hairdryer.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.840
Waddington's landscape gives us quite a few useful insights that are missed by the Mendelian

05:45.840 --> 05:51.200
picture. First and foremost, we can clearly see that every trait has to be the product of many

05:51.200 --> 05:56.080
genes working together to funnel the marble down a particular path. You can imagine how

05:56.080 --> 06:00.800
complex this marble run would have to be to determine things like cardiovascular disease,

06:01.520 --> 06:05.680
as illustrated beautifully by this figure from the genetics pedagogies project,

06:05.680 --> 06:11.040
more on them later. Or take the Y chromosome that's often considered to determine the male sex,

06:11.040 --> 06:16.960
XY chromosomes in your genetic blueprint give a male person, and XX chromosomes give a female.

06:16.960 --> 06:22.240
We can visualize this on Waddington's landscape with this red paddle being the Y chromosome.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.720
When it's there, the marble always goes into the male bin, and when it's not there,

06:26.720 --> 06:32.480
the marble always goes into the female bin. But from cases like South African runner Castor

06:32.480 --> 06:38.160
Semenya, a woman with XY chromosomes, we already know that this picture is too simple. This is

06:38.160 --> 06:43.520
because the Y chromosome has to function in concert with many other genes to collectively

06:43.520 --> 06:48.480
determine sex. But if these other genes were altered in some way, or if different amounts

06:48.480 --> 06:52.720
of hormones are present through development, the landscape could shift in complex ways to

06:52.720 --> 06:58.880
get different sexual patternings. So the Y chromosome is hardly the only important factor

06:58.880 --> 07:04.800
in determining sex. Even without changing the landscape, randomness can also arise naturally

07:04.800 --> 07:10.640
by the marble happening to fall into a different bin by pure chance. This is partly what happens

07:10.640 --> 07:15.840
when identical twins who have the same genetics end up with different handedness, different eye

07:15.840 --> 07:21.600
colors, different neurological conditions like schizophrenia, even different sexes. Of course,

07:21.600 --> 07:26.560
differing environments also play a role in generating variation between identical twins too.

07:26.560 --> 07:31.600
But either way, we can now see why it's misleading to call the Y chromosome, or specifically

07:31.600 --> 07:37.760
SY, the gene for maleness. It can certainly make a big difference in how genetic characteristics

07:37.760 --> 07:43.440
are determined, but it can't act alone, and it doesn't guarantee anything. Really, we shouldn't

07:43.440 --> 07:48.560
talk about genes for anything, because the structure of all traits looks similar to sex.

07:48.560 --> 07:53.200
They're the product of complex networks of genes acting together with the environment.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.840
Even traits that are supposedly under the control of a single gene, like cystic fibrosis,

07:57.840 --> 08:03.600
PKD, and Huntington's disease, can be modified in their severity by several other genes and

08:03.600 --> 08:09.280
environmental factors, again highlighting the convoluted relationship between gene and trait.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.880
It's a little annoying that Mendelian genetics follows such nice rules, and it would seem as though

08:14.880 --> 08:20.480
Waddington's landscape lacks the mathematical niceties of genotype ratios and punnett squares.

08:20.480 --> 08:25.280
But in the past few years, this has begun to change, with the landscape moving from being

08:25.280 --> 08:30.880
a mere metaphor to inspiring mathematically rigorous models that describe real developmental

08:30.880 --> 08:36.080
patterns. This has also been helped along by the development of new technologies, particularly those

08:36.080 --> 08:41.120
that allow us to study the gene expression of individual cells. For instance, James DeFrisco

08:41.120 --> 08:46.720
and Yogi Yeager have shown that the exact same genes in the exact same network of interactions

08:46.720 --> 08:51.440
can actually result in significantly different morphological patterns in flies.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.320
The reason behind this is a little hard to show on my 2D marble run diagram,

08:56.320 --> 09:01.520
but in Waddington's original figure, this is because the genes, the pegs, can pull with

09:01.520 --> 09:06.400
different tensions on the guy ropes to affect the landscape, where the tensions in the ropes

09:06.400 --> 09:11.360
represent the strengths, timings, and rates of interaction in the gap gene network.

09:11.360 --> 09:16.880
The result of all this pulling of guy ropes are qualitative changes in the genetic landscape.

09:16.880 --> 09:22.160
For instance, it's possible for a bi-stable regime, where the marble can only roll down into

09:22.160 --> 09:28.240
two valleys, to turn into a multi-stable one, where more valleys open up for the marble to roll into.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.320
This opens up the possibility for new traits to emerge in the population.

09:32.320 --> 09:37.280
And visually, we can imagine how loosening the slack in this imaginary guy rope

09:37.280 --> 09:40.480
could turn the landscape on the left into the one on the right.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.040
All of this does leave one big historical question unturned.

09:45.040 --> 09:50.000
How did Mendel end up with such nice results, despite all of this complexity?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.920
Well, the truth is that Mendel's peas were actually pretty special.

09:53.920 --> 10:00.720
When other biologists tried to replicate Mendel's results, like Raphael Weldon tried to do in 1902,

10:00.720 --> 10:03.360
their peas looked nothing at all like Mendel's.

10:03.360 --> 10:07.920
Weldon found that pea color actually existed on a spectrum, from yellow to green.

10:07.920 --> 10:12.480
It definitely didn't seem like a binary trait, like we see in today's textbooks or Mendel's

10:12.480 --> 10:17.760
original paper. Weldon wrote in a letter to statistician Carl Pearson, that Mendel must

10:17.760 --> 10:23.760
either be a truly astonishing man, or a black liar. But this is being a little harsh on Mendel,

10:23.760 --> 10:30.480
because remember, he was only directly interested in plant hybridization, not heredity itself.

10:30.480 --> 10:36.880
And to study hybrids, he first had to purify his pea plants to remove any intermediate variation.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.800
This wasn't easy and took him two years of artificial breeding to get

10:40.800 --> 10:44.080
pure bred lines that maintain their color across generations.

10:44.640 --> 10:49.760
Unknowingly, Mendel was essentially fudging the Waddington landscape of the pea color genes

10:49.760 --> 10:53.840
to the very boring case of a marble going into the same bin every time.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.080
And once he'd done that, the patterns we retrospectively call

10:58.160 --> 11:03.680
Mendel's laws of inheritance do indeed emerge, but only in this very particular context.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.160
To quote Annie Jameson and Greg Radick,

11:06.160 --> 11:12.400
These patterns do arise, but they arise only under special conditions, notably when humans,

11:12.400 --> 11:17.760
like Mendel, have engineered artificially purified lineages into being by deliberately

11:17.760 --> 11:23.760
excluding unwanted variability. It's therefore a pretty big mistake, you could even call it a

11:23.760 --> 11:30.160
misinterpretation of Mendel's experiments to extend his results to the entire biological world

11:30.160 --> 11:35.360
in the wild. I can hear some of you saying, Jake, this is the second video you've done critiquing

11:35.360 --> 11:40.720
models in biology that have been hugely successful. Yes, okay, they have their flaws, but aren't we

11:40.720 --> 11:46.160
supposed to teach students the oversimplified model first? And to that, I'll respond with the resounding

11:46.160 --> 11:51.440
no. This line of thinking is based on the idea that students are these silly little naive souls

11:51.440 --> 11:56.480
that are only ready for the truth once they're grown up. Truth is, students are extremely receptive

11:56.480 --> 12:01.200
to being taught a more accurate and modern genetics curriculum. The genetics pedagogies

12:01.200 --> 12:06.960
project did just that. They created an introductory genetics course that placed the entangled nature

12:06.960 --> 12:12.800
of genes, environments, and organisms front and center and contextualized Mendelian traits as

12:12.800 --> 12:18.560
a rare special case. And compared to students who took the more traditional course, the 28 students

12:18.560 --> 12:23.920
taught the new curriculum, emerged as less believing of genetic determinism and better

12:23.920 --> 12:28.960
prepared to understand the subtleties of modern genetics. Surely the point of a good scientific

12:28.960 --> 12:34.320
education should be to do just that, to teach students modern science, not dwell in outdated

12:34.320 --> 12:39.600
paradigms. Anyone that can understand how a marble run works is capable of understanding how our

12:39.600 --> 12:45.520
genetics actually work. There's no need to lie. Plus, even if we eventually teach students the

12:45.520 --> 12:50.160
modern picture of genetics in later courses, there's a very good chance that students never

12:50.160 --> 12:54.880
get exposed to these subtleties because they never end up taking the more advanced courses.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.520
I'm sure the vast majority of you only got exposed to the Mendel's P-style of genetics at

12:59.520 --> 13:04.480
school, and that was it. With the Mendelian blueprint picture firmly ingrained in the minds

13:04.480 --> 13:09.520
of most students, the public at large is much more prone to believe questionable headlines like

13:09.520 --> 13:15.040
genes determine how young use internet and social media, and scientists find 24 golden

13:15.040 --> 13:20.320
genes that help you get rich. If instead we place better metaphors, like Waddington's landscape,

13:20.320 --> 13:25.200
in the curriculum from the beginning, these headlines would be quickly dismissed as nonsense.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.280
Hopefully most of you realize that there's something dodgy going on with the claim that

13:29.280 --> 13:34.480
something as complex as income could be determined by a genetics. Not to mention how deterministic

13:34.480 --> 13:40.000
thinking like this can easily move across into talk of good genes and bad genes, and then blaming

13:40.000 --> 13:45.040
the poor for being poor because of some innate genetic characteristics, and we've mindlessly

13:45.040 --> 13:52.000
just slid into eugenics territory. It's actually Mendel's 200th birthday this year, and it might

13:52.000 --> 13:56.240
seem like a pretty rotten birthday present to suggest jettisoning his ideas out from the

13:56.240 --> 14:01.200
genetics curriculum. But as Greg Radick points out, if we want to honor Mendel, then let us read

14:01.280 --> 14:06.160
him seriously, which is to say historically, without back projecting the doctrinaire

14:06.160 --> 14:11.200
mentalism that came later. Study Mendel, but let him be a part of his time.
