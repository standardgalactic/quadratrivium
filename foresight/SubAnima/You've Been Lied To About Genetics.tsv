0	6160	Between 1990 and 2003, the Human Genome Project sequenced our entire genetic code,
6160	8720	or as they like to call it, the human blueprint.
8720	11440	During the mid-90s, the hopes for the project were high.
11440	14800	Science journalist Laurie Garrett imagined that by 2020,
14800	17760	everyone would be carrying around their own little genome cards,
17760	19840	so if you ever ended up in hospital,
19840	23840	doctors would be able to swipe your card to see which mutation was causing the problem,
23840	26560	and you'd then be sent off for gene therapy to be cured.
26560	27680	Easy peasy.
27680	30480	That was the promise of the Human Genome Project,
30480	35120	but 2020 was now three years ago, and no one's carrying around a genome card.
35120	40640	The harsh reality for the project was that the link between our DNA and who we are
40640	43120	is way more complicated than we imagined.
43120	47120	For the vast majority of characteristics that make you, you,
47120	50880	there just isn't a direct connection between gene and trait.
50880	53520	That seems to go against what we get taught at school,
53520	55120	and what we've seen in the media,
55120	57920	where it seems as though there's genes for blue eyes,
57920	60560	genes for red hair, genes for Scottishness.
60560	62880	My DNA comes from Scotland and Ireland.
62880	66240	Genes for sexuality, even genes for dog ownership.
66240	69440	It's all encoded in the programming language of life.
69440	71600	So what's wrong with this picture?
71600	74080	The father of genetics was Gregor Mendel,
74080	77840	an Augustinian friar who also had a keen interest in science.
77840	80480	Although he initially wanted to become a teacher,
80480	84160	his highly relatable fear of oral presentations
84160	87440	caused him to fail the certification exam twice.
87440	90080	With the teaching career seemingly out of grasp,
90080	95440	he decided to go about conducting his own research in the monastery garden in Burno.
95440	103600	Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel used over 28,000 pea plants to study plant hybridization,
103600	108240	and his results are familiar to anyone who's studied high school genetics today.
108240	111520	He found that the hybridization of different colored peas,
111600	114480	as well as other traits, followed regular patterns.
114480	118400	For instance, if a yellow pea plant was crossed to a green pea plant,
118400	120080	all the offspring would be yellow.
120080	123440	You might remember this from school as yellow being a dominant trait,
123440	125440	and green being a recessive one.
125440	128960	The offspring of these hybrid yellow plants, when crossed to each other,
128960	133040	would then have a three to one ratio of yellow peas to green ones.
133040	136720	This is the origin of the infamous concept of skipping a generation.
137280	140960	Green was present in the first generation, disappeared in the second,
140960	142960	only to reappear in the third.
142960	146400	Another common example of this kind of inheritance is eye color.
146400	149920	Much like Mendel's peas, brown eyes are dominant to blue ones,
149920	152560	and using special tables known as punnet squares,
152560	158080	we can quickly find out that it's possible for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child
158080	161200	because they happen to carry hidden or recessive blue genes,
161200	165280	but it's impossible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.
166080	170400	Altogether, Mendel's picture of inheritance, as it was interpreted by his followers,
170400	172240	gave the following picture of genetics.
172880	176960	One, genes are tightly linked to traits and act like blueprints.
176960	179840	If you find a specific gene in your genetic blueprint,
179840	182160	you know exactly what trait will occur.
182160	186400	Two, inheritance can be easily tracked using Mendel's laws of inheritance,
186400	189520	giving us phenomena like the famous three to one ratio.
189520	192320	Three, the impact of the environment is minimal.
192320	196640	Traits can be determined using punnet squares in any environmental context.
196640	199680	But none of those things are actually true.
199680	202800	Not even for a seemingly simple trait like eye color.
202800	208960	For one, eyes can come in all shades of blue, brown, gray, multicolored, two different colors,
208960	211200	and can even change throughout your lifetime,
211200	215760	with some babies being born with blue eyes and going on to develop brown eyes.
215760	218000	Discrete categories like blue and brown
218000	222240	are actually decided pretty arbitrarily by ignoring all other variation.
222880	227120	In reality, eye color is the product of many genes acting together,
227120	230720	not a single gene with two forms that can be modeled with a punnet square.
230720	235520	As a result, it's entirely possible for blue-eyed parents to have brown-eyed children.
235520	240960	This fact is not really surprising to geneticists and has been well known for over 100 years,
240960	243440	but it doesn't fail to freak parents out.
243440	246800	But if Mendel's story doesn't even work for eye color,
246800	252160	then what is the right way to think about how genes work in humans and other organisms?
252880	257760	In 1957, Conrad Hall Waddington published The Strategy of the Genes,
257760	261040	whose key argument can be summarized in these two figures.
261040	265920	Waddington suggests that we should think of genes not in terms of blueprints or punnet squares,
265920	271760	but as a complex system of pegs and guy ropes that hold up a surface like a circus tent.
271760	274720	The traits that we develop, like blue or brown eyes,
274720	280000	are then the result of a marble rolling down this complicated landscape into one of the valleys.
280000	284800	As Waddington himself admits, following this three-dimensional metaphor is tricky,
284800	289520	so to make things clearer, I've simplified his argument down to something familiar.
289520	294080	Here I've built a Steve Mould style 2D version of the Waddington landscape,
294080	297360	and it ends up looking like the classic Marble Drop Carnival game,
297360	301920	where you place a marble at the top and try to aim it into the highest score at the bottom.
302480	305600	In this modified version of Waddington's metaphor,
305600	307520	genes are the paddles in the middle,
307520	311680	and the bins at the bottom are different traits, like different possible eye colors.
311680	317440	The ball falling then represents the process of development, from single-celled embryo to adult.
317440	323040	As for the environment, Waddington was a little inconsistent in conceptualizing its role,
323040	327120	but at least in one instance, another figure in the strategy of the genes,
327120	332480	he uses an arrow to show an environmental stimulus bumping the marble in a particular direction.
333200	337200	That'll do for us, and we can simulate it with a push from this hairdryer.
341280	345840	Waddington's landscape gives us quite a few useful insights that are missed by the Mendelian
345840	351200	picture. First and foremost, we can clearly see that every trait has to be the product of many
351200	356080	genes working together to funnel the marble down a particular path. You can imagine how
356080	360800	complex this marble run would have to be to determine things like cardiovascular disease,
361520	365680	as illustrated beautifully by this figure from the genetics pedagogies project,
365680	371040	more on them later. Or take the Y chromosome that's often considered to determine the male sex,
371040	376960	XY chromosomes in your genetic blueprint give a male person, and XX chromosomes give a female.
376960	382240	We can visualize this on Waddington's landscape with this red paddle being the Y chromosome.
382240	386720	When it's there, the marble always goes into the male bin, and when it's not there,
386720	392480	the marble always goes into the female bin. But from cases like South African runner Castor
392480	398160	Semenya, a woman with XY chromosomes, we already know that this picture is too simple. This is
398160	403520	because the Y chromosome has to function in concert with many other genes to collectively
403520	408480	determine sex. But if these other genes were altered in some way, or if different amounts
408480	412720	of hormones are present through development, the landscape could shift in complex ways to
412720	418880	get different sexual patternings. So the Y chromosome is hardly the only important factor
418880	424800	in determining sex. Even without changing the landscape, randomness can also arise naturally
424800	430640	by the marble happening to fall into a different bin by pure chance. This is partly what happens
430640	435840	when identical twins who have the same genetics end up with different handedness, different eye
435840	441600	colors, different neurological conditions like schizophrenia, even different sexes. Of course,
441600	446560	differing environments also play a role in generating variation between identical twins too.
446560	451600	But either way, we can now see why it's misleading to call the Y chromosome, or specifically
451600	457760	SY, the gene for maleness. It can certainly make a big difference in how genetic characteristics
457760	463440	are determined, but it can't act alone, and it doesn't guarantee anything. Really, we shouldn't
463440	468560	talk about genes for anything, because the structure of all traits looks similar to sex.
468560	473200	They're the product of complex networks of genes acting together with the environment.
473200	477840	Even traits that are supposedly under the control of a single gene, like cystic fibrosis,
477840	483600	PKD, and Huntington's disease, can be modified in their severity by several other genes and
483600	489280	environmental factors, again highlighting the convoluted relationship between gene and trait.
489280	494880	It's a little annoying that Mendelian genetics follows such nice rules, and it would seem as though
494880	500480	Waddington's landscape lacks the mathematical niceties of genotype ratios and punnett squares.
500480	505280	But in the past few years, this has begun to change, with the landscape moving from being
505280	510880	a mere metaphor to inspiring mathematically rigorous models that describe real developmental
510880	516080	patterns. This has also been helped along by the development of new technologies, particularly those
516080	521120	that allow us to study the gene expression of individual cells. For instance, James DeFrisco
521120	526720	and Yogi Yeager have shown that the exact same genes in the exact same network of interactions
526720	531440	can actually result in significantly different morphological patterns in flies.
531440	536320	The reason behind this is a little hard to show on my 2D marble run diagram,
536320	541520	but in Waddington's original figure, this is because the genes, the pegs, can pull with
541520	546400	different tensions on the guy ropes to affect the landscape, where the tensions in the ropes
546400	551360	represent the strengths, timings, and rates of interaction in the gap gene network.
551360	556880	The result of all this pulling of guy ropes are qualitative changes in the genetic landscape.
556880	562160	For instance, it's possible for a bi-stable regime, where the marble can only roll down into
562160	568240	two valleys, to turn into a multi-stable one, where more valleys open up for the marble to roll into.
568240	572320	This opens up the possibility for new traits to emerge in the population.
572320	577280	And visually, we can imagine how loosening the slack in this imaginary guy rope
577280	580480	could turn the landscape on the left into the one on the right.
581280	585040	All of this does leave one big historical question unturned.
585040	590000	How did Mendel end up with such nice results, despite all of this complexity?
590000	593920	Well, the truth is that Mendel's peas were actually pretty special.
593920	600720	When other biologists tried to replicate Mendel's results, like Raphael Weldon tried to do in 1902,
600720	603360	their peas looked nothing at all like Mendel's.
603360	607920	Weldon found that pea color actually existed on a spectrum, from yellow to green.
607920	612480	It definitely didn't seem like a binary trait, like we see in today's textbooks or Mendel's
612480	617760	original paper. Weldon wrote in a letter to statistician Carl Pearson, that Mendel must
617760	623760	either be a truly astonishing man, or a black liar. But this is being a little harsh on Mendel,
623760	630480	because remember, he was only directly interested in plant hybridization, not heredity itself.
630480	636880	And to study hybrids, he first had to purify his pea plants to remove any intermediate variation.
636880	640800	This wasn't easy and took him two years of artificial breeding to get
640800	644080	pure bred lines that maintain their color across generations.
644640	649760	Unknowingly, Mendel was essentially fudging the Waddington landscape of the pea color genes
649760	653840	to the very boring case of a marble going into the same bin every time.
654480	658080	And once he'd done that, the patterns we retrospectively call
658160	663680	Mendel's laws of inheritance do indeed emerge, but only in this very particular context.
663680	666160	To quote Annie Jameson and Greg Radick,
666160	672400	These patterns do arise, but they arise only under special conditions, notably when humans,
672400	677760	like Mendel, have engineered artificially purified lineages into being by deliberately
677760	683760	excluding unwanted variability. It's therefore a pretty big mistake, you could even call it a
683760	690160	misinterpretation of Mendel's experiments to extend his results to the entire biological world
690160	695360	in the wild. I can hear some of you saying, Jake, this is the second video you've done critiquing
695360	700720	models in biology that have been hugely successful. Yes, okay, they have their flaws, but aren't we
700720	706160	supposed to teach students the oversimplified model first? And to that, I'll respond with the resounding
706160	711440	no. This line of thinking is based on the idea that students are these silly little naive souls
711440	716480	that are only ready for the truth once they're grown up. Truth is, students are extremely receptive
716480	721200	to being taught a more accurate and modern genetics curriculum. The genetics pedagogies
721200	726960	project did just that. They created an introductory genetics course that placed the entangled nature
726960	732800	of genes, environments, and organisms front and center and contextualized Mendelian traits as
732800	738560	a rare special case. And compared to students who took the more traditional course, the 28 students
738560	743920	taught the new curriculum, emerged as less believing of genetic determinism and better
743920	748960	prepared to understand the subtleties of modern genetics. Surely the point of a good scientific
748960	754320	education should be to do just that, to teach students modern science, not dwell in outdated
754320	759600	paradigms. Anyone that can understand how a marble run works is capable of understanding how our
759600	765520	genetics actually work. There's no need to lie. Plus, even if we eventually teach students the
765520	770160	modern picture of genetics in later courses, there's a very good chance that students never
770160	774880	get exposed to these subtleties because they never end up taking the more advanced courses.
774880	779520	I'm sure the vast majority of you only got exposed to the Mendel's P-style of genetics at
779520	784480	school, and that was it. With the Mendelian blueprint picture firmly ingrained in the minds
784480	789520	of most students, the public at large is much more prone to believe questionable headlines like
789520	795040	genes determine how young use internet and social media, and scientists find 24 golden
795040	800320	genes that help you get rich. If instead we place better metaphors, like Waddington's landscape,
800320	805200	in the curriculum from the beginning, these headlines would be quickly dismissed as nonsense.
805200	809280	Hopefully most of you realize that there's something dodgy going on with the claim that
809280	814480	something as complex as income could be determined by a genetics. Not to mention how deterministic
814480	820000	thinking like this can easily move across into talk of good genes and bad genes, and then blaming
820000	825040	the poor for being poor because of some innate genetic characteristics, and we've mindlessly
825040	832000	just slid into eugenics territory. It's actually Mendel's 200th birthday this year, and it might
832000	836240	seem like a pretty rotten birthday present to suggest jettisoning his ideas out from the
836240	841200	genetics curriculum. But as Greg Radick points out, if we want to honor Mendel, then let us read
841280	846160	him seriously, which is to say historically, without back projecting the doctrinaire
846160	851200	mentalism that came later. Study Mendel, but let him be a part of his time.
