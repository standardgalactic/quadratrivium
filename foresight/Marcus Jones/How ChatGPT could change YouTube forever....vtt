00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
ChatGPT has changed YouTube forever. Despite only being released two months ago,

00:04.640 --> 00:09.440
YouTubers have been using it to get monumental results like this while tripling their productivity.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.760
So I'm going to show you some of my favorite ChatGPT hacks for YouTubers and also talk about

00:13.760 --> 00:17.680
how ChatGPT will change the future of YouTube forever.

00:17.680 --> 00:22.720
Let's start at the beginning. On November 30th, 2022, ChatGPT was launched and in just

00:22.720 --> 00:27.680
five days it had over 11 billion users, including Elon Musk, who said it was quote,

00:27.760 --> 00:31.440
scary good. Seriously, at this stage, there are so many people using this damn software

00:31.440 --> 00:35.840
that 50% of the time I load it up, it just crashes because the servers can't handle the volume.

00:35.840 --> 00:41.840
But what exactly is ChatGPT? Well, if you ask ChatGPT itself, it will say that it's an AI language

00:41.840 --> 00:47.200
model, which is nerd speak that basically means it's kind of like a super smart virtual assistant

00:47.200 --> 00:51.600
with the work ethic of a thousand Dwayne The Rock Johnson's. Let me show you what I mean.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.280
So let's say I'm trying to come up with fun video ideas for my Minecraft YouTube channel.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.000
I could log into ChatGPT and tell it to do something like give me fun video ideas for

01:00.000 --> 01:04.480
my Minecraft YouTube channel. And these ideas are completely unique. They've been created from

01:04.480 --> 01:09.040
scratch by the AI, meaning that they haven't just been scraped and copied and pasted from

01:09.040 --> 01:12.640
somewhere on the internet. Now we've got a bunch of ideas here and you could tell it to continue

01:12.640 --> 01:16.560
generating more and more and more ideas until you find one that clicks with you. But for the sake

01:16.560 --> 01:21.120
of this example, let's just look at number eight on this list, role playing adventures. It sounds

01:21.120 --> 01:24.880
like a cool idea. Let's see if we can flesh it out a little bit. Now I often like to come up with

01:24.880 --> 01:28.640
my titles and thumbnails before I actually create my videos. So what I'm going to do is I'm going

01:28.640 --> 01:35.680
to ask ChatGPT now to give me Minecraft YouTube video titles about me role playing as a potato.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.920
Yes, you heard that right. Wow. So as you can see, we've generated a list of video ideas. We've

01:39.920 --> 01:44.960
picked an idea and now we've told ChatGPT to generate a list of titles for the specific idea

01:44.960 --> 01:49.520
that stood out to it the most. And here they are. Now out of these, I actually find title number

01:49.520 --> 01:53.600
three pretty funny. And now I'm up to the stage where I'd actually start brainstorming a script

01:53.600 --> 01:58.560
or outline for my video. And in the name of laziness, ChatGPT can actually help out with this

01:58.560 --> 02:02.800
as well. I can just tell it to create a script outline for this video. And what it generates is

02:02.800 --> 02:06.960
insane. Look at this. It'll tell me to introduce myself and explain the concept of a role play

02:06.960 --> 02:11.680
series. It'll tell me to set the scene by showing a potato farm where the journey begins. It'll tell

02:11.680 --> 02:16.640
me to preview the goals of the journey and what a viewer can expect from the series, basically

02:16.640 --> 02:20.400
foreshadowing, which is a really powerful storytelling technique. It's then going to give

02:20.400 --> 02:24.560
me the different stages of the video. I should show the initial struggles of the potato character

02:24.560 --> 02:29.120
trying to survive in a Minecraft world through to building a base for my potato character,

02:29.120 --> 02:34.640
through to expanding that base into an empire, and then showcasing the challenges and triumphs

02:34.640 --> 02:39.840
I encounter before finally summarizing my journey so far. And if this is a multi video series,

02:39.840 --> 02:44.880
previewing what is to come in future episodes. And while sure, this is a relatively basic video

02:44.880 --> 02:49.760
structure, honestly, it's probably better than 95% of the Minecraft role play videos out there.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.080
Now, we could tell ChatGPT to actually write a script for a video like this, but because

02:54.080 --> 02:59.120
this video is going to be more of a playthrough style one, it probably wouldn't really work out.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.360
However, what we could do is tell it to write a script for the intro for the hook. Since that's

03:03.360 --> 03:07.920
something we'll probably want to pre-plan so we can grab as many people and rope them into watching

03:07.920 --> 03:12.480
the entire video. So all I have to do is ask ChatGPT and here's what it generates. And if you

03:12.480 --> 03:16.080
don't like what it generates, you can actually tell it to generate something different and kind of

03:16.080 --> 03:20.720
explain to it the way in which you want your script to be written. For example, I could tell

03:20.720 --> 03:25.280
it to write the script in the style of MrBeast. And while it hasn't done a perfect job here,

03:25.280 --> 03:30.160
there are definitely elements of this that we could take and use as inspiration for our intro.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.840
For example, we could start the second paragraph here and intro our video like,

03:33.840 --> 03:39.120
We start our journey as a potato, just like any other potato on a farm. But this isn't just an

03:39.120 --> 03:44.400
ordinary potato, no sir. We have big dreams and even bigger plans, and we're going to take this

03:44.480 --> 03:49.120
blocky world by storm and become the biggest, baddest potato Minecraft has ever seen.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.520
Sure, it's kind of cringy, but again, it's probably better than 90 to 95% of the intro is out

03:53.520 --> 03:57.120
there for this type of content. And finally, now that we've got our script in our structure,

03:57.120 --> 04:02.400
we can tell ChatGPT to write our video description for us because that's incredibly boring and no

04:02.400 --> 04:06.560
one wants to do that. Now this one's decent, descriptions don't matter that much. But let's

04:06.560 --> 04:11.920
say this was a searchable video and descriptions do impact YouTube search. You could tell ChatGPT

04:11.920 --> 04:16.800
to optimize this description for SEO and here's what it will do. And notice it adds in more

04:16.800 --> 04:21.680
keywords and keyword phrases related to our video idea. Now obviously it could be improved,

04:21.680 --> 04:25.840
but this is a pretty good foundation. And last but not least, now we have a description, maybe we

04:25.840 --> 04:29.600
want to generate some tags for our video. Now this is okay, but it's going to be a pain for me to

04:29.600 --> 04:35.200
individually copy and paste all of these tags into my video description. So I can just tell ChatGPT

04:35.200 --> 04:38.960
to separate these tags with commas in between, and it'll create them in a way that I can just

04:39.040 --> 04:43.040
literally copy and paste them straight into my YouTube video. And there we have it. Now obviously

04:43.040 --> 04:48.480
this isn't a perfect video, but notice how long it took us to do all of this. This tool is phenomenally

04:48.480 --> 04:53.280
powerful and it's still in beta. And that begs the question, what will the YouTube ecosystem look like

04:53.280 --> 04:59.200
in three, five or even 10 years time from now when ChatGPT is being used by basically everyone?

04:59.200 --> 05:03.440
How do you prepare? Should you embrace it, fight against it or something else? Why jumped on a call

05:03.440 --> 05:08.480
with Ed from Filmbooth who's been looking into this extensively to ask him just that.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.120
So it's scary and it's exciting at the same time because it's writing scripts better than

05:13.120 --> 05:16.880
people I've hired, not who I'm currently hiring, just in case they're watching. It's not better

05:16.880 --> 05:21.760
than you guys. I'm using it every day for titles. I'm using it every day to tighten up scripts,

05:21.760 --> 05:28.800
research. When I first came across AI of this nature, it was about two months before ChatGPT

05:28.800 --> 05:33.920
and I was like, this is years off. And in two months, it's changed to the point where it's like,

05:33.920 --> 05:38.160
the other day it went down and I felt anxious that I didn't have it. That's how much I'm using it.

05:38.240 --> 05:42.160
It's an amazing tool. It's bad for new YouTubers. If they rely on it too much,

05:42.160 --> 05:46.720
they're not going to learn the skills. I think over this time next year, it's going to have caused

05:46.720 --> 05:51.760
huge amounts of content to flood to YouTube. Don't necessarily know if it's going to be the best.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.840
I think for Search, it's just going to absolutely dominate. I think for Faceless Channels,

05:55.840 --> 06:00.880
people who can find gaps and niches, it's going to be unbelievably good and amazingly profitable.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.640
If it gets to the level, I think it's going to be pretty quick. But I worry that it's going to

06:04.640 --> 06:09.760
make us all too lazy. It's only working off stuff that's already out there. The thing that drives

06:09.760 --> 06:14.480
everything forward and makes being creative so wonderful is new things appear. We're not just

06:14.480 --> 06:20.000
repeating old things. MrBeast created this whole style and a lot of people copied it.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.200
Some people would argue that it ruined the entertainment side because everyone's copying

06:23.200 --> 06:29.840
MrBeast. What we need is new concepts, new ideas, new creative and crazy out-of-the-box

06:29.840 --> 06:34.000
thinking that I don't think AI can bring. But I also think it might bring a level where

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
maybe people can get by just using it, not pushing themselves. I feel like that could make

06:40.000 --> 06:45.040
the platform very average if that wins. It's scary and exciting. What do you think of it?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.360
It's really interesting. It's completely changing the game. At least a lot of people,

06:49.360 --> 06:52.960
I've heard talk about it, say, oh, it's now we're going to replace human creativity,

06:52.960 --> 06:59.280
but it's pretty damn good. I think to a point, it won't. I think a lot of creativity is just

06:59.920 --> 07:04.960
people being really good at remixing ideas, even if it's just subconscious. At least in my experience,

07:04.960 --> 07:10.480
it's very rare for someone to come with a completely unique original thing that has

07:10.480 --> 07:18.800
no elements of anyone else's stuff involved in it. That's what chatGPT does. Download the

07:18.800 --> 07:22.160
internet, takes lots of bits and pieces and puts it in. When you think about it, at least in my

07:22.160 --> 07:28.400
view, it is very creative, even though it's AI. It isn't the writing side. I think when it comes

07:28.400 --> 07:34.000
to editing, that's going to be a long way off and production. Yes, 100%. I like it. I do think in a

07:34.000 --> 07:37.600
year's time, it's probably going to be the thing that we rely on more than anything else.

07:38.320 --> 07:43.520
What are the skills that you think smart creators should double down on to future proof

07:43.520 --> 07:48.080
themselves? That's a good question. I would lean into storytelling then. The whole point

07:48.080 --> 07:52.320
about storytelling is there's the twists and turns, and there's structures you can follow,

07:52.320 --> 07:56.320
and the whole point is to try and create emotional reactions. So, humor can do that.

07:56.880 --> 08:02.480
There's a lot of views to be had playing it safe with content. Say I make a video about Ryan

08:02.480 --> 08:07.600
Treyham. If I make a video about Ryan Treyham, there are no jokes. Very informative. Harness's

08:07.600 --> 08:13.760
story structure, but it's kind of bland in that it's not about the personality of the presenter.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.440
It's all about the story of the person they're talking about. What that does is it doesn't

08:17.440 --> 08:21.680
put many people off. It doesn't necessarily create a bigger bond with the creator, but I've seen a lot

08:21.680 --> 08:27.280
of these videos do very well that are kind of like people reporting, and I look at them and think

08:27.840 --> 08:33.680
the AI can do that. What they can't do is all the weird stuff. So, I do stuff in my videos that I

08:33.680 --> 08:39.120
know put people off, and I know I would get more views if I stopped dressing up as in weird outfits.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.520
Because it's odd, right? The cold viewers can go, who the hell is this guy? But at the same time,

08:43.520 --> 08:46.640
I look at it and I go, well, for every one of them that hates me, and for everyone that

08:46.640 --> 08:51.360
stops me getting impressions, I have someone out there laughed, and they felt stronger,

08:52.000 --> 08:56.400
and they felt a bond with me because of that. The AI is not going to have that power to be

08:56.400 --> 09:01.120
thinking, how do I create a bond with a viewer? It's just information. So, I actually feel like

09:01.120 --> 09:05.760
if you're relying heavily on matter of fact, that's a problem. You've got to be thinking more

09:06.320 --> 09:11.760
creative, and how do I bond with people, not just report, because AI will just report

09:11.760 --> 09:16.960
significantly faster and easier than you. Well, Ed, thanks so much for jumping on and

09:16.960 --> 09:20.560
talking with us. If you want to check out Ed's channel, it will be linked down below. Also,

09:20.560 --> 09:25.680
he has a new thumbnail course that is out. You can check that out down below as well. Now,

09:25.680 --> 09:31.200
as Ed and I talked about, the AI is really good at generating words. However, it's not so good

09:31.200 --> 09:35.520
at the technical creation process like video editing. And so, if you want to learn one way

09:35.520 --> 09:40.000
to take your editing to the next level, watch the video on screen. It'll show you a really simple

09:40.000 --> 09:44.880
thing that 97% of people aren't doing. It'll help you get more views, watch time, and subscribers.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.200
Check it out.
