0	4640	ChatGPT has changed YouTube forever. Despite only being released two months ago,
4640	9440	YouTubers have been using it to get monumental results like this while tripling their productivity.
9440	13760	So I'm going to show you some of my favorite ChatGPT hacks for YouTubers and also talk about
13760	17680	how ChatGPT will change the future of YouTube forever.
17680	22720	Let's start at the beginning. On November 30th, 2022, ChatGPT was launched and in just
22720	27680	five days it had over 11 billion users, including Elon Musk, who said it was quote,
27760	31440	scary good. Seriously, at this stage, there are so many people using this damn software
31440	35840	that 50% of the time I load it up, it just crashes because the servers can't handle the volume.
35840	41840	But what exactly is ChatGPT? Well, if you ask ChatGPT itself, it will say that it's an AI language
41840	47200	model, which is nerd speak that basically means it's kind of like a super smart virtual assistant
47200	51600	with the work ethic of a thousand Dwayne The Rock Johnson's. Let me show you what I mean.
51600	55280	So let's say I'm trying to come up with fun video ideas for my Minecraft YouTube channel.
55280	60000	I could log into ChatGPT and tell it to do something like give me fun video ideas for
60000	64480	my Minecraft YouTube channel. And these ideas are completely unique. They've been created from
64480	69040	scratch by the AI, meaning that they haven't just been scraped and copied and pasted from
69040	72640	somewhere on the internet. Now we've got a bunch of ideas here and you could tell it to continue
72640	76560	generating more and more and more ideas until you find one that clicks with you. But for the sake
76560	81120	of this example, let's just look at number eight on this list, role playing adventures. It sounds
81120	84880	like a cool idea. Let's see if we can flesh it out a little bit. Now I often like to come up with
84880	88640	my titles and thumbnails before I actually create my videos. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
88640	95680	to ask ChatGPT now to give me Minecraft YouTube video titles about me role playing as a potato.
95680	99920	Yes, you heard that right. Wow. So as you can see, we've generated a list of video ideas. We've
99920	104960	picked an idea and now we've told ChatGPT to generate a list of titles for the specific idea
104960	109520	that stood out to it the most. And here they are. Now out of these, I actually find title number
109520	113600	three pretty funny. And now I'm up to the stage where I'd actually start brainstorming a script
113600	118560	or outline for my video. And in the name of laziness, ChatGPT can actually help out with this
118560	122800	as well. I can just tell it to create a script outline for this video. And what it generates is
122800	126960	insane. Look at this. It'll tell me to introduce myself and explain the concept of a role play
126960	131680	series. It'll tell me to set the scene by showing a potato farm where the journey begins. It'll tell
131680	136640	me to preview the goals of the journey and what a viewer can expect from the series, basically
136640	140400	foreshadowing, which is a really powerful storytelling technique. It's then going to give
140400	144560	me the different stages of the video. I should show the initial struggles of the potato character
144560	149120	trying to survive in a Minecraft world through to building a base for my potato character,
149120	154640	through to expanding that base into an empire, and then showcasing the challenges and triumphs
154640	159840	I encounter before finally summarizing my journey so far. And if this is a multi video series,
159840	164880	previewing what is to come in future episodes. And while sure, this is a relatively basic video
164880	169760	structure, honestly, it's probably better than 95% of the Minecraft role play videos out there.
169760	174080	Now, we could tell ChatGPT to actually write a script for a video like this, but because
174080	179120	this video is going to be more of a playthrough style one, it probably wouldn't really work out.
179120	183360	However, what we could do is tell it to write a script for the intro for the hook. Since that's
183360	187920	something we'll probably want to pre-plan so we can grab as many people and rope them into watching
187920	192480	the entire video. So all I have to do is ask ChatGPT and here's what it generates. And if you
192480	196080	don't like what it generates, you can actually tell it to generate something different and kind of
196080	200720	explain to it the way in which you want your script to be written. For example, I could tell
200720	205280	it to write the script in the style of MrBeast. And while it hasn't done a perfect job here,
205280	210160	there are definitely elements of this that we could take and use as inspiration for our intro.
210160	213840	For example, we could start the second paragraph here and intro our video like,
213840	219120	We start our journey as a potato, just like any other potato on a farm. But this isn't just an
219120	224400	ordinary potato, no sir. We have big dreams and even bigger plans, and we're going to take this
224480	229120	blocky world by storm and become the biggest, baddest potato Minecraft has ever seen.
229120	233520	Sure, it's kind of cringy, but again, it's probably better than 90 to 95% of the intro is out
233520	237120	there for this type of content. And finally, now that we've got our script in our structure,
237120	242400	we can tell ChatGPT to write our video description for us because that's incredibly boring and no
242400	246560	one wants to do that. Now this one's decent, descriptions don't matter that much. But let's
246560	251920	say this was a searchable video and descriptions do impact YouTube search. You could tell ChatGPT
251920	256800	to optimize this description for SEO and here's what it will do. And notice it adds in more
256800	261680	keywords and keyword phrases related to our video idea. Now obviously it could be improved,
261680	265840	but this is a pretty good foundation. And last but not least, now we have a description, maybe we
265840	269600	want to generate some tags for our video. Now this is okay, but it's going to be a pain for me to
269600	275200	individually copy and paste all of these tags into my video description. So I can just tell ChatGPT
275200	278960	to separate these tags with commas in between, and it'll create them in a way that I can just
279040	283040	literally copy and paste them straight into my YouTube video. And there we have it. Now obviously
283040	288480	this isn't a perfect video, but notice how long it took us to do all of this. This tool is phenomenally
288480	293280	powerful and it's still in beta. And that begs the question, what will the YouTube ecosystem look like
293280	299200	in three, five or even 10 years time from now when ChatGPT is being used by basically everyone?
299200	303440	How do you prepare? Should you embrace it, fight against it or something else? Why jumped on a call
303440	308480	with Ed from Filmbooth who's been looking into this extensively to ask him just that.
308560	313120	So it's scary and it's exciting at the same time because it's writing scripts better than
313120	316880	people I've hired, not who I'm currently hiring, just in case they're watching. It's not better
316880	321760	than you guys. I'm using it every day for titles. I'm using it every day to tighten up scripts,
321760	328800	research. When I first came across AI of this nature, it was about two months before ChatGPT
328800	333920	and I was like, this is years off. And in two months, it's changed to the point where it's like,
333920	338160	the other day it went down and I felt anxious that I didn't have it. That's how much I'm using it.
338240	342160	It's an amazing tool. It's bad for new YouTubers. If they rely on it too much,
342160	346720	they're not going to learn the skills. I think over this time next year, it's going to have caused
346720	351760	huge amounts of content to flood to YouTube. Don't necessarily know if it's going to be the best.
351760	355840	I think for Search, it's just going to absolutely dominate. I think for Faceless Channels,
355840	360880	people who can find gaps and niches, it's going to be unbelievably good and amazingly profitable.
360880	364640	If it gets to the level, I think it's going to be pretty quick. But I worry that it's going to
364640	369760	make us all too lazy. It's only working off stuff that's already out there. The thing that drives
369760	374480	everything forward and makes being creative so wonderful is new things appear. We're not just
374480	380000	repeating old things. MrBeast created this whole style and a lot of people copied it.
380000	383200	Some people would argue that it ruined the entertainment side because everyone's copying
383200	389840	MrBeast. What we need is new concepts, new ideas, new creative and crazy out-of-the-box
389840	394000	thinking that I don't think AI can bring. But I also think it might bring a level where
394000	400000	maybe people can get by just using it, not pushing themselves. I feel like that could make
400000	405040	the platform very average if that wins. It's scary and exciting. What do you think of it?
406000	409360	It's really interesting. It's completely changing the game. At least a lot of people,
409360	412960	I've heard talk about it, say, oh, it's now we're going to replace human creativity,
412960	419280	but it's pretty damn good. I think to a point, it won't. I think a lot of creativity is just
419920	424960	people being really good at remixing ideas, even if it's just subconscious. At least in my experience,
424960	430480	it's very rare for someone to come with a completely unique original thing that has
430480	438800	no elements of anyone else's stuff involved in it. That's what chatGPT does. Download the
438800	442160	internet, takes lots of bits and pieces and puts it in. When you think about it, at least in my
442160	448400	view, it is very creative, even though it's AI. It isn't the writing side. I think when it comes
448400	454000	to editing, that's going to be a long way off and production. Yes, 100%. I like it. I do think in a
454000	457600	year's time, it's probably going to be the thing that we rely on more than anything else.
458320	463520	What are the skills that you think smart creators should double down on to future proof
463520	468080	themselves? That's a good question. I would lean into storytelling then. The whole point
468080	472320	about storytelling is there's the twists and turns, and there's structures you can follow,
472320	476320	and the whole point is to try and create emotional reactions. So, humor can do that.
476880	482480	There's a lot of views to be had playing it safe with content. Say I make a video about Ryan
482480	487600	Treyham. If I make a video about Ryan Treyham, there are no jokes. Very informative. Harness's
487600	493760	story structure, but it's kind of bland in that it's not about the personality of the presenter.
493760	497440	It's all about the story of the person they're talking about. What that does is it doesn't
497440	501680	put many people off. It doesn't necessarily create a bigger bond with the creator, but I've seen a lot
501680	507280	of these videos do very well that are kind of like people reporting, and I look at them and think
507840	513680	the AI can do that. What they can't do is all the weird stuff. So, I do stuff in my videos that I
513680	519120	know put people off, and I know I would get more views if I stopped dressing up as in weird outfits.
519120	523520	Because it's odd, right? The cold viewers can go, who the hell is this guy? But at the same time,
523520	526640	I look at it and I go, well, for every one of them that hates me, and for everyone that
526640	531360	stops me getting impressions, I have someone out there laughed, and they felt stronger,
532000	536400	and they felt a bond with me because of that. The AI is not going to have that power to be
536400	541120	thinking, how do I create a bond with a viewer? It's just information. So, I actually feel like
541120	545760	if you're relying heavily on matter of fact, that's a problem. You've got to be thinking more
546320	551760	creative, and how do I bond with people, not just report, because AI will just report
551760	556960	significantly faster and easier than you. Well, Ed, thanks so much for jumping on and
556960	560560	talking with us. If you want to check out Ed's channel, it will be linked down below. Also,
560560	565680	he has a new thumbnail course that is out. You can check that out down below as well. Now,
565680	571200	as Ed and I talked about, the AI is really good at generating words. However, it's not so good
571200	575520	at the technical creation process like video editing. And so, if you want to learn one way
575520	580000	to take your editing to the next level, watch the video on screen. It'll show you a really simple
580000	584880	thing that 97% of people aren't doing. It'll help you get more views, watch time, and subscribers.
584880	585200	Check it out.
