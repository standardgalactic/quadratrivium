00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
ChatGPT has changed YouTube forever. Despite only being released two months ago,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,440
YouTubers have been using it to get monumental results like this while tripling their productivity.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,760
So I'm going to show you some of my favorite ChatGPT hacks for YouTubers and also talk about

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,680
how ChatGPT will change the future of YouTube forever.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,720
Let's start at the beginning. On November 30th, 2022, ChatGPT was launched and in just

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,680
five days it had over 11 billion users, including Elon Musk, who said it was quote,

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,440
scary good. Seriously, at this stage, there are so many people using this damn software

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,840
that 50% of the time I load it up, it just crashes because the servers can't handle the volume.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,840
But what exactly is ChatGPT? Well, if you ask ChatGPT itself, it will say that it's an AI language

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,200
model, which is nerd speak that basically means it's kind of like a super smart virtual assistant

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,600
with the work ethic of a thousand Dwayne The Rock Johnson's. Let me show you what I mean.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
So let's say I'm trying to come up with fun video ideas for my Minecraft YouTube channel.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
I could log into ChatGPT and tell it to do something like give me fun video ideas for

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,480
my Minecraft YouTube channel. And these ideas are completely unique. They've been created from

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,040
scratch by the AI, meaning that they haven't just been scraped and copied and pasted from

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
somewhere on the internet. Now we've got a bunch of ideas here and you could tell it to continue

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,560
generating more and more and more ideas until you find one that clicks with you. But for the sake

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,120
of this example, let's just look at number eight on this list, role playing adventures. It sounds

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,880
like a cool idea. Let's see if we can flesh it out a little bit. Now I often like to come up with

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,640
my titles and thumbnails before I actually create my videos. So what I'm going to do is I'm going

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,680
to ask ChatGPT now to give me Minecraft YouTube video titles about me role playing as a potato.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
Yes, you heard that right. Wow. So as you can see, we've generated a list of video ideas. We've

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,960
picked an idea and now we've told ChatGPT to generate a list of titles for the specific idea

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,520
that stood out to it the most. And here they are. Now out of these, I actually find title number

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
three pretty funny. And now I'm up to the stage where I'd actually start brainstorming a script

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,560
or outline for my video. And in the name of laziness, ChatGPT can actually help out with this

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,800
as well. I can just tell it to create a script outline for this video. And what it generates is

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,960
insane. Look at this. It'll tell me to introduce myself and explain the concept of a role play

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,680
series. It'll tell me to set the scene by showing a potato farm where the journey begins. It'll tell

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,640
me to preview the goals of the journey and what a viewer can expect from the series, basically

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,400
foreshadowing, which is a really powerful storytelling technique. It's then going to give

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
me the different stages of the video. I should show the initial struggles of the potato character

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,120
trying to survive in a Minecraft world through to building a base for my potato character,

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
through to expanding that base into an empire, and then showcasing the challenges and triumphs

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,840
I encounter before finally summarizing my journey so far. And if this is a multi video series,

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,880
previewing what is to come in future episodes. And while sure, this is a relatively basic video

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,760
structure, honestly, it's probably better than 95% of the Minecraft role play videos out there.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
Now, we could tell ChatGPT to actually write a script for a video like this, but because

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
this video is going to be more of a playthrough style one, it probably wouldn't really work out.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
However, what we could do is tell it to write a script for the intro for the hook. Since that's

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
something we'll probably want to pre-plan so we can grab as many people and rope them into watching

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
the entire video. So all I have to do is ask ChatGPT and here's what it generates. And if you

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
don't like what it generates, you can actually tell it to generate something different and kind of

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
explain to it the way in which you want your script to be written. For example, I could tell

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
it to write the script in the style of MrBeast. And while it hasn't done a perfect job here,

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,160
there are definitely elements of this that we could take and use as inspiration for our intro.

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,840
For example, we could start the second paragraph here and intro our video like,

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
We start our journey as a potato, just like any other potato on a farm. But this isn't just an

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,400
ordinary potato, no sir. We have big dreams and even bigger plans, and we're going to take this

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,120
blocky world by storm and become the biggest, baddest potato Minecraft has ever seen.

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,520
Sure, it's kind of cringy, but again, it's probably better than 90 to 95% of the intro is out

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,120
there for this type of content. And finally, now that we've got our script in our structure,

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
we can tell ChatGPT to write our video description for us because that's incredibly boring and no

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
one wants to do that. Now this one's decent, descriptions don't matter that much. But let's

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,920
say this was a searchable video and descriptions do impact YouTube search. You could tell ChatGPT

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,800
to optimize this description for SEO and here's what it will do. And notice it adds in more

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,680
keywords and keyword phrases related to our video idea. Now obviously it could be improved,

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
but this is a pretty good foundation. And last but not least, now we have a description, maybe we

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,600
want to generate some tags for our video. Now this is okay, but it's going to be a pain for me to

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,200
individually copy and paste all of these tags into my video description. So I can just tell ChatGPT

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,960
to separate these tags with commas in between, and it'll create them in a way that I can just

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
literally copy and paste them straight into my YouTube video. And there we have it. Now obviously

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,480
this isn't a perfect video, but notice how long it took us to do all of this. This tool is phenomenally

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,280
powerful and it's still in beta. And that begs the question, what will the YouTube ecosystem look like

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,200
in three, five or even 10 years time from now when ChatGPT is being used by basically everyone?

66
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,440
How do you prepare? Should you embrace it, fight against it or something else? Why jumped on a call

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,480
with Ed from Filmbooth who's been looking into this extensively to ask him just that.

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
So it's scary and it's exciting at the same time because it's writing scripts better than

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,880
people I've hired, not who I'm currently hiring, just in case they're watching. It's not better

70
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,760
than you guys. I'm using it every day for titles. I'm using it every day to tighten up scripts,

71
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,800
research. When I first came across AI of this nature, it was about two months before ChatGPT

72
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,920
and I was like, this is years off. And in two months, it's changed to the point where it's like,

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,160
the other day it went down and I felt anxious that I didn't have it. That's how much I'm using it.

74
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,160
It's an amazing tool. It's bad for new YouTubers. If they rely on it too much,

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,720
they're not going to learn the skills. I think over this time next year, it's going to have caused

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,760
huge amounts of content to flood to YouTube. Don't necessarily know if it's going to be the best.

77
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,840
I think for Search, it's just going to absolutely dominate. I think for Faceless Channels,

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
people who can find gaps and niches, it's going to be unbelievably good and amazingly profitable.

79
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,640
If it gets to the level, I think it's going to be pretty quick. But I worry that it's going to

80
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,760
make us all too lazy. It's only working off stuff that's already out there. The thing that drives

81
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,480
everything forward and makes being creative so wonderful is new things appear. We're not just

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,000
repeating old things. MrBeast created this whole style and a lot of people copied it.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,200
Some people would argue that it ruined the entertainment side because everyone's copying

84
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,840
MrBeast. What we need is new concepts, new ideas, new creative and crazy out-of-the-box

85
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
thinking that I don't think AI can bring. But I also think it might bring a level where

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
maybe people can get by just using it, not pushing themselves. I feel like that could make

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,040
the platform very average if that wins. It's scary and exciting. What do you think of it?

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
It's really interesting. It's completely changing the game. At least a lot of people,

89
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,960
I've heard talk about it, say, oh, it's now we're going to replace human creativity,

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,280
but it's pretty damn good. I think to a point, it won't. I think a lot of creativity is just

91
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,960
people being really good at remixing ideas, even if it's just subconscious. At least in my experience,

92
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,480
it's very rare for someone to come with a completely unique original thing that has

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,800
no elements of anyone else's stuff involved in it. That's what chatGPT does. Download the

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
internet, takes lots of bits and pieces and puts it in. When you think about it, at least in my

95
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,400
view, it is very creative, even though it's AI. It isn't the writing side. I think when it comes

96
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,000
to editing, that's going to be a long way off and production. Yes, 100%. I like it. I do think in a

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,600
year's time, it's probably going to be the thing that we rely on more than anything else.

98
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,520
What are the skills that you think smart creators should double down on to future proof

99
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
themselves? That's a good question. I would lean into storytelling then. The whole point

100
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,320
about storytelling is there's the twists and turns, and there's structures you can follow,

101
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,320
and the whole point is to try and create emotional reactions. So, humor can do that.

102
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,480
There's a lot of views to be had playing it safe with content. Say I make a video about Ryan

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,600
Treyham. If I make a video about Ryan Treyham, there are no jokes. Very informative. Harness's

104
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,760
story structure, but it's kind of bland in that it's not about the personality of the presenter.

105
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,440
It's all about the story of the person they're talking about. What that does is it doesn't

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
put many people off. It doesn't necessarily create a bigger bond with the creator, but I've seen a lot

107
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,280
of these videos do very well that are kind of like people reporting, and I look at them and think

108
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,680
the AI can do that. What they can't do is all the weird stuff. So, I do stuff in my videos that I

109
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
know put people off, and I know I would get more views if I stopped dressing up as in weird outfits.

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,520
Because it's odd, right? The cold viewers can go, who the hell is this guy? But at the same time,

111
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,640
I look at it and I go, well, for every one of them that hates me, and for everyone that

112
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,360
stops me getting impressions, I have someone out there laughed, and they felt stronger,

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,400
and they felt a bond with me because of that. The AI is not going to have that power to be

114
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,120
thinking, how do I create a bond with a viewer? It's just information. So, I actually feel like

115
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,760
if you're relying heavily on matter of fact, that's a problem. You've got to be thinking more

116
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,760
creative, and how do I bond with people, not just report, because AI will just report

117
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,960
significantly faster and easier than you. Well, Ed, thanks so much for jumping on and

118
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,560
talking with us. If you want to check out Ed's channel, it will be linked down below. Also,

119
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,680
he has a new thumbnail course that is out. You can check that out down below as well. Now,

120
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,200
as Ed and I talked about, the AI is really good at generating words. However, it's not so good

121
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,520
at the technical creation process like video editing. And so, if you want to learn one way

122
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,000
to take your editing to the next level, watch the video on screen. It'll show you a really simple

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,880
thing that 97% of people aren't doing. It'll help you get more views, watch time, and subscribers.

124
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,200
Check it out.
