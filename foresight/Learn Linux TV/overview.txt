1. **Ubuntu Software Center**: This is the primary application installer in Ubuntu. It provides a user-friendly interface to search, install, remove, and update applications available in the official Ubuntu repositories. You can access it by clicking on the "Applications" icon in your dock and selecting "Ubuntu Software".

2. **Searching for Applications**: Use the search bar within Ubuntu Software to find applications you want to install. If an application is not available in the repositories, you can often find it on the official website or in a downloadable archive (.deb file).

3. **Installing Applications from Websites**: When an application is not in the repositories, you can download the installation file (usually a `.deb` for Ubuntu) directly from the developer's website. This typically involves downloading the file, opening it, and entering your password to install.

4. **Google Chrome Example**: Google Chrome is not available in the Ubuntu repositories due to licensing restrictions. You can download it directly from the official Google Chrome website by selecting the correct package for Linux (Ubuntu), clicking "Accept and Install," saving the file, and then installing it using a file manager or a terminal command like `sudo dpkg -i path/to/file.deb`.

5. **Updating Applications**: The "Updates" tab in Ubuntu Software can be used to check for and install updates for the applications you have installed, as well as system updates.

6. **Removing Unwanted Applications**: You can uninstall applications you no longer need by right-clicking on them in Ubuntu Software and selecting "Remove."

7. **Additional Tips**:
   - Always ensure you trust the source of any software you download and install outside of the official repositories.
   - Keep your system updated for security and performance reasons.
   - Explore both Ubuntu Software and the command line (via Terminal) for different methods to manage applications.
