0	25000	Hello, and welcome back to LearnLenux TV.
25000	35000	In today's video, I am going to give all of you Ubuntu beginners out there an entire video dedicated to getting you started with running Ubuntu on your laptop or desktop.
36000	40000	I'm going to talk to you about some considerations, things to think about before you install it.
41000	48000	And then I'll walk you through the installation process both with a full install walkthrough as well as a walkthrough on dual booting with Windows 10.
49000	54000	And then I'm going to show you how to use Ubuntu, how to install software. It's going to be great.
55000	59000	Before we get into that, I want to take a moment to mention my sponsor Linode.
60000	67000	Linode has been doing cloud computing since 2003, which is actually before Amazon Web Services was even a thing.
68000	72000	On Linode's platform, you can get your server up and running in minutes.
73000	83000	And they include all of the popular distributions such as CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and get this also Arch Linux.
84000	91000	And let's be honest, what could be better than a Linux cloud server provider that allows you to tell all of your friends, I run Arch.
92000	96000	Linode has multiple server plans available to make any app scalable and flexible.
97000	109000	You can use it to host a blog, set up a VPN server, a Minecraft server, or you can do what I did and set up a website for your YouTube channel because the official website for LearnLenux TV runs on Linode.
109000	118000	And Linode offers 24 by 7, 365 support, regardless of plan size, so you can get live help from a real person when you need it.
119000	124000	New users can get started right now with $100 in credit towards a new account.
125000	128000	And I highly recommend you check them out because Linode is awesome.
130000	136000	And I want to extend a special thank you to Linode for their continued sponsorship of LearnLenux TV. I really appreciate it.
137000	145000	Also, I want to let you guys know that I have a new book available. It's called Mastering Ubuntu Server Third Edition, and it's available right now.
146000	152000	The third edition includes some new content such as a chapter on Kubernetes, a chapter on AWS, and more.
153000	159000	And it turned out really well if I do say so myself. So please check it out at ubuntuserverbook.com.
160000	163000	And if you've already read it, please leave a review somewhere that would really help me out.
163000	167000	So with all of that out of the way, let's go ahead and get started.
180000	184000	Alright, so what I'm going to do is show you how to install Ubuntu.
185000	190000	But before we can do that, we need to actually create bootable media that we can use for the installation process.
190000	197000	And here I am actually on a Windows desktop because I know a lot of you out there are actually coming from Windows.
198000	205000	So I wanted to show you guys the process of creating bootable media for use for installing Ubuntu from a Windows machine.
206000	209000	But it really doesn't matter which operating system you are currently running.
210000	217000	You could also be running macOS for all I care because the tool that I'm going to use is the same regardless of your current operating system.
218000	223000	So to get started, what we should do is open up a web browser. I have Firefox installed right here.
224000	226000	And we want to go to ubuntu.com.
228000	231000	And here on the website, we can click on the download button.
233000	239000	And then here where it shows Ubuntu desktop, we can choose LTS or the non-LTS release.
240000	243000	Now, if you need a long-term support release, you would go with this one.
244000	248000	But if you want something more bleeding edge, then you would go with the newer version.
249000	252000	The version number basically works out as year and then month.
253000	255000	So here we can see 2020, April.
256000	258000	And then this one is 2020 and then 10.
259000	263000	But we simply refer to it as 2004 or 2010.
264000	268000	And depending on when you are watching this video, there could be other versions shown here.
268000	274000	But the basic thing to understand is that the LTS version stands for long-term support.
275000	277000	It's supported for up to five years with security updates.
278000	286000	And then the non-LTS release is supported for just nine months, which means that you will need to upgrade within nine months to stay current.
287000	289000	Otherwise, you will stop getting security updates.
290000	292000	So again, I'm going to leave that up to you.
293000	296000	For most people, I like to go with the LTS release.
296000	304000	But if you have just purchased a brand new computer, you probably want to go with 2010 because the newer version is going to have newer drivers.
305000	307000	But again, I'll leave that up to you.
308000	311000	In my case, I will actually download the latest version.
313000	315000	And the download automatically started.
316000	322000	Now, the file format is an ISO file, which historically has been used to create DVDs and CDs.
323000	328000	Basically, the ISO format is a clone of a CD or a DVD in file form.
329000	335000	And even though we really don't burn DVDs or CDs so much anymore, the file format has remained the same.
336000	338000	We'll actually use a flash drive for the installation.
339000	343000	So don't worry that this is a format that is specifically catering to CDs and DVDs.
344000	345000	We can still use it.
346000	349000	The format is now pretty much universal, but the name has remained the same.
349000	352000	I'll click OK to actually start the download.
353000	354000	You can see that it is downloading here.
355000	356000	So it's going to take a few minutes.
357000	366000	And then what we also should download is a utility that we can use to actually turn that ISO file into media that we can actually boot from.
367000	369000	So we'll need to download something called USB imager.
370000	371000	So I'm just typing it here in the search.
372000	373000	That should be all I need to do.
374000	376000	USB imager all one word, no space.
376000	380000	And we're looking for a GitLab page like we see here.
381000	382000	So let's go to that.
383000	385000	And I will have links in the description down below.
386000	389000	So you could basically just click on those links and go directly to the things you need.
390000	391000	You don't actually have to search.
392000	399000	And the reason why I like this tool is because regardless of which operating system you are currently running,
400000	403000	you'll be able to use the same tool to create bootable media.
403000	408000	As you can see, we have a version for Windows, Mac OS, and even versions of Linux.
409000	414000	So again, regardless of what you are currently running, you'll be able to use USB imager.
415000	419000	So I only have to describe the process once and it works for any operating system.
420000	422000	So in my case, I'll download the Windows version.
423000	425000	You just download whatever one matches your current operating system.
426000	430000	So I will save the file and that file will download super quick because it's super small.
430000	434000	As you can see, it's only 142 kilobytes.
435000	441000	Now the Ubuntu file here is going to take a little bit more time to download because it's much larger at around 2.7 gigabytes.
442000	443000	As of the time I'm recording this video.
444000	447000	So I'll give it a minute to download and then I'll be right back.
450000	453000	So at this point, both of these files have finished downloading.
454000	455000	So I shouldn't need the browser anymore.
456000	461000	And if I go to the file manager here and then into the downloads directory,
462000	464000	you can see that I have both of the files downloaded.
465000	467000	So I will extract USB imager.
471000	475000	Let's go ahead and open that up and we get this little warning alert.
476000	478000	It's fine. I'll just click more info, run anyway.
480000	482000	And let's go ahead and get that running and it is.
483000	488000	So this is USB imager, the utility that we will use to create bootable media.
489000	491000	And this will erase everything on the flash drive.
492000	500000	So if there is anything important on your flash drive, make sure that you back that up because we'll need to dedicate the flash drive for this process.
501000	503000	So the first thing that we will do is click right here.
504000	505000	We will select the image that we've downloaded.
506000	507000	Here's the Ubuntu ISO image.
508000	509000	So open that up.
510000	511000	Now that's selected.
512000	513000	Close this.
514000	515000	You don't need that anymore.
516000	520000	And then the next thing we'll do is select the flash drive that we want to use for this purpose.
521000	524000	So I will insert my flash drive right here.
527000	532000	And you can see that it immediately selected the flash drive here on this list.
533000	536000	If you have more than one flash drive on your computer, then this will actually show more than one.
537000	540000	Just make sure that you are selecting the correct flash drive.
540000	543000	I only have the one, which is this one right here.
544000	545000	We know it's not the card reader.
546000	547000	So this is the only option.
548000	551000	So what I will do is click the right button right here to begin the process.
552000	553000	And it starts immediately.
554000	556000	You can see down here a progress bar is starting to fill up.
557000	560000	It's telling me it's going to take about a minute or so for this to finish.
561000	563000	So I will let this finish and then I'll be right back.
565000	566000	All right.
567000	568000	So the process has completed.
568000	571000	I have successfully written the ISO image to the flash drive,
572000	577000	and I can now use it to boot my computer into Ubuntu and start the process.
578000	581000	And the method that you will utilize to do that depends on your computer.
582000	586000	With Dell, for example, it's usually F12 to access the boot menu.
587000	588000	It varies from one computer to another.
589000	591000	But essentially what you do is you reboot your computer,
592000	593000	make sure the flash drive is inserted,
593000	597000	and then you press whatever key combination you need to press at the beginning
598000	600000	of the boot process to activate the boot menu.
601000	604000	And then you select the flash drive as the boot option.
605000	608000	And then if all goes well, it should actually boot right into Ubuntu.
609000	612000	So in the next section, what I'm going to do is give you guys some tips
613000	618000	on how you can test compatibility with Ubuntu on your computer before you install it.
623000	635000	So once you have booted from the installation media that we've created,
636000	637000	you will see this screen right here,
638000	642000	which is giving us the option to try Ubuntu or go straight into the installation.
643000	645000	Now I highly recommend that you try it first.
646000	649000	And what that will do is actually allow you to test compatibility
649000	653000	before you actually go and install Ubuntu on your computer.
654000	656000	So I'll click try Ubuntu right here.
659000	660000	And then after you click that button,
661000	664000	you will actually be using the Ubuntu desktop already.
665000	666000	We haven't even installed it yet.
667000	670000	It's actually running off the flash drive in what's called live mode,
671000	673000	which allows you to demo Ubuntu before you install it.
674000	678000	To actually install Ubuntu, you will click on this icon right here to do that.
679000	680000	But we're not going to do that yet.
681000	686000	Before we actually install Ubuntu, we need to make sure that it works on our computer first.
687000	689000	Now Ubuntu has great hardware compatibility.
690000	692000	It's among the best, but it's not 100%.
693000	696000	No operating system has 100% compatibility.
697000	700000	Ubuntu is supported on the majority of hardware out there,
701000	704000	but the onus is on you to verify compatibility before you install it.
704000	708000	What I have seen a lot of people do is go straight to the installation
709000	711000	by double clicking here to open up the installer,
712000	715000	and then they'll just navigate straight through, blow away their current operating system.
716000	719000	And then when it's done, they will create a message in a Linux help forum
720000	723000	or maybe a Linux Facebook group and then ask for help.
724000	725000	You know, Ubuntu doesn't work.
726000	728000	I can access the internet or something like that.
729000	731000	And you know, I'm very happy to help people that are in that situation,
731000	734000	but I do feel that that's a situation that should never happen.
735000	741000	Why? Because again, we need to test compatibility before we blow away our current operating system.
742000	746000	And that's why I had you click the try Ubuntu button instead of the install button.
747000	750000	First and foremost, we need to make sure that we have a network connection.
751000	754000	In the upper right hand corner here, we have a menu we can drop down,
755000	757000	and then we could find out if we have an internet connection.
757000	761000	Now this laptop has Wi-Fi and I haven't even added my Wi-Fi password yet.
762000	767000	So if I open up a web browser and we have Firefox pre-installed right here,
768000	772000	if I go to my website, obviously it's not going to work.
774000	776000	So let's go ahead and get connected to Wi-Fi then.
777000	782000	If you have a Wi-Fi card that is supported, then you should have an option here to connect to Wi-Fi.
783000	785000	So if I click on that and then click select network,
785000	789000	it's going to show me a list of Wi-Fi networks that are in my area.
790000	793000	Now if you don't even have a Wi-Fi option at all in that menu,
794000	796000	or if you do and it shows no networks here,
797000	800000	despite the fact that you are sure there's a Wi-Fi network near you,
801000	804000	that probably means that your Wi-Fi card is not supported.
805000	809000	And you should not install Ubuntu until you find out how to fix that.
809000	815000	Sometimes it comes down to replacing the Wi-Fi card with a known working Wi-Fi card.
816000	819000	Other times there might be specific instructions to get that going.
820000	822000	Most of the time you will have no problems.
823000	827000	On most hardware, Ubuntu will find the Wi-Fi card and be able to use it no problem.
828000	831000	But there are a few Wi-Fi cards out there that are not supported.
832000	835000	So if you do not have an option to connect to Wi-Fi and that is something you need to be able to do,
835000	841000	do not continue, make sure you go to a Linux help forum, a Facebook group,
842000	844000	or even the community forums for this very channel.
845000	849000	Tell us what the model is of the computer that you're trying to install Ubuntu on.
850000	853000	And maybe we can help you try to find out why you don't have that option.
854000	857000	But I do, so I will click on my Wi-Fi network here and connect to it.
858000	859000	I'll add the password.
860000	864000	Click connect.
865000	866000	And now we are connected.
867000	871000	Right here it actually shows that the Wi-Fi icon has some signal.
872000	879000	If I refresh this page here, you can see that we are actually able to view this web page.
880000	884000	Now if you don't even have a Wi-Fi card and you're just going to plug in an Ethernet cable,
885000	887000	then this step probably worked just fine already.
887000	893000	You probably have an icon up here that will be in the same place as this Wi-Fi icon is,
894000	896000	but it will have the icon of an Ethernet jack instead.
897000	900000	But if you can get to a web page, as you can see, I'm able to do here,
901000	905000	then already you know that internet is working just fine and it passes that test.
906000	908000	Another thing that you should do is just click on a video.
909000	910000	You can go to YouTube for example, watch a video.
911000	914000	That gives you an opportunity to test the audio to make sure that that works.
914000	920000	And you know, it even gives you the opportunity to make sure that the video playback is acceptable as well.
921000	926000	If you intend to use multiple monitors, I highly recommend that you plug one in to make sure that that's working just fine.
927000	934000	And if you have an opportunity to test all of the hardware that you intend to use on your computer with Ubuntu and everything works fine,
935000	938000	then you should be all set and ready to go to go ahead and get the installation going.
940000	942000	And that's exactly what I'm going to do in the next section.
942000	945000	I'm going to walk you through an entire installation.
946000	950000	I will show you how to install Ubuntu as the only operating system on your computer.
951000	956000	And then I will also show you the process of setting up a dual boot with Windows as well in a separate section.
957000	961000	So if you want to do a full install, check out the next section in this very video.
962000	965000	If you want to do a dual boot, then skip that section and then move on to the one after it.
966000	971000	But at this point, I'm going to assume that you have backed up everything that is important on your computer.
972000	976000	If you plan on doing a full install and wiping the current operating system, that's especially important.
977000	983000	But even if you plan on doing a dual boot with Windows and you have content on your Windows partition that you want to keep,
984000	987000	I still recommend that you back that up just in case something goes wrong.
988000	994000	So go ahead and make sure that everything is backed up on your computer and then we can go ahead and get Ubuntu installed.
1003000	1013000	In the previous section of the video, I've gone over a few of the things that you should test before you install Ubuntu.
1014000	1018000	So at this point, I'm going to assume that you have backed up everything that's important on your computer
1019000	1022000	and you have already tested the hardware to make sure that it's compatible.
1023000	1026000	Assuming all of that checks out, we can go ahead and get the installation started.
1027000	1031000	And in this section, I am going to walk you through the full installation of Ubuntu,
1032000	1038000	which means erasing your entire hard drive and installing Ubuntu as the only operating system on your computer.
1039000	1045000	If you would like to set up a dual boot with Windows, then move on to the next section directly after this one in this same video,
1046000	1049000	because that's the next thing that I'm going to walk you through how to do.
1050000	1052000	So anyway, I will double click here on install Ubuntu.
1053000	1055000	And then here we have the installer.
1056000	1061000	So the first screen is basically allowing you to set the language for the installation process.
1062000	1063000	Hit defaults to English, at least for me.
1064000	1069000	If your language is something else, you could basically just go through the list until you find yours and select it accordingly.
1070000	1071000	But I'm going to leave it as English.
1072000	1073000	I'll click continue.
1074000	1076000	And then next we have an opportunity to set the keyboard layout.
1077000	1080000	So just make sure that you actually choose the right thing.
1081000	1084000	You can attempt to do a detection if you want it to be automatically selected.
1085000	1088000	I like to manually select it to make sure that I have what I think I have.
1089000	1091000	And then you can type in this box right here to test the keyboard,
1092000	1096000	as well as any special keys you may have to ensure that everything is working properly.
1097000	1098000	So we'll continue.
1099000	1100000	And then we have some options.
1101000	1102000	We could do a normal or a minimal installation.
1102000	1106000	I recommend you do a normal installation that gives you a full suite of software.
1107000	1113000	Advanced users might like the minimal option because that does not include all of the pre-included software here.
1114000	1116000	Just a few things like a web browser and some basic utilities.
1117000	1119000	So I recommend that you do the normal installation.
1120000	1121000	So that's what I'm going to do.
1122000	1123000	Downloading updates while installing Ubuntu.
1124000	1125000	That's a good idea.
1126000	1127000	There still might be some additional updates after the fact.
1127000	1134000	But having this box checked right here will make sure that at least some of the updates are installed as you install the distribution.
1135000	1140000	I'm going to uncheck it though in my case because having this checked is just going to make the recording footage longer.
1141000	1142000	So I'll leave it up to you to check that box.
1143000	1149000	And I'm not going to check this box right here either because that's going to add additional time to the recording.
1150000	1151000	But I do recommend that you check this box.
1152000	1153000	I recommend that you check both.
1153000	1161000	And what this box will do is make sure that if there's any extra software or drivers that's required for any hardware you may have,
1162000	1166000	there's a better chance that you will have that software set up automatically by choosing this option.
1167000	1168000	So I will leave that up to you.
1169000	1170000	But I do recommend that you choose both of these.
1171000	1172000	I will not.
1173000	1175000	Again, it's just going to make the recording a bit longer.
1176000	1177000	So we'll continue.
1178000	1183000	Now in my case, it's detecting that I already have an operating system on the hard drive.
1184000	1188000	And in your case, it's probably going to show that you have an operating system already as well.
1189000	1193000	Although instead of POPOS, yours will probably say Windows or something like that.
1194000	1200000	Some of you might actually be installing a brand new hard drive, although fewer of you will be using a brand new hard drive.
1200000	1207000	So what we want to do is choose the option to erase the disk and install Ubuntu as you can see right here.
1208000	1210000	There are some advanced features that we can utilize here.
1211000	1216000	For example, we can actually use ZFS and LVM as well.
1217000	1221000	And using LVM gives you the ability to encrypt your entire hard drive,
1222000	1225000	which means you will have a password that you'll need to enter anytime you boot.
1226000	1227000	Now that's a bit beyond the scope.
1228000	1229000	You can enable the encryption if you want to.
1230000	1233000	I'm going to cancel this and just leave it selected erase disk.
1234000	1238000	I'll click install now and then I'll click continue.
1239000	1243000	And it's actually installing in the background, but we have a few more screens to answer here.
1244000	1249000	So on this map screen, you are basically going to click wherever on this map you happen to be.
1250000	1253000	That'll set your locale as well as your time zone.
1254000	1258000	And I'm closer to Detroit, so I just basically clicked right here and set it to Detroit.
1258000	1263000	As you can see, just go ahead and set it to wherever your location happens to be and click continue.
1264000	1266000	Then we can put on our user information right here.
1267000	1269000	So I'll just put in my name for the computer name.
1270000	1271000	I'll just call it ThinkPad.
1272000	1273000	I think that's good enough.
1274000	1276000	I'll leave the username as my first name in lower case.
1277000	1278000	That's the username that you'll use to log in with.
1279000	1282000	Although in Ubuntu, you don't actually have to type the username to log in.
1283000	1285000	And then I'll just go ahead and type in the password here.
1286000	1288000	And we have an option to log in automatically.
1289000	1297000	I don't recommend that you choose that unless maybe this is for an internet kiosk or some kind of computer that you want everyone to access very, very easily.
1298000	1300000	It's common to need a password to log in anyway.
1301000	1307000	If you are trying to join an active directory domain and utilize that for authentication, you could check this box.
1308000	1313000	That's beyond the scope of this video, but enterprise users out there would likely want to check that box.
1313000	1314000	So we'll continue.
1315000	1317000	And it's wrapping up the rest of the installation.
1318000	1326000	We have this little slideshow here that we can click through to see some details and some tidbits of knowledge about Ubuntu.
1327000	1329000	I'll leave it up to you to click through that if you'd like.
1330000	1334000	But what I'll do is just fast forward through this installation process and then I'll be right back.
1335000	1337000	All right, so the installation is complete.
1338000	1341000	So let's go ahead and click on the restart button here.
1343000	1346000	And then I'll remove the flash drive and then press enter.
1347000	1350000	And if all goes well, it should boot into the brand new installation.
1351000	1357000	And although you can't actually see this, my screen recorder isn't actually able to start recording until it's done.
1357000	1365000	And although you can't actually see this, my screen recorder isn't actually able to start recording until after I log in, but I see a login screen.
1366000	1369000	So I'm just clicking my name and then I'll type my password.
1372000	1376000	And then now that I've logged in, this is the first screen that I see right here.
1377000	1379000	It's giving me an option to connect to online accounts.
1380000	1391000	If I have an account and any of these services, I can go ahead and click on it, put in my user information, and then I can benefit from things like calendar syncing, contact syncing and things like that.
1392000	1393000	I'll skip it for now.
1394000	1401000	And then here it's asking us to help improve Ubuntu by sending them information about our computer and the installation.
1402000	1406000	And you can click right here to see what the actual information is that it wants to send over.
1407000	1410000	And as you can see, nothing here is personally identifiable.
1411000	1412000	So this is not a privacy concern.
1413000	1415000	Basically, this distribution is free.
1416000	1426000	So if all canonical, the makers of Ubuntu are asking for is to get some information about the computer to help improve Ubuntu and the compatibility it has with hardware.
1427000	1428000	I think that's a very fair trade off.
1429000	1432000	Now I'm actually not going to send that info along because I've already done so.
1432000	1437000	I've installed Ubuntu on this laptop probably dozens of times by now.
1438000	1445000	So they definitely have that information, but I think that's a good thing to send along as a thank you for making this distribution available to us for free.
1446000	1447000	So I'll click next.
1448000	1451000	And then we have the option to enable location services.
1452000	1454000	And you can leave this off by default if you'd like.
1455000	1461000	If you do plan on using something like a map application or something like that, you might consider turning that on.
1462000	1463000	I'll leave that up to you.
1464000	1468000	Now this screen is telling us that we are all set and ready to go.
1469000	1475000	You see some icons here that represent some of the more popular applications that we can choose to install on Ubuntu if we would like to do so.
1476000	1478000	This is not an extensive list here.
1479000	1480000	Just some of the highlights.
1481000	1484000	If you'd like to install one of these apps, you can simply click on the icon for that app.
1485000	1489000	And as you can see that opened up Spotify, I can click on install.
1490000	1491000	I can put in my password.
1492000	1494000	The same password I used to log in with.
1496000	1498000	And it's installing the app as you can see.
1504000	1507000	And now as you can see Spotify is installed.
1508000	1514000	Now I will go over how to install applications in more detail in a section that comes later on in this very video.
1515000	1520000	And you could basically open the software app from this button right here.
1521000	1522000	But again, we'll be going over that soon.
1523000	1524000	So don't worry about that for now.
1525000	1529000	But in terms of this section, we did successfully install Ubuntu.
1530000	1532000	So we're all set and ready to go.
1545000	1552000	Alright, so in this section of the video, what I'm going to do is walk you through dual booting Ubuntu with Windows 10.
1553000	1561000	Now if you want to do a full install, the previous section of this video will walk you through that if you want Ubuntu to be the only operating system.
1562000	1565000	But in this section, we are going to actually set up a dual boot.
1566000	1571000	So I'm going to assume at this point that you already have Windows installed on your computer.
1571000	1577000	In my case, if I go to the disk management, and I can go there by right clicking on the start button here.
1578000	1579000	Then I go to disk management.
1580000	1582000	Just to give you an idea of how the disk is set up here.
1583000	1587000	You can basically see that the entire hard drive is dedicated to Windows.
1591000	1595000	And we can see that right here I have a one terabyte SSD on this computer.
1596000	1600000	Now if your Windows installation is not using the entire hard drive, then that's okay.
1601000	1608000	But anyway, most of you guys that want to do a dual boot will have a Windows installation that takes up the entire hard drive.
1609000	1612000	Similar to how I am setting up this tutorial right here.
1613000	1616000	In a previous section of the video, I showed you how to create bootable media.
1617000	1620000	So I'm going to assume that you have already done that.
1621000	1624000	And with the flash drive inserted into your computer, you can go ahead and restart it.
1625000	1630000	Then at the beginning, you just press whatever key combination you need to press in order to access the boot menu.
1631000	1636000	And then we can select the flash drive as the boot medium that we will use to boot our computer.
1640000	1644000	Now here we have an option to try Ubuntu or install Ubuntu.
1645000	1650000	And what I'm going to do is actually click the try Ubuntu button because we don't want to install Ubuntu just yet.
1650000	1655000	We want to make sure that Ubuntu is compatible with our hardware before we install it.
1656000	1658000	So I'll click the try Ubuntu button.
1660000	1664000	And then as you can see here, we already have the Ubuntu desktop on our screen.
1665000	1670000	Now Ubuntu will run a bit slower in live mode than it will run when you install it on the actual hardware.
1671000	1677000	But it's very important that you try it before you install it so that way you don't install it just to find out that it's not compatible.
1678000	1683000	So now that we know that this computer is compatible, as far as we can tell with Ubuntu, we can go ahead and install it.
1684000	1688000	So right here on the desktop, we have an install icon. If I double click on that.
1690000	1691000	Up comes the installer.
1692000	1697000	So the very first screen is just asking us to select the language that we will use for the installation process.
1698000	1703000	And you can scroll through the language list here if your actual language is not English.
1703000	1707000	English is the default here in my case. So I will click continue.
1709000	1716000	And then if you are using a keyboard type that is not the one that's selected, you can go through and choose the keyboard type that you have.
1717000	1719000	And then the variation of the keyboard that you have.
1720000	1726000	And then you can click into this box right here to basically just test to make sure that everything is working fine.
1727000	1728000	Then we can continue.
1729000	1734000	And now we have an option for normal installation or minimal installation.
1735000	1737000	Now I recommend that everyone go with normal installation.
1738000	1740000	That gives you a full suite of software here.
1741000	1747000	You get an office suite, a web browser, utilities, games, media players, things like that.
1748000	1752000	And alternatively you can choose to install the minimal version of Ubuntu,
1752000	1755000	which only includes the web browser and basic utilities.
1756000	1759000	None of the other things such as games will be installed in that case.
1760000	1765000	Unless you really do want to have a trimmed down install and then select the applications that you want accordingly.
1766000	1769000	I recommend that you actually choose the normal installation option.
1770000	1773000	In this box right here to have it download updates while installing.
1774000	1775000	I recommend you keep that checked.
1776000	1780000	It's not actually going to install all updates, but it will install a great deal of them.
1780000	1782000	So it's just less to do after the install.
1783000	1784000	So there's no reason not to check this box.
1785000	1791000	Although on my end I'm going to uncheck it because having that checked is just going to add unnecessary time to the recording.
1792000	1794000	But I do recommend that you check that on your side.
1795000	1804000	And I also recommend that you check this box here where it says install third party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats.
1805000	1813000	Basically what that is is just giving you the ability to have some pre-installed drivers to support some common pieces of hardware.
1814000	1818000	There's no reason not to select this because it's just going to make your experience that much smoother.
1819000	1822000	So I actually recommend that you check both of these boxes even though I'm not.
1823000	1828000	Because again you know I'm recording a video and the more I choose here the longer this recording is going to take.
1829000	1830000	So I'll click continue.
1831000	1836000	Now here is where the installation instructions actually diverge.
1837000	1844000	In the previous section of this video I walked you through a full installation where you will actually wipe out the entire hard drive.
1845000	1851000	In this case we want to actually create a dual boot between Windows and Ubuntu so we don't want to wipe the entire drive.
1852000	1854000	So with the previous section I had you choose this option.
1855000	1856000	Don't choose this option right here.
1857000	1858000	This will erase Windows and everything on your drive.
1858000	1865000	We are going to leave the selection here where the verbate shows that we can install Ubuntu alongside Windows.
1866000	1867000	That's what we want to do.
1868000	1870000	So we're going to leave that option there and click continue.
1872000	1880000	Now before we go any further I'm hoping that you have already backed up your computer even though this process has never failed me.
1881000	1882000	It's worked just fine.
1883000	1886000	We're dealing with computers which means we are dealing with chaos theory basically.
1887000	1894000	And you know something can go wrong and if we make a mistake or something like that we don't want to have data that we just can't get back.
1895000	1898000	So what I recommend just make sure you have everything backed up.
1899000	1906000	Now on this screen here we are basically choosing how much space to allocate to Windows and how much space to allocate to Ubuntu.
1907000	1909000	And what you can do is just move the mouse here to the center.
1910000	1913000	The cursor kind of turns into a double arrow icon.
1913000	1918000	If you hold the left mouse button you can drag it to the left and you can drag it to the right.
1919000	1922000	Dragging it to the left gives more space to Ubuntu.
1923000	1926000	Dragging it to the right gives more space to Windows.
1927000	1933000	So depending on how much you use one over the other will determine how much space you should give one or the other.
1935000	1937000	I'm going to leave it there somewhere in the middle.
1938000	1939000	It's good enough for me.
1939000	1942000	You definitely want to make sure you don't give too little space to one or the other.
1943000	1949000	You basically want to have some room to you know grow and install applications and store files and things like that.
1950000	1953000	So again I'll put it here in the middle and then I'll click install now.
1956000	1959000	And then I will click continue to finalize the changes.
1961000	1962000	Then continue again.
1964000	1967000	And now Ubuntu is actually installing in the background.
1967000	1971000	But we still have a few more screens to go before we are done with the configuration.
1972000	1978000	So here basically what we'll want to do is click on the map wherever we are located geographically.
1979000	1983000	So I'm closer to Detroit so I'm going to put the little dot right here by clicking on it.
1984000	1987000	And what that does is it sets your locale and your time zone.
1988000	1992000	So just make sure that you put this dot as close as you can get it to where you actually are.
1993000	1994000	And then we'll continue.
1995000	1998000	And then here we fill out information for our user account.
1999000	2000000	So I'll go ahead and put in my information here.
2001000	2004000	And then for the computer name I will just call it ThinkPad.
2005000	2006000	I think that's a simpler name to use.
2007000	2012000	That's the name that the computer will be known as on the network if you do any file sharing or something like that.
2013000	2015000	Here we are choosing a password for the user account.
2016000	2018000	I'll just go ahead and type in the password that I want it to be.
2019000	2024000	And it's not the greatest password in the world but you know this is just an example.
2025000	2028000	And I'm going to leave the selection here to require the password to log in.
2029000	2034000	If I was to choose the log in automatically option it's going to do exactly what it shows.
2035000	2036000	It's going to log us in automatically.
2037000	2041000	And unless you are setting up an internet kiosk you probably don't want to do that.
2042000	2049000	And then if you are using Ubuntu in the enterprise and you have Active Directory you can choose this box right here to enable that option.
2050000	2051000	That's beyond the scope of this video though.
2052000	2054000	So let's continue because we have everything filled out.
2058000	2061000	And the installation is going to go ahead and proceed from here.
2063000	2069000	And you can click the little arrow here to scroll through this slideshow which gives you some additional information about Ubuntu.
2070000	2074000	So feel free to click through this and read about the various features and things like that.
2075000	2076000	I'll leave that up to you.
2077000	2078000	But anyway I'm going to let this finish.
2079000	2081000	I'm just going to fast forward through the rest of this installation.
2082000	2083000	And then I'll be back as soon as it's finished.
2088000	2090000	Alright so the installation is complete.
2091000	2092000	Now what I'm going to do is restart the computer.
2093000	2098000	And what you won't see is the boot menu because my screen recorder can't actually record that.
2099000	2108000	What you should see on your end if everything has gone well is you should see an actual selection for which operating system you would like to boot when you start the computer.
2109000	2112000	But my screen recorder is not actually going to capture that part.
2113000	2117000	But what I want to do first is just boot into Windows and make sure that that still works.
2118000	2119000	So what I'll do is click restart now.
2120000	2123000	And if I press nothing it should boot directly into Windows.
2125000	2128000	Now I will remove the flash drive and press enter.
2131000	2138000	Alright so at the beginning of the process when my computer first started I chose the Windows option in the selection menu.
2139000	2140000	And well here's Windows.
2141000	2142000	So I'll go ahead and log in.
2144000	2145000	And there you go.
2145000	2150000	I'm able to boot into Windows so at least I know that the Windows installation still works fine.
2151000	2152000	That's a good sign.
2153000	2155000	Now if I bring up the disk info here just to show you.
2156000	2159000	Previously this showed that I had a one terabyte disk.
2160000	2162000	Now it shows that it's 469 gigabytes.
2163000	2165000	So we can clearly see that it was resized.
2166000	2167000	That's also a good sign.
2168000	2169000	So Windows is working.
2170000	2172000	Let's reboot again and this time I'm going to let it boot into Ubuntu.
2176000	2182000	And now I have successfully booted into Ubuntu so the dual boot was a complete success.
2183000	2187000	Just like with any other Ubuntu installation it's going to ask us a few questions.
2188000	2193000	The first screen is giving us the ability to sign into any online accounts that we may have.
2194000	2198000	For example if you have a Google account you can actually sign into that right here.
2199000	2200000	I'm not going to do that though.
2200000	2201000	I'm going to skip that.
2202000	2205000	I don't actually have any accounts that I would like to use on this installation.
2206000	2210000	But if you do have at least a Google account you'll benefit from calendar syncing and things like that.
2211000	2214000	It's probably a good idea to sign in if that's something you want to utilize.
2215000	2216000	I'll skip that for now.
2217000	2222000	And this screen right here is basically asking us if we would like to provide some information to Canonical,
2223000	2227000	the developers of Ubuntu that they can use to actually improve Ubuntu.
2227000	2232000	And the way I see it more than likely you probably downloaded Ubuntu for free.
2233000	2238000	And since they made this available to us for free I don't think it's too much to ask to send some information along.
2239000	2242000	And if you're at all curious you can click this button here to show the report.
2243000	2249000	This will show you all of the information that they intend to send to Canonical if you agree to have that done.
2250000	2253000	As you can see here nothing is personally identifiable.
2253000	2259000	So if you don't mind I highly recommend that you send that over to Canonical because they can definitely utilize the information
2260000	2262000	and they can use that to help improve Ubuntu.
2263000	2268000	I'm not going to do that on my end because I've installed Linux on this machine more times and I can count
2269000	2272000	and I've already sent this information to them so I'll just say no for now.
2273000	2274000	I'll click next.
2275000	2278000	And location services is disabled by default.
2278000	2281000	If you'd like you can go ahead and enable that.
2282000	2286000	And I would do that if you actually plan on using a map application or something like that.
2287000	2290000	But if you don't plan on using that then you can actually leave this as disabled.
2291000	2292000	So I'll click next.
2293000	2300000	And then here we have a list of popular applications that we can install if we want any of these on our system.
2301000	2303000	And we also have GNOME software.
2304000	2305000	The button for that is right here.
2306000	2307000	And also here on the left hand side.
2308000	2313000	And we can use that to get a full category of applications that we can install.
2314000	2316000	These are just some of the more popular ones.
2317000	2318000	For example if I click on Spotify.
2322000	2326000	And then with this window here I can simply click install to install Spotify.
2326000	2329000	And then I'll type in the password that I used to log in.
2330000	2331000	That should be others to it.
2332000	2333000	As you can see it's installing.
2335000	2337000	And as you can see it was that simple.
2338000	2343000	Now in a future section in this video I'm going to walk through the process of managing software.
2344000	2345000	So don't worry about that so much right now.
2346000	2347000	We'll get back to that.
2348000	2352000	But for now not only have we installed Ubuntu but we have set up a dual boot which is pretty awesome.
2352000	2353000	So that's great.
2354000	2356000	Now we can boot into Windows when we need to or Ubuntu.
2357000	2362000	And we get a choice at the beginning of the boot process where we can choose one operating system or the other.
2376000	2379000	So now that we have our Ubuntu installation all set up.
2379000	2383000	There's actually a few things that we should do before we start using it.
2384000	2390000	Now the first thing that we should do is make sure that we install any drivers that might be required for hardware that we have on our system.
2391000	2394000	Now this is something that doesn't really apply to most of you.
2395000	2401000	But I do recommend that you at least check this to make sure that you are utilizing whatever software you might need.
2402000	2403000	And it's very easy to check.
2404000	2405000	So if you go down here to the applications menu.
2406000	2409000	The very first thing here is additional drivers.
2410000	2411000	So let's click on that.
2412000	2416000	And it's going to take a moment to basically search and it has already found something.
2417000	2418000	Check this out.
2419000	2424000	So here we have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti mobile graphics processor here.
2425000	2430000	In this laptop which is actually a very decent GPU that allows us to play games.
2430000	2435000	But we're not going to be able to play games on this GPU without having the appropriate driver.
2436000	2443000	Even if you are not playing games I still recommend that you install the NVIDIA driver if you do have such a card as you can see here.
2444000	2446000	Now yours might not show anything here.
2447000	2451000	You may not even have any hardware on your computer that would require a proprietary driver.
2452000	2454000	But basically I'm having you check here just in case you might.
2454000	2459000	And since I do I'm going to choose the most recent version of the NVIDIA driver.
2460000	2463000	That's what I recommend you do as well if you do have such a card.
2464000	2465000	And click apply changes.
2466000	2467000	And then I'll type in my password.
2468000	2469000	Now for comparison.
2470000	2475000	If you have an AMD video card for example then it should already work out of the box.
2476000	2477000	You shouldn't actually need to install anything.
2478000	2480000	NVIDIA is the one that needs proprietary drivers.
2480000	2482000	Now you might actually see other things here.
2483000	2486000	Maybe something related to your Wi-Fi card or some other piece of hardware.
2487000	2491000	But I'll leave it up to you to check this section and find out if there's anything available here.
2492000	2496000	The common rule of thumb is if nothing shows here as being available then you're good.
2497000	2501000	If something does show up here you might want to go ahead and install it to make full use of your hardware.
2502000	2504000	So this will actually take a moment.
2505000	2507000	As you can see here it's filling up it's almost there.
2507000	2511000	Even though it says that we do have a proprietary driver in use.
2512000	2513000	We really don't.
2514000	2517000	We should reboot our computer to make sure that we are using the updated software.
2518000	2528000	But before we do that we actually should install all of the updates that have been made available since the release of the version of Ubuntu that we're on to make sure that everything is up to date.
2529000	2533000	And since we have to reboot anyway to do that then I'm not going to reboot for the NVIDIA driver.
2533000	2535000	Installation. Let's check the updates.
2536000	2538000	So back here in the application menu.
2539000	2540000	Scroll down.
2541000	2544000	And we have software updater right here so we'll click on that.
2547000	2549000	And it has indeed found some updates.
2550000	2555000	It's important to keep up to date on the updates because there's a reason why these updates are made available.
2556000	2560000	There could be new features but more importantly there could also be security updates.
2560000	2562000	So we should definitely get them installed.
2563000	2566000	If you're curious what exactly is being updated you can expand this.
2567000	2569000	Then we can see that there's all kinds of different things here.
2572000	2575000	And inside the Ubuntu base we see that there's actually a bunch more.
2576000	2580000	So they do their best to consolidate the list a little bit here but there's a lot more going on here.
2581000	2583000	We basically just need to install all the updates so I'll do that now.
2583000	2586000	And we can see that it's progressing so I'll let this finish and then I'll be right back.
2588000	2594000	So as you can see right here it's recommending that we restart our computer to take advantage of all of the updates.
2595000	2596000	Which I highly recommend that you do.
2597000	2598000	And I'm going to do the same thing.
2599000	2603000	In the next section of the video though I am going to show you around the desktop environment here.
2604000	2605000	The user interface.
2606000	2607000	How to interact with Ubuntu.
2607000	2608000	Where things are located.
2609000	2610000	How to change settings and things like that.
2611000	2614000	So off camera I'm going to go ahead and click this restart button here.
2615000	2616000	And then I recommend you do the same.
2617000	2618000	And then I'll see you in the next section.
2637000	2641000	So in this section of the video what I'm going to do is show you guys around the Ubuntu desktop.
2642000	2643000	I'm going to show you where things are located.
2644000	2645000	How to launch applications.
2646000	2647000	Switch between applications.
2648000	2650000	As well as how to utilize workspaces.
2651000	2654000	Which will allow you to work more efficiently with your computer.
2655000	2656000	So let's get started.
2657000	2660000	Now first and foremost there's a lot going on with the default desktop here.
2661000	2662000	We have some icons on the desktop.
2663000	2665000	We have some icons here on the left hand side on this panel.
2665000	2669000	And we even have some icons in the upper right hand corner.
2670000	2671000	So in no particular order.
2672000	2674000	Let's go through everything that we see on the screen right now.
2675000	2677000	In the upper right hand corner if we click here.
2678000	2679000	And we can click anywhere here.
2680000	2681000	Doesn't matter.
2682000	2683000	Same thing.
2684000	2686000	You basically get some options that are related to our system in general.
2687000	2689000	Now these indicators here we have one for wifi.
2690000	2691000	This will show your wifi signal strength.
2692000	2694000	I have actually some really good wifi strength right now.
2695000	2698000	In fact the access point is literally right above my head.
2699000	2700000	We have a volume icon here.
2701000	2702000	And a battery icon.
2703000	2706000	And then here we can actually adjust the sliders for anything here.
2707000	2709000	You can't see it but this is going to increase or decrease the brightness.
2710000	2713000	We have a selection here for changing the wifi network.
2714000	2715000	Or just basically connecting to a wifi network.
2716000	2717000	You get a list right here.
2718000	2719000	And then in regards to bluetooth.
2720000	2721000	We could turn it off to save battery.
2722000	2724000	Or if we want to actually connect to a bluetooth device.
2725000	2726000	You can click bluetooth settings right here.
2727000	2729000	And if we have a bluetooth device that's in pairing mode.
2730000	2731000	We should see it here.
2732000	2733000	And then we can connect to it.
2734000	2735000	You simply just click on it and then follow the prompts.
2736000	2737000	So for example if you wanted to set up a headset.
2738000	2739000	And the headset support a bluetooth.
2740000	2741000	Then this is where you would do that.
2743000	2744000	Now here for the battery icon.
2745000	2747000	We get a selection that only includes one option.
2748000	2749000	Power settings.
2750000	2751000	We click on that.
2752000	2754000	We not only see the battery life of any devices that we have attached.
2755000	2757000	About half remaining on my wireless mouse.
2758000	2759000	I'm not really sure what that is.
2760000	2761000	But we're going to ignore that.
2762000	2763000	The battery is fully charged.
2764000	2765000	And if we scroll down.
2766000	2767000	We can adjust the keyboard brightness.
2768000	2769000	If we have a backlight.
2770000	2771000	I do.
2772000	2773000	But you can't see it.
2774000	2775000	But you know, honest it is actually lighting up right now.
2776000	2777000	We can enable or disable the feature that dims the screen.
2778000	2779000	When it's inactive.
2780000	2781000	I don't really like that.
2782000	2783000	So I believe that deactivated here.
2783000	2784000	I don't really want that to happen.
2785000	2788000	And then we can enable automatic suspend or disable it.
2789000	2790000	It's enabled by default for battery power.
2791000	2792000	So if I unplug the power.
2793000	2795000	And then I just let this thing idle for 20 minutes.
2796000	2797000	It's going to suspend.
2798000	2799000	And we get some other controls here.
2800000	2801000	But you know, standard stuff.
2803000	2805000	Then we have access right here to the settings app.
2806000	2809000	Which allows us to customize the Ubuntu desktop.
2810000	2813000	And you just saw that open up to the battery section.
2814000	2815000	Which was the last one I was on.
2816000	2817000	Which is how that works.
2818000	2819000	We could lock the screen.
2820000	2821000	So if we need to leave our chair and go get some coffee.
2822000	2823000	And we don't want anyone to see what we're up to.
2824000	2825000	We could lock the screen.
2826000	2827000	And then if I expand this here.
2828000	2829000	We can suspend, restart, power off or log out.
2830000	2832000	So these are basically all of your system controls.
2833000	2834000	In the upper right.
2835000	2836000	In the center on the top panel.
2837000	2838000	It already shows us the current date.
2839000	2840000	You get a little calendar here.
2841000	2843000	And if we have any calendar events.
2844000	2845000	They will show down here.
2846000	2848000	And those will show if you have decided to synchronize.
2849000	2851000	To any of the calendar services that came up.
2852000	2853000	When we initially installed Ubuntu.
2854000	2856000	It basically asked if we wanted to add any online accounts.
2857000	2858000	And if you have done that.
2859000	2861000	And that online account has a calendar for example.
2862000	2864000	You should see calendar events here if you have any.
2865000	2866000	Now here we have system related notifications.
2867000	2868000	I don't have any right now.
2869000	2871000	And then if an app shows a notification.
2872000	2873000	It'll show up right here.
2874000	2875000	It'll actually briefly display up here at the top.
2876000	2877000	And about this area right here.
2878000	2879000	It'll go away after a few seconds.
2880000	2881000	But if you didn't really get a chance to read it.
2882000	2883000	You can click here.
2884000	2885000	And you can see the notification on this list.
2886000	2887000	If you would prefer not to be disturbed.
2888000	2889000	And not see any notifications at all.
2890000	2891000	You can enable do not disturb mode.
2892000	2893000	So for example.
2894000	2895000	If you are recording a YouTube video.
2896000	2897000	And you don't want any notifications to show up on the screen.
2897000	2898000	That might interrupt the recording.
2899000	2900000	Or make you have to edit something out.
2901000	2903000	Then you would probably enable do not disturb mode.
2904000	2905000	And as you can tell.
2906000	2907000	I actually have to utilize that quite a bit.
2908000	2909000	But even if you do have do not disturb mode enabled.
2910000	2911000	When you click on this.
2912000	2913000	You will still see any notifications here.
2914000	2915000	That you would have seen.
2916000	2917000	If notifications were not disabled.
2918000	2919000	Which gives you the opportunity to catch up with notifications.
2920000	2921000	After the fact.
2922000	2923000	What this does here.
2924000	2925000	Is it just makes sure that you don't have any notifications.
2925000	2926000	To pop up in front of what you are doing.
2927000	2928000	We have some desktop icons.
2929000	2931000	So here we have a link to the home folder.
2932000	2933000	This is where we actually save files.
2934000	2935000	And how I got there.
2936000	2937000	Was I just double clicked right here.
2938000	2939000	Similarly we have a trash folder as well.
2940000	2941000	So if you have used any other operating system.
2942000	2943000	That has a file manager.
2944000	2945000	As well as a trash folder.
2946000	2947000	Which is probably all of them.
2948000	2949000	Then you know pretty much what these do.
2950000	2951000	Your deleted files will actually be stored here.
2952000	2953000	And then again.
2953000	2954000	MP3 files for example.
2955000	2956000	Family photos whatever you have.
2957000	2958000	Can all be saved in here.
2959000	2960000	Which gives you quick access to those files.
2961000	2962000	On the left hand side.
2963000	2964000	We have this panel.
2965000	2966000	Right here.
2967000	2968000	Which has a bunch of icons here.
2969000	2970000	These icons are favorite applications.
2971000	2972000	You can mark any application you have installed.
2973000	2974000	As a favorite.
2975000	2976000	I didn't actually mark any of these.
2977000	2978000	As a favorite.
2979000	2980000	Basically these were included as favorites.
2981000	2982000	When we installed Ubuntu.
2983000	2984000	Right click any of these.
2985000	2987000	And then click here to remove them from the favorites.
2988000	2989000	And if I do that.
2990000	2991000	It goes away.
2992000	2993000	And if I click on any of these apps.
2994000	2995000	They will open.
2996000	2997000	So here's Firefox.
2998000	2999000	Notice how a dot appears to the left of Firefox.
3000000	3002000	That shows that that application is actually running.
3003000	3004000	If we don't see a dot next to it.
3005000	3006000	The application is not running.
3007000	3008000	So that's pretty simple.
3008000	3010000	So I can open as many applications as I would like.
3011000	3012000	As you can see.
3014000	3016000	And again we can easily tell which ones are actually running.
3017000	3018000	I can minimize any of these applications.
3019000	3020000	Just like any other operating system.
3021000	3023000	And it just basically lowers them back into the tray.
3024000	3025000	If I click on any of these icons.
3026000	3027000	For a running application.
3028000	3029000	It brings it back.
3030000	3031000	Now if I click on this little grid icon.
3032000	3033000	Down here.
3034000	3035000	Where it says show application.
3035000	3037000	That will bring me to a list of all of the applications.
3038000	3039000	That are installed on this machine.
3040000	3041000	And there's a lot of applications here.
3042000	3043000	That are installed by default.
3044000	3045000	For example.
3046000	3047000	I already have this open.
3048000	3049000	But it's a full office suite.
3050000	3051000	Libre Office.
3052000	3053000	Which is included by default here.
3054000	3055000	And I can open this right here.
3056000	3057000	Which is their equivalent to basically Excel.
3058000	3059000	It's a spreadsheet application.
3060000	3061000	Libre Office.
3062000	3063000	Is a grid application.
3063000	3064000	Libre Office.
3065000	3066000	Is a great office suite.
3067000	3068000	Now you will actually see some people out there.
3069000	3070000	That will make fun of Libre Office.
3071000	3072000	And say things like you know.
3073000	3074000	It's not as good as Microsoft Office.
3075000	3076000	And it's not compatible.
3077000	3078000	All of which is completely false.
3079000	3080000	I have written five books.
3081000	3082000	Each professionally published.
3083000	3084000	And I have used Libre Office to accomplish that.
3085000	3086000	So if I was able to get.
3087000	3088000	Five books professionally published.
3089000	3090000	Through Libre Office.
3091000	3092000	That just goes to show you how awesome.
3093000	3094000	People on the publishing team.
3095000	3096000	Were using Microsoft Office.
3097000	3098000	So we were able to trade files back and forth.
3099000	3100000	No problem.
3101000	3102000	So Libre Office is awesome.
3103000	3104000	Now older versions of Libre Office.
3105000	3106000	Work as good as the newer versions.
3107000	3109000	So some of those opinions actually stem from reality.
3110000	3111000	Because it was very rough when this came out.
3112000	3113000	Long story made short.
3114000	3115000	The developers have made a lot of improvements.
3116000	3117000	And well.
3118000	3119000	It's actually totally fine.
3120000	3121000	Now also when it comes to pre-installed applications.
3121000	3122000	Quite a few things here.
3123000	3124000	We have some games.
3125000	3126000	They're Solitaire for example.
3127000	3128000	We have Remina.
3129000	3130000	Or maybe it's pronounced Remina.
3131000	3132000	So sorry about that.
3133000	3134000	But anyway.
3135000	3137000	This app is actually able to allow you to connect.
3138000	3139000	To remote desktops.
3140000	3141000	So if you actually use your computer professionally.
3142000	3144000	And you interact with Windows servers.
3145000	3146000	Or something like that.
3147000	3148000	You can actually connect to them from this app.
3149000	3150000	Which is pretty cool.
3152000	3153000	And here we have Rhythmbox.
3154000	3155000	If you have an mp3 collection for example.
3156000	3157000	All you really have to do.
3158000	3161000	And the file manager is basically add all of your music.
3162000	3163000	Into this folder.
3164000	3165000	And this app is already configured.
3166000	3167000	To look inside this folder.
3168000	3169000	To find files.
3170000	3171000	And then it should show them here.
3172000	3173000	I don't actually have any mp3 files.
3174000	3175000	And even if I did.
3176000	3177000	If I was to play any of them.
3178000	3179000	I would probably get a copyright strike.
3179000	3180000	But if you do have music files.
3181000	3182000	You might want to check out Rhythmbox.
3183000	3185000	And we also have a shortcut to it right here as well.
3186000	3187000	And speaking of that.
3188000	3189000	If there is an application.
3190000	3191000	That you would like to be a favorite.
3192000	3193000	That isn't currently a favorite.
3194000	3195000	Then all you really have to do.
3196000	3197000	Is just right click on it.
3198000	3199000	And then make it a favorite.
3200000	3201000	So if I basically want to add.
3202000	3203000	Solitaire as a favorite.
3204000	3205000	I'll right click on that.
3206000	3207000	I'll click add to favorites.
3207000	3208000	And if I scroll down here.
3209000	3210000	There's more applications.
3211000	3212000	And I will let you explore these applications.
3213000	3214000	To see what's included by default.
3215000	3216000	There's actually some really cool stuff here.
3217000	3218000	Now one more I'd like you to see.
3219000	3220000	Is here in utilities.
3221000	3222000	It's called system monitor.
3223000	3224000	It allows you to basically keep an eye.
3225000	3226000	On system resources.
3227000	3228000	For example in the center tab here.
3229000	3230000	We can see the CPU usage.
3231000	3232000	We can see memory usage.
3233000	3234000	Network history.
3235000	3236000	Under file systems.
3237000	3238000	Here in the drive space is actually being utilized.
3239000	3240000	As you can see in my case.
3241000	3242000	Not much.
3243000	3244000	Then here we get a list of all the processes.
3245000	3246000	That are running.
3247000	3248000	On our Linux system here.
3249000	3250000	So if we need to kill something.
3251000	3252000	That's misbehaving.
3253000	3254000	We can right click on it.
3255000	3256000	And kill the process.
3257000	3258000	Hopefully you will not have to do that though.
3259000	3260000	Now also what we can do.
3261000	3262000	Here on the applications menu.
3263000	3264000	Is we can actually rearrange these icons.
3265000	3266000	Any way we see fit.
3267000	3268000	Maybe closer up here to the top.
3270000	3271000	I could just basically drop it.
3272000	3273000	Wherever I want it to be.
3274000	3275000	To rearrange these icons.
3276000	3278000	And what I could do is also drop it on top of another icon.
3279000	3280000	And that will actually group them together.
3281000	3282000	So for example.
3283000	3284000	I could put all the LibreOffice icons.
3285000	3287000	All in the same little box here.
3288000	3289000	And it even named it office.
3290000	3291000	Which is pretty cool.
3292000	3293000	I didn't even have to name it.
3294000	3295000	Another example is I can drag a rhythm box.
3295000	3296000	Spotify.
3297000	3298000	Spotify is something that I've installed as a test.
3299000	3300000	It named it sound and video.
3301000	3302000	And if you click on it.
3303000	3304000	You can see the icons that are inside that group.
3305000	3307000	And you can also go ahead and rename them as well.
3309000	3310000	Maybe something like that.
3311000	3312000	I'll leave it up to you.
3313000	3314000	But basically you have full control.
3315000	3317000	Over the arrangement of the applications on this list.
3318000	3320000	Now when it comes to switching between applications.
3321000	3322000	I mean.
3323000	3324000	At first it's pretty easy.
3325000	3327000	Basically you could just have like several applications open.
3328000	3329000	If it opens full screen.
3330000	3331000	You could pull it away from the top.
3332000	3333000	I don't know why this happens.
3334000	3335000	I think this is a bug.
3336000	3337000	When you do that with LibreOffice.
3338000	3339000	It makes it this impossible to use really small window.
3340000	3341000	So you got to basically position the mouse.
3342000	3343000	Around the corner there to make it.
3344000	3345000	An appropriate size.
3346000	3347000	LibreOffice is the only application I've seen do this.
3348000	3349000	I think it's just the Ubuntu implementation has a bug.
3350000	3351000	I don't know anyway.
3352000	3353000	The point is.
3353000	3354000	Between applications is very easy to do.
3355000	3356000	Again.
3357000	3358000	Just like any other operating system.
3359000	3360000	But where this actually shines.
3361000	3362000	Is that we have virtual workspaces.
3363000	3364000	So if I click up here.
3365000	3366000	Where it shows activities.
3367000	3368000	And what it's going to do is show me all the applications that are open.
3369000	3370000	So for example.
3371000	3372000	If I had this full screen.
3373000	3375000	And I wasn't sure which applications I had open.
3376000	3377000	Now I could just hold alt and press tab.
3378000	3379000	And then the alt tab menu comes up.
3380000	3381000	And I could find out what apps are open and switch accordingly.
3383000	3385000	But I could also just hit the super key.
3386000	3387000	To show all of the applications that are open.
3388000	3389000	I can hit it again.
3390000	3391000	To go back to the normal mode.
3392000	3394000	And I can access that same screen by just clicking on activities.
3395000	3396000	But what we also have at our disposal.
3397000	3398000	Is workspaces.
3399000	3400000	Over here on the right.
3401000	3402000	If I just move my mouse over here to the right.
3403000	3405000	I have an empty desktop that I can use.
3406000	3407000	And I could switch between this desktop.
3408000	3409000	The one I've been using.
3410000	3411000	Or.
3411000	3412000	I could switch here.
3413000	3414000	To this empty desktop.
3415000	3416000	And then I could basically open.
3417000	3418000	Yet another app.
3419000	3421000	And basically I can open apps that are separate from the others.
3422000	3423000	So for example.
3424000	3425000	Maybe I'm at work.
3426000	3427000	And I am playing some solitaire.
3428000	3429000	And you know.
3430000	3431000	I just love this game.
3432000	3433000	And maybe I should be working.
3434000	3435000	But I just need to finish this game.
3436000	3437000	And then my boss comes over and is like.
3438000	3439000	Hey what are you doing.
3439000	3441000	And switch back to the busy workspace.
3442000	3443000	Where I'm actually doing work.
3444000	3445000	And then when he or she walks away.
3446000	3447000	I could just switch back to my game and continue it.
3448000	3449000	Of course.
3450000	3451000	Bad example.
3452000	3453000	But you get the idea.
3454000	3455000	And what I could do is press the super key.
3456000	3457000	And I could switch between them with the mouse.
3458000	3459000	But what I actually did.
3460000	3461000	Was I just held down the super key.
3462000	3463000	And then I pressed page up.
3464000	3465000	To go up a workspace.
3466000	3467000	And while holding down the super key.
3467000	3468000	And what you'll also notice.
3469000	3470000	Back here on activities.
3471000	3473000	I have an empty workspace right here.
3474000	3476000	Now previously I had one empty workspace right here.
3477000	3479000	But now I have two workspaces that have apps.
3480000	3483000	What it did was it went ahead and created a new empty desktop right here.
3484000	3485000	So if I go here and then I open up.
3486000	3487000	Let's just say went to software.
3489000	3490000	And then go back to the overview.
3491000	3493000	I have another empty workspace.
3494000	3495000	So basically what will happen is that.
3495000	3498000	It will always make sure that you have an empty workspace.
3499000	3501000	And this feature is called dynamic workspaces.
3502000	3504000	So the number of workspaces that you have available.
3505000	3506000	Is adjusted automatically.
3507000	3510000	So it just makes sure that you always have an empty workspace that you can switch to.
3511000	3512000	To start a new task.
3513000	3515000	The reason why I like this is because I can have.
3516000	3518000	A workspace for each project that I'm working on.
3519000	3521000	Which allows me to intelligently segregate my workloads.
3521000	3524000	And I can have all the apps that are designated.
3525000	3528000	For a particular purpose on their own separate workspace.
3529000	3530000	Which I think is awesome.
3531000	3532000	So as you can see.
3533000	3536000	The Ubuntu desktop actually gives us quite a bit of flexibility.
3537000	3539000	For how we run our applications.
3540000	3541000	How we separate them.
3542000	3543000	How we switch between them and so on.
3544000	3545000	Now this graphical user interface here.
3546000	3547000	This desktop environment.
3548000	3549000	Is called no.
3549000	3551000	There's actually several desktop environments.
3552000	3553000	Available for Linux distributions.
3554000	3555000	And this is just one of many.
3556000	3558000	Noam is one of the more popular desktop environments.
3559000	3561000	And that's actually what you are interacting with.
3562000	3564000	When you use the standard version of Ubuntu.
3565000	3566000	Although they customize it quite a bit.
3567000	3568000	Because they add this panel here.
3569000	3570000	Which noam doesn't actually have by default.
3571000	3573000	So they just basically add a few things here.
3574000	3575000	To make the desktop easier to use.
3576000	3577000	And the reason why I mentioned that.
3577000	3580000	Is just so if you try a different Linux distribution.
3581000	3583000	That also offers noam as the main desktop environment.
3584000	3586000	And it actually operates a bit differently.
3587000	3588000	Well now you know.
3589000	3591000	Ubuntu actually has some customizations pre-installed.
3592000	3593000	That just makes it easier.
3594000	3595000	And the panel is one example of that.
3596000	3598000	But go ahead and explore the Ubuntu desktop.
3599000	3600000	Just play around with it.
3601000	3602000	Get more familiar with it.
3603000	3604000	Especially play around with the dynamic workspaces.
3605000	3606000	Because that is my favorite feature for sure.
3607000	3608000	In the next section.
3609000	3611000	What I'm going to do is show you how to install additional software.
3625000	3626000	So in this section of the video.
3627000	3630000	I am going to walk you through how to install software.
3631000	3632000	As discussed in the previous section.
3633000	3634000	There's actually quite a bit of software.
3635000	3636000	That's installed here by default.
3637000	3638000	Everything from a web browser.
3639000	3641000	To an app that allows you to view what's on your webcam.
3642000	3643000	A remote desktop app.
3644000	3645000	Even solitaire of all things.
3646000	3648000	There's quite a few awesome apps already included.
3649000	3651000	But how do you add more applications to your Ubuntu desktop?
3652000	3653000	Well let's go ahead and explore that.
3654000	3655000	And to add new software.
3656000	3657000	We will click right here where it shows.
3658000	3659000	A shopping bag icon here.
3660000	3661000	It's labeled Ubuntu software.
3662000	3663000	When I click on that.
3664000	3665000	It's going to bring me to this application right here.
3665000	3666000	Which is the app.
3667000	3669000	That we will use to add additional software.
3670000	3673000	Think of this like the app store on a mobile platform.
3674000	3675000	Or something like that.
3676000	3677000	You have some applications up here.
3678000	3679000	That you could consider installing.
3680000	3681000	But more importantly.
3682000	3683000	We have categories down here.
3684000	3685000	Of different type of applications that you can choose to install.
3686000	3687000	For example.
3688000	3689000	If you click on games.
3690000	3691000	Sometimes it takes a moment for this to refresh.
3692000	3693000	And when it does.
3693000	3696000	There's a list of applications that you can actually install.
3697000	3699000	So if we start scrolling through the list here.
3700000	3701000	We see quite a few.
3702000	3704000	And these are all the apps that are available in the games section.
3705000	3708000	Now this is not going to be all of the applications that are available.
3709000	3710000	For the entire Ubuntu platform.
3711000	3714000	These are just applications that are shown as options that you can install.
3715000	3716000	That are included in the default repositories.
3717000	3719000	Basically the app store if you will.
3720000	3721000	Now it's a bit more complicated than that.
3721000	3726000	I'm not going to get really deep into the theory around how this actually works.
3727000	3729000	But essentially you'll need to know how to install software.
3730000	3731000	Which is what I'm about to show you.
3732000	3733000	So for example.
3734000	3735000	Let's say you want to install Minecraft.
3736000	3737000	So right here.
3738000	3739000	We have an option to install the Minecraft installer.
3740000	3744000	We get a description and some information about the application before we install it.
3745000	3746000	And then here we have the install button.
3747000	3748000	So I'll click on that.
3749000	3750000	I'll put in my password.
3752000	3753000	And that's it.
3754000	3755000	That's really all there is to it.
3756000	3758000	You simply click on an application that you'd like to install.
3759000	3760000	And then you click the install button.
3761000	3763000	And then you just wait through the process and eventually it finishes.
3764000	3766000	And then you can go ahead and use the application.
3769000	3772000	Now you'll notice that the install button changed to remove.
3773000	3775000	So I could click on that if I'd like to remove that application.
3776000	3778000	It should also show up in the menu.
3778000	3779000	And I had a scroll for it.
3780000	3781000	But here it is.
3782000	3783000	There's Minecraft.
3785000	3787000	And if I go back here to the home page.
3788000	3789000	And then the installed tab.
3790000	3793000	We get a list of all the software that's installed on our computer.
3794000	3796000	And we see the one that we've just added right here.
3797000	3800000	We also see quite a few applications that I did not install.
3801000	3806000	Basically what you are seeing here are the applications that are pre-installed as well.
3806000	3808000	In addition to the ones that you install yourself.
3809000	3811000	So if any of these applications are just.
3812000	3815000	You know maybe there are applications you really don't want to have installed.
3816000	3817000	You could basically go ahead and remove them.
3818000	3821000	Maybe I don't want to have games installed on my computer.
3822000	3823000	Well I can remove it.
3824000	3825000	Pretty easy.
3826000	3827000	And just like that it's gone.
3828000	3830000	We also have a tab right here for updates.
3831000	3833000	So if there's any updates available for the applications.
3834000	3835000	Then we can click update all.
3836000	3837000	Go ahead and get those updated.
3839000	3840000	And that's pretty straightforward.
3841000	3842000	So when it all comes down to it.
3843000	3846000	This is what you will use most of the time to install software.
3847000	3853000	But the problem here is that not all of the applications that you might want to install are going to be available in Ubuntu software.
3854000	3855000	So for example.
3856000	3857000	Let's search for Google Chrome.
3858000	3860000	I'm sure this is one that a lot of you guys are probably going to install.
3861000	3862000	So let's search for it.
3863000	3864000	And you know what?
3865000	3866000	I'm not seeing it.
3867000	3868000	So Google Chrome is not available.
3869000	3870000	Actually I already knew that.
3871000	3876000	Because some applications out there are not actually committed to the Ubuntu repositories.
3877000	3880000	And some developers just kind of keep those applications to themselves.
3881000	3882000	But it's still pretty easy to install though.
3883000	3884000	We could just open up a web browser.
3885000	3886000	Firefox is pre installed.
3887000	3889000	Then we can actually search for the application that we would like to install.
3893000	3896000	And here we have the Google Chrome website.
3897000	3898000	I'll just click on that.
3899000	3900000	We have this download button here.
3901000	3902000	If I click on it.
3903000	3904000	It's automatically detecting that I am running on Ubuntu.
3905000	3907000	This is the correct selection by default.
3908000	3909000	So we didn't actually have to do anything.
3910000	3911000	I can click accept and install.
3912000	3913000	I will save the file.
3915000	3916000	And it did download.
3917000	3919000	So let's open up a file manager in the downloads directory.
3922000	3925000	We actually have the file that we have just downloaded.
3926000	3927000	So if I double click on that.
3930000	3931000	I'll click install.
3932000	3934000	I'll type in the password for my user account.
3936000	3938000	And as you can see it's actually installing.
3943000	3944000	Let's see if it's installed.
3947000	3948000	And it is.
3949000	3950000	So I'll click on it.
3950000	3951000	It's fine.
3952000	3954000	So I will not make it the default Firefox is actually my preferred browser.
3955000	3956000	But you know it's up to you.
3957000	3960000	And then I will uncheck this box here because I think Google knows enough about me already.
3961000	3962000	So I'll click OK.
3963000	3965000	And as you can see we now have Google Chrome.
3966000	3970000	So every now and then you might have to install applications outside of Ubuntu software.
3971000	3972000	Google Chrome is one example of that.
3973000	3978000	The licensing restrictions actually prevent Google Chrome from being made available in the normal software store.
3978000	3979000	But you get the idea.
3980000	3983000	Sometimes you just have to download it and install it that way as you just saw.
3984000	3987000	So you just saw two ways of installing software on Ubuntu.
3988000	3992000	Either way you should now be able to go through and install any applications that you would like.
3993000	3995000	First you basically just check Ubuntu software.
3996000	3999000	See if the application that you would like to install is located here.
4000000	4001000	If it is there you go.
4002000	4005000	If not just do a quick Google search and you'll probably find what you're looking for.
4005000	4012000	I'll leave it up to you to explore the Ubuntu software store and then install any applications that you may want.
4013000	4014000	So there you go.
4016000	4019000	So hopefully this video was helpful in getting you set up on Ubuntu.
4020000	4022000	Ubuntu has always been one of my favorite distributions.
4023000	4026000	It runs well on laptops, desktops, as well as servers.
4027000	4028000	And I think it's pretty cool.
4029000	4030000	So hopefully this video has helped you out.
