00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello, and welcome back to LearnLenux TV.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In today's video, I am going to give all of you Ubuntu beginners out there an entire video dedicated to getting you started with running Ubuntu on your laptop or desktop.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to talk to you about some considerations, things to think about before you install it.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then I'll walk you through the installation process both with a full install walkthrough as well as a walkthrough on dual booting with Windows 10.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then I'm going to show you how to use Ubuntu, how to install software. It's going to be great.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Before we get into that, I want to take a moment to mention my sponsor Linode.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Linode has been doing cloud computing since 2003, which is actually before Amazon Web Services was even a thing.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
On Linode's platform, you can get your server up and running in minutes.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And they include all of the popular distributions such as CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and get this also Arch Linux.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And let's be honest, what could be better than a Linux cloud server provider that allows you to tell all of your friends, I run Arch.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Linode has multiple server plans available to make any app scalable and flexible.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can use it to host a blog, set up a VPN server, a Minecraft server, or you can do what I did and set up a website for your YouTube channel because the official website for LearnLenux TV runs on Linode.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And Linode offers 24 by 7, 365 support, regardless of plan size, so you can get live help from a real person when you need it.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
New users can get started right now with $100 in credit towards a new account.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I highly recommend you check them out because Linode is awesome.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I want to extend a special thank you to Linode for their continued sponsorship of LearnLenux TV. I really appreciate it.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Also, I want to let you guys know that I have a new book available. It's called Mastering Ubuntu Server Third Edition, and it's available right now.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The third edition includes some new content such as a chapter on Kubernetes, a chapter on AWS, and more.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And it turned out really well if I do say so myself. So please check it out at ubuntuserverbook.com.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And if you've already read it, please leave a review somewhere that would really help me out.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So with all of that out of the way, let's go ahead and get started.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, so what I'm going to do is show you how to install Ubuntu.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But before we can do that, we need to actually create bootable media that we can use for the installation process.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And here I am actually on a Windows desktop because I know a lot of you out there are actually coming from Windows.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I wanted to show you guys the process of creating bootable media for use for installing Ubuntu from a Windows machine.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But it really doesn't matter which operating system you are currently running.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You could also be running macOS for all I care because the tool that I'm going to use is the same regardless of your current operating system.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So to get started, what we should do is open up a web browser. I have Firefox installed right here.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And we want to go to ubuntu.com.

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And here on the website, we can click on the download button.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And then here where it shows Ubuntu desktop, we can choose LTS or the non-LTS release.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, if you need a long-term support release, you would go with this one.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But if you want something more bleeding edge, then you would go with the newer version.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The version number basically works out as year and then month.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So here we can see 2020, April.

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then this one is 2020 and then 10.

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But we simply refer to it as 2004 or 2010.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And depending on when you are watching this video, there could be other versions shown here.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But the basic thing to understand is that the LTS version stands for long-term support.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's supported for up to five years with security updates.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then the non-LTS release is supported for just nine months, which means that you will need to upgrade within nine months to stay current.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Otherwise, you will stop getting security updates.

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So again, I'm going to leave that up to you.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For most people, I like to go with the LTS release.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But if you have just purchased a brand new computer, you probably want to go with 2010 because the newer version is going to have newer drivers.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But again, I'll leave that up to you.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In my case, I will actually download the latest version.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And the download automatically started.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now, the file format is an ISO file, which historically has been used to create DVDs and CDs.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Basically, the ISO format is a clone of a CD or a DVD in file form.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And even though we really don't burn DVDs or CDs so much anymore, the file format has remained the same.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We'll actually use a flash drive for the installation.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So don't worry that this is a format that is specifically catering to CDs and DVDs.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We can still use it.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The format is now pretty much universal, but the name has remained the same.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll click OK to actually start the download.

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can see that it is downloading here.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So it's going to take a few minutes.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then what we also should download is a utility that we can use to actually turn that ISO file into media that we can actually boot from.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So we'll need to download something called USB imager.

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I'm just typing it here in the search.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That should be all I need to do.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
USB imager all one word, no space.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And we're looking for a GitLab page like we see here.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So let's go to that.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I will have links in the description down below.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So you could basically just click on those links and go directly to the things you need.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You don't actually have to search.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And the reason why I like this tool is because regardless of which operating system you are currently running,

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you'll be able to use the same tool to create bootable media.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
As you can see, we have a version for Windows, Mac OS, and even versions of Linux.

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So again, regardless of what you are currently running, you'll be able to use USB imager.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I only have to describe the process once and it works for any operating system.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So in my case, I'll download the Windows version.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You just download whatever one matches your current operating system.

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I will save the file and that file will download super quick because it's super small.

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
As you can see, it's only 142 kilobytes.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now the Ubuntu file here is going to take a little bit more time to download because it's much larger at around 2.7 gigabytes.

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As of the time I'm recording this video.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So I'll give it a minute to download and then I'll be right back.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So at this point, both of these files have finished downloading.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So I shouldn't need the browser anymore.

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And if I go to the file manager here and then into the downloads directory,

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you can see that I have both of the files downloaded.

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So I will extract USB imager.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's go ahead and open that up and we get this little warning alert.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's fine. I'll just click more info, run anyway.

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And let's go ahead and get that running and it is.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So this is USB imager, the utility that we will use to create bootable media.

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And this will erase everything on the flash drive.

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So if there is anything important on your flash drive, make sure that you back that up because we'll need to dedicate the flash drive for this process.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So the first thing that we will do is click right here.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We will select the image that we've downloaded.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Here's the Ubuntu ISO image.

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So open that up.

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now that's selected.

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Close this.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You don't need that anymore.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And then the next thing we'll do is select the flash drive that we want to use for this purpose.

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I will insert my flash drive right here.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And you can see that it immediately selected the flash drive here on this list.

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If you have more than one flash drive on your computer, then this will actually show more than one.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Just make sure that you are selecting the correct flash drive.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I only have the one, which is this one right here.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We know it's not the card reader.

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So this is the only option.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So what I will do is click the right button right here to begin the process.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it starts immediately.

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can see down here a progress bar is starting to fill up.

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's telling me it's going to take about a minute or so for this to finish.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I will let this finish and then I'll be right back.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right.

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So the process has completed.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I have successfully written the ISO image to the flash drive,

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and I can now use it to boot my computer into Ubuntu and start the process.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And the method that you will utilize to do that depends on your computer.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
With Dell, for example, it's usually F12 to access the boot menu.

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It varies from one computer to another.

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But essentially what you do is you reboot your computer,

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
make sure the flash drive is inserted,

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and then you press whatever key combination you need to press at the beginning

122
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
of the boot process to activate the boot menu.

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And then you select the flash drive as the boot option.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And then if all goes well, it should actually boot right into Ubuntu.

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So in the next section, what I'm going to do is give you guys some tips

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
on how you can test compatibility with Ubuntu on your computer before you install it.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So once you have booted from the installation media that we've created,

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you will see this screen right here,

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
which is giving us the option to try Ubuntu or go straight into the installation.

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Now I highly recommend that you try it first.

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And what that will do is actually allow you to test compatibility

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
before you actually go and install Ubuntu on your computer.

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I'll click try Ubuntu right here.

134
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then after you click that button,

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you will actually be using the Ubuntu desktop already.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We haven't even installed it yet.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's actually running off the flash drive in what's called live mode,

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
which allows you to demo Ubuntu before you install it.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
To actually install Ubuntu, you will click on this icon right here to do that.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But we're not going to do that yet.

141
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Before we actually install Ubuntu, we need to make sure that it works on our computer first.

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now Ubuntu has great hardware compatibility.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's among the best, but it's not 100%.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No operating system has 100% compatibility.

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ubuntu is supported on the majority of hardware out there,

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but the onus is on you to verify compatibility before you install it.

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What I have seen a lot of people do is go straight to the installation

148
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
by double clicking here to open up the installer,

149
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and then they'll just navigate straight through, blow away their current operating system.

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And then when it's done, they will create a message in a Linux help forum

151
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
or maybe a Linux Facebook group and then ask for help.

152
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You know, Ubuntu doesn't work.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I can access the internet or something like that.

154
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And you know, I'm very happy to help people that are in that situation,

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
but I do feel that that's a situation that should never happen.

156
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why? Because again, we need to test compatibility before we blow away our current operating system.

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And that's why I had you click the try Ubuntu button instead of the install button.

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
First and foremost, we need to make sure that we have a network connection.

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In the upper right hand corner here, we have a menu we can drop down,

160
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and then we could find out if we have an internet connection.

161
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now this laptop has Wi-Fi and I haven't even added my Wi-Fi password yet.

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So if I open up a web browser and we have Firefox pre-installed right here,

163
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
if I go to my website, obviously it's not going to work.

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So let's go ahead and get connected to Wi-Fi then.

165
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If you have a Wi-Fi card that is supported, then you should have an option here to connect to Wi-Fi.

166
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So if I click on that and then click select network,

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it's going to show me a list of Wi-Fi networks that are in my area.

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Now if you don't even have a Wi-Fi option at all in that menu,

169
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
or if you do and it shows no networks here,

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
despite the fact that you are sure there's a Wi-Fi network near you,

171
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that probably means that your Wi-Fi card is not supported.

172
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And you should not install Ubuntu until you find out how to fix that.

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sometimes it comes down to replacing the Wi-Fi card with a known working Wi-Fi card.

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Other times there might be specific instructions to get that going.

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Most of the time you will have no problems.

176
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
On most hardware, Ubuntu will find the Wi-Fi card and be able to use it no problem.

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But there are a few Wi-Fi cards out there that are not supported.

178
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So if you do not have an option to connect to Wi-Fi and that is something you need to be able to do,

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
do not continue, make sure you go to a Linux help forum, a Facebook group,

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
or even the community forums for this very channel.

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Tell us what the model is of the computer that you're trying to install Ubuntu on.

182
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And maybe we can help you try to find out why you don't have that option.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But I do, so I will click on my Wi-Fi network here and connect to it.

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll add the password.

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Click connect.

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And now we are connected.

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Right here it actually shows that the Wi-Fi icon has some signal.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If I refresh this page here, you can see that we are actually able to view this web page.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Now if you don't even have a Wi-Fi card and you're just going to plug in an Ethernet cable,

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
then this step probably worked just fine already.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You probably have an icon up here that will be in the same place as this Wi-Fi icon is,

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but it will have the icon of an Ethernet jack instead.

193
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But if you can get to a web page, as you can see, I'm able to do here,

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
then already you know that internet is working just fine and it passes that test.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Another thing that you should do is just click on a video.

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You can go to YouTube for example, watch a video.

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That gives you an opportunity to test the audio to make sure that that works.

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And you know, it even gives you the opportunity to make sure that the video playback is acceptable as well.

199
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you intend to use multiple monitors, I highly recommend that you plug one in to make sure that that's working just fine.

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And if you have an opportunity to test all of the hardware that you intend to use on your computer with Ubuntu and everything works fine,

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
then you should be all set and ready to go to go ahead and get the installation going.

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And that's exactly what I'm going to do in the next section.

203
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm going to walk you through an entire installation.

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will show you how to install Ubuntu as the only operating system on your computer.

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then I will also show you the process of setting up a dual boot with Windows as well in a separate section.

206
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So if you want to do a full install, check out the next section in this very video.

207
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you want to do a dual boot, then skip that section and then move on to the one after it.

208
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But at this point, I'm going to assume that you have backed up everything that is important on your computer.

209
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If you plan on doing a full install and wiping the current operating system, that's especially important.

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But even if you plan on doing a dual boot with Windows and you have content on your Windows partition that you want to keep,

211
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I still recommend that you back that up just in case something goes wrong.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So go ahead and make sure that everything is backed up on your computer and then we can go ahead and get Ubuntu installed.

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In the previous section of the video, I've gone over a few of the things that you should test before you install Ubuntu.

214
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So at this point, I'm going to assume that you have backed up everything that's important on your computer

215
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and you have already tested the hardware to make sure that it's compatible.

216
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Assuming all of that checks out, we can go ahead and get the installation started.

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And in this section, I am going to walk you through the full installation of Ubuntu,

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
which means erasing your entire hard drive and installing Ubuntu as the only operating system on your computer.

219
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If you would like to set up a dual boot with Windows, then move on to the next section directly after this one in this same video,

220
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
because that's the next thing that I'm going to walk you through how to do.

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So anyway, I will double click here on install Ubuntu.

222
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And then here we have the installer.

223
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So the first screen is basically allowing you to set the language for the installation process.

224
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hit defaults to English, at least for me.

225
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If your language is something else, you could basically just go through the list until you find yours and select it accordingly.

226
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But I'm going to leave it as English.

227
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll click continue.

228
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And then next we have an opportunity to set the keyboard layout.

229
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So just make sure that you actually choose the right thing.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You can attempt to do a detection if you want it to be automatically selected.

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I like to manually select it to make sure that I have what I think I have.

232
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And then you can type in this box right here to test the keyboard,

233
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
as well as any special keys you may have to ensure that everything is working properly.

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So we'll continue.

235
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then we have some options.

236
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We could do a normal or a minimal installation.

237
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I recommend you do a normal installation that gives you a full suite of software.

238
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Advanced users might like the minimal option because that does not include all of the pre-included software here.

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Just a few things like a web browser and some basic utilities.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I recommend that you do the normal installation.

241
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So that's what I'm going to do.

242
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Downloading updates while installing Ubuntu.

243
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's a good idea.

244
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There still might be some additional updates after the fact.

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But having this box checked right here will make sure that at least some of the updates are installed as you install the distribution.

246
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm going to uncheck it though in my case because having this checked is just going to make the recording footage longer.

247
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I'll leave it up to you to check that box.

248
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I'm not going to check this box right here either because that's going to add additional time to the recording.

249
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But I do recommend that you check this box.

250
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I recommend that you check both.

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And what this box will do is make sure that if there's any extra software or drivers that's required for any hardware you may have,

252
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
there's a better chance that you will have that software set up automatically by choosing this option.

253
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So I will leave that up to you.

254
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I do recommend that you choose both of these.

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I will not.

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Again, it's just going to make the recording a bit longer.

257
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So we'll continue.

258
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Now in my case, it's detecting that I already have an operating system on the hard drive.

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And in your case, it's probably going to show that you have an operating system already as well.

260
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Although instead of POPOS, yours will probably say Windows or something like that.

261
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Some of you might actually be installing a brand new hard drive, although fewer of you will be using a brand new hard drive.

262
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So what we want to do is choose the option to erase the disk and install Ubuntu as you can see right here.

263
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There are some advanced features that we can utilize here.

264
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
For example, we can actually use ZFS and LVM as well.

265
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And using LVM gives you the ability to encrypt your entire hard drive,

266
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
which means you will have a password that you'll need to enter anytime you boot.

267
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Now that's a bit beyond the scope.

268
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can enable the encryption if you want to.

269
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm going to cancel this and just leave it selected erase disk.

270
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll click install now and then I'll click continue.

271
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And it's actually installing in the background, but we have a few more screens to answer here.

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So on this map screen, you are basically going to click wherever on this map you happen to be.

273
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That'll set your locale as well as your time zone.

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And I'm closer to Detroit, so I just basically clicked right here and set it to Detroit.

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
As you can see, just go ahead and set it to wherever your location happens to be and click continue.

276
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then we can put on our user information right here.

277
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So I'll just put in my name for the computer name.

278
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll just call it ThinkPad.

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think that's good enough.

280
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll leave the username as my first name in lower case.

281
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's the username that you'll use to log in with.

282
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Although in Ubuntu, you don't actually have to type the username to log in.

283
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And then I'll just go ahead and type in the password here.

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And we have an option to log in automatically.

285
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't recommend that you choose that unless maybe this is for an internet kiosk or some kind of computer that you want everyone to access very, very easily.

286
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's common to need a password to log in anyway.

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If you are trying to join an active directory domain and utilize that for authentication, you could check this box.

288
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's beyond the scope of this video, but enterprise users out there would likely want to check that box.

289
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So we'll continue.

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And it's wrapping up the rest of the installation.

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We have this little slideshow here that we can click through to see some details and some tidbits of knowledge about Ubuntu.

292
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll leave it up to you to click through that if you'd like.

293
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But what I'll do is just fast forward through this installation process and then I'll be right back.

294
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
All right, so the installation is complete.

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So let's go ahead and click on the restart button here.

296
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And then I'll remove the flash drive and then press enter.

297
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And if all goes well, it should boot into the brand new installation.

298
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And although you can't actually see this, my screen recorder isn't actually able to start recording until it's done.

299
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And although you can't actually see this, my screen recorder isn't actually able to start recording until after I log in, but I see a login screen.

300
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So I'm just clicking my name and then I'll type my password.

301
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And then now that I've logged in, this is the first screen that I see right here.

302
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's giving me an option to connect to online accounts.

303
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If I have an account and any of these services, I can go ahead and click on it, put in my user information, and then I can benefit from things like calendar syncing, contact syncing and things like that.

304
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'll skip it for now.

305
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And then here it's asking us to help improve Ubuntu by sending them information about our computer and the installation.

306
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And you can click right here to see what the actual information is that it wants to send over.

307
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And as you can see, nothing here is personally identifiable.

308
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So this is not a privacy concern.

309
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Basically, this distribution is free.

310
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So if all canonical, the makers of Ubuntu are asking for is to get some information about the computer to help improve Ubuntu and the compatibility it has with hardware.

311
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I think that's a very fair trade off.

312
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Now I'm actually not going to send that info along because I've already done so.

313
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've installed Ubuntu on this laptop probably dozens of times by now.

314
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So they definitely have that information, but I think that's a good thing to send along as a thank you for making this distribution available to us for free.

315
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I'll click next.

316
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And then we have the option to enable location services.

317
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And you can leave this off by default if you'd like.

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
If you do plan on using something like a map application or something like that, you might consider turning that on.

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll leave that up to you.

320
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Now this screen is telling us that we are all set and ready to go.

321
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You see some icons here that represent some of the more popular applications that we can choose to install on Ubuntu if we would like to do so.

322
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is not an extensive list here.

323
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Just some of the highlights.

324
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
If you'd like to install one of these apps, you can simply click on the icon for that app.

325
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And as you can see that opened up Spotify, I can click on install.

326
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I can put in my password.

327
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The same password I used to log in with.

328
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And it's installing the app as you can see.

329
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And now as you can see Spotify is installed.

330
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Now I will go over how to install applications in more detail in a section that comes later on in this very video.

331
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And you could basically open the software app from this button right here.

332
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But again, we'll be going over that soon.

333
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So don't worry about that for now.

334
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But in terms of this section, we did successfully install Ubuntu.

335
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So we're all set and ready to go.

336
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Alright, so in this section of the video, what I'm going to do is walk you through dual booting Ubuntu with Windows 10.

337
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Now if you want to do a full install, the previous section of this video will walk you through that if you want Ubuntu to be the only operating system.

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But in this section, we are going to actually set up a dual boot.

339
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So I'm going to assume at this point that you already have Windows installed on your computer.

340
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
In my case, if I go to the disk management, and I can go there by right clicking on the start button here.

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Then I go to disk management.

342
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Just to give you an idea of how the disk is set up here.

343
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You can basically see that the entire hard drive is dedicated to Windows.

344
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And we can see that right here I have a one terabyte SSD on this computer.

345
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now if your Windows installation is not using the entire hard drive, then that's okay.

346
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But anyway, most of you guys that want to do a dual boot will have a Windows installation that takes up the entire hard drive.

347
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Similar to how I am setting up this tutorial right here.

348
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In a previous section of the video, I showed you how to create bootable media.

349
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So I'm going to assume that you have already done that.

350
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And with the flash drive inserted into your computer, you can go ahead and restart it.

351
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Then at the beginning, you just press whatever key combination you need to press in order to access the boot menu.

352
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And then we can select the flash drive as the boot medium that we will use to boot our computer.

353
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Now here we have an option to try Ubuntu or install Ubuntu.

354
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And what I'm going to do is actually click the try Ubuntu button because we don't want to install Ubuntu just yet.

355
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We want to make sure that Ubuntu is compatible with our hardware before we install it.

356
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So I'll click the try Ubuntu button.

357
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And then as you can see here, we already have the Ubuntu desktop on our screen.

358
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Now Ubuntu will run a bit slower in live mode than it will run when you install it on the actual hardware.

359
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But it's very important that you try it before you install it so that way you don't install it just to find out that it's not compatible.

360
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So now that we know that this computer is compatible, as far as we can tell with Ubuntu, we can go ahead and install it.

361
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So right here on the desktop, we have an install icon. If I double click on that.

362
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Up comes the installer.

363
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So the very first screen is just asking us to select the language that we will use for the installation process.

364
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And you can scroll through the language list here if your actual language is not English.

365
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
English is the default here in my case. So I will click continue.

366
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And then if you are using a keyboard type that is not the one that's selected, you can go through and choose the keyboard type that you have.

367
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And then the variation of the keyboard that you have.

368
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And then you can click into this box right here to basically just test to make sure that everything is working fine.

369
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then we can continue.

370
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And now we have an option for normal installation or minimal installation.

371
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Now I recommend that everyone go with normal installation.

372
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That gives you a full suite of software here.

373
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You get an office suite, a web browser, utilities, games, media players, things like that.

374
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And alternatively you can choose to install the minimal version of Ubuntu,

375
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
which only includes the web browser and basic utilities.

376
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
None of the other things such as games will be installed in that case.

377
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Unless you really do want to have a trimmed down install and then select the applications that you want accordingly.

378
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I recommend that you actually choose the normal installation option.

379
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
In this box right here to have it download updates while installing.

380
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I recommend you keep that checked.

381
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's not actually going to install all updates, but it will install a great deal of them.

382
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So it's just less to do after the install.

383
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So there's no reason not to check this box.

384
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Although on my end I'm going to uncheck it because having that checked is just going to add unnecessary time to the recording.

385
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But I do recommend that you check that on your side.

386
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I also recommend that you check this box here where it says install third party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats.

387
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Basically what that is is just giving you the ability to have some pre-installed drivers to support some common pieces of hardware.

388
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There's no reason not to select this because it's just going to make your experience that much smoother.

389
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So I actually recommend that you check both of these boxes even though I'm not.

390
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Because again you know I'm recording a video and the more I choose here the longer this recording is going to take.

391
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So I'll click continue.

392
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Now here is where the installation instructions actually diverge.

393
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
In the previous section of this video I walked you through a full installation where you will actually wipe out the entire hard drive.

394
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
In this case we want to actually create a dual boot between Windows and Ubuntu so we don't want to wipe the entire drive.

395
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So with the previous section I had you choose this option.

396
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Don't choose this option right here.

397
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This will erase Windows and everything on your drive.

398
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We are going to leave the selection here where the verbate shows that we can install Ubuntu alongside Windows.

399
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's what we want to do.

400
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So we're going to leave that option there and click continue.

401
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Now before we go any further I'm hoping that you have already backed up your computer even though this process has never failed me.

402
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's worked just fine.

403
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
We're dealing with computers which means we are dealing with chaos theory basically.

404
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And you know something can go wrong and if we make a mistake or something like that we don't want to have data that we just can't get back.

405
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So what I recommend just make sure you have everything backed up.

406
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Now on this screen here we are basically choosing how much space to allocate to Windows and how much space to allocate to Ubuntu.

407
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And what you can do is just move the mouse here to the center.

408
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The cursor kind of turns into a double arrow icon.

409
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If you hold the left mouse button you can drag it to the left and you can drag it to the right.

410
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Dragging it to the left gives more space to Ubuntu.

411
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Dragging it to the right gives more space to Windows.

412
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So depending on how much you use one over the other will determine how much space you should give one or the other.

413
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm going to leave it there somewhere in the middle.

414
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's good enough for me.

415
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You definitely want to make sure you don't give too little space to one or the other.

416
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You basically want to have some room to you know grow and install applications and store files and things like that.

417
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So again I'll put it here in the middle and then I'll click install now.

418
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And then I will click continue to finalize the changes.

419
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Then continue again.

420
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And now Ubuntu is actually installing in the background.

421
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But we still have a few more screens to go before we are done with the configuration.

422
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So here basically what we'll want to do is click on the map wherever we are located geographically.

423
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So I'm closer to Detroit so I'm going to put the little dot right here by clicking on it.

424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And what that does is it sets your locale and your time zone.

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So just make sure that you put this dot as close as you can get it to where you actually are.

426
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And then we'll continue.

427
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And then here we fill out information for our user account.

428
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So I'll go ahead and put in my information here.

429
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And then for the computer name I will just call it ThinkPad.

430
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think that's a simpler name to use.

431
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's the name that the computer will be known as on the network if you do any file sharing or something like that.

432
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Here we are choosing a password for the user account.

433
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'll just go ahead and type in the password that I want it to be.

434
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And it's not the greatest password in the world but you know this is just an example.

435
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And I'm going to leave the selection here to require the password to log in.

436
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
If I was to choose the log in automatically option it's going to do exactly what it shows.

437
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's going to log us in automatically.

438
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And unless you are setting up an internet kiosk you probably don't want to do that.

439
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And then if you are using Ubuntu in the enterprise and you have Active Directory you can choose this box right here to enable that option.

440
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That's beyond the scope of this video though.

441
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So let's continue because we have everything filled out.

442
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And the installation is going to go ahead and proceed from here.

443
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And you can click the little arrow here to scroll through this slideshow which gives you some additional information about Ubuntu.

444
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So feel free to click through this and read about the various features and things like that.

445
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'll leave that up to you.

446
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But anyway I'm going to let this finish.

447
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm just going to fast forward through the rest of this installation.

448
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And then I'll be back as soon as it's finished.

449
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Alright so the installation is complete.

450
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Now what I'm going to do is restart the computer.

451
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And what you won't see is the boot menu because my screen recorder can't actually record that.

452
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What you should see on your end if everything has gone well is you should see an actual selection for which operating system you would like to boot when you start the computer.

453
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But my screen recorder is not actually going to capture that part.

454
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But what I want to do first is just boot into Windows and make sure that that still works.

455
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So what I'll do is click restart now.

456
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And if I press nothing it should boot directly into Windows.

457
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Now I will remove the flash drive and press enter.

458
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Alright so at the beginning of the process when my computer first started I chose the Windows option in the selection menu.

459
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And well here's Windows.

460
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So I'll go ahead and log in.

461
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And there you go.

462
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm able to boot into Windows so at least I know that the Windows installation still works fine.

463
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's a good sign.

464
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Now if I bring up the disk info here just to show you.

465
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Previously this showed that I had a one terabyte disk.

466
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Now it shows that it's 469 gigabytes.

467
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So we can clearly see that it was resized.

468
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
That's also a good sign.

469
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So Windows is working.

470
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's reboot again and this time I'm going to let it boot into Ubuntu.

471
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And now I have successfully booted into Ubuntu so the dual boot was a complete success.

472
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Just like with any other Ubuntu installation it's going to ask us a few questions.

473
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
The first screen is giving us the ability to sign into any online accounts that we may have.

474
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
For example if you have a Google account you can actually sign into that right here.

475
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm not going to do that though.

476
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm going to skip that.

477
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I don't actually have any accounts that I would like to use on this installation.

478
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But if you do have at least a Google account you'll benefit from calendar syncing and things like that.

479
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's probably a good idea to sign in if that's something you want to utilize.

480
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'll skip that for now.

481
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And this screen right here is basically asking us if we would like to provide some information to Canonical,

482
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the developers of Ubuntu that they can use to actually improve Ubuntu.

483
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And the way I see it more than likely you probably downloaded Ubuntu for free.

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And since they made this available to us for free I don't think it's too much to ask to send some information along.

485
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And if you're at all curious you can click this button here to show the report.

486
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
This will show you all of the information that they intend to send to Canonical if you agree to have that done.

487
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
As you can see here nothing is personally identifiable.

488
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So if you don't mind I highly recommend that you send that over to Canonical because they can definitely utilize the information

489
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and they can use that to help improve Ubuntu.

490
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm not going to do that on my end because I've installed Linux on this machine more times and I can count

491
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and I've already sent this information to them so I'll just say no for now.

492
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'll click next.

493
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And location services is disabled by default.

494
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If you'd like you can go ahead and enable that.

495
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I would do that if you actually plan on using a map application or something like that.

496
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But if you don't plan on using that then you can actually leave this as disabled.

497
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So I'll click next.

498
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then here we have a list of popular applications that we can install if we want any of these on our system.

499
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And we also have GNOME software.

500
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
The button for that is right here.

501
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And also here on the left hand side.

502
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And we can use that to get a full category of applications that we can install.

503
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
These are just some of the more popular ones.

504
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
For example if I click on Spotify.

505
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And then with this window here I can simply click install to install Spotify.

506
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And then I'll type in the password that I used to log in.

507
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That should be others to it.

508
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
As you can see it's installing.

509
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And as you can see it was that simple.

510
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Now in a future section in this video I'm going to walk through the process of managing software.

511
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So don't worry about that so much right now.

512
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
We'll get back to that.

513
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But for now not only have we installed Ubuntu but we have set up a dual boot which is pretty awesome.

514
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So that's great.

515
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Now we can boot into Windows when we need to or Ubuntu.

516
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And we get a choice at the beginning of the boot process where we can choose one operating system or the other.

517
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So now that we have our Ubuntu installation all set up.

518
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
There's actually a few things that we should do before we start using it.

519
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Now the first thing that we should do is make sure that we install any drivers that might be required for hardware that we have on our system.

520
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Now this is something that doesn't really apply to most of you.

521
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But I do recommend that you at least check this to make sure that you are utilizing whatever software you might need.

522
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And it's very easy to check.

523
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So if you go down here to the applications menu.

524
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
The very first thing here is additional drivers.

525
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So let's click on that.

526
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And it's going to take a moment to basically search and it has already found something.

527
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Check this out.

528
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So here we have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti mobile graphics processor here.

529
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
In this laptop which is actually a very decent GPU that allows us to play games.

530
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But we're not going to be able to play games on this GPU without having the appropriate driver.

531
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Even if you are not playing games I still recommend that you install the NVIDIA driver if you do have such a card as you can see here.

532
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Now yours might not show anything here.

533
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You may not even have any hardware on your computer that would require a proprietary driver.

534
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But basically I'm having you check here just in case you might.

535
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And since I do I'm going to choose the most recent version of the NVIDIA driver.

536
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's what I recommend you do as well if you do have such a card.

537
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And click apply changes.

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And then I'll type in my password.

539
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Now for comparison.

540
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
If you have an AMD video card for example then it should already work out of the box.

541
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You shouldn't actually need to install anything.

542
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
NVIDIA is the one that needs proprietary drivers.

543
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Now you might actually see other things here.

544
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Maybe something related to your Wi-Fi card or some other piece of hardware.

545
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But I'll leave it up to you to check this section and find out if there's anything available here.

546
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The common rule of thumb is if nothing shows here as being available then you're good.

547
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
If something does show up here you might want to go ahead and install it to make full use of your hardware.

548
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So this will actually take a moment.

549
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
As you can see here it's filling up it's almost there.

550
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Even though it says that we do have a proprietary driver in use.

551
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
We really don't.

552
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We should reboot our computer to make sure that we are using the updated software.

553
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But before we do that we actually should install all of the updates that have been made available since the release of the version of Ubuntu that we're on to make sure that everything is up to date.

554
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And since we have to reboot anyway to do that then I'm not going to reboot for the NVIDIA driver.

555
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Installation. Let's check the updates.

556
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So back here in the application menu.

557
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Scroll down.

558
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And we have software updater right here so we'll click on that.

559
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And it has indeed found some updates.

560
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's important to keep up to date on the updates because there's a reason why these updates are made available.

561
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
There could be new features but more importantly there could also be security updates.

562
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So we should definitely get them installed.

563
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
If you're curious what exactly is being updated you can expand this.

564
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Then we can see that there's all kinds of different things here.

565
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And inside the Ubuntu base we see that there's actually a bunch more.

566
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So they do their best to consolidate the list a little bit here but there's a lot more going on here.

567
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
We basically just need to install all the updates so I'll do that now.

568
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And we can see that it's progressing so I'll let this finish and then I'll be right back.

569
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So as you can see right here it's recommending that we restart our computer to take advantage of all of the updates.

570
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Which I highly recommend that you do.

571
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And I'm going to do the same thing.

572
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
In the next section of the video though I am going to show you around the desktop environment here.

573
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
The user interface.

574
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
How to interact with Ubuntu.

575
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Where things are located.

576
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How to change settings and things like that.

577
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So off camera I'm going to go ahead and click this restart button here.

578
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And then I recommend you do the same.

579
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And then I'll see you in the next section.

580
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So in this section of the video what I'm going to do is show you guys around the Ubuntu desktop.

581
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm going to show you where things are located.

582
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
How to launch applications.

583
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Switch between applications.

584
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
As well as how to utilize workspaces.

585
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Which will allow you to work more efficiently with your computer.

586
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So let's get started.

587
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Now first and foremost there's a lot going on with the default desktop here.

588
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
We have some icons on the desktop.

589
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
We have some icons here on the left hand side on this panel.

590
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And we even have some icons in the upper right hand corner.

591
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So in no particular order.

592
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Let's go through everything that we see on the screen right now.

593
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
In the upper right hand corner if we click here.

594
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And we can click anywhere here.

595
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Doesn't matter.

596
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Same thing.

597
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You basically get some options that are related to our system in general.

598
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Now these indicators here we have one for wifi.

599
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This will show your wifi signal strength.

600
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I have actually some really good wifi strength right now.

601
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In fact the access point is literally right above my head.

602
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We have a volume icon here.

603
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And a battery icon.

604
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And then here we can actually adjust the sliders for anything here.

605
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You can't see it but this is going to increase or decrease the brightness.

606
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We have a selection here for changing the wifi network.

607
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Or just basically connecting to a wifi network.

608
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You get a list right here.

609
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And then in regards to bluetooth.

610
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We could turn it off to save battery.

611
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Or if we want to actually connect to a bluetooth device.

612
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You can click bluetooth settings right here.

613
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And if we have a bluetooth device that's in pairing mode.

614
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We should see it here.

615
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And then we can connect to it.

616
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You simply just click on it and then follow the prompts.

617
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So for example if you wanted to set up a headset.

618
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And the headset support a bluetooth.

619
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Then this is where you would do that.

620
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Now here for the battery icon.

621
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
We get a selection that only includes one option.

622
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Power settings.

623
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We click on that.

624
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
We not only see the battery life of any devices that we have attached.

625
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
About half remaining on my wireless mouse.

626
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm not really sure what that is.

627
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But we're going to ignore that.

628
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The battery is fully charged.

629
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And if we scroll down.

630
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We can adjust the keyboard brightness.

631
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
If we have a backlight.

632
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I do.

633
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But you can't see it.

634
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But you know, honest it is actually lighting up right now.

635
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We can enable or disable the feature that dims the screen.

636
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
When it's inactive.

637
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't really like that.

638
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So I believe that deactivated here.

639
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I don't really want that to happen.

640
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And then we can enable automatic suspend or disable it.

641
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's enabled by default for battery power.

642
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So if I unplug the power.

643
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And then I just let this thing idle for 20 minutes.

644
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's going to suspend.

645
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And we get some other controls here.

646
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But you know, standard stuff.

647
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Then we have access right here to the settings app.

648
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Which allows us to customize the Ubuntu desktop.

649
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And you just saw that open up to the battery section.

650
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Which was the last one I was on.

651
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Which is how that works.

652
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
We could lock the screen.

653
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So if we need to leave our chair and go get some coffee.

654
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And we don't want anyone to see what we're up to.

655
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
We could lock the screen.

656
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And then if I expand this here.

657
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
We can suspend, restart, power off or log out.

658
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So these are basically all of your system controls.

659
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
In the upper right.

660
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
In the center on the top panel.

661
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It already shows us the current date.

662
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You get a little calendar here.

663
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And if we have any calendar events.

664
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
They will show down here.

665
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And those will show if you have decided to synchronize.

666
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
To any of the calendar services that came up.

667
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
When we initially installed Ubuntu.

668
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It basically asked if we wanted to add any online accounts.

669
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And if you have done that.

670
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And that online account has a calendar for example.

671
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You should see calendar events here if you have any.

672
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Now here we have system related notifications.

673
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't have any right now.

674
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And then if an app shows a notification.

675
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It'll show up right here.

676
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It'll actually briefly display up here at the top.

677
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And about this area right here.

678
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It'll go away after a few seconds.

679
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But if you didn't really get a chance to read it.

680
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You can click here.

681
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And you can see the notification on this list.

682
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If you would prefer not to be disturbed.

683
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And not see any notifications at all.

684
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You can enable do not disturb mode.

685
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So for example.

686
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
If you are recording a YouTube video.

687
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And you don't want any notifications to show up on the screen.

688
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That might interrupt the recording.

689
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Or make you have to edit something out.

690
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Then you would probably enable do not disturb mode.

691
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And as you can tell.

692
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I actually have to utilize that quite a bit.

693
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
But even if you do have do not disturb mode enabled.

694
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
When you click on this.

695
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You will still see any notifications here.

696
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That you would have seen.

697
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
If notifications were not disabled.

698
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Which gives you the opportunity to catch up with notifications.

699
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
After the fact.

700
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
What this does here.

701
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Is it just makes sure that you don't have any notifications.

702
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
To pop up in front of what you are doing.

703
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We have some desktop icons.

704
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So here we have a link to the home folder.

705
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
This is where we actually save files.

706
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And how I got there.

707
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Was I just double clicked right here.

708
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Similarly we have a trash folder as well.

709
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So if you have used any other operating system.

710
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
That has a file manager.

711
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
As well as a trash folder.

712
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Which is probably all of them.

713
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Then you know pretty much what these do.

714
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Your deleted files will actually be stored here.

715
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And then again.

716
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
MP3 files for example.

717
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Family photos whatever you have.

718
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Can all be saved in here.

719
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Which gives you quick access to those files.

720
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
On the left hand side.

721
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We have this panel.

722
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Right here.

723
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Which has a bunch of icons here.

724
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
These icons are favorite applications.

725
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You can mark any application you have installed.

726
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
As a favorite.

727
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I didn't actually mark any of these.

728
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
As a favorite.

729
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Basically these were included as favorites.

730
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
When we installed Ubuntu.

731
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Right click any of these.

732
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And then click here to remove them from the favorites.

733
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And if I do that.

734
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It goes away.

735
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And if I click on any of these apps.

736
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
They will open.

737
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So here's Firefox.

738
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Notice how a dot appears to the left of Firefox.

739
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That shows that that application is actually running.

740
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
If we don't see a dot next to it.

741
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The application is not running.

742
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So that's pretty simple.

743
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So I can open as many applications as I would like.

744
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
As you can see.

745
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And again we can easily tell which ones are actually running.

746
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I can minimize any of these applications.

747
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Just like any other operating system.

748
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And it just basically lowers them back into the tray.

749
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
If I click on any of these icons.

750
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
For a running application.

751
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It brings it back.

752
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Now if I click on this little grid icon.

753
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Down here.

754
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Where it says show application.

755
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That will bring me to a list of all of the applications.

756
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That are installed on this machine.

757
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And there's a lot of applications here.

758
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
That are installed by default.

759
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
For example.

760
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I already have this open.

761
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But it's a full office suite.

762
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Libre Office.

763
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Which is included by default here.

764
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And I can open this right here.

765
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Which is their equivalent to basically Excel.

766
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's a spreadsheet application.

767
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Libre Office.

768
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Is a grid application.

769
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Libre Office.

770
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Is a great office suite.

771
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Now you will actually see some people out there.

772
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That will make fun of Libre Office.

773
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And say things like you know.

774
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's not as good as Microsoft Office.

775
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And it's not compatible.

776
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
All of which is completely false.

777
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I have written five books.

778
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Each professionally published.

779
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And I have used Libre Office to accomplish that.

780
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So if I was able to get.

781
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Five books professionally published.

782
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Through Libre Office.

783
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
That just goes to show you how awesome.

784
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
People on the publishing team.

785
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Were using Microsoft Office.

786
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So we were able to trade files back and forth.

787
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
No problem.

788
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So Libre Office is awesome.

789
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Now older versions of Libre Office.

790
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Work as good as the newer versions.

791
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So some of those opinions actually stem from reality.

792
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Because it was very rough when this came out.

793
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Long story made short.

794
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The developers have made a lot of improvements.

795
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And well.

796
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's actually totally fine.

797
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Now also when it comes to pre-installed applications.

798
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Quite a few things here.

799
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We have some games.

800
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
They're Solitaire for example.

801
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We have Remina.

802
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Or maybe it's pronounced Remina.

803
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So sorry about that.

804
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But anyway.

805
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
This app is actually able to allow you to connect.

806
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
To remote desktops.

807
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So if you actually use your computer professionally.

808
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And you interact with Windows servers.

809
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Or something like that.

810
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You can actually connect to them from this app.

811
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Which is pretty cool.

812
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And here we have Rhythmbox.

813
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
If you have an mp3 collection for example.

814
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
All you really have to do.

815
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And the file manager is basically add all of your music.

816
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Into this folder.

817
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And this app is already configured.

818
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
To look inside this folder.

819
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
To find files.

820
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And then it should show them here.

821
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I don't actually have any mp3 files.

822
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And even if I did.

823
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
If I was to play any of them.

824
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I would probably get a copyright strike.

825
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But if you do have music files.

826
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You might want to check out Rhythmbox.

827
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And we also have a shortcut to it right here as well.

828
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And speaking of that.

829
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
If there is an application.

830
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That you would like to be a favorite.

831
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That isn't currently a favorite.

832
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Then all you really have to do.

833
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Is just right click on it.

834
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And then make it a favorite.

835
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So if I basically want to add.

836
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Solitaire as a favorite.

837
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I'll right click on that.

838
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I'll click add to favorites.

839
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And if I scroll down here.

840
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
There's more applications.

841
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And I will let you explore these applications.

842
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
To see what's included by default.

843
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
There's actually some really cool stuff here.

844
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Now one more I'd like you to see.

845
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Is here in utilities.

846
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's called system monitor.

847
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It allows you to basically keep an eye.

848
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
On system resources.

849
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
For example in the center tab here.

850
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
We can see the CPU usage.

851
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We can see memory usage.

852
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Network history.

853
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Under file systems.

854
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Here in the drive space is actually being utilized.

855
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
As you can see in my case.

856
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Not much.

857
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Then here we get a list of all the processes.

858
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
That are running.

859
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
On our Linux system here.

860
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So if we need to kill something.

861
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That's misbehaving.

862
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
We can right click on it.

863
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And kill the process.

864
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Hopefully you will not have to do that though.

865
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Now also what we can do.

866
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Here on the applications menu.

867
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Is we can actually rearrange these icons.

868
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Any way we see fit.

869
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Maybe closer up here to the top.

870
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I could just basically drop it.

871
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Wherever I want it to be.

872
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
To rearrange these icons.

873
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And what I could do is also drop it on top of another icon.

874
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And that will actually group them together.

875
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So for example.

876
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I could put all the LibreOffice icons.

877
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
All in the same little box here.

878
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And it even named it office.

879
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Which is pretty cool.

880
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I didn't even have to name it.

881
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Another example is I can drag a rhythm box.

882
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Spotify.

883
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Spotify is something that I've installed as a test.

884
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It named it sound and video.

885
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And if you click on it.

886
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You can see the icons that are inside that group.

887
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And you can also go ahead and rename them as well.

888
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Maybe something like that.

889
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'll leave it up to you.

890
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But basically you have full control.

891
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Over the arrangement of the applications on this list.

892
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Now when it comes to switching between applications.

893
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I mean.

894
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
At first it's pretty easy.

895
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Basically you could just have like several applications open.

896
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
If it opens full screen.

897
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You could pull it away from the top.

898
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't know why this happens.

899
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I think this is a bug.

900
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
When you do that with LibreOffice.

901
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It makes it this impossible to use really small window.

902
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So you got to basically position the mouse.

903
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Around the corner there to make it.

904
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
An appropriate size.

905
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
LibreOffice is the only application I've seen do this.

906
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I think it's just the Ubuntu implementation has a bug.

907
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I don't know anyway.

908
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The point is.

909
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Between applications is very easy to do.

910
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Again.

911
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Just like any other operating system.

912
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But where this actually shines.

913
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Is that we have virtual workspaces.

914
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So if I click up here.

915
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Where it shows activities.

916
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And what it's going to do is show me all the applications that are open.

917
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So for example.

918
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
If I had this full screen.

919
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And I wasn't sure which applications I had open.

920
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Now I could just hold alt and press tab.

921
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And then the alt tab menu comes up.

922
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And I could find out what apps are open and switch accordingly.

923
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But I could also just hit the super key.

924
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
To show all of the applications that are open.

925
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I can hit it again.

926
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
To go back to the normal mode.

927
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And I can access that same screen by just clicking on activities.

928
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But what we also have at our disposal.

929
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Is workspaces.

930
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Over here on the right.

931
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
If I just move my mouse over here to the right.

932
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I have an empty desktop that I can use.

933
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And I could switch between this desktop.

934
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
The one I've been using.

935
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Or.

936
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I could switch here.

937
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
To this empty desktop.

938
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And then I could basically open.

939
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yet another app.

940
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And basically I can open apps that are separate from the others.

941
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So for example.

942
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Maybe I'm at work.

943
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And I am playing some solitaire.

944
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And you know.

945
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I just love this game.

946
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And maybe I should be working.

947
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But I just need to finish this game.

948
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And then my boss comes over and is like.

949
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Hey what are you doing.

950
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And switch back to the busy workspace.

951
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Where I'm actually doing work.

952
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then when he or she walks away.

953
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I could just switch back to my game and continue it.

954
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Of course.

955
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Bad example.

956
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But you get the idea.

957
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And what I could do is press the super key.

958
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I could switch between them with the mouse.

959
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But what I actually did.

960
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Was I just held down the super key.

961
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And then I pressed page up.

962
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
To go up a workspace.

963
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And while holding down the super key.

964
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And what you'll also notice.

965
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Back here on activities.

966
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I have an empty workspace right here.

967
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Now previously I had one empty workspace right here.

968
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
But now I have two workspaces that have apps.

969
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
What it did was it went ahead and created a new empty desktop right here.

970
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So if I go here and then I open up.

971
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Let's just say went to software.

972
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And then go back to the overview.

973
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I have another empty workspace.

974
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So basically what will happen is that.

975
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It will always make sure that you have an empty workspace.

976
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And this feature is called dynamic workspaces.

977
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So the number of workspaces that you have available.

978
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Is adjusted automatically.

979
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So it just makes sure that you always have an empty workspace that you can switch to.

980
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
To start a new task.

981
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The reason why I like this is because I can have.

982
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
A workspace for each project that I'm working on.

983
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Which allows me to intelligently segregate my workloads.

984
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And I can have all the apps that are designated.

985
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
For a particular purpose on their own separate workspace.

986
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Which I think is awesome.

987
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So as you can see.

988
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
The Ubuntu desktop actually gives us quite a bit of flexibility.

989
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
For how we run our applications.

990
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
How we separate them.

991
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
How we switch between them and so on.

992
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Now this graphical user interface here.

993
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
This desktop environment.

994
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Is called no.

995
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
There's actually several desktop environments.

996
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Available for Linux distributions.

997
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And this is just one of many.

998
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Noam is one of the more popular desktop environments.

999
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And that's actually what you are interacting with.

1000
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
When you use the standard version of Ubuntu.

1001
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Although they customize it quite a bit.

1002
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Because they add this panel here.

1003
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Which noam doesn't actually have by default.

1004
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So they just basically add a few things here.

1005
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
To make the desktop easier to use.

1006
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And the reason why I mentioned that.

1007
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Is just so if you try a different Linux distribution.

1008
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
That also offers noam as the main desktop environment.

1009
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And it actually operates a bit differently.

1010
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Well now you know.

1011
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Ubuntu actually has some customizations pre-installed.

1012
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
That just makes it easier.

1013
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And the panel is one example of that.

1014
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But go ahead and explore the Ubuntu desktop.

1015
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Just play around with it.

1016
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Get more familiar with it.

1017
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Especially play around with the dynamic workspaces.

1018
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Because that is my favorite feature for sure.

1019
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
In the next section.

1020
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
What I'm going to do is show you how to install additional software.

1021
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So in this section of the video.

1022
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I am going to walk you through how to install software.

1023
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
As discussed in the previous section.

1024
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
There's actually quite a bit of software.

1025
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That's installed here by default.

1026
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Everything from a web browser.

1027
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
To an app that allows you to view what's on your webcam.

1028
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
A remote desktop app.

1029
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Even solitaire of all things.

1030
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
There's quite a few awesome apps already included.

1031
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But how do you add more applications to your Ubuntu desktop?

1032
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Well let's go ahead and explore that.

1033
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And to add new software.

1034
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
We will click right here where it shows.

1035
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
A shopping bag icon here.

1036
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's labeled Ubuntu software.

1037
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
When I click on that.

1038
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It's going to bring me to this application right here.

1039
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Which is the app.

1040
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That we will use to add additional software.

1041
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Think of this like the app store on a mobile platform.

1042
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Or something like that.

1043
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You have some applications up here.

1044
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
That you could consider installing.

1045
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
But more importantly.

1046
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
We have categories down here.

1047
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Of different type of applications that you can choose to install.

1048
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
For example.

1049
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
If you click on games.

1050
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Sometimes it takes a moment for this to refresh.

1051
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And when it does.

1052
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
There's a list of applications that you can actually install.

1053
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So if we start scrolling through the list here.

1054
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
We see quite a few.

1055
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And these are all the apps that are available in the games section.

1056
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Now this is not going to be all of the applications that are available.

1057
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
For the entire Ubuntu platform.

1058
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
These are just applications that are shown as options that you can install.

1059
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That are included in the default repositories.

1060
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Basically the app store if you will.

1061
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Now it's a bit more complicated than that.

1062
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm not going to get really deep into the theory around how this actually works.

1063
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But essentially you'll need to know how to install software.

1064
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Which is what I'm about to show you.

1065
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So for example.

1066
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Let's say you want to install Minecraft.

1067
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So right here.

1068
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We have an option to install the Minecraft installer.

1069
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
We get a description and some information about the application before we install it.

1070
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And then here we have the install button.

1071
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So I'll click on that.

1072
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'll put in my password.

1073
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And that's it.

1074
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
That's really all there is to it.

1075
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You simply click on an application that you'd like to install.

1076
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And then you click the install button.

1077
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And then you just wait through the process and eventually it finishes.

1078
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And then you can go ahead and use the application.

1079
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Now you'll notice that the install button changed to remove.

1080
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
So I could click on that if I'd like to remove that application.

1081
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It should also show up in the menu.

1082
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And I had a scroll for it.

1083
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But here it is.

1084
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
There's Minecraft.

1085
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And if I go back here to the home page.

1086
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And then the installed tab.

1087
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
We get a list of all the software that's installed on our computer.

1088
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And we see the one that we've just added right here.

1089
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
We also see quite a few applications that I did not install.

1090
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Basically what you are seeing here are the applications that are pre-installed as well.

1091
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
In addition to the ones that you install yourself.

1092
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So if any of these applications are just.

1093
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You know maybe there are applications you really don't want to have installed.

1094
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You could basically go ahead and remove them.

1095
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Maybe I don't want to have games installed on my computer.

1096
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Well I can remove it.

1097
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Pretty easy.

1098
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And just like that it's gone.

1099
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We also have a tab right here for updates.

1100
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So if there's any updates available for the applications.

1101
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Then we can click update all.

1102
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Go ahead and get those updated.

1103
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And that's pretty straightforward.

1104
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So when it all comes down to it.

1105
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
This is what you will use most of the time to install software.

1106
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But the problem here is that not all of the applications that you might want to install are going to be available in Ubuntu software.

1107
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So for example.

1108
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Let's search for Google Chrome.

1109
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I'm sure this is one that a lot of you guys are probably going to install.

1110
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So let's search for it.

1111
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And you know what?

1112
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm not seeing it.

1113
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So Google Chrome is not available.

1114
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Actually I already knew that.

1115
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Because some applications out there are not actually committed to the Ubuntu repositories.

1116
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And some developers just kind of keep those applications to themselves.

1117
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But it's still pretty easy to install though.

1118
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
We could just open up a web browser.

1119
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Firefox is pre installed.

1120
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Then we can actually search for the application that we would like to install.

1121
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And here we have the Google Chrome website.

1122
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'll just click on that.

1123
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
We have this download button here.

1124
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
If I click on it.

1125
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It's automatically detecting that I am running on Ubuntu.

1126
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
This is the correct selection by default.

1127
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So we didn't actually have to do anything.

1128
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I can click accept and install.

1129
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I will save the file.

1130
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And it did download.

1131
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So let's open up a file manager in the downloads directory.

1132
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We actually have the file that we have just downloaded.

1133
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So if I double click on that.

1134
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I'll click install.

1135
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I'll type in the password for my user account.

1136
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And as you can see it's actually installing.

1137
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let's see if it's installed.

1138
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And it is.

1139
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So I'll click on it.

1140
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It's fine.

1141
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
So I will not make it the default Firefox is actually my preferred browser.

1142
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But you know it's up to you.

1143
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And then I will uncheck this box here because I think Google knows enough about me already.

1144
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So I'll click OK.

1145
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And as you can see we now have Google Chrome.

1146
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So every now and then you might have to install applications outside of Ubuntu software.

1147
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Google Chrome is one example of that.

1148
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
The licensing restrictions actually prevent Google Chrome from being made available in the normal software store.

1149
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But you get the idea.

1150
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Sometimes you just have to download it and install it that way as you just saw.

1151
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So you just saw two ways of installing software on Ubuntu.

1152
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Either way you should now be able to go through and install any applications that you would like.

1153
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
First you basically just check Ubuntu software.

1154
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
See if the application that you would like to install is located here.

1155
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
If it is there you go.

1156
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If not just do a quick Google search and you'll probably find what you're looking for.

1157
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'll leave it up to you to explore the Ubuntu software store and then install any applications that you may want.

1158
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So there you go.

1159
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000

Ubuntu has always been one of my favorite distributions.

1161
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It runs well on laptops, desktops, as well as servers.

01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And I think it's pretty cool.
