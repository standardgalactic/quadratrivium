0	9840	I want to talk in this video about David Hume's ethical thinking.
9840	14960	Hume here is not only developing a line of thinking about ethics that has been very influential
14960	19680	and very important in its own right, but also really defines a problem.
19680	25440	A problem that philosophers now call the problem of normativity that I take to be fundamental.
25440	29320	It's a fundamental problem not only in philosophy, but in our culture.
29320	35000	I teach an entire course called Ideas of the 20th Century, which takes this as its starting point.
35000	43040	And I see the 20th Century as driven, maybe more than any other single issue, by the problem of normativity.
43040	49120	Not only in philosophy, but in art, in literature, in music, and in politics.
49120	56960	It's something that it seems to me our culture is still grappling with, and our civilization has not yet solved.
56960	60320	So we need to understand what this problem is supposed to be.
60320	65720	More important than Hume's ultimate ethical theory, I think, is actually his definition of the problem,
65720	70560	and his phrasing it in terms that have made it something that, ever since the Enlightenment,
70560	74000	has been an absolutely central intellectual problem.
74000	79320	Not only a central problem in ethics, but a problem in every intellectual field.
79320	82120	Well, what is that problem? What's the issue?
82120	90960	Before I get to his version of it, I want to think more generally about a kind of problem we face in making decisions.
90960	100200	I've sketched out here for another video a general problem of, well, practical action that we might face.
100200	104960	And here I am. I survey my options for my decision.
104960	108960	I think about the various goals I have and the motives those give me.
108960	111640	And then I have to make a decision.
111640	115520	Well, that decision is going to issue in an intention to act in a certain way.
115520	120400	If all goes well, I will act in that way, then that action will have certain consequences.
120400	127600	Of course, I'm framing this decision in a certain kind of setting, in a certain kind of context in the world,
127600	134600	given my character and my own character traits, my virtues and vices, the things I know, the things I don't know.
134600	141160	I do it in a framework that includes institutions, that includes an entire civilization that I'm part of.
141160	144720	I end up ranking those options from better to worse, perhaps.
144720	150200	But whatever I do, I'm doing that and making a judgment of evaluation.
150200	153840	However, what am I doing when I describe these various options?
153840	155600	I am describing them.
155600	159160	And yet what I want to come out of this is a prescription.
159160	161240	I should do this.
161240	164600	I am coming up with something that is an evaluation.
164640	165520	This is better.
165520	173320	This is worse on the basis of a description of the various possible actions open to me.
173320	180000	And so I'm somehow going from a pure description of the world to something that is an evaluation of the world.
180000	185560	Philosophers have talked about the distinction between description and prescription,
185560	192600	between description and evaluation, roughly speaking, between is and ought.
192600	197000	And the question is really how you could possibly get from one to the other.
197000	202480	How can you make room in a world that we think is fully described, for example, by science,
202480	206920	but even if you don't think necessarily by science, by science, by history,
206920	213880	by our common sense experience of the world, by whatever it is, right, we describe what the world is like.
213880	220960	But then we try to draw conclusions for action about what we ought to do, about what the world ought to be like,
220960	226040	about what consequence would be better than what other possible consequence.
226040	227760	We're making evaluations.
227760	232080	We're going to ought or right or wrong or better or worse.
232080	235400	How on earth can we get there if all we have is description?
235400	237480	That's the problem of normativity.
237480	240320	Normativity because we're dealing with norms.
240320	245080	Norms for action, norms for character, norms of all sorts of kinds,
245080	247960	where we're saying this is right, this is wrong.
247960	249880	This is correct, this is incorrect.
249880	252120	You ought to do this, you shouldn't do that.
252120	254680	This is permissible, this is not permissible.
254680	256360	This is better than that.
256360	262280	All of those are making evaluative judgments, stemming from or relating to some kind of norm,
262280	266800	some kind of standard for evaluating things for making such judgments.
266800	270800	But where do those norms, those standards of evaluation come from?
270800	276040	If all we've got in descriptions of the world, on whatever basis, are pure descriptions.
276040	278520	It looks like we're describing the world.
278520	279800	Then we evaluate it.
279800	281720	Where's that evaluation coming from?
281720	287080	It doesn't look like it's coming from anything in our description of the world.
287080	291240	Well, that in a nutshell is not just the problem of normativity.
291240	294080	It is the problem that Hume is pointing out.
294080	298680	It is the key to what we're going to look at.
298680	303760	Hume tells us that morality is not a matter of reason.
303760	306160	And here's his argument in a nutshell.
306240	310240	Morals, he says, have an influence on actions and affections.
310240	314960	Morals are the kind of thing that does evaluate things as better or worse,
314960	319120	that tells me to do or not do something, that draws me towards something,
319120	321320	or that pushes me away from something.
321320	324960	Okay, so morality is supposed to have an influence on my actions.
324960	330600	The whole reason I'm interested in evaluating when I'm deliberating is that I wanted to affect my action.
330600	332440	I'm thinking, what should I do?
332440	335600	And so I evaluate certain options as better or worse options.
335600	336720	I choose one.
336720	342640	The whole point of going through that exercise and doing the evaluation is to affect my action.
342640	345720	It also affects my feelings, my affections, as he puts it.
345720	348920	If I think this is better, I'm going to prefer that one.
348920	351240	I'm not going to like this one as well.
351240	354320	I'm going to think, yes, I approve of that action.
354320	355640	I don't approve of this one.
355640	357480	That's going to get me into trouble.
357480	362680	And so it is something that is done as, well, its main point, you might say.
362680	366320	It's not incidental to morality and to thinking about norms,
366320	368800	that it has an influence on actions and affections.
368800	370280	That's the whole point of it.
370280	376240	They're norms for action or norms for feeling or norms for thinking or norms for speaking.
376240	382400	But the whole point is to govern action and to have some effect on what we do.
382400	387440	Well, he says reason alone can have no such influence.
387440	392560	Reason can just take me from descriptions of the world to more descriptions of the world.
392560	394440	It can't draw me toward anything.
394440	396280	It can't push me away from anything.
396280	398760	It can't give me a reason to act.
398760	400720	It can't affect my feelings.
400720	402480	It's just a description.
402480	406800	And so he says morality is not a conclusion of reason.
406800	410760	Reason cannot affect my actions, can't affect my affections.
410760	412000	But morality does.
412000	413760	Norms do.
413760	416600	So morality cannot be a matter of reason.
416600	419120	It consists of no matter of fact.
419120	423960	If it were a matter of fact that this is wrong, for example, or that this is better than this,
423960	426920	I could do some research and discover that fact.
426920	434880	But in fact, when I take out my options, describe them, and then try to choose and decide what's better than what,
434880	437160	I'm not merely describing anymore.
437160	440000	I'm not finding some additional matter of fact.
440000	448720	Instead, what I'm doing is making an evaluation that is not ultimately based on reason.
448720	452800	Here is how Hume puts it, very famously and most dramatically.
452800	457680	In every system of morality I've met with, I've noticed that the author proceeds for some time,
457680	463800	reasoning in the ordinary way to establish the existence of a god or making points about human affairs,
463800	469880	and then he suddenly surprises me by moving from propositions with the usual copula, is or is not,
469880	473640	to ones that are connected by ought or ought not.
473640	477120	This seems like a very small change, but it's highly important,
477120	481560	for as this ought or ought not expresses some new relation or affirmation,
481560	483960	it needs to be pointed out and explained,
483960	489720	and a reason should be given for how this new relation can be inconceivably a deduction from others
489720	492400	that are entirely different from it.
492400	496360	From merely is, I can never get to ought, okay?
496360	500280	So he says moral, well, reasoning, quote unquote,
500280	505800	what people call moral reasoning seems to go from is and is not to ought and ought not.
505800	510520	It goes from this is this and that's that, to this is better than this.
510520	514360	Where is it getting that? How could we possibly go from is to ought?
514360	516520	How could we go from is not to ought not?
516520	521560	How could we go from this is this and that is that, to this is better than that?
521560	524800	Reason doesn't do that, reason supplies no connection.
524800	529000	So he's saying, look, we can describe the world and do that in rational terms.
529000	532960	Good, good thing that we do that, important to understand matters of fact.
532960	535720	We can relate ideas, that's important too.
535720	538040	That's the other main way in which we obtain knowledge.
538040	542320	We relate ideas, we gain knowledge of matters of fact through experience.
542320	547000	But now, we come with conclusions like you ought to do this,
547000	551080	or this is better than that, or that's virtuous, that's vicious.
551080	552960	Where is that coming from?
552960	555920	It's not in our description, there's no matter of fact.
555920	561120	If somebody says, yeah, look, he killed that guy, that's wrong, murder is wrong.
561120	564000	I can't go out and say, well, let me go back to the crime scene.
564000	568440	I found the blood stains and I found the murder weapon, but I didn't find this wrongness.
568440	571840	Let me go do another search of the crime scene.
571840	573200	That's not going to help, right?
573200	576320	It's not like there's some additional matter of fact I need to discover.
576320	580120	It's not something else about the crime scene that's going to tell me that it's wrong.
580120	584280	And so, neither is it some additional matter of reasoning.
584280	588160	He's saying, look, it's not like you can take the existing facts and say, well, all right,
588160	593120	let me analyze those more carefully and try to see what rational and deductive conclusions
593120	595320	I can get out of those matters of fact.
595320	597160	You're never going to get to the is or is not.
597160	602080	You're never going to get to the murder is wrong or this murder is wrong from any of that.
602080	607000	And so, it's not a question of an additional matter of fact or some new deduction from
607000	609320	some set of matters of fact.
609320	610520	That's not what's going on.
610520	613320	Something of a very different kind is happening.
613320	618160	When I invoke norms and move to an is or is not, ought, ought not.
618160	622960	When I move from, sorry, an is or is not to an ought or ought not, this is better than that.
622960	627360	This is virtuous, this is vicious, and so on.
627360	629680	Here, in short, assumes problem.
629680	632880	Once again, I appeal to the underpants gnomes.
632880	634480	I've got a description.
634480	635640	This is this way.
635640	638120	The world is like this.
638120	639680	It's all in terms of is.
639680	641200	I've described things.
641320	645440	And now, phase two, oh, hocus pocus.
645440	648600	And now, phase three, something that involves norms.
648600	656240	Now I get normativity, ought, ought not, good, bad, evil, better than that, worse than that.
656240	657720	Where did any of that come from?
657720	661360	How could I possibly go from those descriptions to an evaluation?
661360	665400	How could I go from those prescriptions to a prescriptions?
665400	666920	There is no way to do it.
666920	670000	It looks like it's completely mysterious.
670040	672160	I'm going from that to profits.
672160	673600	How do I do that?
673600	675200	Where's phase two?
675200	676760	That, in effect, assumes problem.
676760	680280	I don't see how it's possible for anyone to go from is to ought.
680280	682600	So what on earth is going on here?
682600	686920	Whatever it is, I'm pretty sure it's not a matter of reason.
686920	689200	Well, Hume says, let's take a couple of cases.
689200	691120	We think that cruelty is wrong.
691120	693480	We think that generosity is good.
693480	694400	But why?
694400	696120	Why is cruelty wrong?
696120	698040	Why is generosity good?
698080	701200	There's no fact of the matter to be found in them, he says.
701200	707160	It's not as if you take a case of cruelty and you say, OK, I see what happened here.
707160	711240	In this, there are two, let's take two really similar cases.
711240	715320	In both of these cases, there are two children playing in the park.
715320	721880	And the first child pushes the second one into the pond.
721880	726640	And you think, well, OK, huh, I describe this.
726680	730440	Child A pushes child B into the pond.
730440	733080	Looks like same description in both cases.
733080	735440	But now in the first case, here's what was going on.
735440	737000	It was a case of cruelty.
737000	742040	That child was just saying, oh, man, look at this.
742040	743600	Beautiful pond, isn't it?
743600	745840	And the other one says, yeah, look at the duck swimming.
745840	748880	That kid says, you know, I wish I could swim out there with the ducks,
748880	750440	but I'm really afraid of water.
750440	752000	I'm afraid of swimming.
752000	755080	And so that's when the other child says, you're afraid of swimming, huh?
755080	755800	Can't swim?
755800	756880	Afraid of the water?
756880	758200	Boom!
758200	759440	That's an act of cruelty.
759440	761080	That seems wrong.
761080	762720	But now here's case two.
762720	764360	Again, description in the same way.
764360	766600	These two children are there by the pond.
766600	771000	Child A pushes child B into the pond.
771000	773600	But what was happening there?
773600	776560	The one child said to the other, I feel so hot.
776560	778920	I feel so hot and so thirsty.
778920	784880	This would really, maybe we should get you some water.
784880	786480	Think I could drink that water?
786480	790680	No, I don't think you should drink that water, but, you know, let me look at you.
790680	794320	You're, wait, your skin is cold and clammy.
794320	796080	I don't think you're doing well.
796080	797520	You've got to cool down.
797520	798520	Well, what do I do?
798520	800320	What do I do?
800320	801280	Get in the water.
801280	804040	It'll cool you down.
804040	804640	I'm afraid.
804640	805280	I don't know what's in there.
805280	806360	There are ducks in there.
806360	808320	I'm scared of ducks.
808320	812920	Look, you should get in the water right now.
812920	817400	And child C, I want to push in the water.
817400	820520	Okay, in one case, this is an act of generosity.
820520	823080	The child is saying, look, I think you've got heat stroke.
823080	825000	I think you really need to cool your body down.
825000	828440	I'm pushing you in the water, whether you want to go or not, because I think you need
828440	829680	to be in that water.
829680	833560	In the other case, the child is saying, you're afraid of the water.
833560	835880	And so those are really different.
835880	841240	But the description, if we ignore that history anyway, looks like it's just the same.
841240	843000	Now, you might say, Hume's cheating here.
843000	847000	I gave you the history to tell you why one of these is a case of generosity, and you
847000	851080	say that's good, and the other is a case of cruelty, and you say that's wrong.
851080	854200	But the action itself seems the same.
854200	858480	And Hume says, there's no matter of fact to be found in the action.
858480	860000	Now, what did we do there?
860000	864600	I went into the background, and I gave you some additional facts about the background.
864600	868800	It didn't affect the actual act, which was the pushing of one child into another,
868800	871240	or of another into a pond.
871240	877320	But what happened, you might say, is, well, something we morally evaluate on the basis
877320	881040	of, in this case, finding out a few additional facts, true.
881040	886840	But even given the additional facts, what leads us from those facts to that was,
886840	889480	for example, generous?
889480	891400	A pushed B into the pond.
891400	897600	I tell you, A thought B was exhibiting signs of sunstroke, heatstroke.
897600	900360	So push.
900360	902400	You say that was generous.
902400	905160	I mean, actually, no, that child was OK.
905160	909360	And this was a false panic.
909360	914360	But still, the child was being generous in doing this, was not being cruel.
914360	916960	But it's like, wait, wait.
916960	921600	I mean, yes, those additional facts get us to the conclusion that, in this case, it
921600	923120	was generous and good.
923120	925240	And in that case, it was not generous.
925240	927240	It was cruel and bad.
927280	929960	But exactly how is it doing that?
929960	933240	Hume says, I don't see how reason is actually getting us there.
933240	934560	You're just supplying more facts.
934560	936360	You just supplied some conversation.
936360	937880	Maybe you told me something about motives.
937880	939120	OK, motives.
939120	941280	It was done from this motive or that motive.
941280	944680	But then you're making a judgment, but that was a good motive or a bad motive.
944680	947040	And now I was nowhere near to get that.
947040	948560	Why is that motive bad?
948560	953360	You did it because you thought this child had heatstroke.
953360	957520	You did this because you thought the child was afraid of water.
957520	959720	Why is one of those bad, the other good?
959720	960240	They are.
960240	961960	Hume says, look, I'm not questioning that.
961960	963800	I'm not saying they are bad or good.
963800	967720	I'm just saying, what reasoning did you use to get there?
967720	971200	He ends up saying, it wasn't reasoning at all.
971200	973840	It's the object of feeling, not of reason.
973840	977000	It lies in yourself, not in the object.
977000	981320	An action or sentiment or character is virtuous or vicious.
981320	982200	Why?
982200	984920	Because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness
984920	986920	of a particular kind.
986920	988840	So let's go back to that case.
988840	991680	We think, why was that act of cruelty wrong?
991680	993920	Well, think about that case as I described.
993920	996200	The one child pushes the other into the pond
996200	998600	because they thought they were afraid of water
998600	1002280	and wanted them to be terrified.
1002280	1003720	That seems wrong.
1003720	1006040	And why do you draw that conclusion?
1006040	1009960	It's before you invoke any reasoning and you think, well, fear is not good.
1009960	1011560	And the child would have got it.
1011600	1014840	You just think, oh, that's bad, right?
1014840	1017880	And so often it's the case where something just seems bad.
1017880	1019760	And before the reasoning even kicks in,
1019760	1022040	you just come to the conclusion it's wrong.
1022040	1025200	If I were to bring a cat in here and I were suddenly
1025200	1029280	just slap it for no reason, you'd say, that's terrible, OK?
1029280	1031640	And it's not that you have some view about animal rights
1031640	1035800	and so on that you think about, well, I guess, you know, gosh,
1035800	1038560	I don't know if cats have rights exactly, but they have.
1038560	1040040	You don't have to do any of that.
1040040	1041280	That's really wrong.
1041280	1042960	The feeling is there first.
1042960	1044920	Then you might invoke reasons after that,
1044920	1047800	but it's the feeling that pushes you from is to ought.
1047800	1050520	And the same thing is true when one child thinks
1050520	1052840	the other child is in trouble and so pushes them into the pond.
1052840	1054280	You think that's good.
1054280	1055560	Why?
1055560	1058680	Because you hear the story and you think, oh, that's nice.
1058680	1059760	The child was trying to help.
1059760	1061720	Even if it turned out they were wrong about this,
1061720	1063200	they were trying to help.
1063200	1066560	And so it's feeling that takes you from one to the other.
1066560	1069360	Later you might think about reasons and trying to help
1069360	1071440	and the fact that there's a moral principle of trying
1071440	1073280	to help people, but where does that come from?
1073280	1074720	Does that come from reason?
1074720	1076200	That's Hume's problem.
1076200	1079000	But we could say, OK, yes.
1079000	1081680	It's not a question of an additional fact of the matter.
1081680	1084000	What gets me there is primarily a feeling.
1084000	1085200	I have a feeling.
1085200	1087040	I approve of that or disapprove of that.
1087040	1089640	It makes me feel good inside or bad inside.
1089640	1095120	It causes a pleasure or an uneasiness of various kinds.
1095120	1097360	So here's what takes us from is to ought.
1097360	1098160	How do I get there?
1098160	1099800	What is phase two?
1099800	1101760	Well, it's sentiment or feeling.
1101760	1104600	The phase one description, it's just a description of the world.
1104600	1107080	Here's the matter of fact.
1107080	1108360	Here's the way the world is.
1108360	1111400	Phase two feelings, I respond in a certain way.
1111400	1114920	That arouses a feeling of approbation or disapprobation,
1114920	1116720	as you would say.
1116720	1119880	In me, I feel approval or disapproval.
1119880	1122600	It makes me feel good inside or bad inside.
1122600	1125640	And so it is that sentiment within me
1125640	1129280	that then leads me to say, that was good, that was generous,
1129280	1132240	or that was cruel, that was wrong.
1132240	1134640	You ought to do this, or you shouldn't have done that.
1134640	1137240	And so in those cases, what's happening
1137240	1140640	is it is feeling taking me to that conclusion.
1140640	1143720	Now, there are modern psychological theories,
1143720	1147440	very powerful, maybe our best modern psychological theories
1147440	1150240	of moral reasoning, how people actually do it.
1150240	1153240	And I find it very interesting that they agree with you.
1153240	1155400	They say, it's not that we don't actually
1155400	1158000	talk about reasons, that we don't engage in moral reasoning,
1158000	1161120	we do, but actually it comes second.
1161120	1165040	See how quickly somebody forms a moral conclusion,
1165040	1168720	and then see when they come up with a reason for it.
1168720	1169600	It's quick.
1169600	1171200	It's quick, so you really have to do
1171200	1173440	psychological experiments to find out.
1173440	1175280	But the conclusion comes first.
1175280	1177640	Then the person supplies the reasons.
1177640	1181760	And in some cases, the feeling comes,
1181760	1184600	and they draw the conclusion without any reasons at all.
1184600	1188120	And psychologists have constructed elaborate test cases
1188120	1191040	where they basically anticipate all the possible reasons
1191040	1193880	and build the case so that they don't apply.
1193880	1196760	And then they say, well still, is it right or wrong?
1196760	1199280	And the person says, it's wrong.
1199280	1200520	I know it's wrong.
1200520	1202360	I can't tell you what's wrong with it, though.
1202360	1205280	And they're immediate in that it's wrong reaction.
1205280	1207720	So the psychologists say, it's actually
1207720	1210080	our moral feelings, our intuitions, our sentiments
1210080	1212520	that come first, reasons come later.
1212520	1214840	And that's precisely Hume's position.
1214840	1218720	He's saying it's really feeling that takes us to the art.
1218720	1221560	Then maybe we back up and come up with some mumbo-jumbo
1221560	1222920	about how we got there.
1222920	1224840	But the fact is, it's feeling.
1224840	1227800	It's like, that made me feel bad.
1227800	1228960	That was wrong.
1228960	1231760	And in the end, it really is sentiment and feeling
1231760	1234120	and nothing else that takes us there.
1234120	1236000	So let's go back to what he said.
1236000	1239720	When I call something virtuous or vicious, right or wrong,
1239720	1245480	good or bad, admirable or evil, it's
1245480	1248960	because I am constituted in such a way that I have a feeling.
1248960	1251600	I have a response to it emotionally.
1251600	1253440	That's what's really underlying that.
1253440	1255600	And when I talk about it as wrong,
1255600	1258240	I really just mean in the end, it makes me feel bad.
1258240	1260800	It gives me an unpleasant feeling.
1260800	1264280	And that's really all that's going on.
1264280	1268560	So here's his conclusion, a shocking conclusion actually
1268560	1271240	for someone writing at the height of the Scottish
1271240	1273520	Enlightenment in the age of reason.
1273520	1278480	He says, reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions.
1278480	1279560	Well, it is shocking.
1279560	1281960	Wait, this is the height of the age of reason?
1281960	1284240	That it ought to be the slave of the passions?
1284240	1286960	But Hume says, really, that is what reason does.
1286960	1288120	It follows the passions.
1288120	1289480	It doesn't lead them.
1289480	1291600	Now, reason is useful in describing the world.
1291600	1293880	That it can do, and it can do very well.
1293880	1298000	However, as we've seen in other parts of Hume's theory,
1298000	1301160	actually, a lot of that, what we think of as description
1301160	1304920	is really projection out of that world, causation,
1304920	1307000	necessity, a variety of other things,
1307000	1309960	even the notion of an object as a continuing thing.
1309960	1311840	That's something we are imposing on the world.
1311840	1313760	It's not there in the world itself.
1313760	1314440	Well, guess what?
1314440	1316280	Moral qualities are the same.
1316280	1319320	That's good, that's bad, that's wrong, that's right.
1319320	1320640	Those aren't found in the world.
1320640	1322880	They're things we're projecting onto the world.
1322880	1325800	And in all of those cases, the origin
1325800	1328000	is an internal impression, something
1328000	1330920	like the feeling of expectation in the case of causation
1330920	1332520	or necessity.
1332520	1335880	But in this case, the feeling of approval or disapproval,
1335880	1338640	the feeling of discomfort, or the feeling of pleasure
1338640	1341560	we get in contemplating an action of a certain kind.
1341560	1343960	So he says, there is in us something
1343960	1346560	that we could fairly call a moral sense.
1346560	1350360	That moral sense, that ability to have those right feelings.
1350360	1356000	We feel, we respond, saying, ah, I sense that that's wrong.
1356000	1359280	We no more have a reason for thinking that's wrong
1359280	1360800	than we have a reason for thinking
1360800	1364840	that's red, or green, or white, or black, or purple.
1364840	1365640	We just see it.
1365640	1366880	We have a sense.
1366880	1369320	He says, similarly, we have a moral sense,
1369320	1373240	a capacity for these feelings that constitute the basis
1373240	1375280	for our moral judgments.
1375280	1379080	That moral sense gives us the right kinds of sentiments.
1379080	1382360	Well, if the right kind, there's no explanation.
1382360	1384200	They're just part of human nature.
1384200	1386400	Morality is built on those sentiments,
1386400	1390000	and those sentiments taken together constitute a moral sense.
1390000	1391800	So when is something right?
1391800	1393520	When our moral sense approves it?
1393520	1394400	When is something wrong?
1394400	1396600	When our moral sense disapproves it?
1396600	1398320	There's nothing else to say.
1398320	1400920	There is really no reason.
1400920	1404880	It's a matter of sensation, or something like sensation,
1404880	1406760	not of reasoning about the world.
