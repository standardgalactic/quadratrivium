00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
Today, we're going to talk about pragmatism.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.600
Pragmatism is one philosophical view that is thoroughly American in its orientation.

00:13.600 --> 00:18.240
In fact, most people think of American philosophy and immediately think of pragmatism.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.800
And there was a period in the late 19th century and early 20th century when the pragmatists

00:22.800 --> 00:25.400
really dominated American philosophy.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.280
There were other groups to be sure.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.280
There were some realists.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.640
There were some personalists, some monists, and so on.

00:30.640 --> 00:37.480
But the pragmatists had a strong lock on most very good American philosophy departments.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.000
And that really became a symbol of American philosophy.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.680
These days, pragmatism is in a little bit of a retreat in the sense that figures like

00:45.680 --> 00:50.400
Perse, James, and Dewey, who were the key figures in that early movement, no longer

00:50.400 --> 00:52.960
have quite the same level of respect.

00:52.960 --> 00:59.120
But nevertheless, their attitudes and their perspective continues to be highly influential,

00:59.120 --> 01:03.680
not just in the United States, but throughout the English-speaking world at least, and increasingly

01:03.680 --> 01:06.840
has an impact on French and German philosophy, too.

01:06.840 --> 01:14.200
So pragmatism remains a very appealing philosophy to many people, a very powerful philosophy

01:14.200 --> 01:19.240
that whatever one ends up thinking about it needs to be addressed and dealt with.

01:19.240 --> 01:24.400
In the United States, it was formulated, at first, by Charles Sandler's Perse.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.660
Perse had an odd academic career.

01:26.660 --> 01:31.200
He hung around Harvard for much of his academic life, though he never really was hired there

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
as a professor.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.440
He had various subsidiary positions.

01:34.440 --> 01:39.720
He was himself trained as a scientist at Johns Hopkins and ended up living most of his life

01:39.720 --> 01:45.280
in a large house in rural Pennsylvania, not too far from the Delaware River, and in other

01:45.280 --> 01:47.960
words, just across the river from New Jersey.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.120
Well, he developed something known as the Pragmatic Theory of Truth.

01:53.120 --> 01:58.400
He didn't like the fact that his principle of pragmatism became so popular that other

01:58.400 --> 02:02.160
thinkers began to use it, and actually, in his view, misuse it.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.680
He changed the name of his view to pragmatism because he thought it was ugly enough that

02:06.680 --> 02:08.480
no one would try to copy it.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.960
Luckily for us, that did not really stick, and so his view is still known as pragmatism.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.640
Here is the key idea behind it.

02:15.640 --> 02:20.240
The principle of pragmatism says there is no difference in meaning without a difference

02:20.240 --> 02:21.720
in practice.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.040
So what really matters is what difference it makes.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.600
Indeed, we sometimes talk about things and think about a discussion that somebody's having

02:29.600 --> 02:32.200
and say, well, what difference does it make?

02:32.200 --> 02:34.320
And that's exactly Perse's question.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.480
He says we should be asking that about everything.

02:37.480 --> 02:42.380
Let's say two people are debating a question in theology about the nature of God.

02:42.380 --> 02:45.220
One person says, I think God is absolutely simple.

02:45.220 --> 02:47.780
All the properties of God end up being identical.

02:47.780 --> 02:49.980
The other person says, I don't think that's true.

02:49.980 --> 02:54.100
I don't think this idea of the simplicity of God makes any sense.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.980
Perse says, what difference does it make?

02:56.980 --> 02:59.900
What difference does it make to your actual practice?

02:59.900 --> 03:03.620
In this case, the way you live your life or the way you live your religious life, does

03:03.620 --> 03:05.260
it make a difference in how you worship?

03:05.260 --> 03:10.140
Does it make a difference in what you do in any respect?

03:10.140 --> 03:12.580
If not, there's no difference.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.580
Ignore it.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.140
It's a meaningless dispute.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.820
Don't waste your time.

03:16.820 --> 03:21.140
And some pragmatists put it in a very strong form, saying, look, then there is no difference

03:21.140 --> 03:22.780
in meaning.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.140
The issue is utterly meaningless.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.100
You're not talking about anything at all.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.260
Others say, well, maybe you are.

03:28.260 --> 03:29.540
You're wasting your time, though.

03:29.540 --> 03:30.900
There's no point in discussing it.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.900
It makes no difference.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.060
And so as he means it, it really is the stronger version.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.300
There is no difference in meaning.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.220
Of course, it doesn't just happen in theology.

03:39.220 --> 03:42.300
It can happen all over the place in philosophy and politics.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.820
You can say, well, in the end, what does it matter?

03:44.820 --> 03:46.460
What do we do differently if this is true?

03:46.460 --> 03:49.820
And if the answer is nothing, stop fighting about it.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.780
This dispute doesn't really mean anything.

03:51.780 --> 03:54.020
It's not really about anything.

03:54.020 --> 03:57.980
So his idea is that meaning depends entirely on practice.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.980
And pragmatists are fond of using the phrase, the cash value of something.

04:01.980 --> 04:06.660
What he means by talking about the cash value of a view or the cash value of a proposition

04:06.660 --> 04:09.860
is simply this, the difference it would make in practice.

04:09.860 --> 04:13.220
To get clear about the meanings of our terms and our thoughts,

04:13.220 --> 04:17.620
we need to be clear about the practical antecedents and their practical effects.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.460
What would, practically speaking, make somebody say that?

04:21.460 --> 04:23.940
And what difference would it make if they were true?

04:23.940 --> 04:26.260
What would the effect of that view be?

04:26.260 --> 04:28.900
All too often, he says, we look around and we find out nothing.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.500
People are fighting about nothing.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.020
They're arguing about an issue.

04:32.020 --> 04:35.820
And in the end, you say, I don't understand why it makes a difference.

04:35.820 --> 04:42.940
Now, we've got to be careful here because sometimes it makes a difference of a kind,

04:42.940 --> 04:44.740
but no difference to what we might do now.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.380
Suppose two people are historians and they're fighting about the details

04:48.380 --> 04:50.660
of what happened during the 14th century.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.900
Well, are they really involved in a meaningless discussion?

04:53.900 --> 04:56.060
Presumably not, even though you and I would say,

04:56.060 --> 04:57.540
well, I'm not going to live any differently,

04:57.540 --> 05:02.260
depending on what exactly you decide happened in the 1340s.

05:02.380 --> 05:05.660
But there is a difference about what they're going to teach,

05:05.660 --> 05:07.580
for example, what they're going to write.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.940
And so we don't want to say about all of history.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.420
Forget it, it doesn't make any difference.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.860
Or at least, if it's not immediately relevant to our present situation,

05:14.860 --> 05:17.460
doesn't make any difference, so history is meaningless.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.260
We certainly don't want to say that.

05:19.260 --> 05:23.180
So we've got to be cautious here and understand difference in practice

05:23.180 --> 05:24.740
in a very broad sense.

05:24.740 --> 05:31.620
But there are still issues that you might say I don't see how even the historian

05:31.620 --> 05:36.300
or even the astronomer or whatever is going to really do anything differently

05:36.300 --> 05:37.860
as a result of all of this.

05:37.860 --> 05:40.180
And he thinks that happens fairly frequently.

05:40.180 --> 05:44.220
Much more frequent, however, is the idea that we're fighting about something,

05:44.220 --> 05:47.780
arguing about something, and we aren't identifying the real issue.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.180
We think the issue is this, but really when you analyze it and say,

05:51.180 --> 05:55.980
what difference would it make in practice, you realize, oh, it's really this.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.300
And that kind of thing does happen all the time in everyday life,

05:59.300 --> 06:03.500
as well as in academic contexts or political contexts or religious contexts.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.100
We're fighting about a certain issue, and really when you come right down to it

06:07.100 --> 06:11.380
and analyze the practical difference it would make, that's not really the issue.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.260
The issue is this other thing.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.660
And so that, he thinks, is very common.

06:15.660 --> 06:19.460
The pragmatist principle can help you identify what the real issue is

06:19.460 --> 06:22.060
that you ought to be talking about.

06:22.060 --> 06:25.100
Well, Peirce starts out as a follower of Hegel.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.220
And indeed, throughout the 19th century, all over the United States,

06:28.260 --> 06:31.620
in large cities in small towns, Hegel society sprang up,

06:31.620 --> 06:36.540
and people began reading the works of Hegel and discussing them in these small social groups.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.700
These book clubs basically devoted to the works of Hegel.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.340
Now, from our point of view today, that seems like a bizarre thing.

06:42.340 --> 06:46.380
For one thing, we have book clubs, but they don't tend to address philosophical works,

06:46.380 --> 06:51.660
especially long, serious philosophical works like the phenomenology of spirit.

06:51.660 --> 06:55.140
But also, Hegel is a notoriously difficult philosopher.

06:55.140 --> 06:58.100
So why were people so devoted to this?

06:58.100 --> 07:00.740
And how did that turn into pragmatism?

07:00.740 --> 07:04.220
Well, Hegel had, in a way, a dramatically new idea.

07:04.220 --> 07:10.460
This new idea was that absolute truth isn't there before us to be discovered in the world right now.

07:10.460 --> 07:14.340
It is the end of a long dynamic process.

07:14.340 --> 07:17.380
And so there are these higher level dynamic laws,

07:17.380 --> 07:21.740
like the thesis antithesis synthesis law, but also like other laws,

07:21.740 --> 07:26.100
that are going to operate on the development of thought.

07:26.100 --> 07:31.100
And that we are on a ride toward the achievement of absolute knowledge.

07:31.100 --> 07:37.180
We're geist, we're the spirit, we're mind, ultimately and fully realizes itself.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.340
It's an inspiring picture.

07:39.340 --> 07:43.660
It fits in with the 19th century's conception of itself as an age of progress.

07:43.660 --> 07:47.460
Hegel is essentially saying, yes, the entire history of the human race,

07:47.460 --> 07:50.780
the human species is a story of progress,

07:50.780 --> 07:55.780
thought getting closer and closer to absolute knowledge and the absolute truth.

07:55.780 --> 08:00.140
And so there's a way in which it had a strong appeal for the American spirit.

08:00.140 --> 08:05.100
It also was something that seemed to promise a new way of thinking about

08:05.100 --> 08:08.620
philosophical problems and practical problems together.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.700
Because they were all bound up together.

08:10.700 --> 08:16.860
The way we think about everything is something that is part of the development of this spirit.

08:16.860 --> 08:20.700
And then how we act, that's all a result of the way we're thinking about things.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.540
And so it's all driven by these dynamic processes.

08:24.540 --> 08:29.820
The idea of progress, of dynamics, of moving forward in this way,

08:29.820 --> 08:33.260
was tremendously exciting to people.

08:33.260 --> 08:39.140
Perse is deeply influenced by all of this, but he makes two major changes to Hegel's scheme.

08:39.140 --> 08:43.540
First of all, he replaces these perhaps mysterious dynamic principles,

08:43.540 --> 08:46.740
like that one involving thesis, antithesis, synthesis,

08:46.740 --> 08:50.340
with an empirically grounded account of scientific inquiry.

08:50.340 --> 08:53.140
So he says, wait a minute, how does thought progress?

08:53.140 --> 08:56.540
Well, insofar as it's rational, I'll tell you how it progresses.

08:56.540 --> 09:00.940
It's not through mystical laws that have to be discovered through this very complicated process.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.540
It's scientific method.

09:02.540 --> 09:06.180
Scientific method is the way we have of actually advancing knowledge.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.660
So we don't have to do our own independent philosophizing.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.540
We can look at what scientists do.

09:10.540 --> 09:12.980
Remember, he was trained as a scientist.

09:12.980 --> 09:16.180
Secondly, he says, we use the idea of the limit of inquiry.

09:16.180 --> 09:20.380
Not just as a hope and something we believe we're progressing toward,

09:20.380 --> 09:23.780
is a definition of truth itself.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.860
Those are important changes, and they make pragmatism quite distinctive.

09:27.860 --> 09:33.020
It remains a version of idealism, but a really distinctive version of idealism.

09:33.020 --> 09:35.420
So here's how we think about it.

09:35.420 --> 09:38.940
Thought, as we ordinarily conceive it, aims at truth.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.380
Now, not all thinking does.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.980
Sometimes we're just musing, contemplating.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.180
Sometimes we're telling stories, imagining things.

09:46.180 --> 09:51.780
But when we're serious, in a scientific spirit or in the spirit of inquiry in general,

09:51.780 --> 09:53.820
we want to find out what's true.

09:53.820 --> 10:00.180
So truth is the goal of thinking, at least thinking of that kind.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.180
Well, the same thing is true of practice.

10:02.180 --> 10:05.500
We want to base what we do on a real conception of the world.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.060
We want to get things right.

10:07.060 --> 10:10.740
If I am walking over to the edge of a cliff, I want to be sure I know where it is.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.140
I don't want to fall off.

10:12.140 --> 10:19.260
So I want that action to be based on thinking that is actually accurate about the world.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.860
Well, what kind of thought and practice aims at the truth?

10:22.860 --> 10:26.900
Not all thought and practice does, but some does.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.340
And the paradigm of doing that is science.

10:30.340 --> 10:34.260
Scientific inquiry aims at truth.

10:34.260 --> 10:39.380
In particular, scientific inquiry aims at what we might call stable belief.

10:39.380 --> 10:44.260
That is to say, belief we're not going to have to give up in the face of further information.

10:44.260 --> 10:49.140
Our reasoning is typically what computer scientists today call non-monotomic.

10:49.140 --> 10:52.700
That is to say, it doesn't always progress in the same direction.

10:52.700 --> 10:58.380
It is not always a question of progressing, getting more and more theorems derived from our axioms.

10:58.380 --> 11:02.620
If you think about Euclid's geometry or something like that as the model of knowledge,

11:02.620 --> 11:06.780
which is something that philosophers did for centuries, Aristotle has something like that conception.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.460
So does Descartes, so does Spinoza.

11:09.460 --> 11:14.660
And if you think of knowledges like that, well, it really is like you identify the correct starting points

11:14.660 --> 11:20.500
and then you just keep building truths on those and the realm of truth just gets bigger and bigger.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.900
But Peirce says, well, that's not the way science goes.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.740
In science, we frame hypotheses.

11:24.740 --> 11:25.620
Then we experiment.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.500
We test those hypotheses.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.300
And sometimes they're confirmed.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.260
Sometimes they're rejected.

11:31.260 --> 11:35.860
Sometimes we have to make adjustments and try again with a new and better hypothesis.

11:35.860 --> 11:41.660
And so we often give up beliefs in science in the face of further information.

11:41.660 --> 11:46.660
In fact, these days it's popular for some people to say, well, the science is settled about x, y, or z.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.820
Peirce would say, the science is never settled.

11:48.820 --> 11:55.340
Science, no matter how well supported something is, is always open to the possibility that we're wrong about it.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.700
It's our best hypothesis.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.980
At the moment, our evidence seems to support it.

11:58.980 --> 12:03.220
But even in such a case, he says, there is a real possibility

12:03.220 --> 12:06.180
that it will have to be given up in the face of further information.

12:06.180 --> 12:12.460
Our goal, of course, is to come to belief that as it happens, though they in principle could be overcome by further evidence,

12:12.460 --> 12:14.060
they never really will be.

12:14.060 --> 12:19.580
All the subsequent evidence will either support them or at least not contradict them.

12:19.580 --> 12:24.740
So what we're doing in science is proposing hypotheses, testing them, developing them,

12:24.740 --> 12:31.260
and trying to get them into a form where we no longer have to keep revising them or getting rid of them and replacing them.

12:31.300 --> 12:37.540
Where we can instead say, well, this was our hypothesis, so far it's worked and it seems to keep working.

12:37.540 --> 12:40.140
And our hope is it'll keep working on into the future.

12:40.140 --> 12:43.940
So call a belief stable when it really will, when it will continue.

12:43.940 --> 12:48.620
In principle, yes, it could be overturned, but in practice, in fact, it won't be.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.500
That makes it a stable belief.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.500
Well, that's the goal of science.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.660
So what is special about science and about scientific method?

12:56.660 --> 12:58.780
It's self-correcting.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.660
We make these observations.

13:00.660 --> 13:02.460
We formulate hypotheses.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.260
We test their consequences by experiment.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.460
Then we revise the hypotheses in light of new evidence.

13:08.460 --> 13:12.020
We're looking for stable ones that we won't have to revise anymore.

13:12.020 --> 13:19.140
But hey, along the way, how do we have any confidence in the hypotheses we're making and in what survived tests so far?

13:19.140 --> 13:20.580
Because we've been doing this.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.100
We've been making hypotheses.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.740
We've been making observations.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.940
We test consequences by experiment.

13:25.940 --> 13:28.060
We revise our hypotheses.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.380
We keep going.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.820
And so science is self-correcting.

13:31.820 --> 13:34.060
Now, sometimes the correction happens quickly.

13:34.060 --> 13:37.940
Sometimes it can take centuries before people realize, yes, this idea is wrong-headed.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.780
We have to formulate a new hypothesis.

13:40.780 --> 13:51.300
But that's partly because as science improves, it gets harder and harder to actually find cases that are really going to divide some scientific theories from others.

13:51.300 --> 14:13.700
And so often people are in a position where they say, look, we can't solve this without tremendous technological improvements, like building a supercollider, or sending an explorer beyond the solar system, or doing a variety of other things that are going to give us new kinds of evidence that will enable us to test theories in new ways.

14:13.700 --> 14:17.940
So what gives us confidence in the scientific method is that it's self-correcting.

14:17.980 --> 14:23.580
And Purr says, look, that's really a very special and very important quality to scientific method.

14:23.580 --> 14:27.260
It's not something you find in other inquiries.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.180
Is art self-correcting?

14:29.180 --> 14:37.940
You might hope so, in that art that's really bad doesn't sell, and so people can't make a living at it, and they go out, you know, they have to do something else, and so on.

14:37.940 --> 14:44.140
But really, there's nothing like this process in the art world, or in the world of literature, or the world of music, or other things.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.900
There's something maybe kind of approximating it.

14:46.900 --> 14:56.780
But science is unique in that it does make these observations, formulate the hypotheses, and then keep revising them whenever problems are encountered.

14:56.780 --> 14:59.380
So here we see some examples of experiments.

14:59.380 --> 15:05.980
Here a very disturbing one of seeing what happens to a bird when we pump all the air out of a chamber containing it.

15:05.980 --> 15:11.660
As you can tell by the worried faces of the children, it's not going to be good.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.740
Or here a dramatic experiment.

15:14.740 --> 15:21.820
The man who is being shot at right there invented the bulletproof vest, and here is how he tested it.

15:21.820 --> 15:41.220
He was so confident that it would work that his way of publicizing it was to get photographers there, get, yes, the police there, but also get various people who were journalists there to watch him being shot in the chest while he wore the bulletproof vest to prove that it worked and that he would survive.

15:41.220 --> 15:42.220
He did.

15:45.220 --> 15:51.700
People have admired Albert Einstein, partly because of his attitude about science.

15:51.700 --> 16:02.900
Lots of scientists get pretty attached to their theories, and sometimes it takes somebody else to actually test a hypothesis and find the experimental evidence that needs to be revised or rejected.

16:02.900 --> 16:06.100
But Einstein was open to that from the very beginning.

16:06.100 --> 16:11.980
Our goal, Perce would say, is to formulate laws and theories that survive experimental tests.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.660
And that's the way Einstein thought of his own theories.

16:14.660 --> 16:19.300
He said, look, there's this puzzle about the nature of time, about the speed of light.

16:19.300 --> 16:29.700
I don't know how to make sense of the Michelson-Morley experiment and a variety of other phenomena that, by the turn of the century, physicists were aware of but had no explanation of.

16:29.700 --> 16:36.660
So he formulated, first, the special theory of relativity, and then the general theory of relativity to try to solve those problems.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.220
But his reaction to that wasn't to say, so here's the truth.

16:40.220 --> 16:43.420
It was instead to say, these are hypotheses.

16:43.420 --> 16:50.500
And where exactly is my theory going to differ from Newtonian theory or maybe other competing theories?

16:50.500 --> 16:54.860
Well, he proposed some experimental tests and he said, here is what's going to test.

16:54.860 --> 17:01.660
If I don't turn out to have the right predictions about these cases, get rid of my theory and replace it with something better.

17:01.660 --> 17:05.260
So in 1905, he published the special theory of relativity.

17:05.260 --> 17:11.180
According to that theory, length, velocity, simultaneity, and so on are relative to an inertial frame.

17:11.180 --> 17:15.500
They're not absolute or primary qualities, as philosophers had tended to think.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.140
They're relative to the perceiver.

17:18.140 --> 17:22.500
And then in 1915, he proposed the general theory of relativity.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.660
According to that, space-time curves around masses.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.340
There is no action at a distance.

17:27.340 --> 17:29.820
There is no force like the force of gravitation.

17:29.820 --> 17:40.540
As in Newtonian theory, instead, space-time itself gets curved around massive objects and that gives the effect of a gravitational force.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.580
So in Newton's theory, gravity works something like this.

17:43.580 --> 17:50.380
We've got the law of gravitation that says the gravitational force is proportional to the gravitational constant

17:50.380 --> 17:57.100
times the product of the masses of the object divided by the square of the distance between them.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.380
In Einstein's theory, we get a picture like this.

18:00.380 --> 18:04.860
The actual equations are incredibly complicated, involve the tensor calculus,

18:04.860 --> 18:08.700
but the effect of it is that space-time has a curvature.

18:08.700 --> 18:16.620
And that's why the moon revolves around the earth, because space-time is curved around a massive object like the earth.

18:16.620 --> 18:23.020
Well, here are the classical texts that Einstein proposed, the perihelion precession of mercenary,

18:23.020 --> 18:27.500
the deflection of light by the sun, and gravitational redshift of light.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.220
He says, let's find out if we can observe these.

18:30.220 --> 18:31.660
My theory predicts them.

18:31.660 --> 18:33.020
Newton's doesn't.

18:33.020 --> 18:34.460
Here's a good test case.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.740
Let's measure carefully and see if we predict this.

18:37.740 --> 18:38.940
And of course, there's a possibility.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.700
Maybe Newton will turn out to be right.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.780
Maybe Einstein's prediction will be right.

18:42.780 --> 18:46.140
Maybe neither will be right, and we'll have to say we need yet another theory.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.140
Well, people did that.

18:48.140 --> 18:54.540
And in 1919, they came back with the report that Einstein's theory was correct.

18:55.180 --> 18:58.140
So you can see here some things in the popular press.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.540
It really took the public imagination.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.060
Is there a fourth dimension?

19:02.060 --> 19:05.900
Einstein's theory has given a tremendous jolt to the world of science.

19:06.620 --> 19:10.940
Here is the key paper by Arthur Eddington of Two Tables fame,

19:11.740 --> 19:14.700
who went to the Indian Ocean to do the measurements

19:14.700 --> 19:17.660
and came back reporting on the results of the expedition,

19:17.660 --> 19:21.580
which were to confirm Einstein's theory about the deflection of light

19:21.580 --> 19:23.340
in the sun's gravitational field.

19:23.980 --> 19:28.140
By observing the total eclipse of May 29, 1919,

19:28.140 --> 19:31.340
that again revolutionized the scientific world.

19:31.340 --> 19:34.300
And Paul Johnson, the historian in his book Modern Time,

19:34.300 --> 19:37.820
says this is really the beginning of the 20th century.

19:38.780 --> 19:40.300
Here, another newspaper headline,

19:40.300 --> 19:43.900
how Dr. Einstein has modified our ideas of nature.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.300
To the general public, it is startling to learn

19:46.300 --> 19:48.700
that life doesn't travel in a straight line.

19:49.900 --> 19:53.740
And then, Einstein theory causes scientific war.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.420
The little highlighted passage there,

19:55.420 --> 19:58.140
which you probably can't read on your screen, says this.

19:58.140 --> 20:00.540
This should have ended a pleasant evening.

20:00.540 --> 20:03.980
But after the meeting, a number of students chased Professor Einstein home

20:03.980 --> 20:05.340
and threatened to cut his throat.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.220
Well, yes.

20:08.220 --> 20:12.700
It was something that stirred a great deal of passion, positive and negative.

20:12.700 --> 20:16.620
It was something that did revolutionize people's conceptions of the universe

20:16.620 --> 20:18.140
and their place in the universe.

20:18.140 --> 20:22.940
And so the theory of relativity was something that was profoundly shocking to people,

20:22.940 --> 20:25.180
making major newspaper headlines,

20:25.180 --> 20:29.420
causing students to riot and chase him threatening to cut his throat

20:29.420 --> 20:32.860
in a way that is a little hard for us to imagine these days.

20:33.820 --> 20:37.500
One doesn't think anybody's going to read something in physics letters A,

20:37.500 --> 20:40.940
for example, and suddenly start charging through the streets writing

20:40.940 --> 20:44.780
or writing massive newspaper articles about it for the popular press.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.580
In any case, the pragmatist says,

20:47.580 --> 20:51.820
Einstein's attitude is exactly the scientific ideal.

20:51.820 --> 20:55.580
We formulate these hypotheses and then we subject them to test.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.340
We hope they'll survive the test,

20:57.340 --> 20:59.660
but we face the fact they very well may not.

21:00.620 --> 21:04.940
Well, this leads to a revision in our conception of the relationship

21:04.940 --> 21:08.620
between science and truth, or at least so argues the pragmatist.

21:08.620 --> 21:12.300
The correspondence theorist defines scientific activity

21:12.300 --> 21:14.380
as the activity that aims at the truth.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.180
And so far, I've been talking about it in that kind of common sense.

21:17.180 --> 21:20.300
He way away popular among realists in philosophy

21:20.300 --> 21:23.100
that says truth is correspondence with the facts.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.340
Perce turns that around.

21:25.340 --> 21:31.660
He says, let's instead define truth as that at which scientific activity aims.

21:31.660 --> 21:36.540
So instead of saying what makes something science, it's it's aiming at truth.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.220
Instead, we say, what is truth?

21:39.100 --> 21:43.340
It's not correspondence with reality as if we could somehow step outside of science,

21:43.340 --> 21:45.420
step outside of our own minds, our own language,

21:45.420 --> 21:49.100
our own conceptual scheme, and grasp reality and judge a correspondence

21:49.100 --> 21:51.260
between our statement and the fact.

21:51.420 --> 21:56.860
He says, no, truth is defined as what science aims at, namely stable belief.

21:56.860 --> 22:01.180
So truth becomes a belief that is not going to be overturned

22:01.180 --> 22:05.180
in the face of further information, further experimentation, further testing.

22:07.020 --> 22:10.860
So Perce puts it this way, the opinion that is fated to be ultimately agreed to

22:10.860 --> 22:14.460
by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth.

22:14.460 --> 22:17.820
And the object represented in this opinion is the real.

22:18.460 --> 22:23.500
Reality is just being something that is part of and claimed,

22:23.500 --> 22:27.100
has its existence claimed by our ultimate theory that people agree on.

22:27.100 --> 22:30.300
And the opinion that's fated to be agreed to by everyone,

22:30.300 --> 22:33.100
because it is stable belief it will never be overturned,

22:33.100 --> 22:35.020
that is simply the truth.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.540
That is what truth is.

22:38.300 --> 22:41.260
So truth, according to Perce, is a kind of coherence.

22:41.260 --> 22:45.420
He calls it a concordance with not just what we know now,

22:45.580 --> 22:48.700
but with the ideal limit of scientific inquiry.

22:48.700 --> 22:52.780
Not what even scientists will know tomorrow or the day after,

22:52.780 --> 22:54.060
but the ultimate limit.

22:54.060 --> 22:56.380
If we were able to carry out all experiments,

22:56.380 --> 23:00.860
subject all of the hypotheses to that test, we'd end up believing this.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.220
He says, that's the truth.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.380
That's what it is for something to be true.

23:04.380 --> 23:07.900
The truth is simply what we're all eventually bound to agree on.

23:10.300 --> 23:12.620
Well, as I've stressed throughout,

23:12.700 --> 23:15.820
Perce thinks that anything in principle could be overturned.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.100
He's a fallibilist.

23:17.100 --> 23:20.300
He thinks any of our beliefs might turn out to be mistaken.

23:20.300 --> 23:24.780
Any of our hypotheses might turn out to get contrary evidence when we inquire.

23:24.780 --> 23:30.300
So further inquiry is always something that could lead us to give up any of our beliefs.

23:30.300 --> 23:34.380
Beliefs can be justified and kind of rise from a reliable process,

23:34.380 --> 23:36.060
but still be fallible.

23:36.060 --> 23:39.500
That means new evidence, new arguments, counter examples,

23:40.460 --> 23:42.860
and so on might end up undercutting those beliefs.

23:43.420 --> 23:47.500
So he says, we can have knowledge in the sense that we can form beliefs

23:47.500 --> 23:49.580
that have good evidence behind them,

23:49.580 --> 23:50.940
for which we have justification,

23:50.940 --> 23:53.500
that have arisen from a reliable process,

23:53.500 --> 23:56.460
that so far have not been overturned by any further evidence.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.420
But we can never have certainty.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.260
We can never have certainty about anything,

24:01.260 --> 24:04.460
because it is always possible that further inquiry

24:04.460 --> 24:07.660
will develop something that surprises us.

24:07.740 --> 24:11.340
And so we will face new evidence that forces us to give up that belief.

24:12.860 --> 24:16.860
Well, that allows Purse to undermine some of Leibniz's arguments for rationalism.

24:17.580 --> 24:22.460
Remember, Leibniz argued that contingent experience doesn't entail any necessary truths,

24:22.460 --> 24:25.660
and particular experience doesn't entail any universal truths.

24:26.220 --> 24:28.220
Purse is going to say, well, that's okay.

24:28.220 --> 24:29.900
Nothing has to be entailed.

24:29.900 --> 24:33.980
It doesn't have to be forced to be true on the basis of our experience.

24:33.980 --> 24:36.460
It just has to be supported by our experience.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.940
It has to be something that can explain our experience,

24:38.940 --> 24:40.460
and it hasn't yet been overturned.

24:41.020 --> 24:45.420
So he says, look, evidence never conclusively establishes a conclusion.

24:45.420 --> 24:47.180
Leibniz wants too much.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.380
He wants something that can serve as a universal and necessary

24:50.380 --> 24:52.780
synthetic a priori principle to get us

24:52.780 --> 24:54.780
from the contingent particular experiences

24:54.780 --> 24:57.980
to these universal necessary law-like conclusions.

24:57.980 --> 24:59.740
He says, that's not how it works.

24:59.740 --> 25:03.500
We propose those necessary universal law-like things

25:03.500 --> 25:05.660
as a way of explaining our experience,

25:05.660 --> 25:07.260
but there's always a gap.

25:07.260 --> 25:08.940
There's always fallibility.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.380
These are never guaranteed.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.860
We're in a position where we always might have to give them up.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.260
The best we get up for is stability,

25:15.260 --> 25:17.420
that we won't, in fact, have to give them up,

25:17.420 --> 25:20.220
that further evidence is going to end up confirming them,

25:20.220 --> 25:22.300
supporting them, rather than undermining them.

25:24.140 --> 25:26.780
Well, here's how we should think of science then,

25:26.780 --> 25:28.860
and in general, human inquiry.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.420
It's a process of rational belief revision.

25:31.420 --> 25:33.340
We encounter new information.

25:33.340 --> 25:34.780
We update our beliefs.

25:34.780 --> 25:35.740
We keep some of them.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.700
We reject others.

25:36.700 --> 25:37.500
We add new ones.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.860
We revise some.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.420
Truth is what works in the context

25:41.420 --> 25:43.660
of that rational belief revision.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.580
Sometimes people summarize pragmatism

25:45.580 --> 25:47.260
by saying the truth is just what works.

25:47.820 --> 25:50.220
Well, yes, but in this very special sense,

25:50.220 --> 25:52.700
what continues to work in the context

25:52.700 --> 25:55.740
of our attempt to revise our beliefs rationally.

25:55.740 --> 25:58.620
It's not like, hey, I wasn't sure what to do

25:58.620 --> 26:00.700
about that fence that's falling down in the backyard,

26:00.700 --> 26:01.900
but I did this and it seemed to work.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.660
So I guess everything I thought about it was true.

26:04.220 --> 26:05.660
No, it's not like that.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.980
It's like, look, we're doing the process of science.

26:07.980 --> 26:11.580
We're engaged in this self-correcting form of inquiry.

26:11.580 --> 26:16.460
And what works in the context of that, that we can call the truth.

26:17.020 --> 26:21.580
So truth is what our process of rational belief revision

26:22.140 --> 26:23.260
stabilizes on.

26:23.900 --> 26:27.500
Truth is something that we end up agreeing to, he says,

26:27.500 --> 26:29.740
when we engage in this self-correcting process

26:29.740 --> 26:31.420
of rational belief revision.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.500
We end up with some stable beliefs.

26:34.060 --> 26:39.980
And that's what counts as the truth.
