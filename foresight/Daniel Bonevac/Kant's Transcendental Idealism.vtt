00:00.000 --> 00:12.160
Hi, I want to talk to you today about Immanuel Kant's Copernican Revolution in philosophy.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.480
Kant sees himself as doing for philosophy, just what Copernicus did to astronomy and

00:17.480 --> 00:20.000
to our general perspective on the universe.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.840
Kant thinks he's switching our perspective on the entire philosophical universe.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.360
And in some sense, he did.

00:25.360 --> 00:30.440
Richard Rorty has said that Kant is the person who turned philosophy into a profession,

00:30.440 --> 00:34.680
basically because his thinking was so difficult that you had to be a professional to understand

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
it.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.080
And Kant is difficult.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.880
Nevertheless, he transformed the philosophical world in a fundamental way, everyone writing

00:41.880 --> 00:45.440
after Kant, whether they approve of his revolution or not.

00:45.440 --> 00:51.080
Nevertheless, he is in some sense responding to Kant and seeing things in the light of

00:51.080 --> 00:55.000
what Kant argued and what Kant accomplished.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.480
What did Kant accomplish?

00:56.480 --> 01:01.480
I think there's a sense in which he was right that he did fundamentally transform the way

01:01.480 --> 01:04.840
we think about certain philosophical problems.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.240
But there's another sense in which he was doing the reverse of what he claimed.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.820
He really wasn't like Copernicus, as I'll argue.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.680
He is somebody who was like the inverse of Copernicus, somebody who switched our perspective

01:15.680 --> 01:20.920
but away from something like Copernicus's perspective toward something much more ancient.

01:20.920 --> 01:27.600
At any event, let's take a look at the view that Kant describes as transcendental idealism.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.000
It is, from one point of view, a kind of idealism.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.320
Nevertheless, it's not exactly a traditional kind of idealism, and in fact, in his greatest

01:36.320 --> 01:41.640
work, The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues against idealism.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.200
He has a section entitled The Refutation of Idealism.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.520
So if transcendental idealism is an idealism at all, it's a very odd kind of idealism,

01:50.520 --> 01:51.880
as we'll see.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.880
That phrase, Critique of Pure Reason, should be understood as ambiguous.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.920
In part, he is critiquing pure reason and pointing out that it has severe limits.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.160
On the other hand, it is also a critique conducted by pure reason.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.120
It is pure reason's critique.

02:07.120 --> 02:12.360
And so in that way, it is really something like pure reason critiquing itself.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.200
Well, what did Copernicus do?

02:15.200 --> 02:19.960
Copernicus transformed our understanding of the universe and transformed the science

02:19.960 --> 02:26.960
of astronomy by reversing our perspective on our position in the universe.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.680
He did it by saying, look, according to an older conception, we are at the center of

02:31.680 --> 02:32.680
the universe.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.000
The Earth is at the center.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.760
Everything revolves around us.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.600
However, he said that's not right.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.800
Instead something else is at the center, at least, of the solar system.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.760
We revolve around it.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.880
So here is an earlier Ptolemaic conception of the universe.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.080
There in the center is the Earth.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.120
The Sun revolves around the Earth.

02:53.120 --> 02:59.040
And then other things revolve around the Earth as well, including the outer spheres containing

02:59.040 --> 03:00.920
the stars.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.240
Copernicus, on the other hand, said, no, no, it's not like that at all.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.600
In fact, the Sun is at the center of the solar system.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.960
The Earth and the other planets revolve around it.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.640
Well, Kant sees himself as doing something like that.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.320
Now exactly why?

03:17.320 --> 03:20.720
Why does he think he's transforming our perspective in this?

03:20.720 --> 03:27.480
Well, he sees himself as responding to the contrast between rationalism and empiricism,

03:27.480 --> 03:30.760
a contrast that dominated early modern philosophy.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.960
Kant himself was brought up in the rationalist tradition.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.760
He was a student of Christian Wolf, who was a student of Leibniz.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.880
And so he thought of things very much as Leibniz had.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.760
He sees himself as part of that rationalist tradition.

03:43.760 --> 03:50.080
However, he says that then he read David Hume, and Hume awoke him from his dogmatic slumber.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.720
At that point, he changed his perspective and realized that he had to do something to

03:54.720 --> 03:59.480
try to combine the insights of both the empiricist and the rationalist tradition.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.800
How did he do it?

04:00.800 --> 04:07.440
Well, the rationalists, people like Galvesena, Descartes, and Leibniz, had held that universality

04:07.440 --> 04:12.600
and necessity, the kind you find in scientific laws, for example, but also in mathematics,

04:12.600 --> 04:18.880
required synthetic a priori knowledge, knowledge of the world that was independent of experience.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.440
We weren't gaining a knowledge of universality from our particular experiences.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.160
We weren't gaining knowledge of necessity from our contingent experiences.

04:27.160 --> 04:31.600
Instead, they were being supplied from some other source, something that was not from

04:31.600 --> 04:36.080
experience at all, not a posteriori, so it had to be a priori.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.240
But it was really telling us something about the world, not just about language or concepts,

04:40.240 --> 04:42.760
and so it had to be synthetic as well.

04:42.760 --> 04:48.800
Well, Hume said, I think you've got the problem right, but the solution wrong.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.560
You're right that universality and necessity, causation, and a variety of other things aren't

04:53.560 --> 04:57.680
coming from your contingent and particular experiences of the world.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.080
However, they aren't coming from reason at all.

05:01.080 --> 05:06.040
There is no synthetic a priori savior waiting in the background to say, I have the cause

05:06.040 --> 05:09.920
and the concepts you need, I have the principles you need, I'm going to allow you to get to

05:09.920 --> 05:10.920
those conclusions.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.400
Instead, Hume says, look, here's what's going on.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.240
You see something happen a bunch of times, you get a feeling of expectation that it will

05:18.240 --> 05:19.240
happen again.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.720
It's that feeling, it's that sentiment inside you.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.240
It's not something rational.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.920
There is no bit of knowledge underlying it.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.080
Instead, it is simply a passion.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.120
It is custom or habit, but here, not a kind of cultural custom, instead a custom or habit

05:33.120 --> 05:34.120
of the mind.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.520
The mind does this, but why does it do it?

05:36.520 --> 05:38.520
Because it has this feeling inside.

05:38.520 --> 05:44.080
So it's all based on something internal, these internal impressions to use his language.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.100
Kant says, I think Hume is right that the source is in us.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.000
But he's wrong to say it's something outside of reason.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.880
It's just a feeling, it's just sentiment.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.960
Kant says instead, no, it is something inside us.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.600
In that respect, he's right.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.200
But it's really part of reason itself.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.520
So in that sense, he remains in the rationalist tradition.

06:04.520 --> 06:11.560
He says Descartes, Leibniz, other rationalists basically had it right, in that there are

06:11.560 --> 06:18.800
synthetic a priori bits of knowledge that supply the gaps here that take us from contingent

06:18.800 --> 06:23.240
particular experience to universal and necessary conclusions.

06:23.240 --> 06:27.160
But it's not as if they are things that are sort of automatic.

06:27.160 --> 06:32.120
And once we realize their character, we realize they're very limited in what they can do

06:32.120 --> 06:38.160
for us, they can apply to the appearances, the things we actually perceive in experience,

06:38.160 --> 06:39.960
but they have no further application.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.280
Well, how does he get there?

06:43.280 --> 06:48.680
Here's the question Kant asks, and it's a disturbing but very fundamental question.

06:48.680 --> 06:55.600
Do our concepts revolve around objects, as realists, for example, think, or do the objects

06:55.600 --> 06:58.280
revolve around our concepts?

06:58.280 --> 07:01.520
We've talked about the possible gap between mind and world.

07:01.520 --> 07:08.200
And now we can say, well, you might think the problem is that the world is what it is,

07:08.200 --> 07:11.520
and mind has the job of conforming itself to the world.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.040
Kant says, what if it's the reverse?

07:13.040 --> 07:18.000
What if the mind is what it is, and the world has to conform to it?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.560
That's his revolution.

07:19.560 --> 07:25.120
There isn't that serious a gap between mind and world, not because mind is adapted to

07:25.120 --> 07:31.040
understanding the world, but because the world is adapted to being understood by mind.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.440
Here's how he puts it.

07:32.440 --> 07:37.760
It is hitherto been assumed that our knowledge must conform to the objects, but all attempts

07:37.760 --> 07:42.080
to ascertain anything about these objects a priori by means of concepts, and thus to

07:42.080 --> 07:47.080
extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption.

07:47.080 --> 07:51.280
Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics

07:51.320 --> 07:55.720
if we assume that the objects must conform to our knowledge.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.480
Well, that is his remarkable revolution.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.000
He says, the problem isn't getting our ideas to conform to the objects in the world.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.480
Instead, it's the objects problem to conform to our mind.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.000
Now, that's a bit surprising, right?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.040
I mean, you might think, look, it's my job to investigate, to find out about the world.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.240
Kant says, relax.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.600
It's the world's job to conform itself to you.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.400
Now, at first glance, that seems bizarre.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.720
You might say, no, I don't think it's really like that.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.280
It's a little harder than that, right?

08:24.280 --> 08:28.600
Why would I have to go to school if it's the world's job to conform itself to my mind?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.200
It looks like I don't have to learn anything.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.040
I don't have to exert any effort.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.400
It's the world's job to match me.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.600
But of course, that's not quite what he means.

08:37.600 --> 08:45.440
What he means is that our minds are constituted in such a way that they can only process the

08:45.480 --> 08:51.800
information that our bodies and our minds are receiving from the world in certain ways.

08:51.800 --> 08:56.880
And they form out of that information they're receiving, a conception of objects.

08:56.880 --> 09:01.560
Those objects, as we understand them, are constructed by the mind.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.880
He was right about that.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.960
Objects are being constructed by us.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.560
But he's saying to that extent, the objects have to conform to the mind because the mind

09:10.560 --> 09:12.200
is building them.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.280
But the world is giving us this information.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.000
It's not as if that's a bizarre idea.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
No, the world is somehow transmitting information to us.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.920
But then we are processing that information.

09:22.920 --> 09:28.760
And what we do with it forces it to conform to the structures of our mind.

09:28.760 --> 09:33.480
So the objects, as we understand them, are part of the output of that process.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.440
So of course, they conform to the mind.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.120
It's not the mind's job to conform to those objects.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.320
Those objects are constructed in such a way that they do conform to the basic structures

09:42.320 --> 09:43.680
of my mind.

09:43.680 --> 09:49.120
That's how it's possible for me to know something a priori about them.

09:49.120 --> 09:53.080
Let's take a look at how Caught compares himself to Copernicus.

09:53.080 --> 09:57.600
He says, we may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects.

09:57.600 --> 10:02.800
If the intuition, and here he means intuition in the sense in which Avicenna used the term,

10:02.800 --> 10:07.760
it's something like sensation or perception, not just sort of what we mean by intuition

10:07.760 --> 10:10.560
where I can't really explain it but I have this feeling.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
It's not feeling.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.320
It's really a matter of sensation or sensibility.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.880
Anyway, if the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects, I don't see how we

10:18.880 --> 10:21.600
could know anything of them a priori.

10:21.600 --> 10:26.920
If on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition,

10:26.920 --> 10:33.640
that is to say our faculties of sensation and of understanding, I can then easily conceive

10:33.640 --> 10:37.200
the possibility of such an a priori knowledge.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.280
So if it's my job to match the world, I have no reason to think that my mind is built in

10:42.280 --> 10:46.200
such a way that I could have a priori knowledge of the way that world is.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.760
That world is independent of my mind.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
It's far into my mind.

10:48.760 --> 10:54.440
I have no reason to believe that my mind matches it and certainly no guarantee that it will.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.760
So it looks as if I can't know anything about an a priori independently of experience of

10:58.760 --> 11:05.440
it, but if the world is something that has to conform to me, or let's be more precise

11:05.800 --> 11:11.120
really, if the objects have to conform themselves to me because I'm the one constructing out

11:11.120 --> 11:19.360
of all this information I encounter, then I can know something about them a priori.

11:19.360 --> 11:23.600
So Kant says, we here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the

11:23.600 --> 11:25.240
celestial movements.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.880
When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved

11:28.880 --> 11:33.880
around the spectator, he reversed the process and tried the experiment of assuming that

11:33.880 --> 11:37.960
the spectator revolved while the stars remained at rest.

11:37.960 --> 11:46.080
So earlier people thought the heavenly bodies are revolving around us, but instead Copernicus

11:46.080 --> 11:51.880
said, what if we're revolving around this particular heavenly body, the sun?

11:51.880 --> 11:53.240
That changes the perspective.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.240
We're revolving it's stationary.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.800
It's not the case that we're stationary and everything's revolving around us.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.560
Now I mentioned that I think Kant is in a sense doing the reverse.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
Why?

12:04.600 --> 12:10.680
Because realism would say our concepts have to revolve around an external world, a world

12:10.680 --> 12:16.000
that is external, a world of objects that are independent of our minds.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.360
But Kant says, no, no, no, the world of objects revolves around us.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.560
The world of objects has to revolve around our concepts.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.320
Our concepts aren't revolving around those objects.

12:28.320 --> 12:32.560
So I think there's a sense in which this is really a Ptolemaic revolution.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.880
That is really taking us back to a picture where we're at the center of the world.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.920
We're at the center in the sense that our minds are constructing the objects in the

12:39.920 --> 12:40.920
world.

12:40.920 --> 12:45.480
And so the structure of the world is the result of the structure of my mind.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.720
Think of it this way.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.240
Earlier philosophers thought of, let's say, a window on the world, or a mirror.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.360
In fact, a common image was the mind is the mirror of the world.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.120
And so the mirror might get cloudy, it might get dusty, it might get broken.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.520
But the understanding was, look, it's essentially a mirror of the world, at least when it's

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
working well.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.920
That's the ideal.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.520
Kant's saying, what if it's more like a projector?

13:09.520 --> 13:13.080
The world is something like what's displayed on a screen.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.040
And the world is the projector, projecting it onto that screen.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.520
Now, of course, there's some input into the projector.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.400
I mean, it's receiving some information from something.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.800
It has a film strip or a digital file.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.840
It's doing something that it's processing and producing that projection.

13:28.840 --> 13:34.880
Nevertheless, you might say, if I know something about that projector, then I can know something

13:34.880 --> 13:38.640
before I even see the images projected about what they're going to be like.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.720
I might know, OK, the projector is like this.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.120
Suppose I know, for example, it just produces black and white images.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.880
Then I'll know that what I'm about to see is in black and white.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.920
It's not going to be in color.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.680
And I can know that before I even see what's on the screen, because I understand the structure

13:54.680 --> 13:56.680
of the projector.

13:56.680 --> 14:00.200
Now, if this is something like a mirror, you might say, look, I don't know what's going

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
to be on the mirror.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.080
I have to know what it's reflecting.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.280
That's the more traditional perspective.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.520
But if the mind is like a projector, then if I understand the nature of the projector,

14:09.520 --> 14:13.440
I'll understand something about the nature of what's going to be projected before I

14:13.440 --> 14:18.560
even have any experience of what is actually projected.

14:18.560 --> 14:23.280
In just the same sense, if the mind is like a projector, if it's the mind that is giving

14:23.280 --> 14:28.200
structure to the objects of the world, then it is possible for me to know something about

14:28.200 --> 14:32.760
those objects a priori, independently of experience of them, because I can understand something

14:32.760 --> 14:35.680
of the nature of the projector.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.600
So there is a sense in which Kant is really saying, look, the mind doesn't have to revolve

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
around the world.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.720
The world revolves around the mind.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.600
And by putting ourselves at the center, that's the sense in which I think he's really doing

14:47.600 --> 14:52.840
something like the reverse of the Copernican Revolution.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.280
So here is how he describes it.

14:55.280 --> 15:00.200
And you'll see here how he gets to rationalist conclusions.

15:00.200 --> 15:06.560
He says, before objects are given to me, that is, a priori, I must presuppose in myself

15:06.560 --> 15:11.920
laws of the understanding, which are expressed in concepts a priori.

15:11.920 --> 15:17.320
To these concepts, then, all the objects of experience must necessarily conform.

15:17.320 --> 15:23.040
So in order for me to be able to understand anything about objects, a priori, independently

15:23.040 --> 15:26.600
of experience, there must be certain laws of the understanding.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.120
In other words, before I know anything independently of experience about what's going to be projected

15:31.120 --> 15:37.320
on that screen, I have to know something of the laws by which that projector operates.

15:37.320 --> 15:42.200
And there better be concepts I have a priori, concepts, ways, in other words, I have of

15:42.200 --> 15:47.120
understanding things that are independent of what I'm getting off the images on the screen.

15:47.120 --> 15:52.480
So I have to have some innate ideas, I have to have some synthetic a priori knowledge,

15:52.480 --> 15:54.840
these laws of the understanding.

15:54.840 --> 15:59.520
So Kant does turn out to be a rationalist in something like the traditional sense.

15:59.520 --> 16:04.400
There are innate ideas, these pure concepts of the understanding, something that he calls

16:04.400 --> 16:08.240
the categories, and we'll talk about those separately.

16:08.240 --> 16:14.000
There also have to be synthetic a priori truths, which he calls the laws of the understanding.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.560
If there are these categories built into the mind, these a priori concepts or innate ideas,

16:20.560 --> 16:25.520
and there are also synthetic a priori truths or laws of the understanding, understanding

16:25.520 --> 16:29.760
those is going to enable me to understand the nature of this projector.

16:29.760 --> 16:35.080
And that will enable me to understand something universal and necessary about what is about

16:35.080 --> 16:40.600
to be projected in experience, even independently of and prior to experience.

16:40.880 --> 16:46.680
However, something important is, you might say, a byproduct of this way of understanding

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
things.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.280
These things apply only within the realm of experience.

16:50.280 --> 16:55.240
I can say something universal and necessary about what's going to appear on that screen.

16:55.240 --> 17:00.160
I can say, okay, it's going to be black and white, and it's going to be of a certain

17:00.160 --> 17:05.960
kind of resolution, because I know something about the nature of the projector.

17:05.960 --> 17:13.280
But now if you say, okay, fine, tell me something about the input that projector is receiving.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.280
I have to say, I don't really know.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.280
Or maybe I do.

17:17.280 --> 17:22.080
Maybe I know enough about the projector to say a little bit about it, to say, well, it

17:22.080 --> 17:25.600
only understands digital files.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.960
Or it's an old-fashioned one.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.160
It only takes a film strip.

17:28.160 --> 17:33.920
You can't take a flash drive and do anything, and it won't play a DVD and so forth.

17:33.920 --> 17:39.200
So I might know something very general about the input, but I'm not going to know much

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
about it.

17:40.200 --> 17:44.800
If you want to say, yeah, I want to know what's in these digital files.

17:44.800 --> 17:51.800
For example, if that's the input, I can tell you, here's what it's capable of doing with

17:51.800 --> 17:55.560
them, and so I can tell you it's going to be of this resolution, and it's all going to

17:55.560 --> 18:00.560
be in black and white, and it's going to be a projection on this screen of that size.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.800
But that's all I can say.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.120
I can't tell you anything about what is actually going to be in the input.

18:06.120 --> 18:13.400
And so I can only say something about things as I'm going to experience them.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.600
I can tell you something about what will be on the screen.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.880
I can't tell you anything about the world beyond what's on the screen.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.240
So I can't tell you anything about the inputs.

18:22.240 --> 18:27.760
And just so, Cart will say, I can come up with universal and necessary knowledge, independently

18:27.760 --> 18:30.960
of experience now, and that's a beautiful thing.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.600
But it applies only to the realm of experience.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.960
If you then say, well, I'm interested in things going beyond experience, like I'm interested

18:37.960 --> 18:39.320
in the nature of God.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.560
I'm interested in the nature of the will and whether the will is free.

18:42.560 --> 18:47.840
I want to know whether we have a soul and whether that soul is mortal or immoral, if

18:47.840 --> 18:48.840
it exists.

18:48.840 --> 18:55.120
Kant says, I can't tell you any of that, okay?

18:55.120 --> 18:56.880
That's not something that's covered here.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.400
I can't say a word about any of that.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.440
I can tell you something about what kinds of experiences you're capable of having.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.440
But that's all.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
I can't tell you about anything.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.840
And in fact, it will turn out I actually can't tell you anything about things as they are

19:10.840 --> 19:12.440
in themselves.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.520
I can tell you something about the appearances, something about the way they're going to look

19:16.520 --> 19:18.200
to us and experience.

19:18.200 --> 19:23.480
I can't tell you what they really are independently of that experience.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.080
Kant gives us a kind of transcendental argument.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.360
We've seen this in Descartes, but Kant is the one who makes this form of argument really

19:30.360 --> 19:31.860
famous.

19:31.860 --> 19:33.520
Here's the general structure of it.

19:33.520 --> 19:40.320
Q is a necessary condition for the possibility of P. In other words, P would not even be possible

19:40.320 --> 19:42.520
if it weren't the case that Q.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.320
But P is the case.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.000
P is not only possible, it really is actual.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Therefore, Q.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.120
Well, in the form Kant uses it, it takes on this structure.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.880
Descartes had talked about clear and distinct ideas using this form of argument.

19:59.880 --> 20:05.360
Kant says this, a priori concepts and laws of the understanding are necessary conditions

20:05.360 --> 20:08.520
for the possibility of experience.

20:08.520 --> 20:14.040
Experience would not even be possible unless we had some of these a priori concepts and

20:14.040 --> 20:15.760
laws of the understanding.

20:15.760 --> 20:20.360
To put it in terms of my metaphor, it's as if he's saying, look, nothing would be on

20:20.360 --> 20:23.080
that screen if we didn't have a projector.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.920
And that seems possible.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.200
It's like, look, in order for anything to appear on the screen of experience, something

20:29.200 --> 20:32.440
has to be projecting it if we don't have a projector.

20:32.440 --> 20:37.040
And if it doesn't work, if it doesn't have any structure and it won't do anything, nothing

20:37.040 --> 20:39.120
will appear on the screen.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.720
Experience wouldn't even be possible.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.720
But experience is possible.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.000
We're having an experience right now.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.560
So he says there have to be a priori concepts, there have to be laws of the understanding.

20:51.560 --> 20:57.800
But what results is, well, we only know in things a priori what we ourselves place in

20:57.800 --> 20:58.800
them.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.720
We know nothing about what they are in themselves.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.200
We only know what we put into them.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.840
So the laws that govern the realm of experience are in us.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.480
Those are those laws of the understanding.

21:09.480 --> 21:15.080
But that does mean that we can know things only as they're experienced by us, not as

21:15.080 --> 21:17.320
they are in themselves.

21:17.320 --> 21:21.920
So I mentioned at the outset that Kant does end up being a rationalist, but an odd kind

21:21.920 --> 21:23.140
of rationalist.

21:23.140 --> 21:28.240
He ends up being, well, kind of an idealist, but an odd kind of idealist.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.920
Something of a realist, you could argue, but an odd kind of realist.

21:31.920 --> 21:36.240
Here are the questions on which he agrees with either Descartes or Hume.

21:36.240 --> 21:42.160
Descartes here being the paradigm of a rationalist of the early modern period, and Hume being

21:42.160 --> 21:46.360
the paradigm of an empiricist of the early modern period.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.720
Is there synthetic a priori knowledge?

21:48.720 --> 21:50.720
Descartes, the rationalist, says yes.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.200
Hume, the empiricist, says no.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.200
Kant says yes.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.200
It's based on those laws of the understanding.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.920
It applies only within the realm of experience, but we do have synthetic a priori knowledge.

22:01.920 --> 22:06.240
So there he's agreeing with Descartes and Leibniz and the other rationalists.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.840
Does that knowledge extend beyond experience?

22:09.840 --> 22:10.840
Descartes says yes.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.000
I can prove the existence of God, for example.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.960
I can talk about primary qualities, matching our ideas, that is to say, of primary qualities,

22:17.960 --> 22:20.920
matching the qualities that are really in the thing.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.200
Hume says no.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.000
We don't have any knowledge beyond experience.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.480
All of our knowledge that is not purely verbal is merely a posteriori.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.240
Kant says no.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.160
He agrees with Hume about that.

22:33.160 --> 22:39.040
We can have synthetic a priori knowledge, but it does not extend beyond the realm of experience.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.640
Can we know the world as it is?

22:41.760 --> 22:45.840
Not just as it appears to us, but as it really is, independently of us.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.440
Descartes, Leibniz and the other rationalists say yes.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.440
Hume says no.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.120
In fact, I'm not even sure what you mean, Hume would say, about this world as it is beyond

22:55.120 --> 22:56.680
the realm of experience.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
What's that?

22:57.680 --> 22:58.760
You're talking about substances?

22:58.760 --> 23:03.000
You're talking about actual, ah, none of that makes any sense.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.200
Kant agrees with Hume here.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.320
He says no.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.880
You can't have any knowledge of the world as it is.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.880
And so we can't know anything beyond experience.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.960
We can't know the world as it is.

23:12.960 --> 23:19.280
We can only know something about it as it appears on the screen of experience.

23:19.280 --> 23:26.400
But of the things that we ordinarily think of as objects, that he calls objects of experience

23:26.400 --> 23:31.160
or appearances, well, we can know lots of things about those.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.240
Let me show you what Kant is really doing.

23:34.240 --> 23:41.800
Kant is transforming our way of understanding how the mind relates to objects.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.480
So let's start with Plato in the little picture we've drawn.

23:45.480 --> 23:49.560
Here is a mind and a thought of an object.

23:49.560 --> 23:54.480
Let's say a triangle since I've been talking about those all semester.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.200
What's going on there according to Plato?

23:56.200 --> 24:01.400
Well in part it's that triangle affecting the mind, causally in some way through perception.

24:01.400 --> 24:09.200
We recognize that thing as a triangle, so I'm able to think of this thing as a triangle

24:09.200 --> 24:16.840
only by virtue of having access somehow to a form, an abstract universal triangularity.

24:16.840 --> 24:22.520
And so the mind is also turned toward that form of triangularity.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.760
That's the form.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.360
And the object participates in the form.

24:28.360 --> 24:33.560
So I'm actually capable of knowing that's a triangle because my mind manages to relate

24:33.560 --> 24:36.800
itself to the form that actually is in the object.

24:36.800 --> 24:42.480
So this constitutes not only thinking that this object is a triangle, but also if it

24:42.480 --> 24:47.920
really is a triangle then getting it right and having knowledge that it's a triangle.

24:47.920 --> 24:55.360
The first thing that Kant does is to say, hmm, these forms and these innate ideas really

24:55.360 --> 24:56.360
along the way.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.760
I have something like an idea of triangularity that relates to that form.

24:59.760 --> 25:04.880
This particular thought that that thing is a triangle is mobilizing that general concept

25:04.880 --> 25:11.280
or idea and according to Plato then that would be an idea of triangularity, would relate

25:11.280 --> 25:13.800
to this directly.

25:13.800 --> 25:19.040
But Kant says, really, I don't think there's anything out here.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.280
I'm talking about pure concepts of the understanding.

25:22.280 --> 25:27.000
So actually, let's think of the mind as extending to include that form.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.120
That is to say, the forms could really be understood as identified with the concepts

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
now.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.080
I don't even have to draw that distinction.

25:34.080 --> 25:45.640
I can just say, this is now a pure concept, one of these a priori concepts.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.400
And then I can say, aha, what's going on here?

25:50.440 --> 25:53.120
The object participates in that?

25:53.120 --> 25:58.620
Actually the object is formed by my conceptual activity.

25:58.620 --> 26:04.040
So this arrow goes in one direction.

26:04.040 --> 26:11.920
This is something like a relationship, not just a participation, but a projection.

26:11.920 --> 26:16.000
So the mind is projecting this object of experience.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.480
Well, wait, that object of experience was causing me to have this thought.

26:20.480 --> 26:21.680
That's a triangle, right?

26:21.680 --> 26:26.360
Kant says, well, not exactly, not exactly.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.800
This is really a creature of the mind.

26:27.800 --> 26:33.800
Now something is, my mind is presumably getting some kind of input here through perception.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.160
So I've got a faculty of sensibility here.

26:36.160 --> 26:41.920
I'll say, this is like my eye.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.940
And something is giving me this.

26:43.940 --> 26:53.820
This is the thing in itself, the thing as it is independently of my mind.

26:53.820 --> 26:59.460
But this thing, the thing that is being projected by my mind, that's an object of experience

26:59.460 --> 27:01.100
or an appearance.

27:01.100 --> 27:08.820
So he does talk about these in several different ways, an object of experience, which is the

27:08.820 --> 27:14.520
same thing in his language as an appearance.

27:14.520 --> 27:20.140
And he then introduces a technical term for that, drawing from ancient Greek sources and

27:20.140 --> 27:27.460
says, objects like this are phenomena, phenomenon for one of them.

27:27.460 --> 27:31.900
But I'll make them all plural here, since I made that one plural.

27:31.900 --> 27:36.180
The phenomena are the appearances, they're the objects of experience.

27:36.180 --> 27:42.620
And now we can say, oh, wait, I see what's going on here.

27:42.620 --> 27:46.940
Something, it's something like, look, the projector is getting some kind of information,

27:46.940 --> 27:47.940
right?

27:47.940 --> 27:49.140
It's some kind of input.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.540
It's projecting this stuff on the screen.

27:51.540 --> 27:56.520
So this is something like the image on the screen being projected by the projector.

27:56.520 --> 28:02.060
This is whatever the projector is using to generate what it's doing and doing the projection.

28:02.060 --> 28:04.420
Well, what is that exactly?

28:04.420 --> 28:07.020
I don't have direct experience of that.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.380
Or at least let's put it this way.

28:09.380 --> 28:13.580
It does seem like I do in the sense that it's, I guess, having some effect on me.

28:13.580 --> 28:17.820
In the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, he's happy to say, yes, I'm gathering

28:17.820 --> 28:24.220
information and this thing in itself is in some way causing my mind to start this process,

28:24.220 --> 28:26.660
causing me to have this perception and so on.

28:26.660 --> 28:30.740
But as we'll see later, cause turns out to be one of these categories that applies only

28:30.740 --> 28:32.660
within the realm of experience.

28:32.660 --> 28:35.860
And by the realm of experience, he means the kinds of things that are projected on that

28:35.860 --> 28:37.480
screen.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.140
So these aren't projected.

28:39.140 --> 28:46.100
So well, or in a certain sense they are, but they don't appear there as anything like

28:46.100 --> 28:47.980
this form.

28:47.980 --> 28:50.740
So in the end, he says, I can't actually officially save it.

28:50.740 --> 28:51.980
This is causal.

28:51.980 --> 28:58.740
So really, I'm going to take this arrow and kind of make it dotted to indicate there's

28:58.740 --> 29:01.700
something happening here, right?

29:01.700 --> 29:06.180
Something is going into the projector, I guess, if I can even say going in, but what

29:06.180 --> 29:10.620
the relationship is between my mind sensibility and the thing in itself I can't really quite

29:10.620 --> 29:11.620
say.

29:11.620 --> 29:16.820
Now, once we've got something like this picture, and by the way, this is something that is

29:16.820 --> 29:22.580
already in a sense in Barkley, even in a sense in Descartes and Locke, because now the question

29:22.580 --> 29:27.140
is, this thing is what we've referred to as the cause.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.820
Here I'm going to put cause in scare quotes.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.380
We can't officially say that in constant.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.380
Not really a cause.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.880
It's not clear what it is.

29:35.880 --> 29:40.380
Over here, we've got something like what actually appears.

29:40.380 --> 29:43.100
And now the question is, what's the relationship between these two?

29:43.100 --> 29:50.300
What's the relationship between that triangle as it appears in experience and the thing

29:50.300 --> 29:57.500
in itself, whatever is affecting the mind ultimately to lead it to experience that triangle

29:57.500 --> 30:00.260
as we experience it?

30:00.260 --> 30:02.780
There are different approaches we might take.

30:02.780 --> 30:07.580
So for example, Aristotle would say, well, I'll tell you what this relationship is,

30:07.580 --> 30:09.420
it's identity.

30:09.420 --> 30:17.020
The cause of perception is represented in the perception and is represented in the way

30:17.020 --> 30:19.140
that these objects of experience are.

30:19.140 --> 30:24.580
So actually the object of experience, the appearance, that is just the thing in itself.

30:24.580 --> 30:27.060
That is the cause of perception.

30:28.060 --> 30:31.060
Well, that's one answer.

30:31.060 --> 30:35.020
Descartes and Locke say, well, that's a little too simple.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.340
Because after all, it's really the atoms.

30:37.340 --> 30:42.060
It is something described by physics that is having an effect on our bodies and that

30:42.060 --> 30:47.660
our minds project something, but it includes primary qualities as well as secondary qualities.

30:47.660 --> 30:51.460
And the primary qualities are really in the thing itself, but the secondary qualities

30:51.460 --> 30:52.460
aren't.

30:52.460 --> 30:55.260
So the shape, the motion, yeah, that's in the thing itself.

30:55.460 --> 30:59.900
However, the color, the texture, the taste, the smell, that's something being supplied

30:59.900 --> 31:00.900
by the mind.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.820
That's only part of the phenomenon.

31:02.820 --> 31:07.060
So if you're Descartes or Locke, you're going to say this isn't exactly identity, but there

31:07.060 --> 31:10.100
is a relation of similarity between them.

31:10.100 --> 31:15.020
They're going to share primary qualities, but they won't share secondary qualities.

31:15.020 --> 31:19.500
In fact, the secondary qualities won't be down here at all.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.460
What else could we say?

31:21.460 --> 31:27.420
Well, Barclay looks at this picture and says, I don't like this at all, because once we

31:27.420 --> 31:34.260
get rid of the identity, now the skeptic can come in and say, aha, there's this unbridgeable

31:34.260 --> 31:39.820
gulf between the objects of experience and the things themselves.

31:39.820 --> 31:42.580
How can we ever know anything about the world we can't?

31:42.580 --> 31:47.980
And so, indeed, this is the point of the argument from comparison in Philo and in Sextus.

31:47.980 --> 31:49.700
We can never get across that gap.

31:49.700 --> 31:56.220
We have no idea whether our objects, as constructed, whether the appearances match anything in

31:56.220 --> 31:57.220
reality.

31:57.220 --> 31:59.740
And so we'd end up in skepticism.

31:59.740 --> 32:02.420
Barclay says, well, it'd be great if we could identify these.

32:02.420 --> 32:06.260
As Aristotle does, it would be great if we could say the primary qualities at least match

32:06.260 --> 32:10.260
as Descartes and Locke do, but he says, since I can't experience these, I got no way to

32:10.260 --> 32:11.260
do that.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.060
So what does Barclay do?

32:13.060 --> 32:17.100
He says, get rid of those, OK?

32:17.100 --> 32:18.860
Get rid of the things in themselves.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.300
Then no problem.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.460
You're an idealist.

32:21.460 --> 32:25.020
And so idealism is usually construed, does exactly that.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.660
Get rid of the thing in itself.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.740
And we're going to look at the philosophy of Hegel.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.620
That is one of the main criticisms that Hegel makes of Kant.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.460
He says, you don't need the thing in itself.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.460
Get rid of it.

32:34.460 --> 32:37.220
And then we've got idealism in its traditional form.

32:37.220 --> 32:40.300
Well, what is Kant doing?

32:40.300 --> 32:41.980
He doesn't identify them.

32:41.980 --> 32:45.380
He doesn't say they're similar, and I'll tell you in what respects they're similar,

32:45.380 --> 32:47.100
as Descartes and Locke do.

32:47.100 --> 32:51.380
He doesn't get rid of the thing in itself entirely, as Barclay and Hegel do.

32:51.380 --> 32:58.180
So what does he do?

32:58.180 --> 32:59.780
He leaves it a question.

32:59.780 --> 33:04.860
Now, when it first comes out, well, that's just great, Kant.

33:04.860 --> 33:07.740
But I think that is precisely the way it gets left.

33:07.740 --> 33:14.220
In the end, he says, there are the objects of experience, the appearances, the phenomena.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.860
We can know about those.

33:15.860 --> 33:20.220
We can know things about them in a synthetic, a priori fashion.

33:20.220 --> 33:23.780
I can really know about the world, not just verbal truths about these, not just logic,

33:23.780 --> 33:25.320
not just math even.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.900
But I can know all sorts of things about these because I can know something about what's

33:28.900 --> 33:32.440
going to be projected on the screen by understanding the projector.

33:32.440 --> 33:36.500
So I can know something about these in a synthetic, a priori fashion.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.020
I can't know anything about these.

33:38.020 --> 33:42.100
I can't know anything about them synthetic, a priori, but actually, he's going to say,

33:42.100 --> 33:44.500
I can't know anything about this relation.

33:44.500 --> 33:48.620
Now he will argue, in that section I referred to, the refutation of idealism.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.380
They have to be here.

33:50.380 --> 33:51.380
Don't get rid of them.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.140
They're doing something.

33:53.140 --> 33:55.020
But I can't tell you what they're doing.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.260
And in principle, I can't tell you what they're doing.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.980
They lie beyond the realm of experience.

33:58.980 --> 34:00.380
They're not on the screen.

34:00.380 --> 34:05.780
And I can only base my knowledge on what's in my mind and what's on that screen.

34:05.780 --> 34:08.580
So I can't know what the relationship is.

34:08.580 --> 34:14.300
In fact, I can't officially even say they exist because existence is something I use

34:14.300 --> 34:17.180
for the things that are on the screen.

34:17.180 --> 34:20.340
But look, I can't get rid of them.

34:20.340 --> 34:26.820
If you say, but they don't exist, no, it won't work if we do that.

34:26.820 --> 34:29.540
And so we'll see why later.

34:29.540 --> 34:33.220
But that, as I see it, is where it leaves us.

34:33.220 --> 34:37.620
We're in a picture where something like the forms, these abstract universals,

34:37.620 --> 34:41.260
they're in the head as these a priori concepts of the understanding.

34:41.260 --> 34:43.940
We project the objects of experience.

34:43.980 --> 34:47.580
So we can know something about the objects of experience before we even

34:47.580 --> 34:49.140
encounter the inexperience.

34:49.140 --> 34:54.700
We can know this a priori because we can understand the nature of this projection.

34:54.700 --> 34:57.860
But can we know anything about the inputs to the process and

34:57.860 --> 35:02.220
how they relate to what appears on the screen of experience?

35:02.220 --> 35:05.260
No, in the end, we can't know anything about that at all.
