1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's very hard to talk about what I want to talk about today without any logic.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we're going to have to actually introduce a little bit of logical terminology.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've been using it to some extent.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And sometimes I think the best way to actually be introduced to logic as a philosopher is really just to see it appear

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and start picking it up as a word without formal introduction.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I remember telling my advisors and undergraduates that I was interested in logic.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I thought I should take a course in logic.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And he said, don't do it. A complete waste of time.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you can think or you can't.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you can already think, you don't need logic.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And if you can't think, logic isn't going to help you.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, it seems to me that actually logic can help you a lot in thinking about certain philosophical issues.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And so today we're going to have to actually encounter a little bit of logic

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because Quine introduces in this paper that we're going to be discussing today

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
his famous thought that to be is to be a value of a variable.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And at first glance, that sounds absurd, right?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And so you have to think, well, what does he mean to be a value of a variable?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is a variable anyway?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And how does it function in a logical system?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so we're going to be led very quickly from questions about metaphysics to questions about logic.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And there's no avoiding that in a sense.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I'm not going to do it in a very formal way,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in a way that I would do it if I were introducing logic as logic.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But nevertheless, we're going to have to actually confront that at certain points.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this paper itself, as I found out over the weekend, is really hard to track down.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was slated to appear in volume 9 of Her Ketnes, a journal of unified science in 1939.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Due to the outbreak of World War II, they moved the operations of the journal to Holland

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and then the Nazis invaded Holland.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And so this journal issue never appeared.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hence when I said, well, yes, I forgot to scan it in from the book and it's not in quintessence.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But hey, no problem.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sure I can find a copy online.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It turned out to be impossible to do that because, well, it never appeared.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So even though it became a famous paper in this formulation that to be is to be a value of a variable,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
it became a very famous idea.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It turns out that the paper in which it was actually articulated was not published

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
until 1966 when this collection of essays came out.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It was circulated more informally before that.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So let's start by taking a look at what Klein says here.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As you can see, this is a well-loved book.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The cover came off years ago.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't defile it with tapes of tape that can't go on.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I just keep carefully in place.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Anyway, what does it mean to ask?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
For example, whether there is such an entity as roundness?

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, we've got here thrown out a major ontological, a major metaphysical question from the medieval era,

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
at least whether we ought to recognize as components of the world things like roundness.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, we can't even go back before the medieval era to Plato and think,

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
what is the ontological status of the forms?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do the forms have some separate existence,

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
apart from the objects that might exemplify them or might participate in them?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So we can ask about roundness.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When we think about the ultimate constituents of the world,

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
what do we do with roundness?

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Is that one of the things that these Russell's phrase would have to count

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as part of the furniture of the world?

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, before we go into the question in some detail

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and what Klein would have to say about it,

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
let's think about that question all by itself.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
First glance, just intuitively, if I ask you what's in this room,

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
would you say, among the various things you might say, roundness?

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, no.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Klein agrees.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's like, yeah, I would start saying,

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
well, it's actually puzzling, there are two trash cans by the door.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I guess they must think people in this room generate a lot of garbage.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There are a certain number of desks, there are people, there are blackboards,

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
there's a computer, et cetera, et cetera, there's a clock.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But I wouldn't stop to say, oh, yeah, right.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I mean, also the rectangularity of the blackboard

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and the roundness of the clock.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And that means rectangularity, roundness.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And gosh, those lines are pretty straight, straightness,

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and curvedness, and blah, blah, blah.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I wouldn't start listing all those abstract things, right?

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, why not?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why would I stop at talking about the clock and the blackboard

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and not talk about rectangularity aroundness?

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because they're qualities that physical objects have.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ah, all right, there's a good Aristotelian answer.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They're qualities that physical objects have.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So you might think, well, wait a minute.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, we do talk about qualities and quantities and relations

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and actions and affections and states and positions

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and all the other things in Aristotle's categories.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But in the end, it all depends on substance, right?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So the things there are in Aristotle's way of thinking

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
about the world really are the substances.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then, yeah, so it's things like the clock.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And then the clock does have roundness,

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
if we want to put it in that sort of language.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But on the other hand, it's the clock that really exists here

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and the qualities, the relations and so on, all of that.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You might think if they have any sort of existence

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
at all, it's highly derivative.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So remember we drew a distinction between metaphysics

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and ontology.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And ontology, we said, was the study of what there is.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Really, we should perhaps say, well, hey, what there, gosh,

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
really is, ultimately is.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then we said metaphysics includes that,

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
but metaphysics is much broader.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why is that true?

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What does metaphysics include that ontology doesn't include?

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How you perceive what really is.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ah, how you perceive what really is.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So you might think the connection between mind and world

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is something that ought to be included here,

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
not in other words just what the world ultimately consists of,

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but also something about how our minds relate to it.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What else might be included under metaphysics?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Epistemology.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, usually epistemology is thought to be a separate topic,

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
so that there's one question of what the world is like

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and so on and then another, how we know that.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So for example, if you say, well, ah, yeah, I mean,

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
perception and the sense of how it is that we relate to the world.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That is a very broad question.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It has epistemological aspects as well as metaphysical aspects.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sometimes those get deeply intertwined.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And in fact, there are philosophers who think there isn't a sharp distinction

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
to be drawn between metaphysics and epistemology.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So if you're inclined toward idealism or any variety of anti-realism,

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you're going to think, but yeah, wait a minute, it's all tied up together.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't sort of have some radically non-epistemic way of thinking

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
about the way the world is, in which case it looks like epistemology

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and metaphysics fused into this one big unit.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But if we don't want to assume that from the start,

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
we might say, well, the question of how we know the world is one thing,

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
but then the question of what the world is like is another.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's going to include in a broad sense this connection,

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
this question of the connection between mind and world,

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but might not include specifics about, well, for example,

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
how exactly we know universal statements or something like that.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What else might be included in a metaphysical picture

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that wouldn't be a matter of just counting the ultimate furniture in the universe?

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The relations between the pieces of furniture.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, the relations between the pieces of furniture.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Exactly.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So you might say it's a question of identifying the structure of the world,

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
of the things that ontology identifies,

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and not just those things and how they relate to one another,

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but also how various things that aren't ultimate constituents

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
are structured in terms of those.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you might think there's a question of, actually,

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think we drew a fuzzy picture where, in a sense,

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
ontology was a question of identifying these ultimate constituents.

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But then those things are structured into all sorts of complexes,

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
as Russell might put it,

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and then we can talk about how those complexes relate to one another,

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and to the ultimate symbols, and so forth.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So there are all these relations, there are all these constructions.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or if you want to think of this way, complexes and symbols.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now, in a sense, I can't tell you what I'm looking for here

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
without committing to some particular metaphysical theory, right?

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Because the moment I say complexes and symbols,

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm now sort of invoking some kind of atomistic picture of the world.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And if I talk about constructions,

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm already assuming these relations have a certain kind of character and so forth.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So I'm putting things here that we've already identified

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
as going on in analytic philosophy.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But actually, if you want to think much more broadly about this,

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you should realize, I'm just talking here about examples of a kind of relation

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you might have in mind.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Presumably you're going to have a different way of thinking about those relationships

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
if you've got another metaphysical nature.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Are there other things that fit into metaphysics?

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Questions about things like God that might be outside of the world,

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
as we usually think of it?

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, okay, so yeah, we think about various objects in the world,

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but then there are some that have special stats.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, you might think, look, it's one thing to talk about, let's say, atoms,

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
physical atoms or minds or something like that.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's quite another to actually talk about God,

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which seems to be not just one more object in the world,

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
but to have some special status.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And the same thing you might think is true of personal identity,

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because after all, if you're thinking, wait a minute,

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I also want to know as part of metaphysics who am I

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and what kind of thing am I?

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And that's not just saying I'm an ultimate constituent or maybe I'm not.

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Gosh, there's an ontological worry.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What if you add up all the things in the world and I'm not among them?

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, don't worry, you might say.

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a separate metaphysical question.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Just what kind of thing am I?

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Who am I?

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What am I?

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And so, we might think that the nature of God,

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and for that matter of me, personal identity,

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
becomes a crucial thing to think about here.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I care not only about the tables and chairs of the world,

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the atoms and electrons and fields and so on,

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
but I also care about me and I care about whether or not there's a God.

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is a start to thinking about metaphysics.

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's something that includes a lot of stuff.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And as we see here, well, as we will see,

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Kline's essay starts with ontology.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He really acts as if he's just dealing with this ontological question

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
about the ultimate constituents of the world.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, even more simply, just what it is to say that something is.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But then, actually, he does destroy the distinction

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
between these ultimate constituents and other things.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And so, we're going to have to think about the structuring

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
as well as just the sort of counting.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now, so we've said, okay, for example, roundness.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is there such an entity?

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He says, note that we can use the word roundness

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
without acknowledging any such entity as roundness.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We can maintain that the word is in-categoromatic.

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So, there's a distinction that is, well, where does it go back to?

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's found in, he mentions, well, actually, he doesn't mention.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A lot of people mention William Obokam in this connection.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It goes back at least to Peter of Spain.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And I'm not sure that Peter of Spain is the one in the 13th century

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
actually introduces this term for the first time.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But there's a distinction from medieval logic

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
between categoromatic terms and sin-categoromatic terms.

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Now, Klein doesn't actually explain it.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He just assumes you know this already,

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
which is kind of an amazing thing because, like, who knows this?

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, I'm the sort of person who, just to brush up on my Latin,

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
reads Peter of Spain in Latin because it's fun, okay?

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But I assume that I'm very, very weird for doing that.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So, there aren't very many people who would just know what these terms mean often.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But the idea in medieval logic is this.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A sin-categoromatic term is one that doesn't really stand for anything.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A categoromatic term does, okay?

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So, to just put it very broadly, this stands for something,

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and often the medieval will say something definite.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They're worried about problems of vagueness and things like,

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
well, phrases like a man or whatever.

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And a sin-categoromatic term is not like that.

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It doesn't stand for anything.

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, if we think about items in language that we think of typically as

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
categoromatic as standing for something,

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
what would those include from a grammatical point of view?

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What do we take in language to be standard for something?

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A noun.

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A noun, typically, yeah, exactly.

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So, among both, for example, with proper names,

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but then there might be other kinds of nouns,

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
maybe common nouns,

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
or maybe noun phrases, determiner phrases.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The details of that are going to vary with our linguistic theory.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But now, sin-categoromatic terms, well, they don't stand for anything.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So, what are some of the things in language we would think typically don't stand for anything?

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, good.

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So, we might think, well, adjectives are like that.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If I say that thing is round, the clock is round,

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
do I think that round names some entity?

254
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Adverbs.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Good, adverbs.

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He did it quickly.

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Quickly, we don't think, stands for some object in the world.

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Or I say, surprisingly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You don't sort of think, oh, surprisingly, yeah, there's that thing again.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He keeps talking about that.

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Interesting object, surprisingly.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, there's no such thing that it's standing for.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And you might think, oh, not once you get going,

264
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
there are lots of these, right?

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I mean, what about the parts of speech?

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't stand for anything.

267
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Prepositions.

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Prepositions, yeah.

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
A preposition doesn't stand for anything.

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Queen of England.

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, I say, oh, well, actually, there are three objects there.

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The queen, England, and of.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But that seems silly somehow.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Numbers.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Numbers.

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Ah, yeah, numbers.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Now, if that's an interesting one, because it looks as if when we say

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
1 plus 1 is 2, those look like proper names and things, right?

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
On the other hand, we can talk about five birds on the wire, for example.

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And there, five just seems to be an adjective.

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And so, numbers are weird because sometimes they act as proper names

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and sometimes they act as adjectives.

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And we're going to have to say something about how that sort of thing is possible.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But yes, at least in the adjective version, it seems like it's hard to think of,

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
oh, yeah, what was on the wire?

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There were these birds, and also the number five.

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
On road trips before, I've tried, just like when I've been bored as hell,

291
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I've tried to think of things like numbers that we can't live without

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
or that we need to explain the world with, but that you can't point to physically.

293
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are other things that are like in that category?

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I could never think of anything.

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All right, that's a great question, because in the end, this jumps us ahead a little bit.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But good.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Quine is going to say, look, I don't actually care very much.

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What is required to make sense of your speech or my speech?

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because he's convinced that a lot of what we say is more or less nonsense.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And so the real question is going to be, what is required for the language of science?

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And so you might say, yeah, this is all fine to talk about things in ordinary speech,

302
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
parts of speech, and so on.

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But really, in the end, we're going to care about what science requires.

304
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And if you and I find it a little bit difficult to talk about the objects we're passing by

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
on the road trip or our own thoughts and feelings, well, who cares?

306
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
In the end, we care about science, Quine says, and what science requires.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So one way of looking at this is to say, you and I in our common speech,

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
we're using language for all sorts of purposes that aren't just describing the world.

309
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But the science, the job of science is really to focus on that question alone,

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to think what is required to describe the world.

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And so if I'm thinking about these questions of apology, what there really is,

312
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
or metaphysics about the structure of the world,

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I mean, I care more about science than I care about ordinary language.

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You might divide the philosophers we've been talking about, in fact, into three categories.

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Depending upon their view of this, what are we really doing philosophy about?

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
In a sense, all of these early analytic philosophers think that language is key,

317
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and that it's not just the language's useful tool in thinking about philosophical questions,

318
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
but in a sense, philosophical questions are questions of language.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But there are three types.

320
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And so you might say, we've got some of these people that we could call ideal language philosophers.

321
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Those are people like Fraga, Russell, Wittgenstein.

322
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What does ideal mean in this?

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Good question. What do I mean, ideal?

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, yeah, what's special about the language of the Traptatus, for example?

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Or special about Russell's way of thinking about definite descriptions?

326
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He thinks it's more revealing than ordinary speech, but how so?

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ideally, in what respect?

328
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not ambiguous.

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Good, it's not ambiguous, so that's one thing.

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's got this, you know, clarity to it.

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And so the clarity of the structure of this language is important.

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Is there something else?

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Closer to being true or accurately describing?

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, closer to accurately describing the world.

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So it's not only got this clear structure, but the underlying thought is,

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
it really reveals the underlying structure of the world.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And so it serves almost as a mirror of the world.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
In fact, sometimes these philosophers seem to think the ideal language would really just be a mirror of reality.

340
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And it leads you into funny questions.

341
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Borges has a story where he's talking about somebody who is deciding they need a really perfectly adequate map of the world.

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And they realized for it to be perfectly adequate, it would just have to be the world.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Because it would have to stand in one-to-one correspondence with all the things in the world.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And if it was really drawn to scale, it would just be the world.

345
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And so in a certain sense, that's kind of a vision of what this ideal language would be like.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Ideal in being clear as opposed to ambiguous or vague, and also in respect to reflecting the underlying structures.

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then we're going to see some philosophers who are, might call them ordinary language philosophers,

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
who think that, no, it's a cheat to sort of introduce such an ideal language.

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Partly it distorts what our ordinary speech is like.

350
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And partly too, how can we say this is a language that mirrors the structure of the world,

351
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
unless we already know what the structure of the world is?

352
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So this can't be taken as a tool for revealing the structure of the world.

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If a criterion of its being ideal is that it does reveal the structure, we must then already know the structure.

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So these people think, no, start with English or French or German or Chinese or some other natural language,

355
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and think about metaphysics and so on in terms of that.

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So who are some examples of this?

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, we've already seen one, I think, Ryle.

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
J.L. Austin is a famous example.

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
P.F. Strassen.

360
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Paul Reiss.

361
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's see, oh, and of course the later Victor Stein.

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay, but in between, you might say, there are these scientific language philosophers.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And they're the people we're studying right now, for the most part, have been.

364
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We took a detour to Ryle.

365
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And so here I have in mind the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle.

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So figures like Carnab, Tempel, Schlick, Neuerer and so on.

367
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And Klein is one of those.

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Klein, in fact, went to Vienna and hung out with Vienna Circle for a while in the 1930s and studied in particular with Carnab.

369
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And so somebody who was very much influenced by this.

370
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Interestingly, Klein actually studied, got his degree at Harvard under people who were primarily pragmatists.

371
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And so throughout his writings, as we'll see, there's this conflict going on between logical empiricism and pragmatism.

372
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
His teachers at Harvard were all pragmatists, but the guys he was hanging out with in Vienna were all logical empiricists.

373
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And so you see in his work an attempt to synthesize these.

374
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And actually one of our students visited Harvard and found wine in his office and said,

375
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
so throughout your work there are these two war intendents in psychological empiricism and pragmatism.

376
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Suppose in the end you had to put your chips on one of them.

377
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So suppose in the end it was like, I don't know.

378
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He didn't use this phrase with Klein and Klein wouldn't have liked it.

379
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But it's sort of like, you die and you're there at the gates of heaven.

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And Saint Peter says so in Klein, you're kind of mixing these two strands together.

381
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
In the end, what is it? Is it logical empiricism or is it pragmatism?

382
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What you get in depends on your answer.

383
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And interestingly, Klein said logical empiricism.

384
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So we're going to see him infusing more and more pragmatist themes into logical empiricism.

385
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
In the end, he would place himself clearly in there.

386
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay, so anyway, the language of science is what he really cares about.

387
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Now let me come back to your question, which is a key question.

388
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
In a sense, yeah, it's all fine to think about this in English.

389
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But in the end, what is the language of science looked like?

390
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What do we need for science?

391
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What does the language of science look like?

392
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It doesn't really have adverbs in it, for example, does it?

393
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I mean, we can talk about the particle moving more swiftly.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But in the end, we don't really use adverbs in the language of science.

395
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We introduce a term for that, acceleration.

396
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And so what do we use in science?

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We use symbols to represent things we can't necessarily see or perceive.

398
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But good, for one thing, this is highly symbolic.

399
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So we're going to have to understand what's going on in a symbolic language,

400
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
like the language of science, like the language of mathematics or logic,

401
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
as opposed to thinking about things primarily in English.

402
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So although Klein starts this essay thinking about English and

403
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
categoromatic and syn-categoromatic terms, in fact, that's not where the real

404
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
test lies, where the rubber beats the road.

405
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
That's in the symbolic languages of science.

406
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And so in that symbolism, I mean, just think about a few simple scientific laws,

407
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
like forces, mass times, acceleration.

408
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What's going on there?

409
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, we've got identity statements.

410
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We've got mathematical quantities.

411
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So there's a huge amount of math.

412
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We do a lot of identification of, well, of what exactly?

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What is force?

414
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
These aren't proper names, right?

415
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
What are they?

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It depends on what you're talking about.

417
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It depends on what we're talking about.

418
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

419
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And so, well, actually, let's think about mass, because maybe it's simpler.

420
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like right now, I have a certain mass, right?

421
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But that mass changes.

422
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Actually, ever since Thanksgiving, it's been changing quite a bit in the wrong

423
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
direction.

424
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You might notice that I'm wearing like that same three pairs of pants all the time.

425
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It's because they're the only ones that fit me at the moment.

426
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So, yeah.

427
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Anyway, by the end of term, I promise I will start losing mass to get better at this.

428
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But anyway, yeah, we've talked about an object having a mass at a time, right?

429
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And so really, this is something like a function.

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's the mass of Dan Bonovac at time t.

431
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And I might say, oh, yes, I've been gaining weight.

432
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
In other words, this function has been increasing over time.

433
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm hoping to get it to decrease.

434
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And so that's something you might think is, well, okay, a function.

435
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So there are all sorts of things that are going to be expressed as functions.

436
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And indeed, accelerations like that, too, I may be accelerating at a time, right?

437
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Or decelerating at a time, or maintaining a constant velocity at a time.

438
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So this, too, looks like it's an object at a time.

439
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And so presumably, force is going to be, the force applies to an object at a given time.

440
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So that's probably a function of objects at times.

441
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But then there are all sorts of other things that are actually, even this is way too simple, right?

442
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Because actually, if you think about velocity, for example, a physicist will often write

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
velocity not just as a v, but as a vector.

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And why? Because the velocity is not just a question of moving at a certain rate,

445
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
but in a certain direction.

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And so if we think, wait a minute, if that's true, then acceleration should also be understood as that.

447
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And the same with force, those have a direction.

448
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Then we're going to need vectors there as well as just positions and so forth.

449
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So what this is a function of is actually going to be fairly complicated.

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And if you start thinking, oh yes, we're going to need vectors and derivatives and integrals

451
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and functions and all of this kind of stuff, you realize there's quite a lot of mathematics we're going to need here.

452
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Now exactly how much depends on our physical theory and that's a complicated question.

453
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But at the very least, we're going to need a substantial part of mathematics.

454
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What else will we need?

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We are going to have to have some idea.

456
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well, maybe the key is to just jump straight to this.

457
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We're going to need things like variables, like an object x, like a time t, maybe a position p and so forth.

458
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We're going to need variables that stand for the basic things that our language is going to be talking about.

459
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So far we've been taking physics as an example and physics is often taken as the most basic science.

460
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But we could also start thinking, well, what about chemistry?

461
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Is it going to require additional things?

462
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Maybe we're going to need terms for elements in physics and so forth, or in chemistry and so on.

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So it turns out to be crucial to think, well, what does this language of science really require?

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Now let's get back to the essay.

465
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I feel like I keep pulling this fill of brief thing.

466
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We've only gotten through two sentences, but let's see if we can do a little better.

467
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So he says, really in the end, if we go back to this distinction between the categoromatic and the syn-categoromatic,

468
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
one way of thinking about it is that these categoromatic expressions are names of something.

469
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
These are not names of anything.

470
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So he says we can ask an important question.

471
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Is this the name of something?

472
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
To ask whether there is such an entity as roundness is thus not to ask the question of the meaningfulness of roundness.

473
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It amounts rather to asking whether the word is a name or a syn-categoromatic expression.

474
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well, he says, this is a crucial point.

475
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Ontological questions can be transformed in this superficial way into linguistic questions

476
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
regarding the boundary between names and syn-categoromatic expressions.

477
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So we can think, aha, we can take an ontological question.

478
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What is there?

479
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And we can say, well, that's really a way of saying, how do I draw that line?

480
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
These are going to be names of things.

481
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And so these are going to stand for something.

482
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And so that's something.

483
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That'll be something I recognize in my ontology.

484
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's something that is.

485
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Whereas here, these things don't stand for anything.

486
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So I don't have to worry about them from an ontological point of view.

487
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And so I can say, well, what is that really?

488
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's a way of saying, which expressions in my language are categorical?

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Which expressions in my language is going to stand for something?

490
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So notice what's happened.

491
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Ontology gets transformed into a question about language.

492
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I go from the question, what is there?

493
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's the question of what's in my language stands for something.

494
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Now, where does the boundary fall?

495
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, he says, let's turn our attention to barriers.

496
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If in this statement, pedals have roundness,

497
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
where I've been using the example of the clock.

498
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
The clock has roundness.

499
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The word roundness is regarded as a mirrored and categoromatic fragment of this context,

500
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
like have or indeed bowls or mess.

501
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If that's true, then the truth of one doesn't entitle us to infer pebbles have something.

502
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So notice the inference that he's thinking about here.

503
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Pebbles have roundness.

504
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:14,000
When I infer from that, that, therefore, there is some x such that pebbles have x.

505
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
In other words, to put this in language, from pebbles have roundness to pebbles have something.

506
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Which is really just what that logical expression means.

507
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So really, if you translate that, there is an x such that pebbles have x,

508
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
or in other words, pebbles have something.

509
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Now, how is that an argument?

510
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.

511
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The clock is round, so the clock has roundness, so the clock has something.

512
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Some of you would like it, okay?

513
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There's a plane that's sitting right over there.

514
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Love it there, love it.

515
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Pebbles have things, clocks have things, okay?

516
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Everything has things.

517
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I don't know why I'm making a plane that sounds like a tough guy from New Jersey here,

518
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
but anyway, suppose you think of it, oh yeah.

519
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah, he's from the Jersey part of Athens.

520
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So we've got that.

521
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Pebbles have something.

522
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And others of you are shaking your heads like, wait, what do you mean pebbles have something?

523
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If I said, hey, I have some pebbles, but do the pebbles have anything?

524
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You'd say, what do you mean do the pebbles have anything, right?

525
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It'd be very odd to say, of course they do, they have roundness.

526
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It feels like some weird philosophy joke.

527
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And so Klein is sort of saying, yeah, you know, if you've drunk from the plate this Kool-Aid,

528
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
you might like pebbles have something.

529
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
In fact, you might think, actually, pebbles have roundness is the way to explain the fact that pebbles are round.

530
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What is it for something to be round?

531
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's for it to have roundness.

532
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And so pebbles are round by virtue of the fact that they have roundness.

533
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This is really the revealing deep explanation.

534
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But if you're not somebody who's drunk from the plate this Kool-Aid,

535
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
you might say, there's something weird.

536
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It just sounds weird, right?

537
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It sounds different.

538
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In fact, I'd rather say pebbles are something, namely round,

539
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
than to say they have something like roundness.

540
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And so if you have that instinct, and that's Klein's instinct,

541
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
he thinks there's something strange that's gone on here.

542
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So he says, look, where have is understood in the context is have roundness,

543
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and roundness is understood sin categorically.

544
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The use of the variable x after have in pebbles have an x such that,

545
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
well, there is an x such that pebbles have x, or in other words, pebbles have something,

546
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
would be as ungrammatical as saying, you know, there is an x such that pebbles have x has roundness.

547
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And so there's something that seems odd about this to him.

548
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Well, now what?

549
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Here we get a serious argument.

550
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And this is something I think worth thinking very seriously, and thinking about hard.

551
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
He says variables are pronouns.

552
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So what is a variable like this doing in a logical notation?

553
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Or just, or something like that thing, maybe, and something?

554
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The idea is this.

555
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's really acting as a kind of pronoun.

556
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And so although Klein says here in the end to be is to be a value of a variable,

557
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:23,000
a way to put that in ordinary language terms is that to be is to be the kind of thing a pronoun can stand.

558
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Variables are like pronouns in logic.

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And so what do we use pronouns for?

560
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, they stand in for nouns.

561
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And so you might think, actually, that's a dumb way of thinking about it.

562
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Just focus on the nouns.

563
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They focus on the proper names, for example.

564
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But Klein's worried about that because he knows you can introduce proper names for things that don't exist.

565
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And so he says, yeah, look, Pegasus.

566
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't want to be committed to Pegasus's existence, even if I use the term Pegasus.

567
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And so I know it's possible to name things that are there and have proper names in my language that denote nothing.

568
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So it's not wise to focus on names, but pronouns, that's something else.

569
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So he says, really, variables are pronouns.

570
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And now we can think pronouns are really ultimately the thing that reveals what we're talking about.

571
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The kind of thing we can refer to as, oh, that, it, those, them, et cetera.

572
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Those are the things that we're actually committed to talking about.

573
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What would Russell's response be to this?

574
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, I think Klein thinks of himself here as, in part, giving you the moral of Russell's treatment of descriptions.

575
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And so overall, I think Russell would like this idea.

576
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He doesn't quite put it in this way himself.

577
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But if you start thinking, well, gosh, the present king of France is bald.

578
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Does that involve some commitment to something?

579
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah, it does involve a commitment to the king of France, to their being a present king of France.

580
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And if you wrote it out in logical terms, it would indeed be this, there was an X, such that X is king of France.

581
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That would be the thing that causes the trouble.

582
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So this works well with Russell?

583
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I think it works really well with Russell.

584
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And Klein is designing it for that.

585
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
He, in part, has Russell in mind, giving us a way of seeing what really matters here.

586
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And so don't think it's a proper name.

587
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Among the things over here, I should have written down are things like definite descriptions.

588
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And Russell would be saying, I thought the moral of my story is, don't focus on this, don't focus on this.

589
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And in the end, although he doesn't draw the consequence,

590
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Klein says, think about the moral of that story, and the end is the variable that's doing the work in Russell.

591
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's the X of there is an X.

592
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay, so we can reach this in other ways.

593
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah, and we can do it by thinking about a logical notation and how it functions.

594
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So he says, it appears suitable to describe names simply as those constant expressions,

595
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
which replace variables and are replaced by variables according to the usual laws of quantification.

596
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What are those laws of quantification?

597
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What are the laws that govern things like this, there is an X?

598
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
At this point, I think we can get rid of our categorics and categoric distinction.

599
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So let me erase this and think about the way that those items function in logic.

600
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Okay, so we need something like the existential quantifier.

601
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What does it do in logic?

602
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The existential quantifier functions like that, and it goes in front of some formula in logic.

603
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And typically, let's say, you might have a logical notation that requires this,

604
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
or it might just be the standard usage of it, that has some free variable X.

605
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I can tell you officially what a free variable is and a bound variable and so on,

606
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
but I'm not going to.

607
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay, it's easy to pick up in context.

608
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So let's ignore some of the fine points and just think about how this functions.

609
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
What characterizes it?

610
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We might think of it in terms of rules and think about what logical rules are involved in understanding this quantifier.

611
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We also might think in terms of what it means, how we understand its meaning in a logical theory.

612
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Let's first of all think about rules.

613
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
What rules typically go along with the existential quantifier?

614
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, in thinking about logical rules, there are two kinds.

615
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We can think about what it takes to introduce such a thing into the language,

616
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
or I should say what it takes to infer that from some premise,

617
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and then what it takes to actually infer something from it.

618
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So these are usually referred to as introduction and elimination rules.

619
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So let's think about existential quantifier introduction, existential quantifier elimination.

620
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What does it take to introduce something like there is an X such that A of X?

621
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
In other words, something like there is an X such that Pebbles have X.

622
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:38,000
We've actually got a perfect example of it right here.

623
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
A of X.

624
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, we have the A of well now.

625
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We could follow the rule, and many people do, so it's just A of X.

626
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Or we could say, well, really, it's like having a name.

627
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Pebbles have roundness, or I have something in my hand, this piece of chalk.

628
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So you might say, I have a piece of chalk in my hand, so I have something in my hand.

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I have this in my hand. I have something in my hand.

630
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So in short, there's some constant here.

631
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I will write A instead of X here, because usually we would set things up

632
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
so that this is really a name of something, a constant term rather than a variable.

633
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So think of A as something like the constant.

634
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The X is the variable.

635
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So if I've got something true of this, it's true of something.

636
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I am standing in front of the classroom.

637
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Therefore, something is standing in front of the classroom.

638
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Now, existential elimination, that's a lot harder.

639
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And actually, many people have different rules for this.

640
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Quine as his own favorite, which is, in my opinion, by far the best.

641
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So I'll just go with Quine's way of thinking about it.

642
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Suppose we have, there is an X, that's A of X.

643
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What could we infer from that?

644
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You might say, I have something in my hand.

645
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Why is it?

646
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm sure you like your kind of partners.

647
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I have something in my hand.

648
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What can you infer from that?

649
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's not nothing.

650
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Well, it's not nothing, that's true.

651
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That's true.

652
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
If I say, I've got something in my hand, they believe nothing.

653
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, he's a Heideggerian.

654
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That's okay.

655
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah, I see it.

656
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Well, I have four of you.

657
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I have four of you, that's fine.

658
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I've got to roll.

659
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay.

660
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah, Quine's way of thinking about it is to say,

661
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
look, you've got something in your, I've got something in my hand.

662
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And let's say we want to talk about it.

663
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And so I might do that by using a pronoun, right?

664
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
By just using the variable.

665
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So what do you think?

666
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is it white?

667
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Is it round?

668
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Does it have roundness?

669
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I can ask you all these questions about it.

670
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
But suppose I don't want to use a pronoun.

671
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I don't like the idea of just using this variable.

672
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I want to introduce a name for it.

673
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Okay.

674
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
As I might in mathematics, I might say, for example,

675
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
improving the mean value theorem.

676
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
There's some point in that interval at which blah, blah, blah,

677
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
the point is something has a property.

678
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And typically what I do then is what?

679
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I introduce some name for that point.

680
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I say, so there is some number N such that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

681
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Or suppose I've discovered that someone in the organization is leaking secrets.

682
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We don't know who yet.

683
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I could just keep talking about the person who is leaking secrets

684
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
to something else, but that's kind of difficult.

685
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I could just use pronoun saying he or she if we don't know who it is.

686
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But what else could I do?

687
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Give them a new name that's not used before.

688
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Exactly.

689
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Give them a new name.

690
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So I could say, yeah, let's call the leaker.

691
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Gosh, what?

692
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Deep throat has been taken.

693
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So we'll call it deep shoe.

694
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Something like that.

695
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And then we can talk about deep shoe and give and effect this person a name.

696
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So we can do the same thing here.

697
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
There is some object that has this property A.

698
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Well, let's call that object something.

699
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And so we introduce a constant.

700
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Now notice this is a constant, but actually it's very important that it be a new constant.

701
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
If I say, ah, yes, the person who's been leaking these secrets.

702
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Let's call him Bob as I look straight.

703
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Bob.

704
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That's not good.

705
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I've got to introduce some name that doesn't expose anything.

706
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
My daughter, by the way, has a tendency to do this.

707
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
She won't know people's names, but she gets tired of talking to or talking about the person

708
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
fitting a certain description and so on.

709
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So she just introduces a name to that person.

710
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And this isn't always wise because then you get to know the person and you're constantly

711
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
tempted to call them by that name.

712
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Over the weekend, she, yes, there's this organist who's recently been hired.

713
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And anyway, she was talking to, as it happened, the organist's wife saying, oh, yeah, the

714
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
new organ, Billy.

715
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And wait, I married him.

716
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
His name was Billy.

717
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
David.

718
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I don't know.

719
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Or she did that with various cats in my neighborhood.

720
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So there's one cat I thought had, you know, was named Figaro or something.

721
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And then I walked down with the circle and actually meet the owner of the cat.

722
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I say, oh, Figaro is such a nice cat.

723
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That cat's name is Tom or whatever.

724
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I was like, oh, that's what I thought about my daughter just introducing all these names.

725
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And I had thought for all these years, Jackson knew the names of these people and objects

726
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
instead of just making them up.

727
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Anyway, this is what she did.

728
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
She was just making up new constants.

729
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And so practicing good, quiet, and louder.

730
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Now, it's very important that you not stop it, right?

731
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That the conclusion you're ultimately aiming at and doing a proof using this rule does

732
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
not include this name.

733
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Otherwise, you know, you can get to conclusions like the new organist's name is Billy and

734
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
you end up in a silly place.

735
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yes.

736
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I know I don't have much time left, but I really am struggling to see how this helps

737
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
us talk about what there really is.

738
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Good.

739
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Good, good, good.

740
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
This is all just the way of introducing it and what we mean by the rules, but now we

741
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
can talk about the semantics.

742
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So we can say, how do we interpret these darn things anyway?

743
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Now, one is making two points here.

744
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,000
One is that it's not that we start with the idea of a name here and then really use this,

745
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
although it looks that way in the lot.

746
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
He wants to say, I understand by a constant the kind of thing that will let me infer this

747
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
or that I can infer from something like this.

748
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So a constant is the kind of thing that, in other words, I've got the something.

749
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm convinced that it's something and then I'm allowed to use a name for the thing in

750
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
the logic.

751
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So I'm not allowed to actually use names that don't denote anything in this logical

752
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
language.

753
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And the semantics of this is important to understand.

754
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
A model is going to consist of a domain of objects.

755
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And what's the idea?

756
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
These constants stand for particular objects in the domain.

757
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So here is, you might say, intuitively speaking, that object A, the thing that the constant

758
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
A stands for.

759
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The variables will range over the things in this domain.

760
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
They can stand for various things in that domain.

761
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And then the objects in this domain will have some properties and they will stand in

762
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
the relations.

763
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And we will understand the property in terms of the sets of objects having the property

764
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and the relations in terms of n tuples of objects standing in the relation.

765
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But in the end, it's really the objects in this domain that all of this is about.

766
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And so a logic characterized in these ways where we've got quantifiers like this where

767
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:22,000
they range over now objects, individuals in the domain.

768
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This is all known as first order logic.

769
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And what Klein is basically saying is that first order logic is the canonical language

770
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
of science.

771
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
In the end, what we need here are the symbolic things, mathematics, functions, variables,

772
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and so on.

773
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And in short, we need first order logic.

774
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What is that logic like?

775
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's a logic that allows us to talk about, to quantify over a set of objects, to understand

776
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
them as having properties and relations.

777
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And so as giving us a sort of Aristotelian picture of the universe.

778
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Now, what is it going to be to be, well, it's just to be one of those things in the domain,

779
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
to be among the things the variables range over.

780
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Hence, to be, well, to be one of those things, to be a value of a variable, which is another

781
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
way of saying to be in that domain.

782
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Now, from one point of view, you could say, I've learned nothing.

783
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What is it to be?

784
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's to be among the things that we're talking about.

785
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And it's like, gosh, you could have said that without all this logic.

786
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But next time, as we'll see, he thinks he's gotten something.

787
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Because by the end, he says, well, there are things we talk about, but then we have some

788
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
way of transforming that into something else.

789
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And in short, it becomes clear that the underlying picture really is this.

790
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And that what we're doing is identifying the spots we have to worry about, and then he

791
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
gives us a method of trying to structure that domain.

792
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
More on that next time.
