0	7800	Today, our topic is transcendental arguments.
7800	9860	It's a very special kind of argument.
9860	14800	It's one first found in the work of Immanuel Kant, who writes the critique of pure reason
14800	19920	and includes within it a big section called the transcendental deduction.
19920	24280	In the first edition it takes one form, it takes a second form in the second edition,
24280	28840	he almost completely rewrites the argument there, and it is the critical argument of
28840	29840	the work.
29960	33160	Also the one that people most associate with Kant.
33160	37400	But if we analyze the form of the argument, I think we'll see that it has a very general
37400	42720	structure and you can find it in all sorts of places in the history of philosophy.
42720	47800	It's a very powerful kind of argument and not only subsequently the Kant have philosophers
47800	52840	thought a lot about it, people like Hegel and Heidegger for example, but also if you
52840	59760	go back in time, I think you can find similar arguments in Plato, in Augustine, in Anselm,
59760	66520	in a variety of other thinkers, who are all contemplating this general kind of structure.
66520	68480	Now what is a transcendental argument?
68480	73360	Well let's start with a much simpler form of argument to which it bears a close relation.
73360	76000	That is to say modus ponens.
76000	81480	Modus ponens is often taken to be the fundamental form of inference, in fact in some logical
81480	87240	systems it is the only rule of inference, and it says this, if p then q, p therefore
87240	88240	q.
88240	91480	So let's write that out in a more precise and more abstract form.
91480	95120	Here's the general structure of an argument for modus ponens.
95120	106440	We have some sentence, let's just say a, and then we have a claim, if a, then b, we
106440	111360	include therefore b, okay?
111360	116720	So if it's sunny out, the streets aren't wet, it is sunny out.
116720	118800	So the streets aren't wet.
118800	124200	Or if Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal.
124200	127280	Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal.
127280	131800	That's a very simple form of argument, familiar to most of us, anybody who's studied introductory
131800	137520	logic knows all about modus ponens, or it's sometimes called a rule of conditional exploitation
137520	143520	or conditional elimination, and so it's a very familiar kind of logical structure.
143520	146360	Now then, what's a transcendental argument?
146360	152600	It makes a few small changes in the form of modus ponens, but it does it in a way that
152600	156000	makes that argument immensely powerful.
156000	161000	So at first it's going to seem like magic, but I'll argue it isn't magic.
161000	163440	So first of all, what's the change?
163440	170440	Well, we take that premise, a, and we simply weaken it, actually, to possibly a.
170440	173060	It's possible to a, in other words.
173060	177140	And so you might think, well, gee, okay, I don't see how that's going to help me.
177140	179660	I now have a weaker premise.
179660	184380	Well it's going to be a huge advantage if I can get the same or even stronger conclusion
184380	186020	out of a weaker premise.
186020	188540	That makes it a much more powerful argument.
188540	191580	So let's take that, possibly a.
191580	196780	Now I simply say, well, if possibly a, then b.
196780	200940	But I want this not only to be true, but necessarily true.
200940	205420	So I'm going to say, necessarily, if possibly a, then b.
205420	209180	You might think, okay, okay, I see.
209180	212420	It's just modus ponens with, instead of a, possibly a.
212420	215740	So if possibly a, if possibly a, then b, therefore b.
215740	217380	Huh, that's no big deal.
217380	219620	Indeed, that would be no big deal.
219620	221060	But look what I'm going to write.
221060	222700	I'm not going to write down b.
222700	225860	I'm going to write down necessarily b.
225860	227780	So what have I done?
227780	234620	First of all, I've replaced a over here in the premises with possibly a.
234620	238260	So first big change is that I've weakened what I need for those premises.
238260	240500	At least I've weakened this premise.
240500	242340	I don't need that a is even true anymore.
242340	244940	I just need that it's possible.
244940	250460	Second major change is that I've changed the antecedent of this conditional correspondingly.
250460	254500	Well, okay, that does make this a stronger conditional.
254500	258380	Now it's not just saying that if a is true, b follows, it's saying if a is even possible
258380	259380	to be followed.
259380	262100	So that's making a stronger, much more powerful claim.
262100	264380	So if I've weakened this, I've strengthened this.
264380	269060	But I've also strengthened it in another way, I've said necessarily.
269060	272180	I've said that connection is necessarily true.
272180	276220	Now a lot of the connections we talk about in ordinary life are not like that.
276220	277540	They're contingent connections.
277540	280380	They don't have to be necessarily true.
280380	284460	And so if that's the case, you could say, well, this isn't going to work because the
284460	287100	connection I have in mind is not necessary.
287100	291740	This is a form of argument that won't work in those contingent contexts, but it will work
291740	295740	when we're dealing with logic, when we're dealing with metaphysics, when we're dealing
295740	299500	with things where there really are necessary connections.
299500	303940	It may even work in natural science when we're thinking about scientific laws because there
303940	308540	we have in mind law like necessary connections between things.
308540	313260	And so it's quite plausible in those cases to say, look, it doesn't just so happen.
313260	316780	For example, that if I release this, it will fall.
316780	317780	There's a necessity to that.
317780	320500	If I release this, it has to fall.
320500	325420	And so whenever we've got that kind of necessity to our connection, this is a form of argument
325420	327580	that we could apply.
327580	330300	Now the conclusion is really the big change, though.
330300	336060	I don't just get, it is a fact that be, I get be is necessary, it is a necessary truth
336100	339500	that be, and that's a much more powerful conclusion.
339500	341820	Now why does this even follow?
341820	345820	It's something that doesn't follow in every system of modal logic.
345820	350980	There are systems for possibility and necessity that would say this form of argument does
350980	352220	not work.
352220	357140	But it works in the most popular and the oldest form of modal logic, the logic of possibility
357140	358260	and necessity.
358260	363780	It's called S5 after the work of C.I. Lewis, who developed five systems of modal logic
363780	365860	and S5 was the most powerful one.
365860	372020	This is the system that is taken for granted by figures including Ansem, Aquinas, Leibniz,
372020	374340	Kant, and so on.
374340	379500	And here's what it says, necessity is truth in all possible worlds.
379500	382380	Possibility is truth in some possible worlds.
382380	387500	So we could think of it this way, imagine a class of possible worlds.
387500	391940	These are possible circumstances, possible situations, if you will, cases to which we
391940	399460	might apply these various claims about metaphysics, about law-like connections in science, about
399460	401420	logic, and so forth.
401420	404940	And so we're thinking of these as our possibilities.
404940	411300	Now I'm going to put us here, let's let this world, W0, be the actual world.
411300	412660	We're actually here.
412660	414820	In this world, what do we know?
414820	418780	Well, possibly A is true in our world here.
418780	423020	And so I'm going to write that as logicians would, not with the word possibly, but with
423020	425340	a diamond to represent possibility.
425340	431780	Okay, so A is not necessarily true here, but possibly A is.
431780	433340	What can we infer from that?
433340	439420	Well, necessarily, if possibly A then B. So since this is a necessary truth, this connection
439420	442100	holds in every possible world, it holds here.
442100	444900	So if possibly A is true here, B is true here.
444900	446700	Okay, so far so good.
446700	448180	That would give us this conclusion.
448180	450980	That's really just an application of modus ponens.
450980	453600	We didn't need the necessarily at all.
453600	455740	But now, what else can we infer?
455740	457940	How do we get this necessarily?
457940	460060	Well possibly A is true here.
460060	465060	And I said that possibly A means that A is true in some possible worlds.
465060	471460	So let's take one of those worlds, we'll call it W1, and assume that A is true in that world.
471460	479180	So we go to that world W1, this other situation where A is true.
479180	482340	Right now I'm wearing a yellow striped shirt.
482340	484460	I could be wearing a blue shirt.
484460	487300	So here it's possible for me to wear a blue shirt.
487300	490340	In this world I'm actually wearing the blue shirt.
490340	492540	Well good, what's true here?
492540	497340	Well if A is true there, of course possibly A is also true at that world.
497340	504460	But in addition, since it's a necessary truth that if possibly A then B, B is true at that world.
504460	506820	Okay, so far so good.
506820	512220	But we want to know whether B is true in every single world, not just in some possible world.
512220	518140	So far all we get out of that is something we could have gotten anyway, which is possibly B.
518140	519700	So big deal.
519700	523500	That gives me B's truth in some possible worlds, but not in all of them.
523500	527780	To establish that, I need to show that B is true in just some arbitrarily selected world.
527780	530140	Any world at all that we pick out of this set.
530140	532820	So I'm going to pick some arbitrary world over here.
532820	534700	Let's call it W2.
534700	538260	And I need to convince you that B is true there.
538260	539820	Why would that be true?
539820	541580	Well look at it this way.
541580	544180	A is true here, right?
544180	545900	And it's one of these possibilities.
545900	549340	That means from the point of view of this world, well A is possible.
549340	552060	Here's a situation where it would hold.
552060	557940	So we can say, look, A isn't necessarily true down in this world, but possibly A is.
557940	560580	Because A is true up there.
560580	562780	Now I've said, hey, wait a minute.
562780	566340	It's a necessary truth that if possibly A then B.
566340	570180	So B has to hold good in this world.
570180	572540	Ooh, B true here, B true here.
572540	575620	B true in this arbitrarily selected world.
575620	577860	Now I didn't pull any tricks there.
577860	580700	After all, you might say, well, that works for this world.
580700	581900	Will it work for any other world?
581900	585300	Yeah, let's take W3.
585300	589580	Possibly A is going to be true here because of that world.
589580	593260	And so big surprise, B has to be true with that world.
593260	597700	Pick any world in here that you like, B has to be true.
597700	601140	That means B is necessarily true.
601140	606100	Something that logicians would write with a box to indicate necessarily.
606100	610340	B is a necessary truth, but that's exactly the conclusion we wanted.
610380	612780	Moreover, take a look at all these other worlds.
612780	617140	Because no matter where we pick in here, B is going to have to be true.
617140	620860	All of these worlds will be B worlds, which means that in every single one of
620860	626140	these worlds, we don't just get B, we get necessarily B.
626140	631780	Now in general, that form of argument is one that assumes that all of
631780	633900	these worlds are in it together.
633900	639260	And what I mean is to say that all of them define a sphere of possibility.
639300	641940	That is the sphere of possibility for all of them.
643060	646620	Now, for certain kinds of necessity, that seems pretty reasonable.
646620	649220	Metaphysical necessity, logical necessity.
649220	652780	It seems like, yes, we can talk about the logically possible worlds.
652780	655180	Or the metaphysically possible worlds.
655180	658380	That's not something, for example, that changes over time.
658380	661660	But on the other hand, there are lots of senses of possibility,
661660	664940	where things do change over time and we can't go back.
664940	668660	So for example, what can I do with the rest of my life?
668660	672700	Well, there are lots of things I can do, but I can't change the past.
672700	675460	And so what I've done in the past, I can't change.
675460	678900	I can change the future, but I can't change the past.
678900	682220	And that tells you that as we go along through time,
682220	686500	the sphere of our options, the sphere of our possibilities tends to shrink.
686500	689020	Of course, I might develop a new skill and
689020	691460	all of a sudden new things become possible for me.
691460	694700	So the range of possibilities changes over time.
694700	697500	That is to say the real possibilities for a human life.
697500	701020	What Heidegger would call my horizon is something that can shrink,
701020	705340	but maybe can also expand depending on how I think about abilities,
705340	706660	capacities, and so on.
707860	713660	However, here in the realm of all, you might say, logically possible situations,
713660	715700	or all physically possible situations.
715700	718940	Maybe if I'm abstracting from where I am now in time and
718940	722780	just thinking about all possible physical configurations of the universe.
722780	726700	Or I'm thinking about all metaphysical possibilities.
726700	729140	And then this principle seems quite reasonable.
729140	732060	There is just one set of all the possibilities, and
732060	734860	they all are relevant to all the others.
734860	738140	And when I've got that kind of situation, this form of argument works.
739580	742660	So far I've been talking about the logic of this situation.
742660	745060	The logic of transcendental arguments.
745060	749100	But you might say, well, big deal, okay, I see the logical point.
749100	753500	You weaken an important premise, you get a much stronger conclusion, and
753500	757060	you do it by making those two changes in the other premise.
757060	758100	Good for you.
758100	761660	That's very interesting, but what can you do with this?
761660	765380	Well, I've said it was Immanuel Kant who really first gave these their name of
765380	769020	transcendental arguments and brought people's attention to them.
769020	770900	And here's what he does with it.
770900	773980	This is a passage from the critique of Pure Reason.
773980	779780	All necessity, without exception, is grounded in a transcendental condition.
779780	784380	There must therefore be a transcendental ground of the unity of consciousness in
784380	787420	the synthesis of the manifold of all our intuitions.
787420	792020	This must consequently also be a transcendental ground of the concept of objects in general.
792020	796780	And so of all objects of experience, a ground without which it would be impossible to think
796780	798900	any object for our intuitions.
798900	804180	For this object is no more than that something, the concept of which expresses such a necessity
804180	805700	of synthesis.
805700	810500	At one other point, he says it even more directly and clearly, this original and transcendental
810500	815100	condition is no other than transcendental aperception.
815100	816940	But what is Kant doing here?
816940	823340	He's saying, in order for me to have, not just if I have experience, then I have, for
823340	828740	example, a unity of consciousness, a transcendental aperception, or something of that kind.
828740	829980	So I do.
829980	835380	He is saying, experience of the world is possible, experience of objects is possible, experience
835380	838060	of myself is possible.
838060	839660	What makes those possible?
839660	843220	What are the necessary conditions for the possibility of something?
843220	849720	A transcendental argument is an argument about the necessary conditions for the possibility
849720	851220	of something.
851220	853780	So let's take a look at this premise.
853780	860820	If possibly a, then b, I'm asking about the necessary conditions of the possibility of
860820	865300	something, the things that are necessary conditions for something, not just to be true, but even
865300	867180	to be possible.
867180	869900	That's what a transcendental argument is all about.
869900	873500	And so Kant is saying, how could I have experience of the world?
873500	876780	How could I have experience of objects in the world?
876780	881980	You convinced him that actually my experience is highly varied.
881980	886780	It's a manifold of intuition, as he puts it, that is to say, my senses give me just this
886780	889580	huge flux of information.
889580	893140	It's not just experience as if it's one thing, actually.
893140	895540	It's a matter of thoughts and feelings and perceptions.
895540	902180	And the perceptions are combinations of, well, visual elements, auditory elements.
902180	903180	I can smell.
903180	904180	I can taste.
904180	905180	I can touch.
905180	906480	I may have a sense of motion.
906480	913180	There are all these things that go into my senses, and somehow they all get put together
913180	916180	into a unified perception.
916180	921300	And then I combine those perceptions into an object.
921300	928360	And then I categorize that object as, for example, a hand or a marker or a whiteboard
928360	929860	or a camera.
929860	937660	And what I'm doing when I do that is a multi-stage process of combining sensations into sensations
937660	943900	of an object, and then thinking in terms of the category of that object, that object
943900	946260	I recognize as a something.
946260	951100	It's this such, as Aristotle would have put it, a substance, this hand.
951100	955660	And so what's happening here is I've got some perceptions, then across time I have
955660	960660	other perceptions of the hand, and I end up saying that's a hand, and I group all those
960660	963420	together as one object.
963420	964860	How do I do that?
964860	967740	There must be something that enables me to do it.
967740	971580	There must be a unity in consciousness where I put all this stuff together and it gets
971580	973380	unified somewhere.
973380	977900	His objection to Hume is that Hume just has a bundle here, but there's nothing that can
977900	979160	do the bundling.
979160	980900	There is nothing that can put them all together.
980900	986020	There's no place where all of those perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and so forth can be combined
986020	988620	into one thing.
988620	994220	For that combination to be possible, he says, it is a necessary truth that I have to have
994220	997980	a unity of consciousness, the transcendental unity of our perception.
997980	1004540	Moreover, I must have innate concepts, things that he considers the categories, the logical
1004540	1009940	functions of judgment give us the clue to the categories, their necessary conditions
1010060	1016000	for the possibility of that last stage of my grouping these perceptions under the heading
1016000	1021740	of some concept or other, and then sometimes connecting those concepts, connecting those
1021740	1025860	things, seeing the links between objects, the relations between them.
1025860	1032740	Well, that general form of argument is something that then has this structure in mind.
1032740	1034460	Experience of objects is possible.
1034460	1036260	I'm doing it right now.
1036260	1042300	Necessarily, if it's possible, then there must be a unity in consciousness.
1042300	1047100	So necessarily there is a unity in consciousness, the thing that he calls the transcendental
1047100	1049220	unity of our perception.
1049220	1052340	This form of argument had been found earlier in Descartes.
1052340	1059460	In fact, it's how Descartes tries to break out of just having the I think I am as things
1059460	1061820	of which he can be certain.
1061820	1067700	Many readers have said, wait, he goes from I think I am, I can be sure of that, to suddenly
1067700	1071020	I can trust my clear and distinct ideas.
1071020	1075940	And they say, well, wait, that you can trust one or two clear and distinct ideas that I
1075940	1078260	don't see why you get to trust all of them.
1078260	1080300	That seems like a bad inference.
1080300	1083060	And so they've accused him of committing a fallacy.
1083060	1085180	But from this point of view, it's not fallacy.
1085180	1091580	What he's saying is, I have complete faith that I am, I have complete faith that I think
1091580	1094860	if I doubt either one of those, well, doubting is thinking.
1094860	1099260	First of all, it's actually I'm doubting, so there must be a me to do the doubting.
1099260	1104580	Consequently, he ends up saying, look, it is possible for me to be certain of something.
1104580	1107700	But what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of certainty?
1107700	1112540	Well, I have a clear and distinct perception that the I think could not be false.
1112540	1117060	I have a clear and distinct perception that I am could not be false as long as I'm here
1117060	1119260	to think it or say it.
1119260	1125820	So now I look at I say, aha, so it is possible for me to be certain of some things.
1125820	1129480	But necessarily if I'm certain of something, then I've got to be able to trust my clear
1129480	1130980	and distinct perceptions.
1130980	1145700	So necessarily I can trust my clear and distinct perceptions.
1145700	1149780	We find a similar form of argument in a lot of other thinkers.
1149780	1154260	In later thinkers, for example, in Heidegger, he begins to ask, well, Caught, you did a
1154260	1155460	great job.
1155460	1159980	You've said it is a necessary condition for the possibility of experience of objects that
1159980	1164620	I have a unity of consciousness, your transcendental unity of that perception.
1164620	1168860	But now what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of that?
1168860	1173780	And in fact, what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of existence, of being,
1173780	1180020	not just of the I think I am, but of anything being at all.
1180020	1184100	And those are questions that lead Heidegger into very deep metaphysics.
1184100	1189700	And by the end of his thinking, really, into saying, whatever the answer is, it's inexpressible.
1189700	1191140	Language cannot take me there.
1191140	1193380	Conceptual thinking cannot take me there.
1193380	1195340	But we can back up in time.
1195340	1201020	I think a similar form of argument takes place even in Plato, where Plato is thinking, look,
1201020	1206900	it is possible for me to categorize things, for me to recognize something as a triangle,
1206900	1207900	for example.
1207900	1211820	But what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of the recognition of something
1211820	1213300	as a triangle?
1213300	1220140	Well, if it's possible for me to see that thing as a triangle, I must be able to apprehend
1220140	1222180	the concept of triangularity.
1222180	1227220	I must have the concept of triangularity, and I can have it only by apprehending triangularity.
1227220	1231780	So necessarily, I apprehend the form of triangularity.
1231780	1235500	We see this in Anselm in the ontological argument.
1235500	1240100	And here I think there's a brilliant twist, because Anselm notices, actually, what if
1240100	1242900	A and B are the same thing?
1242900	1245300	So what would we get then?
1245300	1251940	We would get, well, possibly, and here I'll just use G for God exists.
1251940	1256340	And to simplify the writing, I'll just put the diamond and the box for possibly and
1256340	1257620	necessarily.
1257620	1262340	He says, look, it is possible that God exists.
1262340	1265460	God is that the greater than which cannot be conceived?
1265460	1267900	And I have the idea of that.
1267900	1269500	It's certainly conceivable.
1269500	1272780	I think that what is conceivable is possible.
1272780	1277060	Now, potentially, big jump, big place you could object right there.
1277060	1281460	Maybe we should read this as it's conceivable that G to be faithful to what he says, but
1281460	1284140	for the moment, just go with me, okay?
1284140	1285900	Possibly God exists.
1285900	1292340	But wait a minute, if it's possible that God exists, then God exists.
1292340	1295180	And I'm going to say that whole thing is necessary.
1295180	1298620	Conclusion, necessarily God exists.
1298620	1299620	Notice what I've done.
1299620	1304540	I've just replaced A and B with G. God exists here.
1304540	1309500	And I get, if it's even possible for God to exist, then God does exist.
1309500	1313700	In other words, God's existence can't be contingent.
1313700	1318140	It would be equivalent to say, if God exists, then God exists necessarily.
1318140	1321180	Maybe we can turn this around and you would find it more plausible.
1321180	1324540	If I simply say, well, yeah, that seems kind of like cheating.
1324540	1325980	But let's do it this way.
1325980	1330220	If God exists, then necessarily God exists.
1330220	1333660	Conclusion, necessarily God exists.
1333660	1337660	That more clearly says God's existence can't just be contingent.
1337660	1342020	If God exists at all, God is necessarily existent.
1342020	1346300	So I think Anson's ontological argument has the same logical structure.
1346300	1349460	It too is a transcendental argument.
1349460	1356260	It's saying God's existence is a necessary condition for the possibility of God's existence,
1356260	1358860	for in effect God's conceivability.
1358860	1363420	And then once we see that, we can recognize the argument that Descartes uses in the Third
1363420	1366260	Meditation has the same basic structure.
1366260	1370180	It looks like a causal argument and it goes into complexities about formal and objective
1370180	1375060	reality, and so almost no other philosopher has said that argument is worth really trying
1375060	1378260	to resuscitate or take seriously.
1378260	1381180	But from this point of view, it's not so strange.
1381180	1384740	What we're really saying there is, well, something closely related to Anson, but not
1384740	1389980	quite the same, he's saying here, it's possible for me to have a concept of God.
1389980	1391980	I do have the idea of God, he says.
1391980	1394800	I have an idea of a perfect being.
1394800	1400020	But necessarily, if it's even possible for me to have such a concept, then God must
1400060	1401060	exist.
1401060	1404580	And here's the causal part of the argument, where else could I have gotten the concept?
1404580	1409620	So he argues, since I can't explain any acquisition of that concept from experience, it must be
1409620	1414100	a priori, but how could it be a priori unless God put it there?
1414100	1416060	In any case, I'll leave that part out.
1416060	1421540	But I think that's part of how he supports this claim, that God's existence is a necessary
1421540	1426140	condition for the possibility of me even thinking of God.
1426140	1430580	So it's possible for me to think of God, but a necessary condition for the possibility
1430580	1435380	of thinking about God is the existence of God, so necessarily God exists.
1435380	1439940	That in a nutshell is the third meditation argument for God's existence.
1439940	1446220	Well all of these arguments, from Plato, from Anselm, from Descartes, from Kant, from Heidegger,
1446220	1448300	have this same basic structure.
1448300	1452660	It's a very powerful sort of structure, and it's a structure that I think you need to
1452660	1458220	take seriously and think hard about, because you're going to find this popping up in philosopher
1458220	1459780	after philosopher.
1459780	1464540	Not only philosophers of historical significance, but on the contemporary scene as well.
1464540	1469900	So the critical question behind any transcendental argument is simply this, what are the necessary
1469900	1473780	conditions for the possibility of something?
1473780	1479980	And if that thing is even possible, then those necessary conditions aren't just conditions
1479980	1482260	that hold, they hold necessarily.
