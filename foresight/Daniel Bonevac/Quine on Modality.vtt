00:00.000 --> 00:07.740
Today we return to the wonderful desert landscape of Kwa. And we're gonna be

00:07.740 --> 00:15.000
talking about an issue that is, well, in a way dominates the next several decades

00:15.000 --> 00:18.840
in philosophy. Now at first glance you might think it's a very surprising thing.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.160
What is this issue? It's often referred to as the problem of

00:22.160 --> 00:26.800
quantifying it and dealing with the issues that arise from a quantified

00:26.800 --> 00:31.920
load a lot from combining ideas about possibility and necessity or for that

00:31.920 --> 00:36.760
matter various attitudes on belief and knowledge with quantifiable apparatus

00:36.760 --> 00:42.320
that allows you to use terms like some and all. Now at first glance you might

00:42.320 --> 00:46.840
think why is this significant? Why does this pose serious philosophical problems?

00:46.840 --> 00:53.720
The answer is roughly this. There is a traditional way of looking at

00:53.720 --> 01:00.080
metaphysics where you think about objects. As in Aristotle, for example,

01:00.080 --> 01:04.600
there are substances, they have properties, they stand in relation, and some of the

01:04.600 --> 01:09.400
properties of these substances are essential to them. They couldn't lose

01:09.400 --> 01:14.840
them without altering what they are. Okay? Other properties are accidental. They

01:14.840 --> 01:20.280
can change without affecting the identity of the object at all. So for example, what

01:20.320 --> 01:25.200
are some accidental properties of me? They could change, I would still be me. Yeah.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.840
Where you're standing? Where I'm standing, exactly. I'm standing here right now, but I

01:29.840 --> 01:35.320
can move around, I'm still me. Okay? If I do this, you can't suddenly say, well, we

01:35.320 --> 01:40.760
just keep getting a new professor in this class. Right? I'm still me. Other properties

01:40.760 --> 01:44.880
that are accidental. What are you wearing? What I'm wearing, exactly. I could wear

01:44.880 --> 01:49.320
different things, I'm still me. That I'm wearing this kind of sort of cream colored

01:49.360 --> 01:54.280
shirt. That is an accidental property of mine. What are some other accidental

01:54.280 --> 02:03.200
properties of mine? The color of your hair. Color of my hair? Yeah. I guess I could

02:03.200 --> 02:10.240
do something about that. It used to be different, but I was the same person. In

02:10.240 --> 02:13.960
fact, somebody recently saw me. I guess they hadn't seen me in a while. They said,

02:14.520 --> 02:20.720
when did your hair turn like this? I don't know. Actually, I sort of do know. It all

02:20.720 --> 02:25.720
happened rather suddenly. But anyway, that's something that is an accidental

02:25.720 --> 02:29.920
property of mine. What about essential properties? These are properties that are

02:29.920 --> 02:33.760
necessary to a thing. And in fact, Aristotle gives us three ways of thinking

02:33.760 --> 02:38.600
about these properties that are necessary to a thing. One is just that. The

02:38.600 --> 02:44.720
thing cannot lose them without stopping to be what it is. A second is that they

02:44.720 --> 02:50.280
are the things by virtue of which the thing is what it is. We might say that

02:50.280 --> 02:54.760
they are the nature of the thing. That's the way he sometimes refers to it. And

02:54.760 --> 02:58.960
Aquinas later calls it the nature of the thing. It's what makes it what it is. And

02:58.960 --> 03:03.080
then finally, we could think of it as something like the definition of the

03:03.080 --> 03:06.880
thing or what corresponds in the thing to what would be a definition of it. Now,

03:06.960 --> 03:10.480
could there be a definition of me? Aristotle talks about the question of

03:10.480 --> 03:13.960
whether there could be a definition of Socrates, for example. But there could

03:13.960 --> 03:19.600
certainly be a definition of a general kind. So we might think we could have a

03:19.600 --> 03:24.400
definition of bachelor or a definition of human being even. And that these things

03:24.400 --> 03:28.960
would express what is necessary to being a bachelor or a human being, what makes

03:28.960 --> 03:33.520
somebody a bachelor or a human being, what would correspond in the thing, the

03:33.520 --> 03:37.120
properties in the thing that would match the definition of those terms

03:37.160 --> 03:44.360
bachelor and human being. So are there such essential properties? Well, from one

03:44.360 --> 03:48.400
point of view, yes, in the Aristotelian tradition, in fact, not only are there

03:48.400 --> 03:51.360
such properties, but they're crucial to understanding the nature of the world.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.160
After all, the accidental properties aren't really very important in detailing

03:55.160 --> 04:00.960
what a thing is, but the essential properties are. And so Aristotelian

04:00.960 --> 04:05.160
essentialism is this doctrine that some of the properties of a thing are really

04:05.160 --> 04:10.360
substantively identical to it, right? Not identical to it, essential to it. And

04:10.440 --> 04:15.000
constitutive of its identity in some way. Now, there has been throughout the history

04:15.000 --> 04:19.720
of philosophy some resistance to this idea. And so there are people, I think

04:19.720 --> 04:26.120
John Walk would be a good example, at least in, well, in a certain respect, in

04:26.160 --> 04:31.720
another respect, not at all. Maybe Hume is a good example of someone who is

04:31.760 --> 04:39.160
doubtful about this idea of essentialism. Why do I say, well, Locke distinguishes

04:39.160 --> 04:43.080
the real from the nominal essence of the thing. He does think things have a real

04:43.080 --> 04:49.440
essence connected to the real internal constitution of the thing. But most of

04:49.440 --> 04:52.920
the essences he thinks that are talked about in the Aristotelian tradition are

04:52.920 --> 04:57.200
actually just nominal essences. They do correspond to something like the

04:57.200 --> 05:01.000
definition. But the definition, you might say, is something that depends on our

05:01.000 --> 05:05.200
categories, our way of understanding the thing. So understand me as a human

05:05.200 --> 05:09.600
being and certain things will look essential to me. But we could also ask,

05:09.600 --> 05:13.680
well, am I essentially a human being? Maybe, maybe not. And if I'm not

05:13.720 --> 05:17.160
essentially a human being, then those properties that are essential to me

05:17.160 --> 05:22.000
qua human being might not be essential to me, qua soul, let's say, or qua

05:22.040 --> 05:26.200
something else. And so it depends how a thing is described, what is essential to

05:26.200 --> 05:31.400
me. From this perspective, you might say, essence depends on the description of

05:31.400 --> 05:35.080
the thing. It's something that we use to understand the thing, but it's not in

05:35.080 --> 05:40.400
the thing itself. And so one way of framing this issue is, if we grant that

05:40.400 --> 05:44.520
some properties have this status of being essential, either to a thing or to a

05:44.520 --> 05:49.480
kind of thing, then is that something that really is about that object? Is it

05:49.520 --> 05:55.000
really about that kind? Or is it something that we are supplying as part of our

05:55.000 --> 05:59.120
conceptual framework for understanding that thing, that kind? It's really a

05:59.120 --> 06:05.360
question of realism versus a kind of anti-realism about those essences. So

06:05.520 --> 06:09.200
almost nobody is going to say, oh, just nothing's essential to anything, in the

06:09.200 --> 06:13.040
sense that we never can talk about something being necessarily this or

06:13.040 --> 06:17.120
that, or we can't really talk about definitions. It's a question of whether

06:17.400 --> 06:21.160
that distinction is something that we find in the world among the properties of

06:21.160 --> 06:25.040
the thing or the kind, or whether it's something that really is just our

06:25.040 --> 06:30.320
creation. Now suppose you're a logical empiricist and you think, well, first of

06:30.320 --> 06:33.240
all, you're going to be uncomfortable with this talk of necessity in the first

06:33.240 --> 06:38.600
place, right? And we'll get some more of that in a moment. But whether or not

06:38.600 --> 06:42.360
you're willing to talk about necessity at all, you're going to think, well, what

06:43.080 --> 06:48.280
is necessity from a logical empiricist point of view? It's basically analytic

06:48.280 --> 06:52.840
truth. It is coming from our verbal conventions. And so you're going to

06:52.840 --> 06:57.280
think that, of course, to the extent that we can talk about essences at all,

06:57.680 --> 07:01.080
they're things that are coming from our conceptual capacities. They're coming

07:01.080 --> 07:04.680
from our linguistic framework. And so sure, we can have definitions of

07:04.680 --> 07:09.000
terms, but that's not expressing some fundamental distinction between

07:09.000 --> 07:13.600
properties in the thing. It's simply a function of the definitions of the

07:13.600 --> 07:18.200
terms we're using. So it's all coming from us. From a more traditional

07:18.200 --> 07:21.920
perspective, though, you might think, no, there really are things that are

07:21.920 --> 07:26.280
essential to me and I couldn't lose without ceasing to be me. There are other

07:26.280 --> 07:31.200
things that may be, well, certainly I can lose and still be me, like the color

07:31.200 --> 07:36.640
of my hair or the color of my shirt or where I'm standing. Now, if we start

07:36.640 --> 07:40.880
asking, well, what are the kinds of things that are essential to me? It's

07:40.880 --> 07:44.440
much harder, right? Easy to list accidental properties. But if I say

07:44.440 --> 07:48.920
suddenly, well, one is essential to me, then that's a really hard question to

07:48.920 --> 07:50.280
answer. Yeah.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.760
Do these essential properties actually need to you?

07:53.920 --> 07:59.240
Well, not all of them certainly, right? There could be some things that are

07:59.240 --> 08:04.920
essential to me. For example, you might say, I've got an idea. Self-identity is

08:04.920 --> 08:10.280
essential. You are necessarily you. Okay? So Dan Bonovac is necessarily Dan

08:10.280 --> 08:15.720
Bonovac. Now, that seems pretty safe. And also a good example of something that

08:15.720 --> 08:19.480
seems analytic, right? It's not something that really expresses something you might

08:19.480 --> 08:24.240
think about the nature of me, but about the way we use identity. And certainly,

08:24.240 --> 08:27.480
it's not unique. Every object would have that property and have that property

08:27.480 --> 08:32.440
essentially. So not all of these are going to really be unique to me. On the

08:32.440 --> 08:36.880
other hand, you might have the idea that what makes me differ from anyone else is

08:36.880 --> 08:40.840
that if you take the collection of these essential properties, there's something

08:40.840 --> 08:45.080
that's unique to me about that collection. So individually, they might not be

08:45.080 --> 08:50.040
unique, but that combination might be. On the other hand, maybe not. So have you

08:50.040 --> 08:56.240
ever seen a movie multiplicity? The guy gets cloned and then the clones start

08:56.240 --> 09:01.440
cloning themselves and it all gets sort of outrageously outhand. But anyway,

09:01.440 --> 09:09.360
suppose we did have a cloning mechanism so that there were just a bunch of

09:09.360 --> 09:14.080
duplicates of me. Would those be me? Would we not say, oh, Dan Bonovac used to be a

09:14.080 --> 09:17.720
particular, but now he's a general kind and there are a bunch of them. He's

09:17.720 --> 09:22.320
multiply instantiated. Or would there be something that distinguishes me from them?

09:22.360 --> 09:26.400
Something about my origin, maybe, the way in which I came to be. They came to be

09:26.400 --> 09:30.240
in a very different way by means of the cloning machine. Or maybe it's a

09:30.240 --> 09:34.120
transporter malfunction in Star Trek. You know, you get in the transporter and

09:34.120 --> 09:38.560
actually we don't send your particles down. We just rebuild you on the other

09:38.560 --> 09:42.640
side and kill you here. It's a really disturbing view of the transporter system,

09:42.640 --> 09:45.880
but suppose you have that view. And then suppose it malfunctions so that we don't

09:45.880 --> 09:48.920
kill you here. So you're still on the ship. But also now there's a clone of you

09:48.960 --> 09:52.640
running around on the planet. And then the clone comes back and what that means is

09:52.640 --> 09:55.600
now there's a second one of you on the ship and that guy's still stuck down

09:55.600 --> 10:00.840
there and they all claim to be you. Well, I don't know what to say about such cases.

10:00.840 --> 10:05.920
So it's not clear to me now whether we have three of you or whether, no, you're

10:05.920 --> 10:09.200
still you. There's something essential to you about the way in which you were

10:09.200 --> 10:14.600
created. These are copies of you, but they're not you. Just as if you produce a

10:14.600 --> 10:18.320
copy of a file on a computer. You've got a copy of the file. You don't have that

10:18.360 --> 10:26.040
same file. In any event, however that may be, does this whole idea of an essence of

10:26.040 --> 10:32.240
the thing make any sense? Well, I've already mentioned one reason why is a

10:32.240 --> 10:36.960
logical empiricist. You might think it doesn't. But there are other reasons you

10:36.960 --> 10:42.640
might think it doesn't. And they are more general. After all, Klein is not a logical

10:42.640 --> 10:46.320
empiricist. He's attacked the analytic synthetic distinction. He's attacked the

10:46.320 --> 10:49.640
identity of truth by convention. So you might think he's the kind of guy that's

10:49.640 --> 10:53.200
actually going to be very friendly toward this idea of essential problems,

10:53.200 --> 11:00.440
really beating the world. But not true. And why not? Well, really, let's go back and

11:00.440 --> 11:12.280
think about the essential major of empiricism. What is an empiricist? An

11:12.280 --> 11:20.240
empiricist thinks that, oh, knowledge comes from what? Well, well, analytic

11:20.240 --> 11:23.800
and synthetic truth, but fundamentally experience, right? And then, yeah, there

11:23.800 --> 11:27.800
are these things that are really, well, knowledge of a sort, but really, in the

11:27.800 --> 11:30.840
end, knowledge of linguistic conventions or something like that, you might

11:30.840 --> 11:36.000
think. But all of our knowledge of the world comes from experience. Now, if

11:36.000 --> 11:39.680
you're quite, you're not actually going to single out some of these analytic

11:39.920 --> 11:43.760
judgments or conventional judgments or something like that as an exception. In

11:43.760 --> 11:47.200
the end, it's all really about the world. And so it's all coming from

11:47.200 --> 11:53.520
experience. It's all judged by the tribunal of experience. So in the end, it

11:53.520 --> 11:58.640
all comes down to experience. But now, there are going to be things that are

11:58.640 --> 12:03.000
hard to explain in connection with experience. So think about the kinds of

12:03.000 --> 12:07.200
things that you as trouble accounting for, for example. Okay, we can talk about

12:07.240 --> 12:11.760
the color of my shirt. But now, there are going to be other properties of me,

12:11.760 --> 12:17.800
dispositional properties of me that you might think are not so evident. What do

12:17.800 --> 12:26.000
we say about dispositional properties? What are some examples of dispositional

12:26.000 --> 12:29.880
properties? You can't directly observe them. They have to do with the way I

12:29.880 --> 12:35.040
would behave in certain circumstances. But those circumstances might actually

12:35.040 --> 12:42.000
never come about. Like the match, let's say. We say it's not soluble, even though

12:42.000 --> 12:45.280
it's never placed in water. It's a we never really have the experience of

12:45.280 --> 12:50.080
finding out. Similarly, the salt in my salt shake. I say it is soluble, but

12:50.080 --> 12:53.320
actually, it might never encounter water. And so we might never find out.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.120
Look at your temper. Sorry. Would your temper be one?

12:57.120 --> 13:01.200
Okay, good. My temper. Am I somebody who is a rassable, easy to anger? Or am I

13:01.200 --> 13:08.400
somebody who's gentle, mellow, difficult to anger? Well, I think I don't know. Not

13:08.400 --> 13:13.440
much happens in the average analytic tradition course to really upset me. And

13:13.440 --> 13:16.880
so you might think this is like the match that's never been placed in water,

13:16.880 --> 13:21.440
right? I mean, nothing's ever happened in your in your experience to really test

13:21.440 --> 13:27.080
whether I'm easy to anger or not. And the same thing is true with respect to you

13:27.080 --> 13:31.000
given my experience, right? Are you easy to anger or not? I don't have any

13:31.000 --> 13:34.640
experience that's relevant to that. I mean, you might be the sort of person who

13:34.640 --> 13:41.240
flies off the handle. What, analytic judgments? No. And you know, analytic

13:41.240 --> 13:43.760
philosophy does that to some people. There's the famous story about

13:43.760 --> 13:48.040
Wittgenstein threatening copper with the poker. But wordarily, you might think,

13:48.040 --> 13:52.440
yeah, it doesn't really come up in the context of this sort of course. So we

13:52.480 --> 13:56.160
don't find out. And maybe I never find out that about them. Yeah.

13:56.160 --> 14:02.640
We're saying that these dispositional probabilities are like essential things.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.840
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything about them being essential. I'm just

14:05.840 --> 14:09.240
thinking, yeah, well, I should make it clear what I'm saying here. What are

14:09.240 --> 14:16.880
potential trouble for an empiricist? Things where we say, gosh, what

14:16.880 --> 14:22.320
experience could that be based on? Right? Now, maybe I do have experience.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.280
There might be some people who see you get angry and they have a sense you're

14:25.280 --> 14:30.080
either easy to anger or hard to anger. But maybe we never encounter that,

14:30.080 --> 14:33.680
right? You just go through life and it's all pretty good. Go through life. It's

14:33.680 --> 14:40.880
like, you know, all right, there's this story about a kid who, you know, never

14:40.880 --> 14:46.320
spoke. Parents took him to all sorts of specialists, had him examined. He seemed

14:46.320 --> 14:51.440
normal in all other ways, but just never said a word. Well, finally they gave up,

14:51.440 --> 14:55.120
right? They take him to this specialist, that specialist, do all sorts of brain

14:55.120 --> 14:59.040
scans and so on. He seems absolutely normal, seems to be intelligent. Nobody

14:59.040 --> 15:03.280
can figure out why this child does not speak. So eventually they just kind of

15:03.280 --> 15:08.200
give up. And then one morning, the kid's sitting down before going to school for

15:08.200 --> 15:13.760
breakfast. Mom gives him this piece of toast. Kid suddenly looks at it and says,

15:13.760 --> 15:18.720
this toast is burnt. Well, suddenly she and her husband, they're all like, you

15:18.720 --> 15:22.960
spoke, you spoke, they're so happy, right? And the kid said, well, of course I

15:22.960 --> 15:28.480
can speak. Why haven't you said anything up to now? It's been 12 years. Kid said,

15:28.480 --> 15:34.320
well, it's all been okay up to now. Okay, so it might be that the kid goes through

15:34.320 --> 15:37.600
life the whole way, right? I mean, we never find out whether this person is

15:37.600 --> 15:41.760
easy to anger because just nothing ever happens to upset them. Yeah, why would

15:41.920 --> 15:45.680
that really be a problem? Because we don't have the knowledge then. So, I mean, you

15:45.680 --> 15:50.000
don't have to justify it with empiricism if you don't know it. Okay, good. You might just say,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.720
well, then we don't know, right? Whether this person is erasable or gentle or what

15:54.720 --> 15:59.520
have you. And so that's fine. It's fine to have things we do not know. But now you

15:59.520 --> 16:03.600
might think, well, here's the problem. Remember, we were talking about this in

16:03.600 --> 16:08.640
Karnap, where Karnap was trying to define terms like soluble in terms that were

16:08.640 --> 16:12.400
strictly observational. And he probably couldn't do it with a regular conditional.

16:12.400 --> 16:17.280
He needed something like a counterfactual conditional. So it had to be something like

16:18.080 --> 16:28.000
if blah, blah, blah were to happen, right? Then blah, blah, blah would happen.

16:32.320 --> 16:37.440
And now the problem is that were to and that would. It seems to refer to things that

16:37.440 --> 16:44.240
actually, well, aren't part of this world. The way philosophers now, following Leibniz,

16:44.240 --> 16:49.360
said to think about this, it's talking about other possible worlds. If you were to be placed

16:49.360 --> 16:54.080
in this kind of situation, right, but maybe you never are, then this would happen. And so it's

16:54.080 --> 16:58.560
not just that we don't happen to know. It feels like the kind of thing that actually

16:58.560 --> 17:03.360
it would be hard to explain our possession of such a property. What could it even mean

17:03.360 --> 17:09.520
to attribute such a property on empiricist grounds? Because you might think, gosh, it's not

17:09.520 --> 17:13.920
just that to notice I'd have to somehow have contact with these other possible worlds. The

17:13.920 --> 17:18.240
very definition of what it is that such a property seems to refer to these other worlds.

17:18.800 --> 17:27.840
And so there's something strange about that. Yeah. I mean, you could just arrive at that knowledge

17:27.840 --> 17:36.000
inductively and say salt dissolves when placed in water, right? I don't really, I remember

17:36.000 --> 17:39.520
talking about this before, but not that we'll be visiting it like this. I don't really see why

17:39.520 --> 17:44.320
you need counterfactuals. Good, good. Well, you might think, look, I don't really need

17:46.080 --> 17:51.200
any mysterious knowledge here. Here's how I do it. I have inductive evidence about this rule,

17:51.200 --> 17:58.560
right? And on the basis of that inductive evidence, I conclude certain generalizations.

17:58.560 --> 18:04.400
And some of those I actually consider laws. Now, some of these generalizations I consider

18:04.400 --> 18:12.880
accidental. It just so happens that this takes place. I can't infer it to have any really

18:12.880 --> 18:17.680
lawline character. It's just been a matter of chance that it's worked out that way. However,

18:17.680 --> 18:21.520
some of these other things might seem to me to reflect some deeper pattern.

18:21.520 --> 18:27.440
And so I think that's a law. Now, what's involved in my going from the generalization

18:27.440 --> 18:34.480
that G puts salt in water and it dissolves to the law, put it in water, it must dissolve?

18:34.480 --> 18:39.680
Where does the must come from? Where does the necessity come from? And you might say,

18:40.240 --> 18:46.080
look, it's just if we have enough inductive evidence, right? We do this in the United States.

18:46.080 --> 18:50.480
We do it in Europe. We do it in Africa. We do it in India. We do it in China. We do it in Russia.

18:50.480 --> 18:54.320
And gee, no matter where we go, no matter when it is, it seems to all be the same.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.640
And we start thinking, this isn't just an accident. This is really lawlike.

18:58.640 --> 19:04.000
And so one way of looking at this is to say, we start attributing something like necessity,

19:04.000 --> 19:09.760
like the must, like calling that a law, when the inductive evidence is just very broad,

19:09.760 --> 19:17.120
very powerful, seems very, what, have a huge scope in space and time and so on.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.600
Which is, by the way, why it would be so hard to come up with equivalent laws in the social sciences,

19:25.600 --> 19:29.760
because you might think it's very hard to have that kind of fraud, inductive evidence.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.840
Maybe in psychology, you can do it because you can observe lots of people in lots of cultures

19:33.840 --> 19:38.000
and so forth. But if you're thinking about political science, you might think, gosh,

19:38.000 --> 19:45.120
where's the science? Because here we call that a department of government, right?

19:45.120 --> 19:48.560
We don't claim it to be a science. But you might think, the problem is really,

19:48.560 --> 19:53.440
we can't get enough inductive evidence. I mean, how many countries are there in the world now?

19:53.440 --> 19:59.760
That's quite few, but not in comparison to grains of salt, for example. And what kinds of experience

19:59.760 --> 20:06.720
have we had, let's say, with revolutions? Well, some, but not equivalent to putting salt in water

20:06.720 --> 20:10.960
and finding out what happens. And so, you might think there, the inductive evidence is just

20:10.960 --> 20:15.600
sparse enough, very hard to make that move. Anyway, I don't have any real objection to that.

20:17.600 --> 20:23.920
In fact, I think that's the way Locke thinks all of this goes. It's Hume, who after all says,

20:23.920 --> 20:28.080
wait a minute, look at what's happening in these cases. We observe this happening,

20:28.080 --> 20:33.120
we observe that happening, we never see the causal connection. We never actually observe the link.

20:34.080 --> 20:39.280
Yeah. I don't really see how this inductive evidence would work. Like, if someone were to

20:39.280 --> 20:43.760
tell me that salt doesn't dissolve in oil, I wouldn't necessarily have to do the experiment over and

20:43.760 --> 20:49.440
over again to understand that for certain, but I could still believe it conceptually. So, I feel

20:49.440 --> 20:53.120
like inductive evidence isn't necessarily the only way to get some kind of dispositional property or

20:53.120 --> 21:08.240
something. Right. Well, here's the problem. Sometimes you're right. We do take one counter

21:08.240 --> 21:15.120
instances enough to establish either a connection or the lack of a connection. But I'm thinking of

21:15.120 --> 21:22.880
cases like the cold fusion experiments. People claim to have discovered cold fusion. And then,

21:23.200 --> 21:28.880
for at least a decade, there was a huge attempt to try to replicate those experiments to figure

21:28.880 --> 21:34.320
out whether there really was a principle underlying this and there was really a technology that would

21:34.320 --> 21:39.920
enable cold fusion or whether this was due to some, the results they got were due to some kind of weird

21:40.720 --> 21:46.400
phenomenon in their lab. And for a long time, it was unsettled what it was. I think now most

21:46.400 --> 21:51.120
people dismiss the possibility, though I think there are still some authors who think that

21:51.920 --> 21:59.280
there may still be something there that one could do. But many of them, from one experiment,

21:59.280 --> 22:03.360
people thought, oh, that's intriguing. It made them want to do more experiments. But people

22:03.360 --> 22:08.000
didn't immediately say, we've got the technology in the future. Let's start building cold fusion,

22:08.000 --> 22:14.320
power plants, and so forth. They felt the need to do more experimentation. So, I think in some

22:14.400 --> 22:21.760
contexts, especially when something refutes along, then it's very powerful. We say, wait a minute,

22:21.760 --> 22:28.480
this is going to happen. We put the salt in the oil and then what happens when we put the salt in

22:28.480 --> 22:33.680
the oil? We've never done it before. We're doing it for the first time. And we might say, aha,

22:33.680 --> 22:39.120
this is what happened. It did dissolve, so salt does dissolve oil or it didn't dissolve. But

22:39.120 --> 22:45.600
the evidence for that is rather thin until we repeat it. And if it's the kind of thing that we

22:45.600 --> 22:52.960
can't repeat, then it's hard to know what to do, which is, again, part of the reason why it's a

22:52.960 --> 22:57.200
political science. It would be so difficult to come up with something law-like. You can't start

22:57.200 --> 23:02.800
saying, whoa, what if that would happen again? Let's hold the last presidential race over again

23:02.800 --> 23:07.360
and see if Trump still wins under these conditions or something. Yeah, can't do that.

23:08.240 --> 23:18.400
And so, in short, it's the kind of thing that, well, yeah, it's going to depend a lot on how

23:18.400 --> 23:22.880
this fits in with the rest of our knowledge. And so, quiet at least will say, yeah, you're right,

23:22.880 --> 23:28.800
this is how it goes. But a lot of that is driven by where this is in the web, how close we are to

23:28.800 --> 23:33.680
experience, how much other theoretical support there is and so forth. Anyway, we're getting sort

23:33.680 --> 23:37.680
of off track because I don't want to spend a huge amount of time thinking about how we can

23:37.680 --> 23:43.920
account for dispositional properties, except to say that there's a sense in which essential

23:43.920 --> 23:52.000
properties raise the same kinds of questions. I was hoping here to be referring to something we all

23:52.000 --> 24:01.200
agree about, but oh well. Anyway, essential properties are kind of the same. Why? Because we

24:01.200 --> 24:12.480
think, well, yeah, I'm saying here, gosh, if the object were right to lack the property,

24:12.560 --> 24:28.400
it wouldn't be what it is. And that's similarly modal, right? It's similarly talking about what

24:28.400 --> 24:35.680
would be the case. And maybe I never, in fact, lack the property. And so, you know, for example,

24:35.680 --> 24:41.760
would I still be me if I were bald? Well, let's suppose I just never go bald. And then you might

24:41.760 --> 24:47.600
say, well, gosh, we never find out. Now, in fact, we think, oh, come on, it's still me himself

24:47.600 --> 24:54.240
to be bald. And so, we think we know something about that. And yet, it looks like, in a sense,

24:55.440 --> 25:00.880
what we're knowing here goes similarly beyond experience directly. So, if you're in the school

25:00.880 --> 25:05.360
of lock as an empiricist, you're going to say, well, we reach inductive conclusions about this,

25:05.360 --> 25:11.040
just as we do about these scientific laws, just as we do dispositional properties. If you're more

25:11.040 --> 25:15.760
humian, you're going to see a deeper problem here. And think that the very idea takes you

25:15.760 --> 25:24.640
beyond the bounds of experience in a way that makes you uncomfortable. So, why did I stand on that?

25:26.160 --> 25:30.000
I don't know. It was really just to make the point that there is kind of this distinction

25:30.000 --> 25:34.560
between the lockians and the humians here, and that there's a sort of parallel problem here.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.960
So, just as Karnab worried a lot about this, and a lot of people start writing about

25:38.960 --> 25:42.720
counterfactual conditionals, and how to understand them, and what the nature of laws is, and so

25:42.720 --> 25:50.160
forth. So, similarly, we have an analogous problem with essential properties. Now, we can characterize

25:50.160 --> 25:56.640
certain contexts in language and in thought as referentially transparent, and others as

25:56.640 --> 26:01.840
referentially opaque. And that's an important distinction for Karnab. So, here's the general

26:01.840 --> 26:11.200
idea. We've got this notion of identity. Okay? And there, or just expressed by is in English.

26:12.080 --> 26:19.280
And ordinarily, it allows us to substitute. So, typically, we can substitute identicals

26:19.840 --> 26:37.280
for identities. So, here's an example. Two plus two is four. Four plus four is eight.

26:38.400 --> 26:42.880
Well, I should be able to substitute two plus two for four in that equation to get two plus two

26:43.440 --> 26:52.640
plus two plus two is eight. And that, that seems right, right? That works out just fine.

26:52.640 --> 26:59.280
And so ordinarily, this is a legitimate rule. Leibniz's law in general says that things are

26:59.280 --> 27:03.440
identical. If they have exactly the same properties, and if they have exactly the same properties,

27:03.440 --> 27:08.080
you should be able to substitute one for the other. And typically, we can do that. If Dan

27:08.080 --> 27:12.400
Bonobak is talking, and Dan Bonobak is the professor, then the professor is talking, etc.

27:13.520 --> 27:20.960
But now, there are some contexts where that prevails. So, we'll say that a context is transparent.

27:25.120 --> 27:31.040
If that works, that is to say, if substituting identicals for identicals always preserves

27:31.040 --> 27:41.360
truth value. So, it turns true sentences into true sentences, and false sentences and false

27:41.360 --> 27:55.440
sentences. And opaque, if it sometimes fails, which means it doesn't always preserve truth value.

27:55.440 --> 28:03.920
So, Quine is worried about these opaque contexts, where we've got some situations where substitution

28:03.920 --> 28:10.400
doesn't always work. Here's one of his examples. Basically, well, yeah, we can say things that

28:10.400 --> 28:23.600
involve quotation, either directly or indirectly. So, yeah, here's one of these examples. Cicero,

28:24.320 --> 28:35.920
a name, right, contains six letters. This fall, by the way, there's going to be a

28:35.920 --> 28:41.840
course on Cicero and Catullus in the classics. So, you should all take it. It would help with your new lab.

28:45.440 --> 28:51.920
Yeah, well, I'm very fond of both of them. So, now, Cicero, what is his actual name?

28:52.640 --> 29:00.400
Well, it's Marcus Tullius Cicero. And so, he's sometimes called Tully as a nickname. So, Cicero

29:00.400 --> 29:08.240
is Tully. But then we might think, ah, so we can substitute. Tully contains six letters.

29:11.120 --> 29:17.840
Well, that obviously fails, right? We don't preserve truth by that kind of substitution. We

29:17.840 --> 29:22.400
can substitute in direct notation. And that's sort of a surprise, really, because after all,

29:22.400 --> 29:28.080
this is about the name, Cicero, and not about the person. And so, the identity of the person here

29:28.080 --> 29:33.840
doesn't mean that the names are going to share the properties. So, it's easy to explain why that fails.

29:33.840 --> 29:41.040
Now, this can also be indirect. So, for example, he gives us this case. Georgione is called Barbarelli.

29:41.040 --> 29:46.800
Sorry, Georgione is Barbarelli. Georgione Barbarelli was the first of the great painters of the

29:46.800 --> 29:51.360
Italian Renaissance. And in particular, he's thought to have painted a painting called The Three

29:51.360 --> 29:57.680
Philosophers, which is perhaps why Klein knows about it. Sort of a mysterious character. He died

29:57.680 --> 30:04.480
when he was around 30 of the play, and only painted a few paintings. So, little is known about him.

30:05.120 --> 30:10.800
But anyway, here's a quite example. Georgione was so-called because of his size. Big guy.

30:11.360 --> 30:17.360
Okay? Barbarelli was so-called because of his size. Well, that's not right.

30:18.320 --> 30:23.840
Okay? So, so-called here is something that sort of sneaks in a reference to the name. And so,

30:23.840 --> 30:28.000
it's kind of an indirect, well, not literally, an indirect quotation. But nevertheless,

30:28.000 --> 30:33.840
it's something like a quotation context. It sneaks it in. So, there are those kinds of cases.

30:34.560 --> 30:40.080
But there are much more interesting kinds of cases. So, in particular, necessity

30:42.080 --> 30:46.560
is one of these. One way of thinking about an essential property is that it's necessary to the

30:46.560 --> 30:51.520
thing, or to the kind of thing. But now we can think, well, wait a minute, necessity is weird

30:51.520 --> 30:56.240
because it's opaque in this way. So, here's an example that might show that.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.720
The number of planets

31:05.440 --> 31:06.000
is 9.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.160
Necessarily,

31:14.000 --> 31:23.520
9 is greater than 7. Therefore, necessarily, the number of planets

31:26.400 --> 31:31.360
is greater than 7. Now, does that work?

31:35.680 --> 31:36.960
No. What's gone wrong?

31:46.160 --> 31:48.880
There's no necessity that there'd be more than 7 planets.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.920
Exactly. There's no necessity that there'd be more than 7 planets.

31:52.640 --> 31:56.880
I think there could have been 6 planets. I mean, a little while ago,

31:56.880 --> 32:00.800
they demoted Pluto for being a planet. Now, again, they promoted Pluto back up again.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.280
So, there are 9 planets again. Yay! Go ahead, because it makes it easier to teach quine here.

32:06.880 --> 32:11.600
But, actually, somebody said, well, wait a minute, I'm not sure. The Earth is a planet.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.200
And you might think, oh, wait, we're going to change the definition of planets. So,

32:15.200 --> 32:18.720
even the Earth isn't a planet. Maybe it will turn out that only, I don't know,

32:19.280 --> 32:22.720
would satisfy their new definition of planets. Those people got their way.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.520
But there might be way fewer than 7 planets by that criterion. In any case, you might think,

32:27.520 --> 32:32.400
yeah, look, it's highly contingent whether or not there are more than 7 planets. That's not a

32:32.400 --> 32:38.720
necessary truth. But this surely is a necessary truth. 9 is greater than 7. That seems necessary.

32:38.720 --> 32:43.760
Something that follows from the laws of arithmetic. And the number of planets is 9.

32:43.760 --> 32:48.560
So, why can't we do this substitution? Well, here's what quine ends up concluding.

32:50.960 --> 32:57.920
Is this property, so you can frame it this way, is the property of being

33:00.000 --> 33:13.440
necessarily greater than 7? Well, maybe I don't want to. We could just say, is that true?

33:14.080 --> 33:24.880
Let's say, is the property of being greater than 7 necessary to 9, the object 9?

33:26.960 --> 33:30.800
Now, one way of looking at it, if you're a realist, you think you can answer the question. If you're

33:30.800 --> 33:35.200
a realist, the amount is essences, right? Because then you think, yes, the essence is in the object.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.960
And so, what is the realist going to say about this question?

33:39.920 --> 33:43.200
Is the property of being greater than 7 necessary to 9?

33:46.560 --> 33:54.480
Yeah, sure it is. Because 9 is necessarily greater than 7. You couldn't make it less than 7,

33:54.480 --> 34:02.240
for example, or equal to 7 without changing what 9 is. But suppose we're one of these anti-realists.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.480
Then how are you going to answer that question?

34:09.920 --> 34:18.960
It depends how you designate it, right? If you call it, if you're thinking of 9 as 9,

34:18.960 --> 34:22.800
then yes, it's necessarily greater than 7. It has that property unnecessarily.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.960
But suppose you're thinking of it as the number of planets, then it doesn't.

34:27.600 --> 34:36.480
9 quad, 9, you might think, necessarily has that property. But the number of planets,

34:36.480 --> 34:44.720
9 quad, the number of planets does not. And so, it sort of depends on how it's described.

34:52.240 --> 34:57.200
And that's in the end client's position. It depends how it's described. So we can talk

34:57.200 --> 35:05.360
about things having essences, but only as, when described as such and such. 9 described as that

35:05.360 --> 35:10.080
number. We're already sort of describing it in terms of its position in the number sequence.

35:10.080 --> 35:15.040
And so, yes, it's necessarily greater than 7, but 9 described as the number of planets. No,

35:15.040 --> 35:20.240
that's not necessarily greater than 7. 9, just without any description, he says,

35:21.120 --> 35:24.480
I don't think I could make any sense of the idea. Yeah.

35:24.480 --> 35:28.640
Well, why is 9 described as the number of planets not necessarily greater than 7?

35:29.440 --> 35:31.360
Because there could have been fewer than 7 planets.

35:31.360 --> 35:31.920
But there aren't.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.520
There aren't. Yeah, there aren't.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.880
That's why I'm confused. Like, there could have been, but if there would have been,

35:40.880 --> 35:44.960
then it just wouldn't have been 9 in the first place. It would be different. So it wouldn't

35:44.960 --> 35:45.760
necessarily, you know.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. You might think the number of planets, wait a minute,

35:51.280 --> 35:55.680
I'm not sure what to do with that when I start thinking about other possible circumstances.

35:55.680 --> 36:00.400
After all, you say that could have been fewer than 9 planets. Well, we're now talking about some

36:00.400 --> 36:08.000
other possible world, right? And so, what about one of these worlds where there are now fewer

36:08.000 --> 36:18.080
than, here's the sun, and here's Mercury, let's say, and here's Venus, and the big bang worked

36:18.080 --> 36:22.240
out a little differently in this world. So all the other planets flew off in this space,

36:22.240 --> 36:26.560
and there are only those two remaining. Okay. So in this world, there are two planets.

36:27.280 --> 36:31.040
Now, what does the number of planets refer to in that world?

36:32.240 --> 36:39.040
Two. Okay. One wavelength. Yeah, look, the number of planets here is just two.

36:40.240 --> 36:46.320
But then it looks like the number of planets is 9 in this world, 2 in that world, so it's not

36:46.320 --> 36:51.120
necessarily greater than 7. On the other hand, you might think, wait a minute, no, when I said the

36:51.120 --> 36:55.520
number of planets is 9, I mean the number of planets in this world. And so I don't mean the

36:55.520 --> 37:02.960
number of planets, let's call the actual world here w, in this world, w prime, let's say, then

37:02.960 --> 37:10.000
really I have to distinguish the number of planets in w prime from the number of planets

37:12.240 --> 37:18.560
in w. And the number of planets in w is still 9, right? Because it is what it is. It doesn't

37:18.560 --> 37:22.880
matter what world you're viewing it from, in that world, in our world, the number of planets is

37:22.880 --> 37:28.080
9. And so you might think, wait a minute, when I say the number of planets, do I mean that to

37:28.080 --> 37:32.000
vary with world? So, ooh, now the number of planets is this. Or do I mean the number of

37:32.000 --> 37:38.080
planets there actually are? And that actually would be something that ties this to this world.

37:38.080 --> 37:44.080
The actual number of planets? That sort of means that's not going to vary from world to world.

37:44.880 --> 37:49.760
But if I don't sort of pin it down with actually, then it looks like it could vary.

37:50.720 --> 37:55.200
On the other hand, people don't ordinarily go around, unless they're teaching seminars on

37:55.200 --> 38:01.600
motor logic, they don't go around using the term actually much in that way. And so often,

38:01.600 --> 38:06.880
if we just say the number of planets, the number of students in the class, etc., etc., we mean the

38:06.880 --> 38:11.520
actual number. We're not talking about something that might vary. You know, I say the number of

38:11.520 --> 38:18.560
students in the class is, what is it in this class? Like 25. And somebody says, well, what if a

38:18.560 --> 38:28.400
bunch of people dropped? Well, yeah, then the number of planets would change. The number of

38:28.400 --> 38:33.440
students that are in the class then would be different. On the other hand, the number of

38:33.440 --> 38:39.920
students who were in the class now would remain the same. And so you might think that actually

38:39.920 --> 38:45.920
there's a sort of hidden ambiguity here, which I think is part of this. You might think, look,

38:46.000 --> 38:50.160
it depends on how it's described. And here's an additional way in which it depends.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.480
Do I mean the number of planets that happen to be in a given world? Or do I mean the number

38:54.480 --> 38:58.560
of planets that actually are in this world? And those would be, as it were, two different

38:58.560 --> 39:03.520
descriptions. And that too would affect what we end up saying about this question.

39:06.400 --> 39:12.560
Okay, well, that's one sort of problem. It's connected to a problem about quantification.

39:12.560 --> 39:18.960
Because now if I say, so there is something

39:22.960 --> 39:24.960
that is necessarily

39:28.560 --> 39:32.160
greater than seven. How do I evaluate that?

39:32.400 --> 39:42.400
Now, Quine doesn't have any problem with necessity applied to a sentence.

39:42.960 --> 39:48.240
He doesn't have any problem with necessity on the outside of this, you might say. It's a necessary

39:48.240 --> 39:55.680
truth that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He worries about the necessity being inside.

39:55.680 --> 40:01.040
Okay, there is something that is necessarily greater than seven, that has been greater than seven

40:01.040 --> 40:07.440
as an essential property of it. And why does he worry about that? Because this something

40:08.880 --> 40:14.800
isn't described as being of any particular kind. And if it really does depend on how it's described,

40:14.800 --> 40:19.760
then it doesn't make any sense to talk about whether the object itself is necessarily greater

40:19.760 --> 40:26.400
than seven or not. What makes sense is to say the number of planets is not necessarily greater

40:26.400 --> 40:31.520
than seven, but nine is necessarily greater than seven. And yet we're talking about the same object,

40:31.520 --> 40:37.760
so it depends on the description. And so he's worried that things like this don't fully make sense.

40:39.440 --> 40:45.040
Now, the same sort of thing can happen with respect to attitudes. And that's what the paper

40:45.040 --> 40:51.600
quantifiers in propositional attitudes is about. This begins, by the way, with one of my favorite

40:51.600 --> 40:58.960
passages of analytic philosophy. The incorrectness of rendering Tessius is hunting unicorns. In the

40:58.960 --> 41:04.960
fashion that there is an X, such that X is a unicorn and Tessius is hunting X, is conveniently

41:04.960 --> 41:10.080
attested by the non-existence of unicorns. But it's not due simply to that zoological Kunah.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.880
It would be equally incorrect to render Ernest's hunting lions as there is an X such that X is

41:14.880 --> 41:20.720
a lion. And Ernest is hunting X, where Ernest is a sportsman in Africa. The force of one is

41:20.720 --> 41:24.640
rather that there is some individual lion or several, which Ernest is hunting, stray circus

41:24.640 --> 41:31.680
property, for example. The contrast recurs in I want a sloop. The version, there is an X such

41:31.680 --> 41:37.120
that X is a sloop, and I want X. It's suitable insofar only as there may be said to be a certain

41:37.120 --> 41:43.600
sloop that I want. If what I seek is mere relief from slooplessness, then do guess the wrong idea.

41:44.560 --> 41:48.560
Okay, now this is something that actually linguists have worried a lot about. What do you do about

41:48.560 --> 41:53.040
cases like hunting a unicorn or hunting a lion or wanting a sloop and so forth?

41:54.720 --> 41:58.480
And then he kind of leaves that problem behind, but it's an interesting problem.

41:58.480 --> 42:05.920
Anyway, that's one difficulty where we want to say, wait, hunting, actually, yeah, I should

42:05.920 --> 42:13.040
sort of put in here. We've got this additional thing now of attitudes. Hunting is something

42:13.040 --> 42:24.240
that does involve some kind of attitude. Hunting, searching for wanting.

42:27.600 --> 42:35.520
But there are others. So here is a wonderful story. Consider the difference between there is an X

42:35.520 --> 42:41.200
such that Ralph believes that X is a spy and Ralph believes that there is an X such that X is a spy.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.800
They're two very different states, right? They may be ambiguously phrased as Ralph believes that

42:46.800 --> 42:51.760
someone's a spy, but they may be unambiguously phrased respectively as there's someone who Ralph

42:51.760 --> 42:57.040
believes to be a spy, and Ralph believes there are spies. The difference is vast. If Ralph is like

42:57.040 --> 43:01.840
most of us, aid is true, that is to say, he does believe there are spies, but there's no particular

43:01.840 --> 43:10.160
person of whom he believes that that person is a spy. Well, here is the marvelous story.

43:11.200 --> 43:15.280
There's a certain man in a brown hat whom Ralph has glimpsed several times under questionable

43:15.280 --> 43:20.560
circumstances on which we need not enter here. Suffice it to say that Ralph suspects he's a spy.

43:20.560 --> 43:25.360
Also, there's a gray-haired man vaguely known as Ralph as rather a pillar of the community whom

43:25.360 --> 43:30.000
Ralph is not aware of having seen except once at the beach. Now, Ralph does not know it, but the

43:30.000 --> 43:35.440
men are one and the same. Can we say of this man, Bernard J. Orcutt, to give him a name,

43:36.000 --> 43:42.880
that Ralph believes him to be a spy? If so, we find ourselves accepting a conjunction of this type.

43:42.880 --> 43:49.120
W sincerely denies blah-blah-blah and yet believes that blah-blah-blah. With one and the same sentence

43:49.120 --> 43:53.920
in both of these planks, for Ralph is ready enough to say in all sincerity Bernard J. Orcutt

43:53.920 --> 43:58.160
is no spy. He's that upstanding member of the community, right? If on the other hand, with a

43:58.160 --> 44:03.840
view to disallowing these situations, we say Ralph believes the man in the brown hat is a spy,

44:03.840 --> 44:08.320
Ralph doesn't believe the man seen at the beach is a spy. But wait a minute, the man in the brown

44:08.320 --> 44:14.400
hat is the man at the beach. Now, what do we say about Ralph's beliefs? So here the problem is,

44:14.400 --> 44:22.080
well, in general about belief, but also specifically about this. Does Ralph have a belief for Ralph

44:22.080 --> 44:44.480
Bernard J? Well, here's Ralph. He believes the man in the brown hat is a spy, but Ralph doesn't believe

44:45.280 --> 45:02.880
that the man at the beach is a spy. In fact, he would outright deny it, but those two are identical,

45:03.680 --> 45:09.680
right? They're both Bernard J. Orcutt. So does Ralph believe that Orcutt is a spy or not?

45:10.400 --> 45:15.360
Well, under one description, the man in the brown hat, yes. Under the other description,

45:15.360 --> 45:21.680
the man at the beach, no. And so it's very tempting here to say that actually belief

45:21.680 --> 45:26.560
is not something you have about an object, it's something you have about an object under a certain

45:26.560 --> 45:36.560
description.
