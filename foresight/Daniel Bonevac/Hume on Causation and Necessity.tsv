0	12720	Hi. I want to talk today about David Hume on causation. It's one of Hume's most distinctive
12720	18600	and most surprising philosophical theses. Because when he follows out his method, it
18600	24040	turns out all sorts of things have to be committed to the flames as he puts it dramatically.
24040	28120	All sorts of things turn out either to be meaningless or to have a meaning that is not
28120	34360	at all what we thought. We trace them back to origins in experience. And sometimes we
34360	39240	find there is no origin in experience. This is made up out of thin air. It's bad news.
39240	43720	It's utterly meaningless. There is no content. Other times we find out, well, it does have
43720	48280	a content, but it's not what we thought. And that's what's going to happen with causation.
48280	52560	He's not going to say causation is meaningless, but he is going to say actually what's going
52560	55480	on within is very different from what you might have thought. You thought you were describing
55480	59920	a relation in the world. You're not. You're doing something else. So let's take a look
59920	66280	at how this goes. Hume is considering causal inferences. Sometimes we go from cause to
66280	74360	effect. So we say, aha, here is lightning. So expect thunder. Sometimes we go from the
74360	79560	effect of the cause as when we hear thunder and think there must have been lightning.
79560	83560	Sometimes it's going to be, let's say in a medical context where we see a symptom and
83560	89360	we say, aha, that's evidence that the underlying cause is this illness. Or sometimes we find
89360	93360	out that somebody's tested positive for an illness and we say, aha, here's what you
93360	98280	can expect. Here are the various symptoms you might start to exhibit. Well, we make inferences
98280	102720	then on the basis of causation, sometimes from cause to effect, sometimes from effect
102720	109360	to cause, sometimes from just observing regularities in the world to thinking there is a causation.
109360	115280	What justifies those kinds of inferences? Inferences from a causal relation to an effect
115280	122160	or a cause, inferences to a causal relation from various bits of evidence. Well, Hume
122160	127600	says it's actually tricky to understand this. Why? Well, first of all, the inference doesn't
127600	134360	seem to be something that rests on anything a priori. Why? Because we can imagine it otherwise.
134360	139320	I can imagine that this symptom has a different cause from the disease I thought. I can imagine
139680	144160	that that loud boom was not actually caused by lightning, but was, let's say, a sonic
144160	149320	boom produced by an airplane. I can go in the other direction and think, well, aha, a bit
149320	153920	of lightning. I'm going to hear thunder and then I don't hear it. Or it could turn out
153920	158120	that, okay, people with this disease generally exhibit these symptoms, so expect this to
158120	163120	happen and it doesn't happen. I'm free of that symptom. Yay. Good thing for me. But
163120	167280	it turns out that in short, that doesn't always happen and there's no necessity that
167280	172880	I can, in any case, easily imagine it happening otherwise. It certainly is the case that having
172880	177840	something tossed up in the air generally leads to it coming down, but of course that
177840	181600	could vary, that could change. I can imagine it just continuing to go up or just lingering
181600	189000	in the air. And similarly, normally, my hitting a ball with a pull cue will cause it to move,
189000	193120	but I can easily imagine that I hit it and it doesn't move for some reason. So I can
193120	198540	imagine it otherwise. There's no necessity to this idea of causal relations, at least
198540	204120	not the kind of necessity that means I can't imagine it otherwise.
204120	209680	So Hume puts it this way, the inference we draw from cause to effect is not derived merely
209680	214360	from a survey of these particular objects and from such a penetration into their essences
214360	218540	may discover the dependence of one upon the other. There's no object that implies the
218540	222600	existence of any other if we consider these objects to themselves and never look beyond
222600	226840	the ideas we form of them. Such an inference would amount to knowledge. It would imply
226840	231420	the absolute contradiction and impossibility of conceiving anything different. But as all
231420	236480	distinct ideas are separable, it's evident there can be no impossibility of that kind.
236480	240840	In other words, our knowledge of causation can't be our priori. I can't just reflect
240840	245160	on the nature of billiard balls and say that, oh, striking them will cause them to move.
245160	249880	I can't just reflect on the nature of thunder and realize it's caused by lightning. These
249880	254520	are not things that are part of the concept. It's really about the world.
254520	260280	And so we can imagine all sorts of wild things, right? We can imagine that seeing a statue
260280	265720	of David Hume in Edinburgh immediately makes people fall in love. It's like a love potion.
265720	272080	Well, I can imagine that. In fact, there is no such causal relation. I can imagine whenever
272080	276240	two people fall in love, a statue of David Hume appears. Of course, that doesn't happen
276240	280420	either. But in short, we can imagine anything. That doesn't tell us anything about causal
280420	285000	relations and whether they do or don't exist.
285000	290000	So we quite reasonably infer any causal inference is really a posteriori. It's something that
290000	296040	can only be discovered on the basis of experience. And indeed, Hume says, look, yeah, of course,
296040	300280	it's by experience only we can infer the existence of one object from that of another,
300280	305360	or the existence or currents of one event on the basis of another. However, he says,
305400	311080	here's the problem. When we think it's derived from experience, we start looking for the
311080	315960	origin of that idea and experience, and we don't find it. He says, actually, it can't
315960	322120	be a posteriori because we don't experience the causal link. You might think we do. I
322120	327680	see the lightning and then I hear the thunder or I strike the ball with a pull cue and
327680	333480	it does move. But he says, don't be misled. What are you seeing there? Are you seeing
333520	337320	the connection between the lightning and the thunder? Are you seeing the connection between
337320	344080	the motion of the cue and the motion of the ball? You're not seeing the connection. You're
344080	347400	just seeing the motion of one and the motion of the other. Or in the case of lightning,
347400	353360	you're seeing the flash and then you're hearing the thunder a little while later, you hope.
353360	358600	And you're just seeing one thing and then another. You're not seeing any link between
358640	365640	them. So, Hume says, let's think about the cause of motion, like the cause of motion of
365640	370600	cogs in a machine or of a billiard ball. He says, motion in one body is regarded upon
370600	375080	impulses the cause of motion in another, like the cue stick and the ball. When we consider
375080	379920	these objects with the utmost attention, we find only that one object approaches the
379920	384960	other, that the motion of it precedes that of the other, but without any sensible interval,
384960	389200	it is vain to rack ourselves with further thought and reflection upon this subject.
389200	394280	We can go no farther in considering this particular instance. So what do we get? We think about
394280	400240	this kind of motion. The cue stick moves. We see it move first. The ball is stationary.
400240	410240	Then there's contact. Then the ball moves. How did that happen? Okay. We see now, contiguity.
410240	415520	It was contact. So the cue stick did touch the ball. We see a succession. We see motion
415520	419840	of cue stick followed by motion of ball. But we don't see what links them. We don't see
419840	426000	the connection. We see the one move, then the other move. It starts when there's contact.
426000	431560	But what happens at that point of contact? Can we look in there? Let's say we get a magnifying
431560	436360	glass and I say, okay, you hit the ball now. I'm still not going to see the connection.
436360	442240	I will see one motion followed by another motion. That's it. So Hume says, when we look
442240	447160	about us toward external objects and consider the operation of causes, we're never able
447160	452400	in a single instance to discover any power or necessary connection. Any quality that
452400	456920	binds the effect to the cause and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other,
456920	462320	we never find such a thing. We never observe the causal relation. We don't see the connection.
462320	468160	We just see one thing followed by another. Franco Malley once said, life is just one
468160	472480	damn thing after another. And that's basically Hume's position. Life is just one damn thing
472480	477800	after another. And so we just get this followed by that. We start talking about causes, but
477800	482160	we never observe anything that is the origin of our idea of causal relations. At least
482160	486960	we don't observe it in the world. It's not there in watching the billiard balls, in watching
486960	492200	the lightning and hearing the thunder. We never see it. What do we find? We find constant
492200	497800	conjunction. We only find that one does actually follow the other. The impulse of one billiard
497800	502600	ball is attended with motion in the second. This is the hole that appears to the outward
502600	507240	senses. I see the motion of the cue stick, the motion of the cue ball, the motion of
507240	513160	another ball. That's all I perceive. I don't see anything beyond that constant conjunction.
513160	519680	This moves, that moves. I don't see the link. So upon the hole, Hume says, there appears
519680	525240	not throughout all nature any one instance of connection, which is conceivable by us.
525240	529720	All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another, but we can never
529720	536200	observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but never connected. The lightning, followed
536200	541520	by the thunder, keeps happening. But do we see the necessity? Do we see the connection?
541520	548000	No. This is a little joke based on this. Don't give me that constant conjunction. Doesn't
548120	553720	imply causal connection. It's yours. Well, anyway, there is a kind of infinite regress
553720	558960	argument lurking here. Hume says, when we infer effects from causes, we must establish the
558960	563600	existence of these causes, which we have only two ways of doing, either by an immediate
563600	568800	perception of our memory or senses, or by an inference from other causes. Which causes,
568800	572400	again, we've got to ascertain in the same manner, either by a present impression or
572400	577400	by an inference from their causes and so on, till we arrive at some object, which we see
577440	582480	or remember. It's impossible for us to carry on our inferences out in full item. The only
582480	586560	thing that can stop them is an impression of the memory or senses, beyond which there's
586560	591800	no room for doubt or inquiry. So we get a classic infinite regress argument here. We
591800	598560	infer some causes and effects in the world. Well, we can infer a causal relation only
598560	602280	from causal relations, unless we can actually find that connection in the world, which is
602280	608160	what we can't, he says. So we get a causal relation only from causal relations. But that
608160	613440	can't go on to infinity. Any inference to cause an effect must start with an impression,
613440	620200	a perception of something. Okay, causal relations can't just lead us around within that circle.
620200	626520	In the end, we can't go on to infinity. It's got to be from something outside that circle,
626520	631840	something that rests on an impression, an experience, a perception of something. But
631880	636120	now we don't find the connection in the world. We just find one thing followed by another.
636120	642720	So how is that going to work? The transition from an impression present to the memory or
642720	648160	senses, the uneven object, which we call causal effect, is founded on past experience and our
648160	653480	remembrance of their constant conjunction. We just have the constant conjunction, the contiguity,
653480	659840	the succession. That is to say, we have the conjunction of this motion, that motion, or that
659880	666640	flash, that boom. And that leads us to draw a causal conclusion. But now Hume says,
666640	673040	that's weird because I can't find the perception. I don't see us seeing the link. And so he says,
673040	677680	this whole inference, admittedly, we do that. We see the constant conjunction. We move to a
677680	685520	causal conclusion. But is that based on reason? Or is it based on something else? He says,
685520	690720	if reason determined, it perceived upon the principle that instances of which we've had no
690720	695040	experience must resemble those of which we've had experience, and that the course of nature
695040	700480	continues always uniformly the same. Well, we'd have to have rational grounds for that principle.
701040	707840	But where could we get that? Ah, he says, there's nowhere to get it. There can be no demonstrative
707840	712240	arguments to prove that those instances that we haven't experienced resemble those of which
712240	717360	we have had experience. We can imagine a change in the course of nature, which sufficiently proves
717360	722880	that such a change isn't absolutely impossible. To form a clear idea of anything is an undeniable
722880	728240	argument for its possibility. So I can conceive of a future that's radically different from the past.
728240	732320	And when I conceive of that, you might say it's the job of science fiction writers to do that.
733040	737600	Well, I'm imagining just the kind of change. So there can't be any rational,
737600	742400	demonstrative, deductive argument for the claim that the future will resemble the past.
744320	748800	Well, is there a probabilistic argument? Well, in general, the past has resembled what came
748800	754080	before it. So I guess it's okay to assume that our future is going to resemble our past. But wait,
754080	758320	what you're saying is there was a regularity in the past that the future would resemble the past?
758960	763840	Huh, I can't say the future is likely to resemble the past because it always has in the past. And
763840	769040	so it's going to in the future. That just looks like a circular argument. And so that won't work
769040	774480	either. It can't be a deductive argument. It can't be an inductive argument based on past experience.
774480	780640	We can't have any argument for it at all. So, Hume says, we've got to seek something outside reason.
781200	787680	Here's how we find it. He says, think about a single case. Okay, one case of that cause leading
787680	794160	to that effect. One flash of lightning leading to thunder. Do we infer cause and effect from that?
795120	799680	No. Right? The first time a child experiences a thunderstorm and sees a flash of lightning
799680	804960	and hears thunder, they don't immediately say, aha, lightning caused thunder. Nobody's going to
804960	810640	guess that from a single case. And so Hume says, we don't get this sort of conclusion at all from
810640	817760	one case. But we can get it from multiple cases. If we observe several instances where the same
817760	822320	things are always conjoined together, we conceive a connection between them and begin to draw an
822320	828240	inference from one to the other. It's that multiplicity of resembling instances that constitute
828240	833760	the very essence of power and connection. And it's the source where the idea of it arises.
834320	839520	That's where we get this. Something about the repetition of cases gives us this idea from
839520	845840	which we get the concepts of power, of connection, of causation. But he says, wait a minute.
846640	852320	I don't get it. Repetition can't give us any new idea, can it? I mean, it just is a perfectly
852320	856480	similar instances. We don't get the idea from one. We're not going to get it from a bunch of them.
857120	862640	And so that doesn't make any sense. All our ideas are copied from impressions. We get the same
862640	866320	impressions of the external world. It's just the same thing again and again.
867040	871440	No new impressions are happening. No new ideas are happening. So look,
872560	875840	it can't be found in one of these. It's not going to be found in multiple.
877280	882240	So what's the source? We might expect him at this point to conclude there is no source.
883760	888800	But that's not where he goes. He says something new does happen. The repetition does something.
888800	893840	But what does it do? It affects me. It forms a new impression, not a new impression of the world.
893840	897360	It's not that I suddenly see something in the lightning or the thunder or the motions of
897360	902720	the billiard balls that I didn't see before. It's instead that I get a feeling of expectation.
903280	909120	I see it enough times that I see the flash of lightning. I expect the thunder. I hit the ball.
909120	913920	I expect the ball to move. And I expect it to contact and hit other balls and make them move.
914720	921040	So I feel a determination of the mind to pass from one thing to another. That's all the changes.
921040	926880	My feeling, my feeling of expectation. From one instance, I can infer nothing causal at all.
926880	932400	From repeated instances, we infer the causal link, but nothing in the world changes.
932400	937520	What does our feeling of expectation? There is a new impression, but it's not a new impression of
937520	942320	anything going on in the world. It's a new impression in us. It is a purely internal impression.
942880	949600	So the origin of our idea of causation is this constant conjunction of events leading to a
949600	955760	feeling of expectation, an internal impression in us. And that gives us the ideas of causation
955760	961440	and necessity. But notice, the source is in us. It's not in the world. Necessity is the effect
961440	967040	of this observation and nothing but an internal impression of the mind. The necessity is something
967040	976240	that exists in the mind, not in objects. So the source of necessity of causation is not in the
976240	983200	world. Those ideas come from something in us. It exists in the mind, not in objects. We project
983200	988880	that regularity onto the world. The mind, he says, has a great propensity to spread itself on external
988880	994400	objects. And that's what we're doing when we talk about necessity or causation. We're projecting
994400	1000400	that onto the world. We can't find sources for certain of these ideas in the world, but we do
1000400	1006320	find the source in experience. It's just not in the world. It's in us. The source is an internal
1006320	1011360	impression. And it's going to turn out that that's true of lots of ideas, not just causation and
1011360	1019120	necessity, but substance, matter, the self, identity, morality. The source of all of those is going to
1019120	1026240	be internal and we project them onto the world. So he says in the end, it is feeling. It is this
1026240	1030080	internal feeling that leads to belief in all of those things.
