1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Well, today we're going to be talking about Karnab's paper,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,700
empiricism, semantics, and ontology.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,920
Some people consider this the last gasp of logical empiricism.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,300
Even its opponents tend to treat it as an extremely important paper,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,160
and there is a fundamental distinction that it introduces that has become part of,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
you might say, common currency philosophically.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,480
And so it's a useful thing to be exposed to and to think through,

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,480
even if in the end you think Karnab is wrong.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,080
Now, there are a lot of people, on the other hand,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,880
who think Karnab is actually getting at something deep and important here.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,380
And there is a philosophical strategy that emerges in this paper

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,180
that I think is really important independently of the way that he in particular replies it.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,080
One way of putting it is this.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,980
Suppose we're interested in a certain concept or set of concepts,

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,380
and we're trying to analyze what that's all about philosophically.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,280
Karnab's point, in a way, is just that we should approach it in the following fashion.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Think about language, which did not have that set of terms

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,380
or the ability to express those concepts.

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,980
And think what would have to be added to give that language the ability

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,580
to include those terms or express those concepts.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,680
And so the way of thinking about it isn't exactly analysis

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,780
in the more traditional sense in which the early writers in this tradition,

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,980
like Bertrand Russell or G. E. Moore or even Wittgenstein,

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,380
were thinking instead it's something like,

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,980
think about what would be like not to speak a language,

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,480
in which we could talk about propositions, for example,

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,580
or in which we could talk about mental entities,

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,680
or in which we could discuss abstract entities

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,280
and think what resources would we have to add to that language to be able to do that.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,980
So he's not approaching this from the point of view of X is a number,

31
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,880
if and only if we translate that into something else.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
He's instead saying, imagine a language where we have no way of expressing numbers.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,080
What would we have to add to the language in order to be able to express numbers?

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,780
Now you might say, well, numbers, okay?

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,780
And so you might think this has a very dumb sort of answer to it.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,980
And so to make it interesting, you could say, well, what's the smallest set

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,180
or what are the smallest sets of resources we could add

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,580
that would actually allow us to accomplish this?

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,880
Also, another way of thinking about this is to say, well, yes, in some sense,

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,780
obviously, we could just add and talk about numbers.

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,080
But what we're interested in, in a sense, is what kind of move is made

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
when we make that transition?

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,580
If you make the jump to number, what exactly are you doing?

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,380
And sometimes it surprises how little has to be added.

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,980
So we've been discussing this idea of frameworks.

46
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,880
And this is the paper which really starts thinking about things in terms of frameworks,

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,580
a framework in which we can discuss propositions, for example, or mental states,

48
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,980
or numbers, or other abstract objects such as properties and relations.

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,080
And we think, what does it take to add such a framework?

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Cardapp starts out with a pretty bold claim.

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
He says, here's what it takes.

52
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,680
It takes something that is a term that talks about the things of this general category.

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:30,880
So if we say, you know, yeah, actually, let me write down what I was saying just a moment ago.

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Think about a language or a framework if you want to keep it more general,

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:51,580
in which we can't discuss x, whatever that is, and then ask the question,

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:04:09,780
what would we have to add to have that capacity to obtain the ability to discuss things of this kind?

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,080
And his answer is twofold.

58
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,980
He basically says, first of all, we would have to add some term that covers things of the relevant kind.

59
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:28,580
So a term like, for example, proposition, or property, or number, or whatever.

60
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,280
So just a term covering the general category.

61
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,480
Because after all, if we can't do this, presumably we can't actually.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,780
We don't already have such a term and we're going to need one.

63
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,180
But then what else?

64
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,280
Well, this is the surprising part.

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:50,180
We just have to add variables for such things.

66
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,380
Or propositions for properties, for relations, for numbers, for mental states, or something like that.

67
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,680
And that's really all we have to do.

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,780
So it turns out that introducing a framework for discussing a kind of entity, he says,

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,580
is actually a pretty simple thing.

70
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,780
Okay, just introduce a term and some variables for that kind of thing.

71
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,880
Now let's start with something dumb.

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,480
We don't tend to talk about witches anymore.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,680
But suppose we were to start doing that again.

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,380
And said, okay, what would it take to introduce into our current framework a framework where there are witches?

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,880
Or maybe if that's, since that used to be, maybe a better example would be something from the Harry Potter world.

76
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,280
Okay, where it's really just, what's something that's distinctive to Harry Potter?

77
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,780
Muggles?

78
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,280
Well, yeah, but you and I are muggles.

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,780
I mean, muggles is just sort of an ordinary person, right?

80
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,680
So that's easy to translate.

81
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,080
But, de-mentors, right?

82
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,480
Okay, there isn't just sort of this old view about de-mentors.

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,780
It's like that's specifically introduced by J.K. Rowling.

84
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:02,080
So, okay, we might be puzzled about how to actually do an analysis of de-mentor.

85
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,280
If we're thinking in terms of reducing that to something else, X is a de-mentor if and only if, what?

86
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,380
You might say, yeah, I don't know how to do it that way.

87
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,480
But what is it to introduce into a conceptual framework this concept, this ability to talk about de-mentors?

88
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,080
Well, you need the term de-mentor and variables that will include de-mentors.

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,980
The end, okay?

90
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,580
They might be, oh, wait a minute, that's all?

91
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,780
I mean, that's kind of trivial.

92
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:32,280
That's sort of, gosh, what do I need to talk about?

93
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,580
X, oh, the term X, right?

94
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,880
And some things that it could apply to, some variables that it could apply to.

95
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,380
But actually, the analysis is more interesting than that.

96
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:48,780
So let's see how it goes with respect to propositions, for example.

97
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,480
What does it take to introduce the framework of propositions?

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,180
Now, we get back up, and before we really get to this, think, what is a proposition supposed to be?

99
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,880
Philosophers have talked about propositions or something like that, ever since ancient times.

100
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,580
But now, what is a proposition exactly?

101
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,280
So suppose we started, we'll start in a traditional form.

102
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,080
We'll think, let's do an analysis of the kind of Russell, or Moore might have had in mind.

103
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,580
What is a proposition?

104
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,680
What's the relationship between a sentence and a proposition?

105
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,180
Something a sentence signifies.

106
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,280
Good, it's something a sentence signifies or expresses, right?

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:44,380
So one thing we can say is, okay, sentences express or signify propositions.

108
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Okay, what else is true propositions as traditionally conceived?

109
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
They have a truth value.

110
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,880
They have a truth value, yeah.

111
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:08,880
So they bear truth values, and what else?

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:20,480
It's really a third thing that I think is part of the traditional conception.

113
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,680
Well, you can have attitudes with respect to them, right?

114
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,780
You can believe them, you can know them, you can doubt them.

115
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,180
You can wonder whether they're true.

116
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,080
You can, gosh, maybe you can fear them.

117
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,080
I fear that it will continue raining, and I didn't bring my umbrella.

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,580
Or you can have other kinds of attitudes, presumably, totally.

119
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,080
So they are objects of attitudes.

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,580
Now, you might think, look, there is nothing that actually has all three of those properties.

121
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,880
And so some people doubt that there are propositions.

122
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,780
Just because they think actually those are three different functions,

123
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,380
why should I be sure that any one person fulfills all those functions?

124
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,080
You might think, gosh, I would like to have somebody landscape my yard,

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,080
and fix my plumbing, and install some lights.

126
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,780
Okay, so I need a landscaper, plumber, or electrician, right?

127
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,980
I'm looking for somebody who fulfills all three of those.

128
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,780
And it might be that nobody does that.

129
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,880
You've got to have three different people doing those three different tasks.

130
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
So it's a nontrivial philosophical assumption underlying this,

131
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,180
that there is one kind of entity that does those three things.

132
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,080
But let's put that aside for a moment.

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,180
That's sort of how to think about this from a traditional point of view.

134
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,480
Now, from Karnab's point of view, how do we think about it?

135
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,280
Well, we think what is actually required to introduce this framework of propositions?

136
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,380
Imagine that we have a language where we don't discuss them at all.

137
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,080
Maybe we talk about sentences, maybe we just say things about the world.

138
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,480
And then we introduce this idea of propositions.

139
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
And so here's one way to introduce it, say, here's what a proposition is.

140
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,280
But another way would simply be to introduce this linguistic frame.

141
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,080
And so, what does he say about this?

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Well, if we want to talk about propositions,

143
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,980
what we do is, let's see, where does it start?

144
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,880
Okay, we introduce the general term proposition.

145
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,280
So we need a term.

146
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,980
In this case, it is indeed just proposition.

147
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,480
And then what?

148
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,180
Well, we have to have a style of variables.

149
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:57,380
And so, we'll introduce something like, he is a proposition.

150
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,780
So we have a certain style of variable here, makes that possible.

151
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,380
But now, actually, there's one more thing.

152
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,780
He says, the general term proposition is introduced.

153
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,880
P is a proposition maybe defined.

154
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,080
So the third thing that we actually add is something like a definition.

155
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,680
But it's a definition of a surprising con.

156
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,880
It doesn't look very much like that sort of definition.

157
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Instead, he says, we do it in the following way.

158
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,280
We say P is a proposition, maybe defined by P or not P.

159
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,380
And so here's how that ends up going.

160
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:48,280
P is a proposition, it's just defined as P or not P.

161
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,480
And that enables us to introduce the framework of propositions.

162
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,080
Now, there's something important about this.

163
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,480
Because what happens here is we get something, he says, that notice is analytic.

164
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,180
It's analytic whether P or not P.

165
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,480
Chicago is large or Chicago is not large?

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,680
Yeah, that seems like a logical truth.

167
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,480
So that Chicago is large is a proposition.

168
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,780
We have to cheat there a little bit.

169
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,880
Notice I have to introduce the word that and say that Chicago is large is a proposition.

170
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,380
But I substitute other things for P that are inappropriate for the variable and

171
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,780
hope we're count like Fred or not Fred.

172
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,480
That doesn't make any sense.

173
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Molecule or not molecule, that doesn't make any sense.

174
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Between or not between, that doesn't make any sense.

175
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,180
So I have to have the right kind of thing going in here.

176
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,780
It has to be a sentence, for example.

177
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,880
But his point is this, if I've got sentences in my language,

178
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,480
then it actually doesn't take much to introduce talk of propositions.

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,580
All I have to do is have a term proposition, some variables that can range over propositions

180
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,080
and then introduce a way of making sense of that.

181
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,480
So with the dementor example, I would introduce the term dementor,

182
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,980
have a variable for that, let's say D is a dementor.

183
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,780
But then I do have to actually give some kind of characterization of it.

184
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,580
But notice in this case, it's not this kind of definition.

185
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,180
It's something that has a sort of surprising feature.

186
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,580
What happens is that I take something that wasn't functioning as a singular term,

187
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,180
I turn it into one.

188
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,580
So here, the thought is supposed to be a little bit different.

189
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,380
I am actually taking predicates that I can make sense of,

190
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,180
and then using those to characterize what a proposition is.

191
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,680
Here, I'm actually just taking something of a different grammatical category

192
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,980
and allowing it to play a new role.

193
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,880
So Chicago is large, or Chicago is not large.

194
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,980
But then, well, in English, we signify that by putting it over that.

195
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,380
That Chicago is large is a proposition.

196
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,880
I've taken something that was functioning just as a sentence,

197
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,580
and I've turned it into something that can function as a singular term,

198
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,680
referring to an object, in this case a proposition.

199
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Okay, so if that's the general strategy, then what kind of thing can we do with other sorts of terms?

200
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,680
So let's think about properties.

201
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,280
Are there such things as properties in the world?

202
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,080
Think about this in a big platonic sense.

203
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,180
Are there such things as forms?

204
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Plato says, you and I are really just shadows of the form of personhood.

205
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:50,180
And these desks are really just shadows of the form of deskhood.

206
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,880
Well, that feels really dense.

207
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,680
But some of these things, you sort of think, okay, that's sort of the overall picture.

208
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,180
Now, whether you think that shadow business works or not, you could think,

209
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:09,480
well, look, we do talk about properties such as, well, being a desk or being a personhood.

210
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,180
There's a big debate about personhood and what that is and what it covers in ethics, for example.

211
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,880
But we can talk about properties in all sorts of other ways.

212
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,880
We can worry about triangularity or justice.

213
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,780
And so those are things that seem to be, well, talk about properties of various kinds.

214
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Now, what does it take to introduce talk of properties?

215
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,780
Well, from this point of view, it's not so surprising.

216
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,180
First of all, we introduce the general term property.

217
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,180
So we have a way of talking about these things.

218
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,680
Secondly, we introduce a new style of variable.

219
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,380
So let's let that be, I don't know, maybe capital P to be a style of variable that we'll use for properties.

220
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,680
And then we have to say something about what a property is.

221
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,580
So we define P is a property to be the same as, now what?

222
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,580
The whole point of this strategy is not then to give a sort of definition in the standard way,

223
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:19,580
but instead to take P and use it in a different grammatical role where it's not a singular term.

224
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,080
So how could we do that?

225
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,580
P is a set.

226
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,080
Well, we could do it that way.

227
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,080
We could think, ah, let's represent P as a set of objects that have the property, for example.

228
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,080
And that's a very Vercelian or even Freyian way of thinking about this.

229
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,080
But actually, Carnap has in mind something different,

230
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,580
because that's a way of taking an object that we've already constructed and identifying with this.

231
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,580
And notice what Carnap did here.

232
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,580
He didn't construct an object and say that object is a proposition.

233
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,080
He just said P is a proposition if and only if P or not P.

234
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
He didn't build up an object.

235
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Instead, now, later, by the way, people think of propositions in different ways,

236
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
for example, as sets of possible worlds.

237
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,580
So they're using your strategy of building up an object and saying let's call that a proposition.

238
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,080
That's not what he's doing.

239
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:25,080
He's really just taking something and allowing you to use things as singular terms without building an object.

240
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,080
And so you might say there's this traditional strategy of construction

241
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,080
that he was concerned with early in the logical structure of the world

242
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
that Russell was pursuing a logical atomism.

243
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,580
Notice this is not constructed.

244
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,080
He's not actually constructing an object and saying,

245
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,080
aha, now we have something that can play the role of a proposition or a property or something like that.

246
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Instead, he's just sort of, well, pulling what feels like a logical trick.

247
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Allowing you to use something as a singular term but wasn't used as a singular term.

248
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
So one way to do this would be to construct a set, something of that sort,

249
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
but his strategy in this paper is different.

250
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,080
The earlier Carnap would have done just what you're saying.

251
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,080
But Carnap at this stage says, actually, there's a different way of doing it.

252
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Now, think about a property like justice.

253
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Okay?

254
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Justice is a property if and only if.

255
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,080
And now, what do we want to, what do we have in our language already

256
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
that isn't an abstract term like justice?

257
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,080
But nevertheless, it might apply to individual objects or individual events, influences or actions.

258
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,080
You could say, he's a property if an object has or doesn't have it.

259
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Yeah, it has or doesn't have it.

260
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
But that's already to use it as a singular term.

261
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,080
So to say that an action has justice, for example.

262
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
What's a simpler way of saying that?

263
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
An act is just.

264
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
It's just, exactly.

265
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,080
So, if px or not px.

266
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Okay?

267
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
So justice is a property if and only if.

268
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, for any x, x is just or x is not just.

269
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Triadularity is a property if and only if.

270
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Well, x is triadular or x is not triadular.

271
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Notice what happens here.

272
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,080
There we had that sort of acting as the thing in English

273
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
that signals a singular term.

274
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Here what happens?

275
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Well, we have something that signals this.

276
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:38,080
It's like turning triangle into triadularity or just into justice or kind into kindness, et cetera, et cetera.

277
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,080
There are all these ways of putting on a suffix that turns something into an abstract term.

278
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,080
And that's an indication that we've done this and we're now using this as a singular term.

279
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
But he says, don't think that singular term has to refer to something.

280
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Instead, just think, well, we're building it up from a predicate.

281
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,080
And we're doing it by adding this and allowing it to play the role of a singular term.

282
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,080
But nothing philosophically huge is going on there.

283
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Now, there are two ways of taking this.

284
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:17,080
One way of taking Carnap's general strategy here is to say he's a nominalist and he's giving you the key to nominalism.

285
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:25,080
He's saying you can talk about justice or triangularity or propositions without committing yourself to abstract objects.

286
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,080
You can think everything in the world is just a particular thing.

287
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
That is triangular is not triangular.

288
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
That is just or is not just.

289
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
That is true or not true or something like that.

290
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,080
And then add this abstract language without really any ontological commitments.

291
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,080
And a lot of people have interpreted Carnap that way.

292
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:53,080
But actually, Carnap himself seems to say, what I'm doing is showing that this question of nominalism is actually not a very interesting question.

293
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,080
So he doesn't see himself, I think, as pursuing a strategy of nominalism here.

294
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:06,080
But instead of saying the whole traditional debate about realism, conceptualism, nominalism, and so on,

295
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,080
is based on the idea that there's a real metaphysical question here.

296
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
And there isn't.

297
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Why?

298
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
What are we doing?

299
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
We're introducing a framework like this.

300
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
And now we can distinguish two kinds of questions.

301
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:26,080
There are internal questions, questions that are internal to a framework.

302
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Like, let's say within the framework of propositions, we ask, are there propositions?

303
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Well, within this framework, what's the answer to that question?

304
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Sure.

305
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Right?

306
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Are there propositions?

307
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Well, all that means is, yeah, is there a P such that P is a proposition?

308
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,080
So is there a P such that P are not P?

309
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,080
Is there a sentence such that it's true or not true?

310
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Yeah, sure.

311
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:09,080
And so the answer is always a sort of trivial yes or no.

312
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I mean, if the framework is not one that includes that.

313
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Maybe.

314
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080
But normally it's just a trivial yes.

315
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Of course.

316
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,080
If you ask the person teaching you, let's say you're in first grade,

317
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
the teacher is teaching you some basic arithmetic.

318
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
You're counting, right?

319
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,080
One, two, three, four.

320
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,080
And then you can complicate things like one plus one is two.

321
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,080
And you say, I have a question, Ms. Walters.

322
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Are there really numbers?

323
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,080
What's Ms. Walters going to say?

324
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Sure.

325
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Sure.

326
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Yeah, like one is a number, right?

327
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Two is a number.

328
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,080
So sure there are numbers like one, two, three.

329
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,080
And it's a kind of trivial question, right?

330
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,080
If you say, are there even numbers that are greater than 100?

331
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
She's going to say sure, like 102, 104, et cetera, right?

332
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
If you say, are there any numbers at all?

333
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Sure.

334
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
One, two, three.

335
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
It's a trivial question.

336
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Are there any propositions?

337
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Sure.

338
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
The one plus one is two.

339
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
The Chicago is large, right?

340
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
I'm now speaking to you.

341
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
And so within the framework, this is very simple.

342
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Are there propositions?

343
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Well, sure.

344
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Similarly, are there properties within the framework of properties?

345
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Sure.

346
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Yes.

347
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,080
And notice that in this case, it's just the analytic pieces that that's true.

348
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
It's just the analytic that there are properties.

349
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
It is analytic that there are propositions.

350
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Why?

351
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Because it's analytic that p or not p.

352
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,080
It's analytic that px or not px.

353
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,080
And so within the framework, these are utterly trivial questions.

354
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,080
But now suppose we're not in the framework.

355
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Suppose we say, yeah, but look, I'm not asking that kind of question.

356
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Right?

357
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Ms. Walters says, of course there are numbers.

358
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
One, two, three.

359
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
And you say, no, no, no.

360
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,080
I'm asking a deeper question.

361
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Numbers are abstract objects.

362
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
I want to know if there are abstract objects.

363
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Ms. Walters, what's your position on the realist, conceptualist, novelist debate?

364
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,080
And then I think Ms. Walters sends you to the principal.

365
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,080
But it could be that she said, well, you're, oh, you want to ask a deeper question.

366
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Well, there is a deeper question here.

367
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Right?

368
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
And that is the external question.

369
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,080
But it's not really the metaphysical question either.

370
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,080
The external question is just should be.

371
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Adopt that framework.

372
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,080
The framework of propositions, the framework of properties, the framework of work of numbers.

373
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,080
And so from that point of view, the right way to answer this deeper question the first

374
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,080
framework has is to say, well, sure, there's numbers like one, two, three, and four.

375
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,080
And if you're asking why we should do arithmetic at all, why we should accept any of that,

376
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
the question is because arithmetic is really useful.

377
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:23,080
It's important that we actually be able to count things, that we be able to add numbers together

378
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
and do other kinds of things.

379
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,080
And in short, what Ms. Walters has to do is defend the utility of arithmetic.

380
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
But notice that when she's doing that, she's not giving some metaphysical argument.

381
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,080
She's just saying, look, pragmatically, it's really useful to introduce this framework of numbers

382
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
and talk about numbers.

383
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
So this sort of question ends up being analytic and trivial.

384
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
This sort of question is just pragmatic.

385
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,080
It's just a matter of thinking, well, is it worth adopting that framework?

386
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
It has advantages.

387
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
It has some disadvantages.

388
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Right?

389
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,080
As the first grader is learning arithmetic, you may be painfully aware of the disadvantages

390
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
of introducing this framework.

391
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,080
You have to learn all this stuff and count stuff and learn the rules of addition and multiplication

392
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
and back, back, back, back, back.

393
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Right?

394
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,080
And so there can be all sorts of pragmatic arguments forward against us to reframe them.

395
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,080
For example, introducing this framework of propositions.

396
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,080
What are some advantages of introducing this framework of propositions?

397
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
The external question here isn't the simple one.

398
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Are there propositions?

399
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh, of course.

400
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Chicago is large or not large.

401
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,080
So Chicago is large is the proposition.

402
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,080
It's instead to say, what's the value of introducing that talk of propositions?

403
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
And now we can think about positive and negative consequences.

404
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,080
So what are some positive things that happen if we introduce this framework of propositions?

405
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Why do people talk about propositions and not just talk about sentences?

406
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
After all, that's Chicago is large.

407
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,080
It's different from just, quote, Chicago is large.

408
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,080
What's the advantage of moving from that to talk of propositions?

409
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Convenience in language.

410
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
It's just easier.

411
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Okay, it is easier.

412
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Now, why is it easier?

413
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Why does it let us do easily that otherwise would become hard to do?

414
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Evaluate the truth of something.

415
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Evaluate the truth.

416
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Well, let's see.

417
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
I say Chicago is large.

418
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
And you think, I don't know how to think about that.

419
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,080
But if I think, is it true that Chicago is large?

420
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Oh, no, I see.

421
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,080
And how do you know you're actually talking about what we connotate Chicago as currently?

422
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Or you know it's not really meant to denote something else?

423
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Well, there, yeah.

424
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
Okay, good.

425
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
That's an interesting point.

426
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Because when I talk about the sentence Chicago is large, I'm just talking about a set of

427
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
marks, right?

428
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Or maybe a type of mark or a type of, I mean, it's actually kind of complicated to figure

429
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
it out because it can be written down, it can be spoken, et cetera.

430
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
But it's a syntactic object of some kind, or maybe a phonological object of some kind

431
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
or some combination of those.

432
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
But as soon as I say that Chicago is large, you do get the sense that now I'm talking

433
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
about this as interpreted, right?

434
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,080
And now the referent of Chicago seems relevant and the referent of large.

435
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
So you're right.

436
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Both of those are actually vague.

437
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Chicago, do you mean the city boundaries?

438
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Or do you mean the metropolitan area?

439
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Do you mean in population?

440
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Do you mean in geographical area?

441
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,080
What Chicago denotes there may seem vague.

442
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,080
But also large, they can seem vague.

443
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,080
It's actually not only between geographically large and large in population, but there's

444
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
a lot of vagueness to large, right?

445
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Is Austin a large city?

446
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
I don't know.

447
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
It's kind of large.

448
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Actually, this was a better example 20 years ago.

449
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Then it was kind of large.

450
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Now it sort of just is large.

451
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
It's used in a large city.

452
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
It's used well.

453
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
It's used in a large city.

454
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,080
There I think you can just say, yeah, sure.

455
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,080
But what are some cities that might be on the borderline of this?

456
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Where you say it's that large and you say, oh, I don't know.

457
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Kind of sort of Perth.

458
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Perth Australian?

459
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Perth, maybe.

460
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
I don't.

461
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Good.

462
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Take a obscure city that I don't know about.

463
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Sorry for those Australian viewers.

464
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
But yeah, I don't know much about Perth Australia.

465
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
You might be right.

466
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
It's a small city.

467
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Yeah.

468
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,080
I mean, there are some cities where very clearly we say no.

469
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
It's not large, right?

470
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I say, oh gosh, what's?

471
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Salt Flat, Texas.

472
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Population 10 is a large city.

473
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
No, it is really not.

474
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
It's not a city then.

475
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
It's not really a city at all.

476
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
That's true.

477
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
City is vague in addition to this vagueness of large.

478
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
So what counts as a city?

479
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,080
You might think, yeah, in fact, in that sense, what is a city but a large population center?

480
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,080
And so you might, somebody might say it's just analytic that cities are large.

481
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Because otherwise, we wouldn't call them cities.

482
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,080
But presumably, there can be small cities like Akron, Ohio, maybe, or maybe like Perth,

483
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Australia, or gosh, Sioux City, Iowa, or something like that.

484
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Where you say, look, it's a city.

485
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
It's called Sioux City.

486
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
So it's got to be a city.

487
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
But it's a small city.

488
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Yeah.

489
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Large probably means like large if it's tight, right?

490
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
And you say, good.

491
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
It does mean large for a city, right?

492
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,080
So yeah, city is sort of already large for a population center.

493
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
But then a large city is large for a city.

494
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
So it's large for a large population center.

495
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Yeah, exactly.

496
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
So there are really two senses of large there.

497
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,080
Now, notice that if we're just talking about the sentence, Chicago is large.

498
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
We don't necessarily have to get into this.

499
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,080
But the moment we talk about propositions, you might think all of this becomes relevant.

500
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
What proposition are you expressing?

501
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
You say Chicago is large.

502
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
And now we can say, what do you mean?

503
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,080
If I just say, ah, consider the sentence, single quote, Chicago is large.

504
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
You could think, OK, that's clear.

505
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
I know what you're saying.

506
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Right?

507
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,080
To say what that expresses, that's where all this vagueness and ambiguity, et cetera, come in.

508
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:10,080
So one thing we could think happens here is we've now got something that has real semantic input.

509
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Now, the sentence has a semantics, too.

510
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
We could interpret it.

511
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,080
You might think an act of interpretation has already gone on when we moved to the proposition.

512
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,080
Now, something like Chicago is large shows us this because there are these levels of ambiguity introduced.

513
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Another classic case of this, which shows utility, is something that involves a pronoun.

514
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,080
I say, I wonder whether it's raining.

515
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,080
And you think, Dan wonders whether it's raining.

516
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
And there's a sense in which we're both expressing the same proposition.

517
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Those are two different sentences.

518
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I've said, I wonder whether it's raining.

519
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,080
You've said, he wonders whether it's raining, or Dan wonders whether it's raining.

520
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,080
And yet we want to say all of those express the same proposition.

521
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Now, what are some other advantages besides getting away from the difficulty of the I, in that sense?

522
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,080
By the way, some people have argued that the traditional concept of omniscience attributed to God is incoherent,

523
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,080
because I can know that I am wondering whether it's raining, but God can't know that I am wondering.

524
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,080
God knows that Pan-Bonevac is wondering, let's say, if God knows everything.

525
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,080
But God can't know it in this day-say, personal way that I do.

526
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Now, yeah, I think this is a laughable objection.

527
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,080
But one way of arguing that it's a laughable objection is to say, well, to say that God is omniscient

528
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
means God knows all the propositions.

529
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,080
It doesn't mean God knows I am hungry when I am hungry, I consider.

530
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
So, yeah, it seems so.

531
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,080
But introducing the term proposition can be a way of seeing why that's a silly objection.

532
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,080
By the way, people have actually talked about this at the American Philosophical Association meetings,

533
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,080
which is why, if you ever think, whoa, I bet that is a forum for deep and wise thinking.

534
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,080
It's not always true.

535
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,080
In fact, most of the time not true.

536
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Now, so it gives us that advantage.

537
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
What are some other advantages?

538
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,080
It allows us to abstract away, in other words, from indexicals and illustratives like this and that

539
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,080
and other things that introduce a kind of context dependence.

540
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,080
And so it allows us to talk about what's being said or what's being thought

541
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,080
without being tied to a specific context, and that can be really useful.

542
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Are there other things that are like that, taking it out of a context?

543
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Suppose we speak different languages.

544
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,080
And so I say, that is red.

545
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,080
And a German speaker says, das ist gut.

546
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
We're expressing the same proposition, right?

547
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,080
And yet using two very different sentences in different languages to express the same proposition.

548
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
You might say, gosh, we're thinking the same thing, we're saying the same thing,

549
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,080
even though we're speaking different languages.

550
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,080
Can you see other advantages of talking about propositions?

551
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Actually, that's a big one when you think about objects of attitudes.

552
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Because suppose the German speaker has that belief that would be expressed by that sentence.

553
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
And I have the belief expressed by the sentence in English.

554
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,080
Are we believing the same thing or different things?

555
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,080
If we're talking about propositions as objects of belief, we can say we're believing the same thing.

556
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
And we can easily express that using this language of propositions.

557
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
In sentences, what would we have to do?

558
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,080
We'd have to say, well, the German speaker has a relation to that sentence.

559
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,080
And I have a relation to this sentence.

560
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,080
And then those sentences are inter-translatable or mean the same thing or something.

561
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:51,080
So maybe we could say that, but it's a lot more complicated to say.

562
00:34:51,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Are there other advantages to introducing an abstract term like proposition?

563
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Well, let's turn it around and ask the other question.

564
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Are there disadvantages?

565
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,080
What would be an argument pragmatic against introducing talk of propositions

566
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,080
or properties or other abstractions like this?

567
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I mean, it kind of just sets sentences into either being true or false.

568
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,080
So I feel like that kind of takes away from what a sentence could actually mean.

569
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Oh, well, all right, yes, it does abstract away from the details of the individual sentence.

570
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:39,080
And at times that can be an advantage, but at times you might be losing information that matters.

571
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,080
For example, I ask whether John believes that the morning star is the evening star.

572
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,080
And you happen to know that those actually refer to the same object.

573
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Now, is that proposition the same as the morning star is the morning star?

574
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Ask John, is the morning star the morning star?

575
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Sure.

576
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Is the morning star the evening star?

577
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Ooh, I don't know.

578
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,080
And so now we might say, in this case, it matters what sentence is being used.

579
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,080
But depending on our view of propositions, we couldn't upsay it,

580
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
but those things express the same proposition.

581
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,080
So it would be a mistake to move away from the sentences in that case

582
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
and move to talk about propositions.

583
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Now here, are we committed about the identity conditions of propositions?

584
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,080
When is P the same proposition as Q?

585
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Notice this doesn't really say anything about that.

586
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,080
We don't really have identity conditions here.

587
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,080
After all, P or not P is equivalent to Q or not Q

588
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,080
in the sense that they're both just logical truths.

589
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,080
So we can't very easily introduce identity conditions here

590
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,080
and get a good answer to the question of whether the morning star is the morning star

591
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,080
and the morning star is the evening star expressed the same proposition as propositions.

592
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Now, in a way, that's good.

593
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,080
We are committed to a bad consequence here.

594
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,080
But from another point of view, you might say there's something that's really ill-defined here.

595
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,080
And the same truth of this is triangularity.

596
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,080
The same property is tri-laterality, having three angles, having three sides.

597
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Are they the same property or different properties?

598
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Well, things have three angles or not.

599
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Things have three sides or not.

600
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,080
We don't really get an answer to that question, right?

601
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,080
There are different P's that go in there.

602
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,080
So I suppose you could say that's an argument that there are different properties.

603
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Just as here, the morning star is the morning star and the morning star is the evening star

604
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,080
are different sentences, so maybe that's an argument that there are different properties.

605
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,080
But we've got to be careful because we want, I'm hungry and Dan is hungry,

606
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:47,080
or I'm wondering whether it's raining and Dan's wondering whether it's actually expressed the same proposition.

607
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,080
So this, in a sense, doesn't commit us with respect to identity conditions.

608
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,080
And that can be dissatisfied.

609
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I mean, quite at one point, introduces the slogan, no entity without identity.

610
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
And we don't have identity conditions here.

611
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
So Kwan will be unhappy.

612
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,080
He'll say, I don't know whether that's the same proposition as that,

613
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
whether this is the same property as that,

614
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,080
whether there are one or infinitely many possible fat men in the doorway, et cetera, et cetera,

615
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,080
because possibilities might be something introduced along similar lines.

616
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,080
And so in short, there might be that kind of disadvantage,

617
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
or there are other disadvantages we might have to worry about.

618
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Losing information is one, in other words.

619
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,080
And this lack of identity conditions is another closely related one.

620
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Are there other disadvantages?

621
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Yeah?

622
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,080
So kind of quite along with the losing information one,

623
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
I'm in another linguistic anthropology class,

624
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
and we're just talking about linguistic relativity,

625
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,080
where it's like, because people aren't speaking the same language,

626
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080
like even though you're saying the same thing,

627
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,080
we still have a different kind of meaning associated with it,

628
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,080
even though it's relating to referencing the same thing.

629
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,080
So kind of, we're losing that level of information also.

630
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
That's a good point.

631
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,080
You might think that the kind of information being conveyed

632
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,080
really does depend on the rest of the linguistic framework.

633
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,080
And it's not clear, especially in so far as we're now able to identify things

634
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
across linguistic frameworks,

635
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,080
you might worry that we're losing a certain kind of context.

636
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,080
So if this could happen in a kind of anthropological setting,

637
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,080
where, for example, we have a very rich set of color words,

638
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
we go to study a tribe's language,

639
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,080
and we realize they only have, let's say, three color terms.

640
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,080
They divide the whole spectrum up into just these three things.

641
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,080
And the question is, well, how do we translate those words they use?

642
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Here's one proposal.

643
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
They are white, black and red.

644
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
Okay?

645
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Here's another proposal.

646
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Well, they're really red, yeah,

647
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
but the others are more like light and dark.

648
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Because after all, what we would describe as brown, for example,

649
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
they're going to call black.

650
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:12,080
And so you might worry about how we sort of capture the content of this proposition.

651
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,080
And that's, so there's that worry.

652
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,080
There's also this kind of worry in a scientific context with theory change.

653
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,080
We move from traditional Newtonian mechanics to relativistic mechanics,

654
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,080
and all of a sudden, do we have the same concept of kinetic energy

655
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
or a different concept of kinetic energy?

656
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Does kinetic energy really function as the same term there,

657
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
or should be viewed differently?

658
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,080
Is it, if we think of it as an abstract property that something has,

659
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
is it the same property or a different property?

660
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,080
And so I think you're right that, in a sense,

661
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,080
it may be good that this doesn't commit us to a specific view of that,

662
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,080
but you might think, look, there's a tension here,

663
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,080
because insofar as we gain the advantage of pulling things out of their context,

664
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,080
we get the disadvantage that we're losing information provided by that context.

665
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Right?

666
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,080
And we've got to, in some cases, it's super easy to put in that information.

667
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,080
I pull, I am hungry away from the speaker.

668
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
I don't know who it is anymore,

669
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
but I can fill that in with a proper name,

670
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,080
designating the person who's hungry and problem solved.

671
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,080
But in a case like the one you're describing, right?

672
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,080
The whole question is, in a sense, what term would I substitute?

673
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,080
And it might be really hard to do that.

674
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,080
This is the kind of worry, actually, that's going to lead Quine

675
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,080
to one of his most dramatic theses that we'll study later in the course,

676
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,080
which is the thesis of the indeterminacy of translation,

677
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,080
where even in pretty simple cases, he's going to ask you,

678
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,080
it's not all clear how we should translate native utterances,

679
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,080
partly because of this question of conceptual schemes that don't match up precisely,

680
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,080
but partly because when it comes to basic metaphysical questions,

681
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,080
he's going to say there's no real content to the idea of, let's say,

682
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,080
running into a tribe, all of them turn out to be plainness,

683
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,080
or another tribe that are thorough and go anomalous,

684
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,080
and he'll say, you know, look, I can't tell the difference between these tribes.

685
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,080
And so there's something unintelligible about that.

686
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,080
In a way, that finding a tribe with a different set of color concepts isn't absurd.

687
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
That really could happen.

688
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:22,080
But to say, oh, we've discovered this tribe of plainness that he thinks is absurd,

689
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
even though intuitively you might think,

690
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,080
but go back to Plato's Academy in the old days,

691
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,080
and isn't that a tribe of plainness right there?

692
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Well, never mind. We'll get to that soon enough.

693
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,080
But yes, there's one last.

694
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Anyway, I think that's a critical point.

695
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Insofar as we gained flexibility to use this independently of context,

696
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:49,080
linguistic context, cultural context, context of the speaker at the time, et cetera, et cetera,

697
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,080
all of those things are going to be, in a sense,

698
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,080
abstracting away from certain information we might care about.

699
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,080
The last one is we have to learn this, right?

700
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,080
And not only is there that kind of burden,

701
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
we have to learn to speak proposition and ease or properties and so on,

702
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
but it can mislead us.

703
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Now, what's potentially misleading about it?

704
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,080
We've got all of these things functioning, the singular terms,

705
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
and it looks like they're referring to objects.

706
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,080
But are they really referring to objects?

707
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
Not really.

708
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Right?

709
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
I mean, this just transits as P or not.

710
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,080
That's not referring to an object.

711
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
Justus is a property.

712
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,080
That just translates into X is just or X is not just.

713
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,080
So, actually, these are kind of pseudo singular terms.

714
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
They're not really referring to an object.

715
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
They're doing something else.

716
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Now, notice this has an implication, which is part of the reason why he hates it.

717
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Because one question to ask here is,

718
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
why does one find it so objectionable?

719
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Why do he and Karnab get into a big debate about all of this?

720
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Part of it is because this really undermines

721
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Quine's Criterion of Ontological Commitment.

722
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,080
Remember, he said to be is to be a value of a variable.

723
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,080
And so, once I've got this, notice I can existentially quantify with respect to this.

724
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
I can now say there are propositions.

725
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,080
In fact, there's a proposition that both you and I believe.

726
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,080
We can say all sorts of things like this.

727
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:25,080
And similarly here, we can say, sure, there is a P, such that P is a property.

728
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Namely, for example, justice or triangularity or redness, blah, blah, blah.

729
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Of course, those things are analytic.

730
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,080
And so, there is a P such that this is the case.

731
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
That's going to be a trivial truth.

732
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,080
And yet, Karnab's point is that doesn't actually commit me to an object like justice

733
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
or triangularity or redness.

734
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Why? Because all I'm really doing is abstracting away from usages like this.

735
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,080
And so, the big conclusion of...

736
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,080
Well, I think there are a number of big conclusions of this.

737
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Let's spell them out explicitly.

738
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:10,080
One is to be is not to be a value of a variable.

739
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,080
In fact, we might say variables are cheap.

740
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Can I ask the reason for that?

741
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:27,080
It's because there are things that are values of variables that don't really exist.

742
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Is that the argument?

743
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Well, yeah, that...

744
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Well, actually, yeah, you're right.

745
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,080
I mean, maybe the value here is that...

746
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Because in a sense, we can talk about there being properties

747
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,080
without actually having any properties as values of variables.

748
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,080
So maybe, actually, I'm putting it in a misleading way.

749
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,080
A better way of putting it would really be that existential and universal quantifications

750
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,080
are not good guides to ontology.

751
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,080
So, let me put that more precisely.

752
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,080
And now I'm running out of room or time.

753
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,080
I'll get rid of properties here like a good novelist.

754
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,080
And so we can say a better way of putting that really is quantification.

755
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:21,080
Is must the guide to ontology.

756
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,080
And the second big implication is really just that

757
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,080
if we ask these basic ontological questions, or their properties,

758
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,080
or their propositions, or their numbers, et cetera,

759
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:40,080
really they're either trivial if they're internal questions or they're pragmatic.

760
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:52,080
So, so-called metaphysical questions

761
00:46:52,080 --> 00:47:00,080
are either trivial if they're internal or practical questions.

762
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,080
If they're external questions.

763
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,080
There is no deep metaphysical question.

764
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
Are there numbers?

765
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
Are there propositions?

766
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Are there properties?

767
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,080
Are there relations?

768
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
Are there mental states?

769
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,080
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

770
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,080
All right.

771
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,080
All of those end up current up things.

772
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Being either trivial questions as asked within the framework.

773
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
We've introduced the framework.

774
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,080
Numbers.

775
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Are there numbers?

776
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,080
Sure.

777
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,080
One, two, three, four.

778
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,080
Right?

779
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,080
Oh, you mean external question?

780
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
Then it's a practical question.

781
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Is it worth doing arithmetic?

782
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Is it worth talking about propositions?

783
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,080
Is it worth talking about properties?

784
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,080
In that way could Pegasus become a pragmatic object?

785
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Oh, suppose we talk.

786
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,080
Well, for one thing, Pegasus doesn't give us something of a new kind really

787
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,080
in the sense that we have to now introduce a new kind

788
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,080
that forces us to change grammatical categories.

789
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,080
But if we introduce a category of dementors or of Pegasus,

790
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,080
the question is in a sense,

791
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,080
well, I'm telling you the story about Pegasus, right?

792
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,080
I'm, well, Irofon wrote to me.

793
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
He was white.

794
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,080
He was winged.

795
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,080
He did this and that.

796
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:10,080
Within the myth, of course, Pegasus exists, right?

797
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,080
If I ask a journal question, it's really to say,

798
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,080
so is this myth something we should accept?

799
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,080
The same thing would be true of the dementors.

800
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,080
Within the story of the Harry Potter world,

801
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,080
of course there are dementors,

802
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,080
but you say, oh, they really exist.

803
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,080
You're saying, should we accept this myth or this, you know,

804
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,080
Harry Potter world as reality?

805
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,080
And then, for all sorts of practical reasons, we should.

806
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,080
We'll go around looking for dementors.

807
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,080
We'll fear them.

808
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,080
We'll think we have to come up with a pre-patronist.

809
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,080
And none of that's true.
