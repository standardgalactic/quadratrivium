0	6080	Last time we were talking about Klein's attack on analyticity and I want to
6080	10320	return to that there's one last argument we have to consider before we move on
10320	15080	to the second dogma of empiricism. However before even doing that I think I
15080	18960	should say a little bit about what motivates Klein's attack. Why does he
18960	22560	care about this anyway? We began last time by thinking about empiricism and
22560	26680	thinking it was pretty important to be empiricist to screen off a certain set
26720	31680	of sentences as things that were well verbally true that didn't concern
31680	36120	experience. Otherwise you have to fake the claim that our knowledge even that
36120	43600	one plus one is two or that every duck is a duck and so on is actually something
43600	49480	we have to learn from experience. However the reason goes deeper than that
49480	53280	in a sense why someone would care. After all Kant is the one who actually
53280	56440	framed the analytic synthetic distinction in the form we have it today
56440	61320	more or less. You introduce those terms and why did he do it? Not because he was
61320	67240	an empiricist but because he was able to identify a mission for philosophy.
67240	72120	Philosophy was the thing that would discover the grounds and the extent of
72120	77440	synthetic apriori truth. So from that point of view, Kant has a way of
77440	81320	distinguishing philosophy from empirical science from other sorts of things.
81360	86520	Philosophy is the thing that uncovers the synthetic apriori truths. Hume and other
86520	90480	empiricists have tended to find a role for philosophy in doing an analysis of
90480	94720	concepts and so I'm covering certain analytic truths especially those that
94720	98960	aren't just lookable up in the dictionary but ones that are more
98960	104800	theoretical, ones that are more illuminating, one that explicated
104800	108880	concept as opposed to just giving you a definition of courage as being courageous.
109320	113160	I can only imagine what Socrates would have said. He said, what is courage? It's
113160	117440	being courageous. It's like, yeah, that's not going to satisfy him, right? He wants
117440	122640	something more and so there's a task there too. When Quine is challenging this
122640	127000	distinction then what is he doing? He's challenging the claim that philosophy
127000	132920	actually has any distinctive task of its own and so in the end Quine's
132920	136880	motivation for challenging the analytic synthetic distinction is not to attack
136960	141640	empiricism, it's to defend naturalism. The idea that there is no way to
141640	145720	distinguish philosophy or some other discipline from natural science. In a
145720	149840	sense, it all becomes one big project of understanding the world and any
149840	154560	distinction we draw between philosophical analysis and actual
154560	158080	investigation of the world between an attempt to discover the transcendental
158080	164240	grounds of synthetic apriori truths or any other type of thing as opposed to
164960	169560	disciplines of psychology or physics or anything like that. All of that is bound
169560	174160	to fail, he thinks. In the end, it's all the same thing. Philosophy is just part
174160	180160	of natural science. Or to put it another way, you might say all branches of
180160	183600	knowledge are really just part of the same thing. Our distinction between
183600	189200	philosophy and anything else is really arbitrary. In the end, it doesn't
189200	193840	reflect a deep difference of discipline, it's just a matter of levels of
193840	197520	generality. And so what he's going to do by the end of this essay is draw us a
197520	202120	picture that's like this. He says in the end, think of our beliefs not as resting
202120	207560	on some foundation of observation and analytic truth, but instead as being
207560	211200	something like a spider web connected to experience at the ends, but then
211200	217480	containing lots of things in between. So here I will draw a spider web. That might
217560	222760	be a crappy spider. But this is something he ends up calling the web of
222760	228800	belief. And the point, in a sense, of the attack on analyticity is to say, look,
228800	232480	it's all in there together. Yes, some things are closer to experience and
232480	237040	some aren't. So some look kind of empirical. Some are very far here in the
237040	242920	center and might look either analytic or very abstractly theoretical. But all of
242920	245840	that is just a matter of degree. In the end, there's nothing that is sort of
245960	250200	directly tied to experience in the way that an observation sentence is supposed
250200	254280	to be a logical empiricism. There's nothing that is sort of off limits to
254280	259040	revision as part of natural science as an analytic truth might be. So it's all
259040	263520	sort of hanging in there together. What's physics and what's math? In the end,
263520	266480	they're going to be sort of mixed together and we draw certain pragmatic
266480	270480	distinctions between them. But there's no really principal distinction to be
270520	276280	drawn between. So that's what this attack on analyticity is really about. Now,
276280	281080	we identified a couple of attacks before. So let's return to this question of
281080	286800	analyticity. And remember, we had thought of a variety of ways of thinking about it.
286800	292840	One was based on meanings and synonymy. But Kauai doesn't like thinking of
292840	298280	meanings as entities, number one. And secondly, we could say, well, okay, a
298280	302400	bachelor is an unmarried man. That's an analytic truth if it's only a bachelor
302400	306480	and an unmarried man are synonymous. But how do we tell whether it's those
306480	310440	things are synonymous? In the end, well, that's just a question of whether that
310440	315320	sentence is an analytic truth. So synonomy and analyticity can be defined in terms
315320	322000	of each other, but neither really helps. It's as if we just have two synonymous
322160	328640	sentences. Or it's like pig and swine. Or brave and courageous. If I say, what is it
328640	333560	to be courageous? To be brave, you might think that doesn't help me a lot. What is
333560	337960	it to be brave? To be courageous. And so in the end, that doesn't help. If we think
337960	341880	about definability, we've got all sorts of definitions. But the ones that are
341880	347560	interesting from our point of view, and aren't just stipulations, all involve
347560	351320	some prior sense of synonymy. We write in the dictionary that this is the
351320	354680	definition of that term because we're trying to capture something about usage
354680	358040	and something about identity of meaning or synonymy. So we just get thrown back
358040	363800	into the same problem. And then we talk about interchangeability and end up
363800	367600	finding that problematic and basically saying, look, in the end, that doesn't
367600	373320	seem either necessary or submission for understanding analyticity. Well, the last
373320	377640	thing he considers before moving on to the second topic is a different approach
377640	383880	to this. And it's an approach based on the idea of a sematical rule. So this is
383880	389280	what Karnat does. He gives us a language and he characterizes the language in
389280	393480	terms of its syntax. So he defines a vocabulary in that set of grammatical
393480	398040	rules. And then he said, here are the semantic rules for actually interpreting
398040	402840	my language. Okay. What is an analytic statement? It's something that is true on
402840	406480	the basis of the sematical rules. So it's something you can derive from the
406520	412200	sematical rules alone. So we've got a syntax that gives us a vocabulary and a
412200	420400	grammar that defines the well-formed expressions of our language. And then we've
420400	431720	got sematical rules. The semantics tells us how to interpret those expressions. And
431720	435480	it generally does that in a compositional way. We start out with the simple parts
435480	439080	and tells us how to interpret the simple parts and then how to combine those into
439080	445200	more complex parts. And so we've got a way of interpreting the well-formed
445200	454480	expressions. And in particular, that semantics consists of rules, rules for
454480	459320	the basic expressions and then the ways of combining them. And those rules are
459320	464600	going to imply certain things. And indeed, what Karnat lays out here is what
464600	468560	linguists do all the time. If you look up an average paper in linguistics and
468560	473880	philosophy, you will find a sort of toy language frequently with a simple
473880	478400	vocabulary, a simple set of grammatical rules, and then some sematical rules that
478400	482400	tell you how to interpret all of that. And so something is analytic, if it just
482400	487920	follows from the sematical rules. So I can show you a little example of that if
487920	493400	you're interested. Yeah, okay. This is something from a paper by Bar-Wise and
493400	498160	Harry in 1981. It's a very simple thing. Suppose we have a sentence like this.
498160	508480	John sees Mary run. How would we interpret that sentence? Well, they say the
508480	511080	basic idea here, you've got something strange going on in these
511080	516440	sentences. Look at Mary run. That's called a naked infinitive. That is to say an
516440	523160	infinitive, but without the two. And so it could be like an ordinary infinitive.
523160	528600	It would be something like John once Mary to run. This, however, leaves out the two.
528600	532040	And so there's something a little bit surprising about that. These constructions
532040	538200	are a little unusual. What do they mean? Well, the idea in Bar-Wise and Harry is
538200	543080	that this is really a situation. It's a scene. So John is seeing a scene here. And
543080	548720	so let's call that scene S. We want to say there is such a scene that John sees,
548760	556080	basically. So the truth conditions will be something like this. There is an S such
556080	570240	that, well, what? John sees S and now S supports the truth of Mary runs. So one way
570280	580240	to put that is like this. Where that thing just means, well, that's from a set of
580240	594640	situations now in which Mary runs. So in other words, John sees some situation in
594680	601520	which Mary runs. And that would be, well, actually this is a simplified version of
601520	605560	a semantic rule for that kind of construction involving these oddball
605560	613320	infinitives. So what does it mean to see Mary run, let's say, or to see, let's say,
613320	618800	Fred trip and fall? It's going to mean something like that. John would see a
618840	625560	scene and that scene would support the truth of, in that case, Fred trips and
625560	630280	falls. And then we could actually see that there are some things that follow
630280	634760	from that. For example, when would a situation support Fred tripping and
634760	640160	falling? When it supports Fred tripping and also his falling, right? And so we'd
640160	646680	be able to say, ah, John sees Fred trip and fall. So John sees Fred fall. That
646720	650440	should be a legitimate inference. And that's something that would follow from
650440	655880	the semantical rules. Well, all right, but that's just a simple example of the
655880	660440	kind of things that people do in semantics. And indeed, there are things
660440	664520	that count as semantical rules. Ones that you're much more likely to have seen
664520	672200	are ones in basic logic. So for example, we could say, what is the meaning of
672200	681600	something like A and B? Well, think of that as something like the set of
681600	687840	possible worlds supporting the truth of A and B. And what would that be? Well, it
687840	693200	would be the set of possible worlds in which A is true, intersected with the
693200	697240	set of possible worlds in which B is true. And so that would be another form
697240	706480	that a semantical rule could take. Some of you are nodding appreciatively,
706480	711720	others are hating my guts right now. Yes. This makes sense, but can you relate a
711720	716720	little bit to the analyticity? Oh, yeah. Okay, good. So, right, here's a
716720	722200	semantical rule, let's say in our plotter. And now I say, aha. Okay, here's an
722200	745280	analytic set instead. If Fred tripped and fell, Fred fell. Now, actually, I'd have
745280	748680	to tell you about if then in order to really make this work. This is going to
748680	752600	follow from this together with something about if then. But that's going to end up
752600	757800	analytic because after all, Fred tripped and fell, that means our situation is one
757800	762440	in which, well, this happened. But what is that? It's the intersection of those two
762440	765880	things. That means this happened there and this happened. So, it's going to follow
765880	770800	that Fred tripped and fell, Fred fell. And that would be that analytic because
770920	780240	it's derivable from our semantical rules just using logic. Well, what's wrong with
780240	786040	that? Why can't we do this and have a good account of analyticity? Gwein does
786040	789640	think Carnap's come closer than anyone else to capturing what analyticity really
789640	794600	is. And so, suppose we try this strategy and say that's what an analytic statement
794600	798320	is. It's something that follows from our semantical rules. After all, what Gwein
798320	801280	is worried about are the things, not really so much the logical things,
801280	805760	strictly speaking, as the other things. So, presumably we're going to have not only
805760	810240	these kind, well, yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves. But we're going to have
810240	813480	to have semantical rules of a variety of kinds, right, to get something like
813480	819040	Bachelors of Unmarried Men. Now, why does he object to this strategy?
829160	836120	Why isn't that perfectly good? Imagine somebody studying linguistics now who
836120	839240	says, what do you mean? I'm taking semantics. We write down semantical rules
839240	843360	all the time. And we think things follow from those and are true just by virtue
843360	849680	of meanings. And that means we think they're analytic. And so, gosh, linguists use
849680	851200	this sort of thing all the time. That's wrong.
859320	865320	Well, problem A, which isn't actually stressed by Klein, if you think about all
865320	869320	Bachelors of Unmarried, what kind of semantical rule is going to give you that?
869320	876040	That depends on the lexical meanings of terms like Bachelor, right? And so,
876040	878960	we're actually going to have to have that as part of the semantical rules here,
878960	883960	lexicon. So, one objection that he doesn't really stress, but he could, is to say,
883960	886720	wait a minute, a lot of this is going to require a lexicon that's going to
886760	890520	actually specify meanings. But now we're back into the same problem of definition.
890520	894520	Now we're going to have some dictionary that's basically going to give us a
894520	898160	bunch of definitions. But why don't we give us those definitions? Because it's
898160	902400	trying to match identities of meaning already. And as we've seen, metros gets
902400	905640	tied up with analyticity. So, we're back to the same problem we had before.
905640	906400	Yeah.
906400	911400	So, just to confirm, vocabulary is different to lexicon. And vocabulary is just a list of words
911400	912920	and lexicon times the meanings of the words.
913240	918360	Yeah, exactly. So, here we might have, you know, in the syntax we have a vocabulary
918360	922600	and that might include Bachelor. So, that'll just tell us sentences involving
922600	926680	Bachelor in the noun position are well-formed. But then here, it'll be
926680	938200	something like, ah, Bachelor, you know, noun unmarried man. So, we're going to, in
938200	942040	a sense, be back to the same problem we had. But that's not actually his main
942280	955720	objection. The main objection is this. What's a semantical rule? Why don't we just
955720	961160	start writing down every true sentence and calling this semantical rule? Okay. So,
961160	967400	gosh, John C. is very wrong. We have this account. Why don't we just keep going?
967400	970360	After all, here we've got something that goes beyond the bounds of ordinary
970360	975240	logic we were talking about basically seeing with respect to this kind of
975240	978680	construction. What about running? Should we have a logic of runs and start
978680	983880	writing down semantical rules for this? We actually had a PhD in philosophy a
983880	987640	number of years ago. Actually, we've had several who have gotten jobs at a
987640	993320	software company here in Austin. And their job is to sort of write down
993320	1000600	axioms in a database that will allow it to interpret things it reads, things
1000600	1007400	that people say, and so forth. It's this huge database, actually, that's sort of
1007400	1010840	an encyclopedia of all sorts of things. And at one point I asked this guy, so
1010840	1014040	what are you working on? Because you have a little business card and it said
1014040	1018680	ontological engineer. I thought, all right, that's sort of awesome. What is an
1018760	1023960	ontological engineer? And he said, well, you know, it's basically we try to
1023960	1027800	systematize everything that's in your head and put it into a computer so the
1027800	1031400	artificial intelligence system can actually converse with you as if it were
1031400	1035480	human. And I said, okay, well, like for example, what are you working on right
1035480	1043080	now? He said, right now I'm working on the ontology of beds. I said, wait, beds?
1043080	1048760	Yeah, beds. Okay, well, what do you mean? There are beds, right? I thought that was
1048760	1054520	the ontology of beds. He said, no, no, no, you know, for example, Joe walks into a room
1054520	1060840	and sees a bed. Now, what do you have to know about that bed to figure out what
1060840	1065720	might happen next or to understand the subsequent discourse? Well, there's a head
1065720	1070920	of a bed and a foot of a bed. There's usually space under a bed. You can either
1071000	1079400	sit or lie down on top of the bed. Beds have flat surfaces. And then, you know,
1079400	1083560	they often have headboards and things like this. They often have pillows. They have
1083560	1092200	blankets. Now, it was important to know this because suppose the story goes, you
1092200	1097320	know, John got to his hotel. He walked into the room. He saw the bed. He put his,
1097720	1104120	um, yeah. What could we have happened? Okay, he sat down on the foot.
1105880	1110600	He said, what, whose foot? Right? His own foot? Did he sit on his own foot? No,
1110600	1114360	the foot of the bed, you have to understand. Was there somebody else in the room?
1114360	1120760	Stacked down on the foot? No. And so, in short, you have to sort of have the computer already
1120760	1126600	have a huge amount of world knowledge that we have already. But now, here's the significance
1127320	1132840	of this. How do we decide what of the entry, entries into that huge database
1132840	1139400	counts as a semantic rule about beds and what is just a fact about beds? How do we divide the
1139400	1145800	semantics from the world knowledge? Beds are, I mean, suppose I ask you, what is the definition of a bed?
1146680	1153080	It's sort of hard to say, right? A surface to sleep on.
1154280	1162280	A surface to sleep on. Yeah, but now, what about, how is that different from a cot or a house? Or,
1162280	1169000	yeah, a couch, people can sleep on a couch. Gosh, I've slept on floors. Actually, it's really good
1169000	1174600	for my back to sleep on. Right, a sort of back. Could you possibly describe it as a complex
1174600	1180120	comprising of symbols like the mattress in that comprise it for the function? Oh, you could start
1180120	1186760	saying, all right, yeah, I mean, a bed consists of a mattress. Evidently, Austin is big into beds,
1186760	1191800	by the way. I mean, everywhere I go, there are these mattress firm stores. That, and very close to
1191800	1196600	where I live there too, right across the street from each other. It's like, what? How many mattresses
1196600	1202280	does Austin need? But anyway, yeah, okay, you could define it in terms of its parts. You could say,
1202280	1208040	no, it's just its function, something to sleep on. You could start describing it in terms of its
1208040	1214920	typical shape, maybe. You could, anyway, all the point is, I don't know how to give you a definition
1214920	1219160	and how to separate the definition of bed from all these other things that are true of beds.
1219720	1226280	And bed isn't pretty unusual here. We would do the same thing if we talked about chairs or tables or
1227240	1232360	all sorts of things, actually, that we began to think about that are in common usage. There are
1232360	1237960	all these things that we commonly assume about them, and which of those are actually part of the
1237960	1242360	meaning, which are just commonly known facts, if you would want to put it in a database so that
1242360	1249320	it can help the computer understand the story, for example. Gosh, I don't know. And in effect,
1249320	1254360	Quine's saying it's an arbitrary choice. Some of those things, we designate as semantical rules.
1254360	1258760	Some we treat as world knowledge. But what really ultimately is the difference between
1258760	1262200	things that are true by virtue of meaning and things that are just commonly known?
1262840	1267640	He thinks it's impossible to tell. In the end, in word and object, in some later words, he does
1267640	1272600	define a notion of stimulus analyticity. But that's just something someone will immediately
1272600	1277240	accept to if they know the language. And he says, yes, that will include things like bachelors
1277240	1283160	are unmarried, but it will also include things like there are dogs. So it's not going to give you
1283160	1288840	actually a very good approximation to what philosophers have wanted by this notion of
1288840	1296440	analyticity. And so the basic objection to this is something like our objection to certain kinds
1296440	1309240	of definitions, that in the end, it feels arbitrary or circular. Either we do have some sense of what
1309320	1314120	really meaning is, but then we're back into the problem of meaning and sonotomy and all of that.
1314680	1319160	Or we're just arbitrarily designating some of these as part of the definition of say,
1319160	1324760	bed, as opposed to a commonly known fact about bed. But there's really no way to draw that
1324760	1332520	distinction that is not ultimately arbitrary. Yeah. What is where the line falls between
1333640	1338760	synthetic analytic statements actually tell us about the world? Why is it so important for
1338840	1345480	ontology? Oh, right. Why is it important? Well, one reason is that if we have a distinction between
1345480	1353880	the analytic and the synthetic, we can say there are certain disciplines that fall on one side
1353880	1358680	and certain disciplines that fall on the other. So for example, if we're logists, for example,
1358680	1364360	at Fraga and Russell, and we say mathematics ultimately reduces to logic, we can put logic
1364360	1373320	and math on this side, we can put semantics on this side. And then over here we get physics and
1373320	1381480	psychology and biology and other natural sciences and so forth. And then the question is, what do
1381480	1388520	we do with philosophy? Well, we could, if we have this sharp distinction, think, oh, you know,
1388520	1395240	philosophy is a form of analysis. In fact, why is analytic philosophy called analytic philosophy?
1395240	1400200	Because it arises in the context of a sort of empiricism that says we can draw that distinction.
1400200	1406760	And over here, we can put philosophy because philosophy really consists in analysis. It's a
1406760	1413960	matter of analyzing concepts, serving as something like the logic of science, understanding what we
1413960	1418840	mean when we debate about whether people have free will. In short, the kind of thing that Air does
1419480	1426120	in language truth and logic. Or we could be like Kant and say, no, no, no, philosophy concerns itself
1426120	1433800	with the synthetic. But it's not just one more science, alongside physics and biology and chemistry
1433800	1441320	and psychology and so on. No, instead, philosophy appears over here. But what is it doing that's
1441320	1448040	distinctive? Well, it's really engaged in this transcendental enterprise. And that transcendental
1448040	1455240	enterprise is actually capable of giving us synthetic a priori truths. So on both sides,
1455240	1460840	you end up saying there's something a priori about philosophy, something that philosophy is doing just
1460840	1466840	through reflection that isn't dependent on experience. But what kind of truth is it giving you?
1466840	1472600	Well, maybe it's this. And so here we get human air and Russell
1475080	1482520	and Karnapp. Or it's doing this kind of thing. And if we're over here, maybe we have Kant or
1483640	1490280	Heidegger, it's involved in this sort of transcendental enterprise. Actually,
1490280	1494360	I think it's not just these guys, but many rationalists would put it over here too.
1494360	1507880	So maybe Descartes, Leibniz, I think Plato. And so in a certain sense, part of the reason
1507880	1514120	client cares is that he sees philosophy's self concept is often tied up with this distinction,
1514120	1519720	the vital terms of it. And if that distinction goes away, not only then is there no really
1519800	1523400	principle distinction on this sort of discipline and that sort of discipline,
1523960	1528440	but also then this way of understanding philosophy goes away. So what is philosophy now?
1531720	1536040	That's why he says there's a shift toward pragmatism, this result. Because in the end,
1536040	1541160	there's no way to really distinguish in principle what is philosophical. And I think that's what
1541160	1545640	client thinks. What's the difference between philosophy and physics or philosophy and psychology
1545640	1549800	or philosophy and linguistics? It's more or less that just philosophy is somewhat more general.
1550520	1557400	But whenever physicists start reflecting generally on the nature of reality or the nature of physical
1557400	1561560	law, whenever a psychologist says, so what does this really tell us about the mind,
1562200	1567080	they're really engaging in philosophical reflection. And it's really just kind of degrees
1567080	1570760	of generality. So the difference between philosophy and everything else is just a matter of degree.
1571560	1576840	More or less philosophers are just constantly involved in these reflective, extremely abstract,
1578040	1583320	rather vague enterprises. And as soon as you get more specific about it, you turn to a scientist.
1584520	1591000	So why did he say that he preferred logical, positive, positivism over pragmatism in the
1591000	1596360	office if this is? That's a great question. So if that's really the story in the end,
1596360	1601880	why isn't Quine, somebody who really doesn't engage so much with Russell and Carnap and so on,
1601880	1607000	but is writing about Dewey and James and Perse and so on, why doesn't he see himself clearly in
1607000	1614360	that pragmatic tradition? I think that is a really good question. You might think in the end,
1614360	1621960	he forced to choose, he ups with these guys, right? So what's going on there? I think partly
1621960	1626840	it's that he looks at this older pragmatist tradition, and he thinks it's just not precise
1626840	1633800	enough to actually give you any real information. So there's a way of being, of denying this distinction
1633800	1639240	being a pragmatist, that in a sense he thinks is going in the right direction, but he doesn't really
1639240	1644760	have much sympathy with that way of doing philosophy. And he sees it in people like Perse, James and Dewey,
1644760	1655400	where it's sort of suggestive, but on the other hand, not worked out. There are places in Quine,
1655400	1661960	especially in his 1969 book, Ontological Relativity and Other Essays, where he talks directly about
1661960	1666120	Dewey, and he says, I'm trying to give you a theory of language that's very similar to Dewey's
1666120	1671480	in a certain way. Dewey was hostile to this sort of picture of language where, I think in a language
1671480	1677320	is a name of something, it's a sort of museum metaphor. We take a term and we go off looking
1677320	1681800	in the museum for the thing that we can attach that label to. And he says, yeah, that's not the
1681800	1687080	right way to see language, so Dewey was right about that. But then he sort of forgets about Dewey,
1687080	1693640	and why? I think because in the end he thinks, Dewey gives you a good sort of picture of the way
1693640	1700280	things go, but gives you no real argument in favor of that. And in fact, the picture is so
1701240	1705960	that there's not that much to be learned from it. So in the end, I think he thinks
1706600	1711400	analytic philosophy does a better job, and logical empiricism even does a better job,
1711400	1716040	because at least it formulates precise questions and allows you to frame precise arguments.
1717320	1723240	He thinks in the end, some of its presuppositions are wrong. And those are things the pragmatists
1723240	1729000	are right about, but the pragmatists also are not in a position to do anything very interesting
1729000	1734840	with that. It's sort of like, let's say a great philosopher with brilliant ideas brings up a child
1734840	1740200	to have that perspective on the world, but not to actually have any of the arguments
1740200	1746680	be able to formulate anything precisely. And so this little kid kind of has, let's say,
1746680	1750840	the right philosophical ideas, but can't defend them, can't articulate them very clearly.
1751720	1758600	Quite almost sees the pragmatists as being like that child. And so I think in the end,
1758600	1763240	that's why, here at least is a method that he thinks is a useful method, whereas he doesn't
1763240	1767160	think the pragmatists historically had a very useful method, even though their views were in
1767160	1775000	the end closer to the truth. Yeah. I don't understand why the John Seesmerian
1775720	1778920	rule that you introduced, why would he say that that's arbitrary?
1781240	1786360	All right, good question. It's not just a rule of like seeing. You could substitute
1786360	1791880	other than like, John, here is Mary saying or whatever. Oh, right, exactly. It's a more general
1791880	1797800	rule than that. Yes, that's right. And in fact, in practice, linguists do this kind of thing all
1797800	1802760	the time. And if you said, well, gosh, is it part of personal medical rules that people see with
1802840	1810200	their eyes? The linguists would typically say, no, that's not really part of my theory. Why not?
1810760	1821000	Well, gosh, why not exactly? I think the linguists would typically say, because that doesn't really
1821000	1829000	fit into this compositional structure, that's not something that has to be built into the theory
1829000	1834920	of meaning. That's just an additional fact about seeing. And there is a kind of rough and ready
1834920	1842040	intuition that supports that thought, I think. So one of the things that lurks underneath this
1842040	1846120	and forms the foundation of a number of people like Rice and Strauss are not projecting to what
1846120	1850760	Kwan does, is the thought that, look, actually, in practice, linguists don't have any proof
1850760	1855320	figuring out what they should write down as a semantical rule and what they would actually
1855320	1859400	account as a bit of world knowledge about things. There's huge agreement in the linguistic community
1859400	1864440	about that. And the same thing is true about logic. We don't have any problem writing down things
1864440	1872600	about and or even about knows that and things like that. And so why, if nobody seems that confused
1872600	1879160	about this, we should re-attack the distinction. There must be something that we're all responding
1879160	1884360	to here. Now, in the end, is the analysis is going to be, well, we're responding to distance from
1884360	1889320	the edge of experience or something like that. And so the analytic truths are going to be the ones
1889960	1895080	here that are pretty far from empirical dependency. And so they're going to be
1895080	1898760	way in the center of the level of belief. But in the end, it's a matter of degree.
1898760	1901960	And this is why there will be vague cases in the boundaries and blah, blah, blah.
1905720	1911240	I think to get a better answer than that, though, what we really need to do is think,
1911240	1917480	what exactly is coin objecting to? Is he saying there's no way to draw the distinction? Because
1917480	1922440	you might think, what we're doing to give you a semantic theory is drawing the distinction.
1923080	1926760	So what do you mean we can't do it? That's like saying we can't do semantics,
1926760	1932520	but people do semantics all the time. So we've got to distinguish, I think, several questions.
1932760	1944520	One is, what coin is really done? And let me see where I can put this. Let me get rid of this.
1947240	1957080	What coin is really done, in a sense, is say, analytic is part of a set of concepts, meaning
1957640	1981320	synonymy. Definition. Substitution. Substitutability. Substitution. And semantic rule.
1981320	1991000	Oh, I could put a certain kind of necessity in here, too. And he's in the end saying,
1991000	1995640	we've got this whole set of concepts, and we can characterize them in terms of one another.
1996200	2002920	And we do, to a surprising degree, agree about how to use these things. But here's the thing.
2002920	2009240	He thinks they're all, in a sense, ill-founded. He wants to find some way of making sense of them.
2010200	2016280	From outside that circle. Now, one response is to say, why? The circle is fine as it is.
2016920	2021880	If I say I define courage in terms of bravery and bravery in terms of courage, that's not very
2021880	2026600	illuminating. But you might still say, but I'm right, right? And it would be very strange to say,
2026600	2032840	so there's no such thing as courage as a result of that. So what is he really concerned about?
2032840	2038440	To some extent, I think this is developing within the context of logical empiricism.
2038520	2045160	And he's thinking, okay, what is logical empiricism all about in the end? Observation,
2045160	2050360	right? Bringing things back to observation. And so he's thinking, I don't know how to give
2050360	2054920	an observational account of any of these. How do I explain, in terms of observation,
2055960	2061640	what any single one of those is? You might think, oh, I observed definitions in the dictionary.
2061640	2066200	Yeah, but they're putting them in the dictionary because of some identity of meaning,
2066200	2073000	Zanari, let's say. But how do I characterize that in terms of observation? The closest I could come,
2073000	2077720	maybe, is the terms are used in exactly the same way. And so something like a criterion of
2077720	2083000	substitutability. But we saw that doesn't really work either. That's neither necessary nor sufficient.
2084040	2090280	And so in short, he ends up saying, this whole structure is something that we would really like
2090360	2097480	to find the foundation with respect to observation, with respect to usage, with respect to behavior,
2098200	2104520	something we can actually pin down from the perspective of a logical empiricism. And it's
2104520	2110040	all sort of floating up there, and it's something we can't find any observational content to.
2111240	2115880	So one way of looking at it is to say, within the project of logical empiricism,
2115960	2122280	he can't find any way of making sense of what it is. Now, if you frame it that way,
2122280	2125960	you've got a reason why this is an objection to people like A.R. and Russell and Karnan.
2126680	2131240	You don't have much of a reason why anyone on the other side should care about this,
2131240	2135640	because you can have cards or Heidegger or Descartes or whatever saying. But I don't start
2135640	2140440	with those purposes. I don't care about resting this on observation. Why should I care? So that's
2140760	2144680	best an answer that will explain why these people are going to be in trouble here,
2144680	2148520	because on their own likes, they can't really assign any of this any meaning. Yeah.
2148520	2153160	Sorry. It's been a long week. And so this was just to explain the
2153160	2155160	why semantic rules are put into the creature?
2157080	2160920	Well, no. Really, now I'm trying to respond to the question of what's going to be your picture
2160920	2166360	here? What's the real objection come to? And I think it comes down to the fact that these
2166360	2169800	concepts can all be defined in terms of one another, but there's no way to define any of them
2169800	2174040	in terms that are outside of that. And in particular, that would rest on something like
2174040	2180280	observation or behavior or usage or something we could tie these down to in ways that don't already
2180280	2186600	involve something that's in that circle. Yeah. On the analytic synthetic kind of
2187960	2195560	way of looking at things, where would art be? Where would art be? Well, art isn't really giving us
2195560	2203320	truths, you might think. And so it doesn't really have propositional content that would allow us
2203320	2208280	to classify them one way or another. For example, suppose I say, ah, you want to work at artwork,
2208920	2215800	I will now give you an artwork. This is Bonnevac's logical empiricism defined.
2225640	2230440	Okay. So we've constructed a lot of symbols. Oh, I should put a lamp this morning.
2233720	2239000	There. Now, there's no propositional content to that, right? I haven't said anything. I haven't
2239000	2244040	asserted anything. So if you say, is that analytic or synthetic? It's kind of like, yeah,
2244680	2248920	there's nothing there to be analytic or synthetic. Now, as soon as I say things about it on the other
2248920	2255320	hand, so art criticism or that sort of thing will have to find a place somewhere. If I say,
2255400	2260760	ah, that's a terrible work of art, right? Where do I put aesthetic judgments like that?
2261560	2265880	Presumably it's not through my definition that it's a bad work of art. That's something that would
2265880	2272440	require some content. So presumably something like that would be synthetic. Now, in so far as
2272440	2276680	it's a value in it, it raises special philosophical questions because what about all value judgments
2276680	2283960	like that's a bad work of art or that was a bad action or something. Presumably those are typically
2283960	2288440	going to be synthetic claims, though they might have a special status and make us worry about
2288440	2292280	things. But most normative claims are going to end up being over here on the synthetic side.
2292280	2297000	Things like murder is wrong or that's a bad work of art. Now that I look at it.
2299880	2304280	My drawing teacher would be very happy because it was very fast. Oh yes, the faster you draw it,
2304280	2309400	the more you get the essence of the object. You can actually see some of the face in the middle
2309400	2314760	of a little bit. Oh, you sort of can. Yeah, there's a little bit like Wittgenstein.
2318280	2321560	And it's on a blackboard like that famous portrait of Wittgenstein in front of the
2321560	2326920	blind board. So see, it not only is a nice work of art in there, it contains allusions of other
2326920	2335080	works of art. See, you just see more and more levels as you come. This is the kind of thing that
2335080	2341800	got me an A in art. See what's going on. Oh, that's a great idea. Okay, well, never mind that.
2343720	2347800	Yeah, oh yes, we've got five minutes left and we haven't even moved on to the second dog.
2348760	2353960	So by the after spring break, we'll forget what the second dog even is. So let's talk about the
2353960	2364760	second dog. It's one about reduction. And it turns out to be, well, we can take it as really
2364760	2368520	reduction in something like the sense that Frege and Russell were concerned with, the
2368520	2372840	reducibility of mathematics for logic. But in a certain sense, I think we can characterize
2372840	2376120	what Klein's doing here much more simply without going into the details of that.
2377160	2380120	So suppose we just thought of it this way. For any sentence,
2380200	2385800	S, let's say,
2388600	2395560	there are sets of observations
2395960	2402360	that would confirm
2405240	2407960	or disconfirm
2413560	2419640	S. And let's call these, oh, I don't know, like O plus and O minus.
2420600	2427720	Okay. O plus here would be the set of observations that would tend to confirm
2427720	2432920	sentence S and O minus the set of observations that would tend to disconfirm S.
2434120	2438680	So now, if we actually could do that, if we could associate with any sentence,
2438680	2443080	whether we call that its meaning or not, presumably people like A are saying that is the
2443080	2449000	meaning of S. But whether or not we say that, we could say, all right, if we can characterize
2449880	2453960	sentences in terms of pairs of sets of observations that would confirm them or
2453960	2460120	disconfirm them, then we could say, aha, then we can define analyticity. S is analytic
2462280	2467080	if and only if every observation
2470200	2479480	is in that O plus or S. Yes, we should make that specific to that sentence.
2480600	2486360	Okay. So everything confirms it, then we make it an analytic truth. Yeah.
2486920	2491160	Oh, well, I've been thinking, and this has popped up before in class,
2491160	2496840	where like this sentence is false, like as, how do we apply that?
2499080	2503800	Good point. What will happen if we have a paradoxical sentence?
2504680	2511960	This sentence is false. What confirms that? Oh, you might think nothing confirms that, right?
2511960	2516120	Suppose there were an observation that confirmed it. Well, then it would imply that it was false,
2516120	2522040	but that would disconfirm it. And so, what if something disconfirmed it? Well,
2522040	2527160	it says it's false, so that would actually confirm it. And so, you could be thinking, oh,
2527160	2531720	gosh, I get every observation both confirms and disconfirms it, or maybe you could think,
2531720	2534600	actually, nothing ends up really confirming it or disconfirming it.
2535720	2539800	I haven't said anything about what the relationship between these would be, but if we say,
2540440	2544920	assume these are disjoint sets and nothing both confirms and disconfirms the sentence,
2546680	2551800	then we would end up saying, gosh, yeah, maybe a paradoxical sentence is one,
2552680	2555560	which is going to look actually very much like a meaningless sentence.
2556680	2561240	The way the logical empiricists understand it, no observation would confirm or disconfirmed.
2561720	2566680	So, you might say, if S has no empirical content,
2570280	2581240	if and only if O plus S and O minus S are just the empty set, nothing confirms it,
2581240	2587560	nothing disconfirms it. And paradoxical sentences would probably end up being in that sort of
2588360	2594600	thing. So, it would end up saying, yeah, this sentence is false, that has no empirical content.
2594600	2599560	But admittedly, that's a trickier problem and it might give us headaches for other reasons as
2599560	2606120	soon as we think about what truth means more broadly. But anyway, this at least has some hope.
2606120	2610600	So, suppose we were able to do this, what's quite a subjection to that? This is actually,
2610600	2614840	in a sense, what Carnap is trying to do, ultimately, at a certain stage of his thought.
2614920	2618600	What? What? What's wrong with that?
2628120	2633800	Ground time! But I'm not going to say the answer comes next time, because actually,
2633800	2637960	next time we won't have class and your offer spring break and no one will remember the question.
2638600	2645560	So, what we're going to do is just make, look, it's one answer, do head, okay? These things
2645560	2651240	don't face the tribunal of experience one-on-one. We have to do our examination of what confirms
2651240	2656200	or disconfirms in the context of about a broader theory. And so, in the end, he says it's really
2656200	2661160	all of science together that confronts the tribunal of experience, not each sentence together.
2661160	2665480	So, in short, he says there's really no way to define O plus and O minus here,
2665480	2670280	because we only know what confirms or disconfirms something in the context of a background theory.
