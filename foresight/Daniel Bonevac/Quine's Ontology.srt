1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In any case, let's back up a little bit and try to understand what's going on on what there is and in this last section of order of knowledge.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We've looked at one criteria of ontological commitment and he puts it in a logistical approach to the ontological problem by saying that to be is to be a value of a variable.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, he says it more explicitly or at least maybe less dramatically, but nevertheless more intelligently.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But I think it's the same criteria in some of the way it works.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And he then says, well, I'm not telling you what there is.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not trying to give you a theory of beating of what there is directly.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm telling you what a theory says there is.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And so we might say, here's the idea.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A theory says there are a's if and only if it asserts there are a's.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or in logical terms, there is an x subject able to prove x.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now, when you put it that way, it's almost trivial, right?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
When does a theory tell you there are certain objects?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, when it says there are those objects.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And so when he puts it that way, it should be clear.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's meaning to say something that's kind of obvious.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, when does my theory imply the existence of sense data when it says there are sense data?

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When does it imply the existence of unicorns when it says there are unicorns?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When does it imply the existence of attributes when it says there are attributes?

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And so we look to things that we are willing to, well, quantify over in this sense, say there are such things.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, put that way, it sounds like a very obvious point, right?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But then the question is, well, okay, suppose that is the criterion.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Notice it splits the ontological question in two.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And that's something that isn't very obvious in the earlier work.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's something brought out by this reformulation.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Because if we just say to be is to be a value of a variable, we think we're getting a theory of what there is, a theory of being.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But if we say it this way, we realize there are really two questions.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The first question is, okay, what does?

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, actually, this is telling you what a theory says there is.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So why don't we start with a prior question?

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's really, what theory about the world should we adopt?

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then secondly, what does it say there is?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In other words, he's really telling us what a theory claims about reality.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What does a theory say there is in the world?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And so if we're asking what is there in the world, really trying to address the fundamental question of ontology,

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we have to ask, well, first of all, what theory should we adopt?

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And then secondly, all right, what does it say there is?

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, let's look at that first question.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What theory should we adopt?

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're trying to describe the world, right?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, a project of metaphysics is in a way to talk about the structure of the world.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's structure in the sense of what ultimately exists.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How we talk about other things in terms of what ultimately exists.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How the mind relates to all of that.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All of that is broadly speaking metaphysics.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
At the bottom, we've got this ontological question of what there is.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, in thinking about the world in this way, what sort of theory should we adopt?

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Where do we start in thinking about this?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There are really only two options in Klein's view.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Really maybe three, I guess I should say.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But what are our options for this question of what theory we should adopt?

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Nominalism and realism?

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, we could adopt specific metaphysical theories like nominalism and realism.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But in a sense, he's asking a question that's even prior to metaphysics.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Prior to this question of what is real, like our attributes, universal forms, real or not.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's saying, look, I'm just trying to get a metaphysical theory of the world.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And to do that, I just need to start with some theory of the world.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I need to start with something that talks about the way the world is.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And forget philosophy for a moment.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not a question of starting with a philosophical theory.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a question of just what are we, when we describe the world, what are we doing?

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He says science.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, okay, one option here is science.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And indeed, that's his preferred option.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He says, yeah, we start with our best scientific theory.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then we ask what that scientific theory says there is.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, that's one option.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Say, yeah, look, when we're really about the project describing the world, we do science.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And so we think science describes the world.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And in his way of thinking about it, science is really, it's an old Aristotelian idea in a way.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Science is like a layer page.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So this picture of science he's working with, and it's a very common picture,

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is to say the most fundamental science, the one on which all the others rest, is physics.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Physics, exactly.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So physics is the thing that ultimately tells us what there is in the world.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then on top of physics, we build chemistry.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then on top of chemistry, we build biology.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And on top of biology, we build psychology.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And then on top of psychology, we build all the rest of the social sciences,

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
things like economics, sociology, and so forth.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And so if you have that picture of science, you're going to say, well, all right, yes,

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
we talk about, for example, income trends and social groups and things like that.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But in the end, those come down to questions of psychology.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Those reduce to questions of biology, which in turn reduce to questions of chemistry,

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
which ultimately reduce to physics.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And so in the end, the way he talks about science, really,

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
it becomes a question of what his physics state is.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So as Quine's thinking about this question, we really start broadly speaking with the language of science

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and pretty quickly the language of physics.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have a question about scientific language philosophers in general.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When you read someone like Stephen Hawking, he explicitly admits that all these things he's talking about

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
don't necessarily really exist.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They're mathematical models.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When you're talking about like Einstein radiation or something like that,

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
it's not like there's some entity there.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This ground state fluctuations are a model to describe a phenomenon.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How do these scientific language philosophers square their theories with that?

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Great question.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When we look at science, notice it's doing something,

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
well, at the higher levels, it may just be much of the time anyway,

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we're just systematizing things that we already think are there.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But when we get down to these levels, science is postulating a realm of hypothetical entities,

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
theoretical entities, that we don't have any access to in observation.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Things like microparticles, things like fields of certain kinds,

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
or in string theory, strings, maybe in theories of additional dimensions and things like that, hyperspace.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In the end, we've got certain objects, and indeed physics is quantifying over certain objects.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, what sort of objects?

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And what do we say about those?

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There are going to be entities here, but now there are two attitudes you might have about them.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You might be a realist who says, look, science says there are quarks, for example,

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and that's our best scientific theory of the world.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It asserts that there are quarks, so I have reason to believe there are quarks.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And so the realist says the real objects, especially if he goes the path of flying here,

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
the real objects are just the objects postulated by science.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So in the end, what is there in the world?

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, there are things like quarks and electromagnetic fields, and positrons, and neutrons, and so forth.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
On the other hand, there's another attitude you might have towards science, an instrumentalist attitude,

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
which says, wait a minute, I'm postulating entities like quarks and fields and so on.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But to those things really exist, I'm saying they're useful calculating devices.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So one way of looking at it is the realist says, look, these basic objects of science,

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
let's call them theoretical objects, the theoretical objects exist,

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and the scientific theory explains what it explains if those things exist.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But if they don't exist, there's something weird going on.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You've got something that's really just a calculating device.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The instrumentalist says, well, yeah, that's all it is. It is a calculated device.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And so the instrumentalist says, wait a minute, this whole idea of answering science is not going to give us the right answer.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What science does is hypothesize various things that might be behind the curtain to explain the appearances we have in the world.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But don't think those things being postulated as being behind the curtain are the real things.

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They're just ways of calculating about the things we actually experience.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So the instrumentalist is going to say, look, don't take physics or science in general as the right way to do this.

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's not telling you what they're all about.

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, it seems like the realist would run into immediate problems with no light.

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Science says it's a particle and a wave, and those things are mutually exclusive if you take it in a realistic way.

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We have to kind of view it as a mathematical, as an instrumentalist view.

134
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I think most physicists I've read seem to be more instrumentalists.

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right, lots of physicists are instrumentalists, partly because it's a way of avoiding carbon problems.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like, are you saying that light is really a particle or is it a wave?

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is it some kind of weird combination of the two?

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Some people have introduced this sort of a waveical for it, right?

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And the realist has to grapple with those questions and says roughly after quantum mechanics,

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
yeah, this is what really is in the world.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know what, the world is weird, man.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The world is unbelievably dear.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And indeed, the realist often says, yes, physics is describing the way the world is.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ultimately, quantum mechanics is describing what the possible is in the world.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It turns out it's weird.

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It doesn't fit our ordinary chemical words at all.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it's very easy to go from this claim, a theoretical object,

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so that the ones that really exist to say, look, the world is weird.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And a lot of physicists want to say, hmm, I don't know if the world is really that weird.

150
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We've got a theory here that works really well, but it might be.

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And indeed, if we think it's just a calculating device,

152
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
does it have to give us a picture of what light really is?

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It doesn't have to answer that question.

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can say it in certain respects, it's like a particle.

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In certain other respects, it's like a wave.

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We've got the famous two-slit experiments,

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and it's very hard to make sense of the intuitive terms.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But from this point of view, good, we don't have to make sense of the intuitive terms.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's a mathematical theory, and it explains the appearances.

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the appearances are kind of strange and surprising.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But nevertheless, we don't take the object seriously.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now, if we have this attitude, we're not going to say science is the path to this,

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and that's the theory, not the theory we're going to be interested in.

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What will we be interested in?

165
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I mean, if we're instrumentalists about the objects introduced by science,

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
hypothetically, and theoretically, then what are we taking as fundamental?

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What we see.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What we see, yeah.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So science is one option.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But there are other options.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
One option would be, well, experience.

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The objects of immediate experience.

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So we've seen some philosophers who do that.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay, Russell, for example, talking about sense data,

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
or actually Karnam in the logical structure of the world,

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and arguing that you can reduce all talk of physical objects

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to objects of immediate sensation, something like sense data.

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's right before your senses at any given moment?

179
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He also argues in that book, you can do it the other way around.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can reduce talk of sense data to talk of physical objects.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then he says, which should we take as primary?

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Should we really think what there is in the world are physical objects?

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Or should we think, no, it's a matter of the contents of immediate experience.

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's sensations.

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And he ends up saying, you can do it either way, which is a little surprising.

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But he says, what's directly before the mind,

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and so what's epistemologically prior, are the sensations.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So he favors actually going in the direction of the sensations.

189
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But he admits it goes both ways.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And part of what's in the background, in object decision,

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that last section of word and object, is that Klein assumes you know Karnam.

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And Klein is basically saying, yes, you can go in either direction.

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But I favor, he says, going in the direction of taking physical objects as primary.

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But not ordinary physical objects like tables and chairs,

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
necessarily in the end, the objects are hypothesized by science.

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He's aware that Karnam and Russell and others would say, no, no, no,

197
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
go in this more instrumentalist direction.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And that's going to lead me to say it's experience that's the fundamental

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
theory I don't worry about.

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And my reports of sensations.

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And he says, we could do it that way.

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But he thinks that our theory of objects in the world is just so well confirmed

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and so explanatory.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then he says, look, I know how to get through a day without referring to my own sensations.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know how to get through a day without referring to people and tables

206
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and chairs and other ordinary objects of experience.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And so he ends up saying, I'd much rather trust talk of objects than talk of sensations.

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But there's yet another option.

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What other option could there be?

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When you talk about the world, sometimes you do science.

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sometimes you might be talking about your own experiences.

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But what do we do most of the time?

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I say, tell me about this room.

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you immediately start saying, well, all right, let's introduce the wave function.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Our observations?

216
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, you could be talking about our observations.

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I mean, you could say, ah, tell me about the room.

218
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, I'm sensing grayly and greenly and clockly and camera-ly and people-ly.

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But you probably don't, right?

220
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What do you do?

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

222
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Perceptimals.

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
In other words, the objects of ordinary perception, right?

225
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I look around saying, oh, what's in the room?

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sure, I'll describe the room for you.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's got tile on the floor and a bunch of desks and there are people in the desks

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and it's got clock at the back and blackboards all around and so forth and so on.

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I tell you about the ordinary objects of experience.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And so you might say, well, look, one place to look is science.

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
One place to look is the contents of experience in the sense of these sensations themselves.

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But another place to look is just our everyday language, right?

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So we can say, just look at natural language and our everyday uses of it.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
After all, we ordinarily confront the world not just by talking about our own sensations,

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
not by doing science, but just by talking about stuff.

236
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Go to lunch with somebody after class.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But what are you going to talk about?

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I mean, maybe you're going to talk about physics.

239
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Except you say, whoa, check out that electron.

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Maybe you're going to talk about your own sensations.

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I mean, I suppose that's actually plausible in certain settings.

242
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
People talk about their feelings and all that.

243
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But often, you're not talking about your feelings or other sensations.

244
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're not talking about physics.

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're talking about things and people around you.

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And so that might be a place to start.

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Now, the reason I mentioned that is that a lot of clients' effort in word and object

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is to actually say, yeah, but don't worry about that.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We can explain the kinds of things we talk about there.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And if pushed to the wall, he ends up saying, well, anyway, they're not part of science,

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
so I don't have to worry about them.

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But he doesn't start there.

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If he really started there, he'd just say, here's the language in physics.

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And here's what it's telling us.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He doesn't do that.

256
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He talks about attributes and propositions and facts and models and glids and all these other things.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And why is he doing that?

258
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Because we talk about the natural language.

259
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And he feels compelled to say something about what we really have to be committed to.

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Because he doesn't want to say that much of what we say is just false.

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I say, well, I didn't see the light.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There was this glint of a mirror, a neighboring car.

263
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And we don't want to be lying.

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The officer might not believe you, but the officer isn't going to say,

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
yeah, listen, I've written word and object.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There are no such things as glints.

267
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, he's saying it's false.

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We want to be able to make some sense of that kind of talk.

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OK, so those are the options that are in front of us.

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And then why, now, he doesn't really, although that's his ultimate position,

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
he doesn't just jump there.

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He tries to actually say, look, most of the time,

273
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
we don't have to worry about the things that natural language introduces

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
in addition to the language of science.

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So what does science really commit us to in his view?

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Two things in that, right?

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, two very broad categories of things.

278
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What are they?

279
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What does science talk about?

280
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
See, be brave.

281
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Good physical objects, exactly.

282
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm not looking for something deep like, oh, man, I forgot my hyperspace theory.

283
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, physical objects.

284
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
OK, good.

285
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So yes, it talks about physical objects.

286
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And what else does it use in talking about physical objects?

287
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Abstract objects.

288
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Abstract objects, exactly.

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It introduces specifically mathematics.

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And in the end, what does mathematics commit us to?

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, you might say all sorts of things, right?

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Mathematical facts, numbers, functions, relations, spaces, metric spaces,

293
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
monarch spaces, et cetera.

294
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Here, we could give all those sorts of answers.

295
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Groups, rings, fields, matrices.

296
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, he just says it all comes down to what?

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
One logical and set.

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Exactly.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It comes down to a theory of classes to use Russell's language or in more modern language sense.

300
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Actually, there are some set theories that distinguish sets from classes.

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But for the moment, let's not worry about that.

302
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So in the end, we can build all of mathematics from that.

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Now, in his early work, he is a novelist.

304
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He thinks it loves to get rid of this, OK, and just have physical objects.

305
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's the things that are there in the world.

306
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But he can't figure out how to do it.

307
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
In 1948, he is a novelist.

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And in fact, he publishes a paper with Nelson Goodman

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
called Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism.

310
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And it starts with a ringing declaration of nominalism

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that there are no abstract objects.

312
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And indeed, throughout much of his work,

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
he's trying to get rid of abstract objects like propositions

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and attributes and various other things.

315
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But in the end, he says, look, I don't know how to do without mathematics in science.

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And mathematics seems to commit me to classes,

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and I don't know how to get rid of them.

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now, Russell, in 1908, was convinced that classes were just a logical fiction

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that he could get rid of them.

320
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's part of the project of Principia Mathemica.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But in the end, he couldn't do it.

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why does it turn out to be hard?

323
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Why can't you just say, ah, come on, classes of objects, sets of objects.

324
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We're just talking about the objects.

325
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I could say, yes, consider the set of people in this room.

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You might think, I'm just talking about the people in the room, right?

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not like how many things are in the room.

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Oh, there are these people.

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then, oh, I forgot the set of people in the room, too.

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And so there's a powerful intuition that, look,

331
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
sets are just a ways of talking about the things in them.

332
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And Frege and Russell start with that idea.

333
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But it turns out to be harder to make sense of that than you might think.

334
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Here's why.

335
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We could say, all right, suppose we're talking about the set of A's.

336
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We think there are such things, maybe.

337
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And so I want to talk about the set of all the X's, such that A is true of X.

338
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You might think, look, it's very easy to explain my talk that way.

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What does it mean to talk about the set of objects that are A's?

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is just the set of A's, right?

341
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Well, I've introduced that term.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And it turns out to be a very useful thing to do in math and in various other contexts.

343
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What could I mean by that?

344
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Well, you might think, oh, it's very easy.

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I just have to worry about element to it.

346
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In fact, in the end, in mathematics, all I really need is this one symbol

347
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
in addition to logic, is a member of.

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And so you might think, I can explain this very easily.

349
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Y is a member of this set of X's, such that A of X, if and only if A holds true of Y.

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So let's say I'm talking about the set of people in the room.

351
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Y belongs to the set of people in the room, if and only if Y is a person in the room.

352
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Y belongs to the set of green things, if and only if Y is green.

353
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Y belongs to the set of novelists, if and only if Y is a novelist, et cetera.

354
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And so you might think, great, here I'm talking about sets, right?

355
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I seem to be committed to sets.

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But over here, I'm not.

357
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm just talking about the Y's, whatever they are.

358
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And I'm not talking about sets anymore.

359
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And so if I could make that work, I could just say, see,

360
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
look, classes are just logical fictions.

361
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
They're just constructions out of the objects they're classes of.

362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And so actually, I could just get by with the physical objects.

363
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, this is, in fact, the way we explain that notation.

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And so can't we be happy and say, oh, there it is.

365
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We can get rid of this talk of classes.

366
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Silly quine.

367
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We don't need.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We don't need no stinking classes.

369
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No fans of the treasure of the Sierra Landry here.

370
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Well, it was on TV the other night.

371
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Forgive me.

372
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Anyway, now I feel we need to explain this.

373
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
These bandidos come up, and Humphrey Bogart and the others

374
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
are trying to fight them off.

375
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
They claim to be federales, and they don't believe them.

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And Humphrey Bogart says, if you're federales, show me your badges.

377
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They say, badges?

378
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We don't need no stinking badges.

379
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think the Mel Brooks version better, Blazing Saddle.

380
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh.

381
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah.

382
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Sorry.

383
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's quite not that good.

384
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, no.

385
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They're recruiting all the bandits to raid the town,

386
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and the bandidos come up, and they're like, all right, you know,

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
here are your badges, and they laugh at you.

388
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We don't need no stinking badges.

389
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Very good.

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So yes, you have the normalist's sets, and the normalist's sets.

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't need no stinking sets.

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
All right.

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And now here's the way to get rid of them.

394
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But what's wrong with this?

395
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, come on.

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, this is called Russell's Paradox.

397
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It devastated poor Frank.

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Frank was all excited about his theory.

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Here it is.

400
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then Russell writes him like a two-page letter in which he says,

401
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
oh, you know, wonderful work.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
There's one problem.

403
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's all inconsistent.

404
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And here's the problem.

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Consider the class of all classes that are not members themselves.

406
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So in other words, just take AX as X is not a member of X.

407
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Then what happens?

408
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, breaks my heart.

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Because we end up saying, great.

410
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Y belongs to the set of all X, such that X is not a member of X,

411
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
if and only if.

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Now what?

413
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
A is true of Y, so Y is not a member of Y.

414
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Y belongs to the set of sets that are not members themselves,

415
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
if and only if Y isn't a member of itself, right?

416
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But now, wait a minute.

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We've said, what about that set itself?

418
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Does that set belong to itself or not?

419
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's a paradox.

420
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Because now we've plugged that set in.

421
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And so we can actually, let me give that set a name.

422
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It'll make it easier to see what's going on.

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's call this set just, well, R for Russell's set.

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Then we can say, OK, Y belongs to R, if and only if Y doesn't belong to Y.

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But now plug in R for Y.

426
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Ask, does that set belong to itself or not?

427
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And then we say, well, R belongs to R, if and only if.

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh, yeah.

429
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
R doesn't belong to R.

430
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And that's pretty bad.

431
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's just not pretty bad.

432
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's really bad.

433
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And so it turns out this simple way of doing things,

434
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
which now is called naive set theory, doesn't work out.

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So what do we do?

436
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well, there are various ways of trying to respond to this paradox.

437
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And they were really the chief obsession of mathematical logicians

438
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
for the first several decades of the 20th century.

439
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Russell discovered this and published it in 1902.

440
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Well, I think the letter to Frager was 1902.

441
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
He published the result in 1903.

442
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And right away people realized this is a fundamental problem

443
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
in the foundations of mathematics.

444
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
To explain why, I have to go back a little bit.

445
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I won't say much about this.

446
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But the calculus had been developed by Newton and by Leibniz

447
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
in the 17th century.

448
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It turned out to be immensely useful in science.

449
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We use the calculus in all sorts of ways.

450
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
In many, many different branches of science,

451
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
but definitely in physics.

452
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And it turned out that it talked about infinitesimal quantities.

453
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you think about the definition of a derivative,

454
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
it's really, well, now we do it in terms of limits.

455
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But then it was just done as really something that came to 0 over 0.

456
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And 0 over 0 doesn't make any sense.

457
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And so it was kind of like, ah, yes, f y minus f x over y minus x,

458
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
as we would now say, as y approaches x.

459
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But then we think, well, wait a minute.

460
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In the end, that is just 0 over 0.

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What do we do?

462
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Leibniz and Newton talked about infinitesimal quantities.

463
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
We'll divide this one infinitesimal quantity by this other infinitesimal quantity.

464
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What do you mean infinitesimal quantity?

465
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Now, Abraham Robinson did find a way in the later 20th century

466
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
to make sense of that talk.

467
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But throughout the 19th century, people realized we're using the calculus,

468
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
but it's all based on kind of something unintelligible

469
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that we don't really understand.

470
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And in fact, certain contradictions began emerging

471
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
in the foundations of the calculus.

472
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So people thought it was very important to try and construct it on a rigorous foundation.

473
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And Koshy, Dedekin, and a variety of other people throughout the 19th century did that.

474
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The great achievement, in a way, of 19th century mathematics

475
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
was the rigorization of mathematics

476
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and setting it on a firm foundation developing theories of limits

477
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of infinite sequences of convergence and so on.

478
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And so all of that was a great achievement.

479
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And Frager was basically saying,

480
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and so you can do it all with classes,

481
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
but oh, there's an inconsistency in the way you've been thinking about this.

482
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So it was as if people jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.

483
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
They had solved the problems in the foundations of the calculus

484
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
by using set theory and then realized, oh, crap.

485
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Set theory as we've been using it is inconsistent.

486
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What do we do?

487
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, they addressed this in a variety of ways.

488
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Russell developed the theory of types.

489
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He was talking about objects and then classes of objects

490
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and classes of classes of objects

491
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and classes of classes of objects and so on.

492
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And that's one way of approaching it.

493
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Kline himself developed something called new foundations

494
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
that tried to prevent any circularities

495
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and thought the problem was really the X belongings

496
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
who were not belonging to X,

497
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ruling such things out as illegitimate.

498
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The most standard way of doing this is Zermaylo-Frankl set theory.

499
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
These days called ZFC.

500
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Zermaylo-Frankl and then the axiom of choice.

501
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
C isn't a person, but an additional axiom.

502
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And the reason I mention it is not only is it the way that mathematics

503
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
is now standardly done, but it replaces this one principle

504
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
with a bunch of other principles.

505
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It restricts this to say you can only do this within a certain background set.

506
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So you can define a new set inside another set,

507
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
but not just out of thin air.

508
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It says pairs of things.

509
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You can basically, if you have two objects, X and Y,

510
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
you can have the pair set X, Y.

511
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You can take the power set of a set, the set of all the subsets and so on.

512
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
All of these are ways of building sets out of other sets.

513
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But there's one axiom that's different.

514
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There is an axiom called the axiom of infinity.

515
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And what it essentially says is there is

516
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
an infinite set.

517
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Now, why is that scary?

518
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, because it just makes that ball climb, right?

519
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It just says there is such a thing.

520
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And there's no way to get rid of that.

521
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's foundational in the theory.

522
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And what is a set?

523
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What is this infinite set?

524
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, the way it's usually done, it turns out it's an all set

525
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
together with the set containing an all set and the set containing that

526
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's the set containing all those things.

527
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And it's like, wait, I'm just coming out and saying that.

528
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's a pretty frightening thing to say.

529
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But however you do it, what you're really claiming is that.

530
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And now you can see, wait a minute, okay, the math part.

531
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That just commits me to the claim there is an infinite set,

532
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the way that's now done.

533
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And there's no way to get rid of that.

534
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
There's no way to, in fact, if I try to replace that with some physical object,

535
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
what could it possibly be, right?

536
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It would have to be an infinite object.

537
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And it would have to contain infinitely many other objects.

538
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You could maybe guess at what Freda thought near the end of his life about this.

539
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And actually, what I tried to do in my dissertation,

540
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
which was to say, what could a physical object that's infinite

541
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and contains infinitely many others as objects be?

542
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Be a region of space time.

543
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And so in the end, maybe,

544
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Freda thought we could reduce set theory to geometry

545
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and think of it as a theory of spatiotemporal regions.

546
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But that seems like the only hope.

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
In any event, it looks like math really does commit us to abstract objects.

548
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It commits us to at least one infinite set.

549
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
There's no obvious way of getting rid of that

550
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
in favor of just talking about physical objects.

551
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So anyway, this whole story has been,

552
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
why Klein transformed from a novelist to a flatness.

553
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Because, as Klein said in the end,

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
yes, physics commits me to all this,

555
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and I don't see how to get rid of it.

556
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah?

557
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
How could a region be infinite?

558
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Well, think of all the points inside that region.

559
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, it's not a closed curve, if I close it.

560
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Think of the points inside that region.

561
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
There would be incredibly many points.

562
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But is that infinite?

563
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh, yeah.

564
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah.

565
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But that assumes the continuity of space-time for one thing.

566
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And one of the big reasons I sort of gave up on this

567
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
is not so much technically that I couldn't do it.

568
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's that, first of all, the structure of space-time

569
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
didn't seem to be necessary

570
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
in the way that mathematical truths are necessary.

571
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It feels as if the actual structure of space-time

572
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
is something that's contingent.

573
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Right?

574
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Is it Euclidean?

575
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Is it non-Euclidean?

576
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What's the curvature of space?

577
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Is it discrete ultimately or continuous?

578
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It feels like those questions could go either way.

579
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Right?

580
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah, I don't want to say, all right, kids,

581
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
one plus one is two.

582
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Provided that space-time is continuous.

583
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You know, the curvature of space is blah, blah, blah.

584
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So it's like, no, that's crazy.

585
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So it introduces a contingency,

586
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
which is part of what bothered me about it.

587
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But the other thing that bothered me about it

588
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
is that I see how to actually make sense of the idea

589
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
of an uncountable infinity.

590
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But actually, so I've got something the size

591
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
of the real numbers there.

592
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But wait a minute.

593
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What I need are higher levels of infinity.

594
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
How do I get the idea of, like, now, the cardinality

595
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
of all of the power set of that,

596
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
of all the subsets of this?

597
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It looks like, wait a minute,

598
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the power set of all the subsets of that region

599
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
is just the region, right?

600
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So it's not clear how you ever get above

601
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the cardinality of the real numbers.

602
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I didn't know how to solve that problem either.

603
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And I want more than the real numbers.

604
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I want to be able to talk about functions on the real numbers,

605
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
which requires me to talk about sets of real numbers.

606
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And so it requires something fancier

607
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
than regions of space-time.

608
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And so then I had various tricks, technically.

609
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But in the end, I thought philosophically,

610
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
it made no sense.

611
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So in any event, that's why I, too,

612
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
stopped being an analyst at a little confession time.

613
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But anyway, Kwan didn't really take that detour.

614
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
He just said, yeah, it seems to me

615
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
what we've learned from the paradoxes.

616
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And the way of reformulating mathematics

617
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in the life of the paradoxes is you can't get rid of

618
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
a commitment to abstract objects.

619
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You end up having to commit yourself to sets.

620
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Now, I see that excited a few of you

621
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and bored to tears the rest of you.

622
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So let's go back to the objects that might be introduced,

623
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
not by science, but by, for example, natural language.

624
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So he's worried about these things.

625
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And in the end, he says, yes, these things

626
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
we have to be committed to before to do science.

627
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So he thinks those really do answer the question,

628
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
what is there?

629
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
What is there?

630
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
In the end, the physical objects, as described by physics,

631
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and sets.

632
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But now, what else might we worry about?

633
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Well, one thing that he's concerned about is actual use.

634
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Right?

635
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In other words, proverbs.

636
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Or more broadly, relations, et cetera.

637
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Do we have to think that those things exist?

638
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Well, last time, we looked at some examples,

639
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:45,000
like the clock has rattles.

640
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We could existentially quantify it,

641
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
so the clock has something.

642
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Remember that inference?

643
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Actually, I think we talked about pebbles,

644
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
which is an example of what there is.

645
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What should we do about that?

646
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Doesn't it follow that, therefore, the clock has something?

647
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,000
In which case, we're committed to attributes.

648
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
If you're already committed to abstract objects,

649
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
why is committing to attributes as abstract objects

650
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
extend your anthropology?

651
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's a great question.

652
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You might think, look, there are places to man the barricades

653
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
philosophically, and places not.

654
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You might think, indeed, the nominalists think,

655
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
typically, abstract objects are the place to do it.

656
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Universals.

657
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
By the way, Quine conflates those two issues.

658
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
There really are separate issues.

659
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The abstract concrete distinction and the universal

660
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
particular distinction are not the same distinction.

661
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He recognizes that in word and object.

662
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
He says, oh yeah, there are these kind of abstract

663
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
particulars like the equator.

664
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Whatever.

665
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Let's go on to typical cases.

666
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But anyway, that aside, you might think,

667
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
yeah, look, abstract and concrete,

668
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
that's a big place to draw the fighting line.

669
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
After all, concrete objects are ones

670
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I can come into contact with.

671
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Maybe I can experience them.

672
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
At any rate, I can come into some kind of causal

673
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
contact with them, even some micro-particle

674
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
that I could never directly experience,

675
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
causally interact with me.

676
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I can have a theory of that causal interaction.

677
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So concrete objects, I'm happy to admit into my

678
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
ontology because I'm interacting with them all the time.

679
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And I explain how, therefore, I can know about them.

680
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
But an abstract object isn't the kind of thing

681
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I can causally interact with.

682
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's not just that I can't experience it.

683
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't see roundness in the way that I see

684
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
the clock, for example.

685
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But also, and I don't see the number three,

686
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
for example, I might see three birds on a wire.

687
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And so you might think, yeah, look,

688
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't experience these.

689
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't have causal contact with them.

690
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And so this is a place to fight.

691
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But once I've lost that fight,

692
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
once I have to recognize sense,

693
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you might say, now, why not just

694
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
in for a penny, in for a pound?

695
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I've already got sense.

696
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I've already made that purchase.

697
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Why not go ahead and buy the full package

698
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and get HBO and Cinemax 2 as a word?

699
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Might as well get attributes.

700
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It might as well sign on for propositions

701
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and facts and all the rest of it.

702
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because after all, they're a small additional cost.

703
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Not true in the case of movie packages.

704
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But you might think it is true.

705
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Here, Fimmelsoff, why not?

706
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Now, I think that's a great question.

707
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Why does Quine spend a lot of time

708
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
worrying about these?

709
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Two parts to the question, really.

710
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If science is what tells us what there is,

711
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
who cares what we say in natural language?

712
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And second part of the question is,

713
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
once you've, in effect, admitted these,

714
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
now, why should it matter to you

715
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
whether there are additional kinds of abstract objects

716
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
like attributes and relations and propositions

717
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and meanings and so on?

718
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Because they're different, right?

719
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
They are different.

720
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Now, how are they different?

721
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Why does he really resist them?

722
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because we love the dog.

723
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay, good.

724
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like, doghood is completely different

725
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
from saying that this is a dog, an individual dog,

726
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and then you have another individual dog, right?

727
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Right.

728
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Okay, good.

729
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Now, Quine says that he's looking for something

730
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that's explanatory.

731
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And he says, are physical explanations

732
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
involve physical objects?

733
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
They involve mathematics.

734
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But I don't think this explains anything, okay?

735
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
In other words, he said,

736
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and in part is a willingness to say,

737
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm happy to recognize

738
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
ontological commitments where something is introduced

739
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to explain the experiences I have,

740
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
to explain the appearances, to explain the world.

741
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But I don't think introducing a form like roundness

742
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
does any explaining at all.

743
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You say, aha, the clock is round.

744
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Why is the clock round?

745
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The answer is, well, it has roundness.

746
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Do I learn anything from that?

747
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Does it explain anything?

748
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I think his answer is no.

749
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And so the way he sees it, it's like this.

750
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I've got two ways of putting things.

751
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I can say the clock is round.

752
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Or I can say the clock has roundness.

753
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And now he's saying,

754
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
which one of those is explanatory prime?

755
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Does the clock have roundness because it's round?

756
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Or is the clock round because it has roundness?

757
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What should I say?

758
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Which of those is more fundamental?

759
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Which gives me an explanation.

760
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The clock is round.

761
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

762
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
He says, look, the clock is round.

763
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's the thing that explains this other thing, right?

764
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Why do I say it has roundness?

765
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Because it's round.

766
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That's the fundamental thing.

767
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And saying it has roundness doesn't explain anything at all.

768
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
In fact, there's a sort of paradox you can keep going.

769
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Why does it have roundness?

770
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Because it has the property of having roundness.

771
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Or it and roundness are in the participation margin.

772
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And so if you start making this move,

773
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
this is something called the Bradley Regress.

774
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You might worry it keeps going.

775
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And a lot of nominalists have been motivated

776
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
by that Bradley Regress thinking,

777
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I don't know where it stops.

778
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
If the clock is round, something like RC

779
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
is explained by C having R-ness,

780
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
that it seems like now I've got the relation of having

781
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
linking C and roundness.

782
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And then you might say, oh, now I've got

783
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
some other special relation linking having

784
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and C and roundness.

785
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And well, you can see I can just keep doing this forever.

786
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But even if you say, well, maybe I can stop this regress here,

787
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
it's not clear what that's accomplishing.

788
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So I think that's part of his reason.

789
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
He thinks this isn't doing any explaining.

790
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It's really derivative.

791
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And there are other reasons too.

792
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
How do I know how to talk about roundness?

793
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It's epistemologically by virtue of interacting with round things.

794
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So the explanatory priority of this

795
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
is mirrored by its epistemic priority.

796
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I encounter the clock and I see that it's round.

797
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't encounter roundness in the same way.

798
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It seems indirect by virtue of encountering round things.

799
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And so you might say, I say this after learning

800
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the talk of properties and attributes and so on,

801
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
because I think that's not the other way around.

802
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The little baby doesn't start speaking as a Platonist.

803
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, Mama exemplified here.

804
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But instead talks about Mama, OK?

805
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And we'll learn to say, you know, green or something.

806
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And so anyway, he's motivated in part by that.

807
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Well, he thinks we can get rid of talk of meanings

808
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
of propositions of attributes.

809
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And here's one way to do it, right?

810
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The clock has roundness.

811
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Oh, very easy.

812
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Just translate that into the clock is round.

813
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Now what about this?

814
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Roundness is an attribute.

815
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
How do we get rid of that?

816
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
After all, roundness in that sort of having round this position,

817
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
that's easy to replace with a predicate.

818
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But here we've got a subject position.

819
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If Quine's right, we can rephrase all of these things.

820
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And notice in the logic decision chapter,

821
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
he really, for that matter, on what there is,

822
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
he gives you a few examples, but he doesn't give you

823
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
any programmatic way of doing this.

824
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So we've got to be creative here.

825
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's not like he tells us how to do most of this stuff.

826
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He just gives us a couple of examples and says, see?

827
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But now here, what could we do?

828
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

829
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Is this maybe a good example of you turning roundness into a verb?

830
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Like roundness is kind of doing a certain work,

831
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
like theoretically and trying to explain it.

832
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yes.

833
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That's true.

834
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And so one way to do it would be to say,

835
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
well, here our strategy was to replace

836
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
talk of roundness with talk of round things.

837
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So maybe we could say round things.

838
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh, we don't want to say have an attribute.

839
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We could say round things are blank for some blank.

840
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Or another way to do it, the way Carnap does it actually

841
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
in the logical syntax of language,

842
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
is to go into what he calls the formal mode

843
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
by what Quine later calls semantic ascent.

844
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So this is just saying round is imaginative.

845
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Which is a little weird because there we replace it

846
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
with round things, and here we replace it with round.

847
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But that might be less strange if we think here

848
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
we're really saying, well, the word round is true of the clock.

849
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Well, in the closing moment here,

850
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
let me just say something about how he gets rid of meanings.

851
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Because this ends up being a major strategy for Quine.

852
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
How do we get rid of meanings?

853
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Instead of talking about the meaning of a sentence,

854
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
he says we can just replace that with, first of all,

855
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the talk of the sentence being meaningful.

856
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So first of all, you draw a distinction between the meaningful

857
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and the insignificant, the meaningless, I suppose.

858
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's one way.

859
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But the other thing we need talk of meanings for

860
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
is to say when things have the same meaning.

861
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And so it's that, and then we have identity, basically,

862
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
which is a matter here of saying when things have the same meaning,

863
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
we can talk about synonymy.

864
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And so in general, this becomes his strategy.

865
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
We say, first there's the existence question,

866
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
whether something has a meaning or not.

867
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And secondly, the identity question,

868
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
when does this have the same meaning as that?

869
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And he's going to do that with all sorts of things.

870
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Propositions.

871
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It'll just be when does something express a proposition,

872
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and then when does it express the same proposition.

873
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So it will not be essentially equivalent to talking about meanings.

874
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And in the end, all we have to do is talk about

875
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
significant or insignificant sentences,

876
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and then sentences meaning the same as other sentences.

877
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So that's the general recipe he's going to use

878
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
for a lot of these abstract objects.

879
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Just introduce a way of talking about the existence of such a thing,

880
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and then what is that, the same one of those,

881
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and there's no need any longer to talk about the propositions

882
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
or the facts or the attributes of the meanings.
