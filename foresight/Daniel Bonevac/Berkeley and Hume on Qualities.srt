1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,100
One of the most basic philosophical questions is the relation between mind and world.

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,080
How exactly does my mind relate to the world?

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,320
I hope to know things about the world, I hope to understand it, I hope to be able to act

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,760
in the world in a way that makes sense, is reasonable, and will let me succeed at achieving

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,880
my goals.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
But it's hard to do that.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,520
I don't know how the thoughts, the desires, the intentions, the plans I make, the other

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,240
aspects of my mental life correspond to the world.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,720
So the question of the relationship between mind and world is really fundamental.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,840
I want to know to what extent they correspond and various things that I think I want to

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,640
know whether they're reflecting things that are really going on in the world or whether

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,080
they're things that I am contributing, that I am maybe hoping for or fantasizing or in

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,160
some other way getting wrong about reality.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,760
It's going to affect the way I act, it's going to affect the way I think, what I take

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,720
to be a belief, what I take to be knowledge, I'm going to get into a lot of trouble conceivably

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,640
if I've got a lot of things going on in my mind that correspond to nothing in the world.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,000
Descartes and Locke draw a fundamental distinction that's supposed to help us understand this

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,920
question, the distinction between primary qualities of objects and secondary qualities.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,400
The primary qualities are really in the things themselves.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,400
They're inseparable from the things themselves, they're constant, whereas the secondary qualities

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,800
are a matter of how those things affect us.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,840
They're being contributed by the mind.

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
So our ideas of secondary qualities, things like colors and tastes and textures, those

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
are not really in the world, those are being contributed by the mind.

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,040
But things like extension, solidity, mass, movement, those are really in the world, those

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,280
are primary qualities of the things themselves.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,960
So to some extent our minds are getting the world right, Descartes and Locke think.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,600
They are matching characteristics of the world.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Descartes and Locke are what we had called today scientific realists.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,160
Science is revealing the real essences of things, the true nature of things, and the

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,800
qualities that are identified by science as going on in the world, those are the real

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,520
qualities of objects.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,120
But everything else is something that our mind is contributing, it's a question of

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,360
how those things are affecting our perceptual and cognitive faculties.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,120
They're not really in the world.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,000
That kind of distinction between the qualities that are really in the things themselves,

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,180
and described by science, and the things that are not really in the things themselves but

38
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,360
contributed by the mind, came under surprising and sustained attack.

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,560
It was begun by Bishop Barkley, responding to Locke, continued by David Hume, and then

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,760
spawns an entire idealist tradition that has dominated much of the philosophical world

41
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,080
for the last couple of centuries.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,080
So it's sort of surprising that that took place, given that our ordinary attitude I

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,200
think is very much in line with a primary, secondary quality distinction.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,880
But today I want to talk about Barkley and Hume and their attack on that distinction,

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,640
their conception of qualities.

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,920
They're going to say there is no place for the kind of distinction that Descartes and

47
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Locke are drawing, no way for us to say those qualities are really in the objects themselves.

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,280
In fact, in their view, everything is going to end up being something like a secondary

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,080
quality, everything really turns out to depend on the mind.

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,520
Well, Bishop George Barkley himself was the Dean of Derry.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,040
He was Irish, lived in Northern Ireland specifically.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,600
He was a philosopher of the 18th century, as you can see here, and he was a very notable

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,520
character, important in the history of philosophy for starting that entire tradition within

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
Western philosophy.

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,720
Here you see him pictured with a group of people referred to as his entourage.

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,160
Barkley held that idealism, the thesis that everything in the world is mind dependent,

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,160
that the entire world, as we understand it, is really a projection or construction of

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
the mind.

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,880
That's the best defense of common sense against skepticism.

60
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,560
He thinks in particular that Descartes and Locke's ideas of objects make no sense and

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,800
attacks the concept of a primary quality.

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,520
He correspondingly attacks the concept of a substance, of a material object in general.

63
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,200
In the end, he says there are only ideas.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,840
The entire world is a construction of the mind.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,120
The world has to be understood as fundamentally mental or spiritual.

66
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,720
Well, how does this constitute a defense against skepticism?

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,200
You might think of it as a surrender to the skeptic.

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,840
After all, Barkley seems to be saying, well, gosh, mind.

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,480
Everything is really mind, so nothing corresponds to the world.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Wow, why aren't we skeptics as a result?

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,040
He doesn't think that's what he's doing.

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Instead, he thinks what's happening is that the danger of skepticism is the gap between

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
mind and world.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,360
I've got a set of ideas about things.

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,760
I think certain things are true about the world, and if there's a gap between the way

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,880
I think and what's really going on in the world, then there is the danger that a lot

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,760
of my thinking diverges, and a lot of my beliefs diverge from the way the world really is.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,840
That's what gives skepticism its power.

79
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,340
We think about scenarios where I'm wrong about this or that, or maybe everything as

80
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,840
in Descartes' evil deceiver scenario.

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,400
Well, how does he propose to get rid of that?

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,040
Notice Descartes and Locke are saying, let's use science to help address that.

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,640
Some things, yes, we're going to have to surrender to the skeptics.

84
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
There really are no colors.

85
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,200
There really are no textures.

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,660
But there really is such a thing as mass.

87
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,240
There really is extension in space.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,800
There really is solidity and motion and so forth.

89
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,160
Barkley and Hume both are going to say, I don't think that will do it.

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,060
Science will not give us a way of drawing that distinction.

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,040
The best way of getting rid of the gap between mind and world is to push the world up into

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
the mind.

93
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,120
If the world is mental through and through, if all we've got are ideas, there's no problem

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
that how our ideas match the world.

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,400
The world consists of our ideas.

96
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
That's it.

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,680
So there's a sense in which it does get rid of skepticism.

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,080
It gets rid of the gap between mind and the world because the world is entirely mental.

99
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,980
It is itself a projection or construction of mind.

100
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,440
So there is no gap.

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,020
There's no place for the skeptic to get a foothold and drive a wedge and say, maybe

102
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,560
we're wrong about this.

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
What do you mean?

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
We're wrong about our own ideas?

105
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,800
Our ideas are our ideas.

106
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
That is the world.

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
That's all there is.

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,080
There isn't any longer any gap.

109
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,720
Well, that's an unusual strategy.

110
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,480
But let's go back to what Descartes and Locke have in mind and see why Barclay thinks it

111
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
doesn't work.

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,400
A primary quality is in the object itself.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
It's constant.

114
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,960
It's the thing that we find even in the most minute part of the object.

115
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,760
So things like extension, figure, motion, rest, solidity, impenetrability, number.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,400
These are things that are there in the wheatberry.

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,320
They're also there in the flour.

118
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,680
The secondary qualities can differ.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,440
They are the powers of the object to affect us.

120
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,600
They are often not in its minute parts.

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,440
So the color of the object, once we pound it, may become quite different.

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,680
The way it sounds may be quite different.

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,120
Drop a pound of flour on the floor, it's going to sound differently from a pound of wheatberries

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,400
being dropped on the floor.

125
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,000
And in general, the secondary qualities are going to change between the large parts of

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,760
the object and the small parts of the object.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Sometimes we will perceive them that way, sometimes not.

128
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,120
They are dependent on the mind, dependent on our own perceptual and cognitive faculties.

129
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Well, that's the distinction.

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
That's the way it's supposed to go.

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,120
But Barclay says, actually, we have no basis for thinking that any of our ideas correspond

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,840
to some mind-independent reality.

133
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,520
The whole idea here is supposed to be that some ideas, like the idea of mass or the idea

134
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,960
of velocity, the idea of motion, the idea of taking up some space, those really correspond

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
to the world.

136
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,880
But things like color and texture and taste don't.

137
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,160
Barclay says, actually, I don't see how there's a basis for thinking that any of them do,

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,320
even the primary ones.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,600
There are several reasons he gives for this.

140
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,920
One of the arguments is that we can't judge their resemblance to reality.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,040
Locke and Descartes say the primary qualities are adequate.

142
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,960
They correspond to the way the world really is.

143
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Barclay says, how would you know?

144
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:44,080
Our perceptions of heights, of weight, of width, and so on, he says moreover, are not

145
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
constant.

146
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,000
They vary while the objects remain unchanged.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,640
So that's the second argument.

148
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,200
First argument is there's no way to judge this resemblance.

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
We can't have access.

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,760
We basically can't get outside of our heads to judge whether our ideas are matching the

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
world.

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,240
One is, you say the test is whether they're constant and invariable and inseparable.

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,200
Actually primary qualities are just as inseparable, just as variable.

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,000
So let's look at those arguments in turn.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Here is the first argument about resemblance.

156
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Barclay says an idea can be like nothing but an idea.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,120
A color or figure can be like nothing but another color, another figure.

158
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,760
If we look but ever so little into our thoughts, we shall find it impossible for us to conceive

159
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,160
a likeness except only between our ideas.

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,560
So the whole thought of Locke and Descartes of a primary quality is it's an idea that

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
matches the world.

162
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,400
But what do you mean, match the world?

163
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,760
What do you mean there's a resemblance between this, that it's adequate in the sense that

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,640
it matches or corresponds to what's in the world exactly?

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,960
How would we know is partly Barclay's issue, and partly the issue is what without even

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
mean.

167
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
An idea is an idea.

168
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,840
It's something in my mind, and it's supposed to be something that corresponds to or matches

169
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,080
precisely or resembles something that's really in the world.

170
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,560
Well, I don't understand what this sense of resemblance could be.

171
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,880
So I don't know what it would mean for an idea to resemble something that's not an idea,

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,600
but also even if that made sense, I wouldn't know how on earth to get outside the realm

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,520
of my ideas to be able to compare it to a thing unaffected by my ideas.

174
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,760
So in a way he's giving us a version of that argument from comparison, saying I am always

175
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,600
perceiving a thing as processed by my faculties, I am always perceiving the thing by virtue

176
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
of an idea.

177
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,720
What's before my mind is always an idea.

178
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't compare the idea to something that is not an idea.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,520
I can compare ideas to ideas that I can do, but I can't compare ideas to something else.

180
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,360
So not only do I deny he's saying that there is any way for there to be a resemblance here,

181
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,560
but even if there were, how could I know it?

182
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,600
I'd never be able to get at the thing itself to compare.

183
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,680
So I think what really is going on here is something that relates to Locke's conception.

184
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,040
When we were talking about Locke on ideas, I pointed out that the way he characterizes

185
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
them is actually somewhat puzzling.

186
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,160
He says that an idea is whatsoever is the object of the understanding what a man thinks.

187
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,400
It's whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking.

188
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,600
It's what his mind is applied about while thinking.

189
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,720
Well, I tried to reconstruct that in terms of first-order cognitive abilities, but Barclay

190
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
is taking Locke's words very literally and very directly.

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
He's saying it's what I'm thinking about.

192
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,240
It is what is before my mind when I'm thinking.

193
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,800
Well, if that's right, then I can never think about the triangle, for example, directly.

194
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I never think about the paper directly.

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,960
Always what's before the mind is my idea of the paper.

196
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,800
So my thoughts are really about the idea.

197
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Now that's what worried us before about Locke's definition, but Barclay is going to push that

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
in a certain direction.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,680
He's going to say, look, if what's before my mind when I'm thinking is always an idea,

200
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,840
and then you ask me to judge resemblance, what am I doing?

201
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,600
What's before the mind here?

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,360
Let's say it's these two hands.

203
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm asked to judge whether this is similar to that.

204
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,560
OK, I can know how to do that because they're hands, but what am I doing when I do it?

205
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,920
I've got two ideas, two perceptions in my mind, and I'm comparing those.

206
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,480
So I'm doing it by comparing the ideas.

207
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
Now you say, don't compare the two hands to one another.

208
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't compare the two ideas of the hands you have to one another.

209
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,640
Instead, compare the idea of this hand to the hand as it is in itself without using an

210
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,080
idea.

211
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,560
But wait, whatever's before my mind when I think is an idea according to Locke, I never

212
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,080
get at the thing itself without an idea in the way, without an idea in between.

213
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,480
So I can't do it.

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,160
A, I don't know what it even means since I have no experience of these things in themselves

215
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,440
to say what that kind of resemblance would even be.

216
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,400
But even if it makes sense, I can't get out of the realm of ideas to do it.

217
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,960
Every time I employ my mind in thinking, I've got an idea.

218
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,040
So at best, I could compare my idea of the thing to the idea of the thing.

219
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,360
Maybe I could do that.

220
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
But to compare the idea to the thing, impossible.

221
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
No way for me to do it.

222
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,800
Here is a little diagram that might indicate the general kind of thing that Locke seems

223
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,080
to have in mind and what drives Barclay crazy about it.

224
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,600
Within my mind, I have a certain thought of a triangle, let's say, since that's my favorite

225
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,640
example throughout this course.

226
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,960
That thought has a certain content, hey, that's a triangle.

227
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,200
It's using the content of my idea of a triangle.

228
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,400
And that represents that individual object.

229
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,360
Well, okay, that's supposed to be the picture.

230
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,120
And indeed, often that's described as the representative theory of perception.

231
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,400
I represent the triangle in my mind.

232
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,040
But wait a minute, Barclay says.

233
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,080
I don't quite understand what's happening here.

234
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,880
Let's take a look at how this is supposed to develop.

235
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,080
I've got an object I'm perceiving here, like this triangle.

236
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,760
And I within my mind do that by having a thought.

237
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,240
There's a relation of perception.

238
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,000
I perceive the triangle, so in some way the triangle is causing me to have this perception.

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
And it's got a certain content.

240
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,560
It's related to my idea or concept of a triangle.

241
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,240
And that concept applies to that triangle.

242
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm leaving out a lot of things here about the word that might go along and relations

243
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,560
of meaning and reference and all of that.

244
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,640
But the point emerges with something very simple.

245
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Because notice what's going on.

246
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,280
How am I able to think about this triangle?

247
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,840
I think about it by virtue of the fact of having an idea.

248
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,360
Now I say whenever I'm thinking, that's what's before the mind, the idea.

249
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,680
So think of the mind as something like a screen.

250
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,280
And what's playing on the screen are my ideas.

251
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,920
Ah, now the question that Locke and Descartes are trying to solve is this question of the

252
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,360
relationship between my idea and the thing.

253
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,600
I want to know whether there is in particular the kind of resemblance that will allow me

254
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,960
to say this idea is adequate to the thing.

255
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,200
It's a good representation of the thing.

256
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I want there to be a relation of representation here.

257
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,520
And so I need to judge the adequacy of this to use Locke's term.

258
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:40,520
And I'm going to do that, Barkley says, in terms of resemblance.

259
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,680
But now notice what's going on.

260
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,440
I have to judge the resemblance between my idea and the thing.

261
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,920
But everything that is within my mind here that I have access to is an idea.

262
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
So how do I get the thing itself?

263
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:03,640
I've got to compare now this, that idea, to this, this thing.

264
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,040
But how on earth do I do that?

265
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,160
You want me to think about that thing in itself?

266
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,480
Well, I do that by virtue of having this idea.

267
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,400
If you want me to think about the idea, OK, I guess I can have an idea of an idea.

268
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,840
But notice, that's not going to help me.

269
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,560
I still don't get at this relation.

270
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,760
I now have to think about this relation.

271
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
You say, well, think about the idea of that.

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,040
Well now I get something else here.

273
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
I can have ideas about my ideas about my ideas.

274
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
But you get the point.

275
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,600
I never get outside of my own mind to the thing itself.

276
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
So I can't judge the resemblance.

277
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,040
So first of all, I have no experience of this kind of relationship between an idea and a

278
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,200
thing.

279
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,760
And remember, Barkley, like Locke, is an empiricist.

280
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,240
He's saying, if I have an idea, it's coming from some impression, some perception or experience.

281
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,320
But I don't have an experience of this.

282
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,760
All the mental experiencing I'm having of comparing is within my own mind of ideas to

283
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,080
ideas, or ideas of one thing to ideas of another thing.

284
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,480
And then, where could I do this?

285
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,880
It's the moment you ask me this question and make me think about it, I'm forming more

286
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
ideas.

287
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,720
And so I never get at the thing itself.

288
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,960
I can't get out of it.

289
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Now that's part of what's driving Barkley crazy.

290
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,840
But part of it is, and this is beautiful in a way, he frames this in terms of a dilemma

291
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,000
for Locke.

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,680
He says, look, I don't understand.

293
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,400
In this kind of picture, can I think about the triangle?

294
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,440
Can I perceive the triangle?

295
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,280
He says, I ask whether these supposed originals or external things, of which our ideas are

296
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,840
the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or no.

297
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
If they are, then they're ideas.

298
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,920
And we've gained our point.

299
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,840
But if you say they're not, I appeal to anyone whether it be sense to assert that a color

300
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,520
is like something that's invisible, hard or soft like something that's intangible, and

301
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,620
so on of the rest.

302
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,440
So he's basically saying, OK, I want to ask you a question about this thing.

303
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,480
I want to ask a question about this triangle, the thing itself, this external object, this

304
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,360
original, as he puts it.

305
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,920
And I want to say, is that something I can perceive or no?

306
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Locke, you've said that ideas are what's before the mind.

307
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Well, you also characterize this in representational terms.

308
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,480
That idea is supposed to represent the thing out there in the mind, or out there in the

309
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
world.

310
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Well, can I perceive that thing or not?

311
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,760
If you say yes, I can perceive that thing, wait a minute, what do I perceive?

312
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,960
Everything before the mind is an idea.

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,120
So if you answer yes, I can perceive this, you've just put it in the mind and made it

314
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,920
into an idea by your own definition of idea.

315
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,600
So as you say, no, I can't perceive it.

316
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,040
Only ideas are the things I perceive.

317
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,600
Then it's even worse, because now you're saying, OK, I can't perceive this.

318
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I can't see it.

319
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,840
It's invisible.

320
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,960
And you're saying this idea is like something invisible?

321
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,600
That doesn't make any sense.

322
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,840
Little things don't have three sides and three angles.

323
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,600
This has three sides and three angles.

324
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,680
What are you talking about?

325
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,720
So in short, Barkley is saying there's something confused about the way that Locke is describing

326
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,520
this entire scenario.

327
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,800
What's before the mind is supposedly an idea, but the idea is supposed to represent a thing.

328
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,680
And yet whenever we think about anything, we're thinking about an idea.

329
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,080
Well, either that triangle, that thing is just another idea, and it's really mental

330
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,560
and mind-dependent, or it's not.

331
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,880
But then this whole talk of representation makes no sense.

332
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,080
So he thinks he's got Locke in a real trap.

333
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,760
What are you going to say about these external objects?

334
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,160
Can I perceive them?

335
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,920
If yes, they're mental by your own definition.

336
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,840
If not, then they can't resemble any of these things that are ideas.

337
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,600
And either way, the theory is sunk.

338
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,160
So in our diagram, we can put it this way.

339
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Do I have a relation of perception between my thought and that actual triangle as external

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
to me?

341
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,120
If so, that object becomes an idea.

342
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,400
And if not, we can't evaluate resemblance.

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,360
There's no way to talk about adequacy or inadequacy.

344
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,240
The conclusion that Barkley draws is that there are no primary qualities.

345
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,280
Extension, figure, and motion are only ideas existing in the mind.

346
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,960
An idea can be like nothing but another idea.

347
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,360
Consequently, neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance.

348
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,680
Hence it's plain that the very notion of what's called matter or corporeal substance involves

349
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,520
a contradiction in it.

350
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,320
So notice here, he's arguing there are no primary qualities.

351
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,040
The moment you postulate some quality that is in the thing itself, I'm forced to talk

352
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,880
about the idea of that.

353
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,120
And ideas can be like nothing but another idea.

354
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,960
So actually, they can't exist independently of the mind.

355
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,360
If I'm to talk about adequacy or representation or any kind of match or resemblance, then

356
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,480
they have to be mental, along with the ideas that I can characterize in this way.

357
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,680
But then they aren't really substances.

358
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
They aren't really matter.

359
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,800
They're creatures of the mind.

360
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,680
And so there is no way to talk about qualities.

361
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,080
They're really out there in the thing itself, independently of the mind.

362
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,680
There is nothing independent of the mind.

363
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:39,280
Well, that is, he thinks, what follows from taking seriously Locke's talk that we think

364
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,680
by having ideas before the mind, and those ideas are meant to represent things.

365
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,120
Those things end up being mental.

366
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,120
And if that's true, there's no such thing as a primary quality.

367
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,200
There's no such thing as a material substance.

368
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,160
Let's take a look at the other argument he gives, an argument based on variability.

369
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,320
The whole way of distinguishing primary from secondary quality, he says, is supposed to

370
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,160
be that the primary qualities are inseparable.

371
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,680
They are constant.

372
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,200
But actually, they're not.

373
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,640
People's perceptions vary, says the argument from variability.

374
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,200
And there's no way to decide among them, so we should suspend judgment.

375
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Well, Barclay goes back to that skeptical form of argument and uses it against Locke,

376
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,640
and says, you say this is a reason for us to think that the secondary qualities aren't

377
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,980
really in the world.

378
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,240
They can vary.

379
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,560
They can depend on context.

380
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,480
They can depend on the perceiver.

381
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
And there's no way to decide what would really be in the object, so we should suspend judgment

382
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,000
about that and, in fact, deny that they are in the object.

383
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,040
He says, but wait a minute, the same thing applies to the primary qualities, too.

384
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,000
They also vary, and there's no way to decide among them.

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,360
So you claim that this will allow us to draw the distinction.

386
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,060
This set of qualities is invariable and inseparable.

387
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,100
This one is variable and separable.

388
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,740
Barclay says they're all variable.

389
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,540
They're all separable.

390
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,220
Nothing ends up being a primary quality by that criterion.

391
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,580
The perceptions we have of primary qualities vary, too.

392
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Now why?

393
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,360
Well, let's take a look, he says, at a mites view of the world.

394
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,740
This is an actual photograph of dust mites on a carpet.

395
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,060
Now to us, that carpet might look clean.

396
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,660
It might look bug-free.

397
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,300
It might look as if it's a smooth textured carpet.

398
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,140
To a mites, it looks very different.

399
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,020
It's crawling with other mites.

400
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,240
It's actually very rough and has a kind of texture that's quite complex.

401
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,500
It looks like a bowl of spaghetti.

402
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,980
And so the mites view of that is very different from our own view.

403
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,700
Even though notice here, we're not talking just about texture in the sense of being a

404
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,380
secondary quality, we're talking about the actual shape of the thing.

405
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,460
The shape looks really different from a mites point of view.

406
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,880
This is an even more disturbing photograph.

407
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,660
These are mites on human skin.

408
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,580
That is what human skin that feels smooth to us looks like to one of these mites.

409
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,020
Looks like a series of caverns, deeply disturbing.

410
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,020
Looks like that person badly needs some hand cream.

411
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,060
But whatever we want to conclude about that, the mites view, it is really different from

412
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,260
our view.

413
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,980
Even though again, we're talking about the shape.

414
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,260
We're talking about the extension of it.

415
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,620
We're talking about things that ought to be among the primary qualities.

416
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,460
But perceptions vary.

417
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,060
Among species, yes.

418
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,740
But even for us.

419
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,060
Phylonus, one of the characters in the dialogue here, says, from what you've laid down, it

420
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,660
follows that both the extension by you perceived and that perceived by the mite itself, as

421
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,860
likewise all those perceived by lesser animals, or each of them the true extension of the

422
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,100
mites foot.

423
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,900
After all, these are perceptions of a primary quality.

424
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,100
So they're supposed to be in the things themselves.

425
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,700
But Phylonus says, by that criterion, you're led into an absurdity.

426
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,660
We see this as having a certain kind of, now I don't want to say just texture, but a certain

427
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,860
kind of shape.

428
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
The mite views it as having a very different kind of shape.

429
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,140
What does that tell us?

430
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,260
If shape is a primary quality, that's supposed to be really in the thing.

431
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,300
But it's the shape as perceived by the mite that's in the thing, or the shape as perceived

432
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
by us that's in the thing.

433
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,740
We've got to say, if we really take that to correspond, in both cases, that they're

434
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
both in the thing.

435
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,140
But that's a manifest contradiction.

436
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,620
Well, it's not just a question of different species.

437
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,060
Maybe we want to say, I don't care how a mite sees things, or how an elephant would

438
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
see it, or a bat would see it.

439
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,500
I mean, maybe we should.

440
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,140
But suppose you say, let's stay in the human realm.

441
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,980
The same problem emerges.

442
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,780
Phylonus says, look, think about a human being.

443
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,900
As we approach an object or a seed from it, the visible extension varies, being at one

444
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,660
distance ten or a hundred times greater than another.

445
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Doth it not therefore follow from hence likewise that it's not really inherent in the object?

446
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,700
My perceptions vary.

447
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,820
Depending upon, well, all sorts of things, maybe dependent on my mood, depending upon

448
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,380
the time of day, how tired I am, but also on the basis of my distance from the object.

449
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,780
So here's an example.

450
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,900
This is a mountain known as Shiprock in northwestern New Mexico.

451
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,300
It was something that was used as a guidepost by people who were on wagon trains across the

452
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,760
west headed for California and other destinations.

453
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,420
You can see it from hundreds of miles away.

454
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,740
And here it is from hundreds of miles away.

455
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,680
It looks rather small there, and it's hard to tell how far away you are.

456
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,080
That might be a smaller mountain, and you're not that far away, or it might be a very large

457
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,120
mountain and you're quite far away.

458
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:59,320
In any case, as you approach Shiprock, it looks bigger and bigger.

459
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,720
And by the time you get right up to it, you realize this thing is huge.

460
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,000
That's why you can see it hundreds of miles away and why it was a good guidepost for

461
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,360
people seeking to cross the desert.

462
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,160
Well, that sort of thing is not just something that happens in wagon trains, it's something

463
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,640
that happens all the time.

464
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,720
I see something across the room, and it looks very small.

465
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,280
In fact, you might ask me a question about it, and I might find it hard to answer.

466
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,920
I could hold up these keys, for example, and ask you about the shape of the keys, and you

467
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,800
might say, well, they look very small.

468
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,760
But if I bring it toward the camera, they look larger and larger.

469
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,880
And indeed, if I bring them closer to my eyes, they look bigger and bigger in my visual field.

470
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
That kind of thing is commonplace.

471
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,680
I see something far away as I'm driving.

472
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,520
It looks very small, far away.

473
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
I might be driving toward Dallas.

474
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I see the Dallas skyline, but I'm far away.

475
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,000
And I think, well, Dallas doesn't look that impressive.

476
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,440
But then when I get up close to it, I realize, oh, this is a big city, and it looks much

477
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,920
more impressive.

478
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,360
The same thing can happen when you're flying over something.

479
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,200
Imagine being in an airplane looking down on, let's say, New York City.

480
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,300
I've often flown over New York City.

481
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,960
You look down, and from a distance or a very high height, it doesn't look that big.

482
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,400
And the buildings there are barely discernible.

483
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
It looks tiny.

484
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,240
But on the other hand, when you're flying much lower over it, things look large.

485
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,440
And of course, if you're there just in a building, like at the top of the Empire State Building

486
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,280
looking at it, it looks huge.

487
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,760
So New York City is something that looks gigantic.

488
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,000
When you're close up, it can look small if you're far away.

489
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,220
You might have had the experience being very in a very tall tower, a tall office building

490
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,680
or something like that, where you look down at the road and people look like ants.

491
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Well, that's because they look really small when you're far away.

492
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,320
On the other hand, when you're up close, you realize, no, they're the normal size for people.

493
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,520
And that sort of phenomenon is every day.

494
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,360
So yes, the sizes of things can vary, not only from context to context.

495
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,480
I mean, something might look much smaller if I put it next to something that's really large.

496
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,960
And in fact, often people, to take a photograph of something really large, will put something

497
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,760
next to it or have a person stand next to it or something so that you get a sense of

498
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,040
scale and so that you can see, look, I know it looks small in the photograph, this thing

499
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
is really large.

500
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,800
And that's because all of these things can affect our perception, our perception of primary

501
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,880
qualities.

502
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,920
The same thing can happen with respect to something like mass or motion.

503
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,760
The same motion might feel very fast or very slow, depending upon the context.

504
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,240
In this case, not how close we are to it, though that can be true too, watch an airplane

505
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,320
go across the sky.

506
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,960
The plane is going at hundreds of miles an hour, but it looks for our vantage point

507
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,200
on the ground as if it's traveling very slowly.

508
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
The same thing can happen if you've ever flown a plane.

509
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,520
I have.

510
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,080
And when you stop flying a plane and get into your car, for example, the speed you're going

511
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,720
in a car feels so unbelievably slow.

512
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,920
I had a friend who was a pilot and he was constantly getting speeding tickets.

513
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,240
And it's not really just because he was the kind of person who speeds a lot and ignores

514
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
the law.

515
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,520
It's because when you've been up in an airplane, the speeds you get used to are the speeds

516
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,680
of going hundreds of miles an hour.

517
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,120
When you then are on the ground traveling at 60, it feels like you're crawling.

518
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,000
And so that kind of thing is a phenomenon we're familiar with.

519
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,920
But wait, velocity was a primary quality.

520
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,600
So is that airplane moving across the sky quickly or not?

521
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,680
Well, we're perceiving a primary quality of motion there.

522
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,840
But the feeling for the pilot and the feeling of us on the ground can't both be right.

523
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,760
They can't both match the actual velocity.

524
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,120
And the same thing is true of driving a car when you haven't driven in a while and then

525
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,280
when you've been flying an airplane.

526
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,560
It's the same velocity, but one time it feels fast to you, another time it feels slow.

527
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,600
It can't be both fast and slow.

528
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,380
But again, motion, velocity, is supposed to be a primary quality.

529
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,120
So it looks like we're immediately led into trouble.

530
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,080
Filonius concludes in the dialogue, this isn't in the object.

531
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,720
He says, is it not the very same reasoning to conclude that there is no extension or

532
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
a figure in an object?

533
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,880
Because to one eye, it shall seem little, smooth, and round, while at the same time

534
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,720
it appears to the other great, uneven, and regular.

535
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,600
Hylis, who is defending the Lochte-Cart point of view in the dialogue, says, the very same.

536
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,720
But does this latter fact ever happen?

537
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,920
Filonius says you may at any time make the experiment by looking with one eye bare and

538
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,000
with another through a microscope.

539
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,640
So doubt the examples I've given about mites, about speeds of airplanes, about other things.

540
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,200
Maybe they don't convince you, but Filo says, hey, look at a leaf.

541
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,960
Here's how a leaf looks every day.

542
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,960
And we can describe, not just its secondary qualities, its green and so on, but its primary

543
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:07,520
qualities, describe its shape, describe the actual figure that it corresponds to, describe

544
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,880
it in any way you like, and now look through a microscope.

545
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,240
It looks like that.

546
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,120
Now, yes, its secondary qualities have changed, but the primary qualities have changed too.

547
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,640
That bottom edge, for example, looks smooth.

548
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not smooth.

549
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,720
It's pretty bumpy.

550
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,440
And the same thing is going to be true of all sorts of primary qualities of the thing.

551
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,680
Your perception will be very different through a microscope.

552
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,200
You'll be seeing it very up close.

553
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,200
And your perception of the size, of the velocity, of the shape, all of that is going to

554
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,840
be quite different.

555
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,280
Conclusion, Barclay draws, there's no distinction between primary and secondary qualities.

556
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,320
They're all in the mind alone.

557
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,280
If we insist on using those terms at all, the point is all of those qualities are really

558
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,240
secondary qualities.

559
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,280
And so we should be idealists about all qualities, none of them are in the things themselves.

560
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,160
They are all in the mind alone.

561
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,720
Everything is really a construction or a projection of the mind.

562
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,680
Every single quality we attribute to an object is mind dependent.

563
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
It is variable.

564
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
It is separable.

565
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,800
It is the kind of thing that is there in the mind, but is not there in the object.

566
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,320
I want to leave you with a question.

567
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,920
We've been attacking here with Barclay that distinction between the primary and secondary

568
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,520
qualities.

569
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,840
But could we do this in a different way?

570
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,680
Instead of saying all qualities are really primary, could we do it in the opposite way?

571
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,600
Actually, they're all in the object.

572
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
They're all primary qualities.

573
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,360
Now notice we would have to get rid of Locke's idea that everything before the mind is really

574
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
an idea.

575
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,040
We'd have to say, no, I can perceive the triangle.

576
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,240
I don't have to just have an idea before the mind.

577
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,920
The triangle can really be before my mind.

578
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:09,720
I would also have to say that actually these tests of constancy and invariableness, maybe

579
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,400
those aren't the right tests.

580
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,560
The right test is something else.

581
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,000
But even a secondary quality, maybe I could push all of those into the thing.

582
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,280
I can say, ah, you think the yellow isn't really in the paper?

583
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,440
What if it is?

584
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,080
What if we end up saying, look, being yellow is just reflecting certain wavelengths of

585
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
light.

586
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,400
And the paper really does reflect those wavelengths.

587
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,680
That really is a quality of the paper itself.

588
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:41,200
I think these arguments, as framed, are quite effective against the way Locke sets it all

589
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,400
up.

590
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,280
But maybe the general problem of mind and world here could be addressed in a kind of

591
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,360
Barclayan spirit, but in a different way.

592
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,600
Instead of pushing the world up into the mind, maybe we could push the mind in effect down

593
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:03,000
into the world and say, actually all of those ideas are about things in the world.

594
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Our thinking is about the things.

595
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,880
It's not about the ideas.

596
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,080
The thing can itself be before the mind.

597
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,320
We can make direct reference to the thing in our thoughts and in our language.

598
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,480
And maybe we could instead then say, actually all those qualities are really in the things

599
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
themselves.

600
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,840
They're all primary qualities.

601
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,000
It's not just a question of affecting us in certain ways.

602
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,520
Being red might be reflecting wavelengths of light of a certain kind.

603
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,160
Same thing with being yellow.

604
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,840
Maybe the same thing is true of all of the other secondary qualities.

605
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,280
So even if Barclay succeeds at denying the distinction, maybe we don't have to become

606
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,680
idealists about everything.

607
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,160
Could we instead become realists about all of it and attribute all of this to the things

608
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,920
themselves?
