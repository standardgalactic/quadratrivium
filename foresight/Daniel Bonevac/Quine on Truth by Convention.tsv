0	6120	Well, today I want to return to our discussion of the debate between Karnap and why.
6120	11400	Two people whose views are closely aligned, but who nevertheless disagree about some fundamental
11400	17720	questions about logical truth, about conventionalism, about ontology, and about the nature of philosophy
17720	18720	in general.
18720	23000	So let's begin by going back to what we introduced right at the end of last time.
23000	27640	We were talking about the idea of a framework, and indeed that's something fundamental to
27640	28640	Karnap.
28640	33760	The thought that we introduced frameworks, linguistic frameworks ultimately, but I think
33760	38760	we could also refer to them as conceptual frameworks if that didn't in some sense make
38760	42960	a question that Karnap is interested in avoiding.
42960	47480	But in that case, we talked about some of these last time, and we focused on the distinction
47480	54960	between logic, mathematics, and then natural science, state physics.
54960	57920	We're going to talk about other frameworks today too.
57920	61920	But let's start with that distinction.
61920	65880	Quoting thinks it's tempting with respect to the first two.
65880	70080	When he sees the logical empiricism by Karnap as in general saying about the first two,
70080	72240	these things are true by conventional.
72240	77440	We adopt certain linguistic conventions, and things in logic and mathematics are true.
77440	81920	By virtue of the meanings of the terms, those meanings are determined by those conventions.
82360	85960	Physics is something that isn't a question of convention, that's something that's actually
85960	88360	talking about the real world.
88360	96840	Well, as I see it, Quine is basically saying, with respect to this idea of truth by convention,
96840	101200	that it makes sense only for one of these three.
101200	110200	Which one could we legitimately argue about, whether or not that thing is true by convention?
110480	111480	Logic?
111480	114280	Well, you'd think logic.
114280	118280	That is what, in a sense, quite a card game, Karnap, we're arguing about, except that
118280	122400	actually there, Quine disagrees with Karnap and thinks that the question is ultimately
122400	123400	unintelligible.
123400	127000	It's not so much that he thinks, oh, Karnap thinks it is true by convention.
127000	128000	I think it's not.
128000	130360	And there's a well-defined question we can debate.
130360	135400	He thinks, he says, look, my objection here isn't so much to question the truth of this
135400	136400	point as it's set.
136400	137400	Yeah.
137400	138400	I would say physics.
138600	145600	Physics, there, we might argue, somebody might say there's certain conventions that are established
145600	146600	in physics.
146600	150880	Others might say, oh, it's purely an empirical question.
150880	155280	Actually as we'll see there, too, Quine thinks there's a huge amount of arbitrarians.
155280	159240	And so that it's not clear that there's any real sense to the question of whether anything
159240	160880	in physics is true by convention.
160880	164000	Well, that leaves only one more possibility, right?
164000	165000	Math.
165000	170080	And there he thinks it is actually a legitimate question whether this is true by convention.
170080	172520	Now why is there that difference?
172520	175040	We need to think about this sort of question.
175040	180440	So let's raise this issue of truth by convention.
180440	186080	And here I mean, I'm going to put question mark to indicate, I mean the question of whether
186080	187680	this is true by convention.
187680	193120	I don't really mean to say what I'm about to do is, with respect to the truth, is it
193240	194240	true by convention?
194240	196720	But rather, does the question even make sense?
196720	198720	This answer is with respect to logic.
198720	199720	No.
199720	200720	And with respect to physics?
200720	201720	No.
201720	203720	But with respect to mathematics?
203720	204720	Yes.
204720	206520	Now, why is it different?
206520	209480	What are his arguments in each case?
209480	215640	He thinks with respect to logic, for example, that we can't say anything meaningful in saying
215640	223040	that logic is true by convention or true by the meanings of the terms not or if some
223040	226320	all and other logical symbols or other logical words.
226320	227920	Now why is that true?
227920	231440	What's wrong with this idea of truth by convention there?
231440	236000	Not in the sense that it's false, but in the sense that it's just meanings.
236000	237640	What kind of argument is he given?
237640	243080	I've got to say that when I started out reading Quine as an undergraduate, I thought he was
243080	244600	a breath of fresh air.
244600	247080	He was so clear compared to other philosophers.
247080	251320	But then again, I had studied mostly continental philosophy, so in a certain sense compared
251320	257240	to Hegel and Sartre and Heidegger, he's a breath of fresh air.
257240	261920	On the other hand, I've got to say the older I get, the less I understand Quine.
261920	265920	And so I don't think it's an easy question to say what are his arguments against this
265920	270640	position here and here and what's his argument in favor of its intelligibility with respect
270640	271640	to math.
271640	274280	I used to think I got it, and it was sort of there on the surface.
274280	278600	Now I think it's very hard to tease out what's really going on.
278600	279600	Yeah?
279880	285320	I guess I'm kind of confused because I thought in the two dogmas, or his paper, whatever,
285320	288680	I think it's called just the two dogmas.
288680	295640	He talks about physical objects being the only, I can't remember if it's physical objects
295640	302840	or physics being the only thing so we can, you know, no study, whatever.
302840	303840	Right, right.
304080	309280	Well, we're going to end up thinking about a variety of other frameworks, as you point
309280	314200	out, and one of them is going to be just the framework of things.
314200	318160	We've talked about this issue in relation to Russell and a few other people, whether
318160	322640	we should really think of the ultimate constituents of the world, something like sense data or
322640	328200	sensations or other perceptions, this type of thing, or whether we can really legitimately
328200	334480	talk about objects, like people in tables and chairs or clocks, as the objects that
334480	335680	are in the world.
335680	340160	So there's that question, and we're similarly going to begin with other frameworks like
340160	349240	the framework of propositions and a framework of properties, but you're right that certain
349240	355920	of these client things are matters of, well, there's a sense in which you might say all
356040	359960	of these are really questions of empirical investigation, right?
359960	361920	In the end, his model is that web.
361920	366480	It's not that there's some sort of foundation of given things, either given by virtue of
366480	371400	the means of terms or given directly in experience, and then we construct all these other things
371400	373400	on the basis of it.
373400	378040	Instead, there are certain things we're trying to explain about the appearances of the world
378040	383120	and we're just building these frameworks in an attempt to understand the world, period.
383120	388880	And so it's all sort of mixed together there, whereas in a sense for the earlier logical
388880	390840	empiricists, there's a clear divide.
390840	395920	Certain things go into the foundation, things like logic and mathematics, and maybe some
395920	400920	things directly perceived, and then everything else gets built on top of that.
400920	404680	So if you want to think of it this way, here's the older logical empiricist view, it's this
404760	411760	layer cake view, where down here is sort of logic, math, sensation, and then everything
415640	417640	else gets constructed on top of it.
417640	422640	Whereas in Quine, so that's the logical empiricist picture, then in Quine, we get this picture
422640	425640	of, well, gosh, what?
425640	430640	The web, I'm not too good at drawing webs.
431600	433600	It's like a seal.
433600	435600	It does look like a seal.
435600	437600	Like a tiger striped seal.
437600	439600	By the way, what's going on on campus today?
439600	441600	I walked past camels to get here.
441600	443600	Why are there camels?
443600	445600	Yeah, they're camels.
445600	447600	It's the Israel block party.
447600	449600	Oh, okay.
449600	451600	Right out there in front of the Martin Luther King Center.
451600	453600	I had no idea what was going on.
453600	455600	There's all this stuff near the main building, too.
455600	457600	People handing out t-shirts.
457600	459600	I don't know.
460560	462560	Well, never mind.
462560	464560	Talking about a framework of editing.
464560	466560	There's this framework going on campus today.
466560	468560	But anyway.
468560	472560	Yeah, there's this sort of web of belief that it all hangs together in a certain sense
472560	476560	in trying to explain experience.
476560	480560	There's no one part we can isolate exactly the contribution it's making to the whole.
480560	486560	Now, if we go back to this question about conventionalism,
486560	488560	and we look for Quine's arguments about this,
489520	491520	in a sense, as I said, it's a little hard to uncover
491520	493520	because it goes into so much detail
493520	495520	and there's so much being presupposed.
495520	498520	But I think the core of it is something like this.
498520	501520	What's wrong with the idea in logic
501520	503520	that it is true by convention?
503520	505520	Or for that matter, not.
505520	507520	In the end, he says, look, we could say
507520	509520	we established these conventions about me.
509520	513520	And then logic follows from those conventions.
513520	515520	Or we could say
515520	517520	that, really,
518480	520480	they're just general features of the world.
520480	522480	Like things are self-identical.
522480	526480	Or, you know, gosh.
526480	530480	I'm trying to correspond to the law of non-contradiction.
530480	532480	Reality is not contradictory.
532480	534480	Something like that.
534480	536480	Reality is consistent.
536480	540480	And in the end, he says, there's no real difference
540480	542480	between those two pseudo-doctrines.
542480	544480	Now, why not?
544480	546480	Well, really, to understand this,
546480	548480	I think we have to go back to his paper Truth by Convention.
548480	550480	And there,
550480	552480	there's a lot of complicated stuff going on.
552480	554480	But in the end, it comes down,
554480	556480	I think, to a key move.
556480	558480	How would we establish
558480	560480	conventions in logic?
564480	566480	Here's a really simple convention.
566480	568480	Universal claims
568480	570480	imply their instances.
570480	572480	Right?
572480	574480	So we might say, here's a rule
574480	576480	that the universe will quantify.
576480	578480	In logical notation, we could put it this way.
578480	580480	If for all x,
580480	582480	a holds of x,
582480	584480	then a holds of c.
584480	586480	Let's say, for any constant c,
586480	588480	we substitute for x.
588480	590480	Okay?
590480	592480	Or, to put it in English,
592480	594480	we could just say, okay, everything
596480	598480	is a.
598480	600480	Therefore,
600480	602480	that is a.
602480	604480	And, that would be true for any
604480	606480	that.
606480	608480	Right?
608480	610480	Okay, so now,
610480	612480	there, I've tried to establish a certain convention
612480	614480	that partially establishes
614480	616480	the meaning of all, or everything,
616480	618480	or the universe will quantify.
618480	620480	But now, Klein says,
620480	622480	wait, I can't do that.
622480	624480	What's wrong
624480	626480	with saying, hey, I've just
626480	628480	established a convention, that's part of the meaning
628480	630480	of the universal quantifier
630480	632480	of all, or every, in English.
632480	634480	What's the problem
634480	636480	with that?
640480	642480	Can you rephrase that?
642480	644480	Yeah, sure.
644480	646480	He says, look, here's some card
646480	648480	and other logical empiricists were thinking
648480	650480	about this, and thinking of logic is true by convention.
650480	652480	I established certain conventions,
652480	654480	certain rules for my language,
654480	656480	and maybe I do that by having a
656480	658480	semantics for all,
658480	660480	or for the universal quantifier,
660480	662480	in a kind of formal sense.
662480	664480	Maybe, I don't. Maybe I just
664480	666480	introduce some rules like this. I say, that
666480	668480	establishes the meaning. Or I could do it with
668480	670480	am. I could say, here's what
670480	672480	am means. We have ways of introducing
672480	674480	am, so if I have the truth of a and b,
674480	676480	I can then say a and b.
676480	678480	And if I have the truth of a and
678480	680480	b, then I can deduce
680480	682480	a, or for that matter, b,
682480	684480	whichever I want.
684480	686480	And I might say those introduction
686480	688480	rules establish the meaning of a and.
688480	690480	And I could introduce
690480	692480	an introduction rule for the universal
692480	694480	quantifier and say, there,
694480	696480	I've given you the meaning of the universal
696480	698480	quantifier. I've told you under what
698480	700480	circumstances we can infer from something
700480	702480	else. I've told you under what circumstances
702480	704480	we can infer something else from it.
704480	706480	And that's all there is to establishing the
706480	708480	meaning. Now, Coins' way of saying,
708480	710480	I can't really do it.
710480	712480	There's something wrong with saying,
712480	714480	in doing this, I've just established
714480	716480	a logical
716480	718480	truth.
718480	720480	And why?
720480	722480	Let's take
722480	724480	a very simple example of one of these.
724480	726480	Like,
726480	728480	what's a good universal
728480	730480	claim? True of everything.
730480	732480	Gravity
732480	733480	is
733480	734480	universal.
734480	736480	Yeah, everything
736480	738480	exerts
738480	740480	gravitational force.
744480	746480	Therefore,
746480	748480	you
748480	750480	exert
750480	752480	gravitational force.
754480	756480	I want to say that's true just by
756480	758480	virtue of logic. Okay, and why?
758480	760480	Because of conventions.
760480	762480	Specifically, this convention
762480	764480	is what makes that true.
764480	766480	Now,
766480	768480	that seems plausible enough, right?
768480	770480	But what have I done in going from
770480	772480	this to that?
774480	776480	Here,
776480	778480	I have
778480	780480	a of x.
780480	782480	Here, I have
782480	784480	exerts gravitational force, right?
784480	786480	I
786480	788480	substituted
788480	790480	that to be a
790480	792480	in both cases.
792480	794480	Well,
794480	796480	how, what enabled me to do that?
796480	798480	What justified that?
798480	800480	Yeah.
800480	802480	The word everything?
802480	804480	The word everything, yeah.
804480	806480	And so, you might say,
806480	808480	well, it's just a matter of everything, right?
808480	810480	It appeals to some, well, and the mind says,
810480	812480	ah, yes, right, but wait a minute.
812480	814480	Notice what else I did.
814480	816480	I actually said, aha,
816480	818480	this is saying this is true for every a, right?
818480	820480	And so, I substituted
820480	822480	exerts
822480	824480	gravitational force in for the a,
824480	826480	in both cases.
826480	828480	But now, that was just
828480	830480	a bit of, well,
830480	832480	the very same,
832480	834480	actually, in this case, yeah, the very same
834480	836480	sort of
836480	838480	logical, in other words,
838480	840480	to get from my logical convention
840480	842480	to any actual
842480	844480	logical truth, I have to be willing
844480	846480	to engage in a bit of logical reason.
846480	848480	So, in other words, he says,
848480	850480	I can't actually establish a convention
850480	852480	without presupposing
852480	854480	logic.
854480	856480	In order to establish convention by doing
856480	858480	this, or by doing this for
858480	860480	conjunction, for example,
860480	862480	I have to already presuppose
862480	864480	some logic. I have to presuppose
864480	866480	logic that says, oh, you mean I can
866480	868480	substitute any sentence for a, and any
868480	870480	sentence for b, and have this make sense,
870480	872480	right? In other words, this is true
872480	874480	for all a and b.
874480	876480	And so, I'm presupposing something about
876480	878480	logic. And I'm saying moreover,
878480	880480	think about what I'm saying in the rule. Ah,
880480	882480	if you have both a and
882480	884480	b, you can conclude a and b.
884480	886480	I say, wait a minute.
886480	888480	I already have to understand
888480	890480	and to understand what it means to have both a
890480	892480	and b, right? Similarly
892480	894480	here, I said, if you've got a and b,
894480	896480	then you can conclude a
896480	898480	or b, whichever you choose,
898480	900480	right? And I could also frame it by saying
900480	902480	if you've got a and b, you can conclude a.
902480	904480	If you've got a and b, you can conclude
904480	906480	b. Both of those things are true.
906480	908480	He said, wait, both of those things are true.
908480	910480	To understand your convention, I already have to
910480	912480	understand the meaning of both, and
912480	914480	and all.
914480	916480	And so, you can't give me those things by convention.
916480	918480	I don't understand the conventions
918480	920480	and how to apply them unless I already know
920480	922480	logic.
922480	924480	So the central argument, as I see it,
924480	926480	of his paper truth about convention,
926480	928480	with respect to logic,
928480	930480	is that the conventions
930480	932480	or maybe, well, stating the conventions
932480	934480	I think, but also applying the conventions
934480	936480	presuppose
936480	938480	logic.
938480	940480	And so, they can't give you logic.
940480	942480	They can't give you the logical truth.
942480	944480	They can't specify the meanings
944480	946480	of logical particles.
946480	948480	You don't understand them unless you already
948480	950480	understand the conventions.
950480	952480	And here, I've done it in terms of
952480	954480	syntax.
954480	956480	In terms of, you know, actually
956480	958480	saying what the rules are,
958480	960480	but it wouldn't be any better
960480	962480	if I did it in terms of meanings.
962480	964480	In fact, how do we usually do that?
964480	966480	People will say something like this.
966480	968480	The truth value
968480	970480	of A
970480	972480	and B
972480	974480	is truth
974480	976480	if and only if
976480	978480	the value of A
978480	980480	well, actually, in this case
980480	982480	it's often done
982480	984480	to equal size, but I won't do it that way.
984480	986480	The value of A is true
986480	988480	and the value of B
988480	990480	is truth.
990480	992480	And notice what I've done.
992480	994480	I've given you
994480	996480	by convention the meaning of A.
996480	998480	I'm assuming, of course, you already understand.
998480	1000480	And
1000480	1002480	right?
1002480	1004480	And it often goes this way.
1004480	1006480	The truth value of not A
1006480	1008480	is equal to truth if and only if
1008480	1010480	well, here's one way to do it.
1010480	1012480	The truth value of A
1012480	1014480	is not equal to truth.
1016480	1018480	You say, hey, I already have to understand not
1018480	1020480	in order for that to make sense.
1020480	1022480	Now, this is not a criticism
1022480	1024480	of these symmetrical rules
1024480	1026480	or a piece in tactical rules.
1026480	1028480	It's not any objection to logic.
1028480	1030480	It's just saying I can't understand
1030480	1032480	these conventions about meaning or about
1032480	1034480	use without already knowing
1034480	1036480	some logic.
1036480	1038480	You're defining the meaning of A
1038480	1040480	in a background language that includes A
1040480	1042480	or not, and well, that includes not.
1042480	1044480	Or here, the defining universal
1044480	1046480	quantifier
1046480	1048480	in a background language where I already have to understand
1048480	1050480	how to use the universal quantifier.
1050480	1052480	Now, I can't be getting logical truth
1052480	1054480	out of these conventions.
1054480	1056480	I only can state the conventions that apply to them
1056480	1058480	by already understanding logic.
1058480	1060480	Do these conventions always follow
1060480	1062480	things that seem to be logically true?
1062480	1064480	It's never like a convention's established,
1064480	1066480	then something follows
1066480	1068480	from that. It's the other way around, right?
1068480	1070480	Like, that's what this is saying.
1070480	1072480	That's what's quite the same. Right, exactly.
1072480	1074480	It's not like we established the convention
1074480	1076480	and then these things follow in logic.
1076480	1078480	It's rather that we have to already
1078480	1080480	know the logic to even state the convention.
1080480	1082480	So what does that mean?
1082480	1084480	Well, what he thinks what it means is that
1084480	1086480	here would be a simple way of concluding.
1086480	1088480	Ah, so logic isn't true by convention.
1088480	1090480	Somehow
1090480	1092480	stating conventions or applying conventions
1092480	1094480	and so on would already
1094480	1096480	presuppose logic. So conclusion,
1096480	1098480	logic is not true by convention.
1098480	1100480	Interestingly, he doesn't really say that.
1100480	1102480	He says, I don't think
1102480	1104480	it makes any sense to talk about logic
1104480	1106480	as true by convention. So
1106480	1108480	it's not so much he thinks the claim is false.
1108480	1110480	He thinks it's unintelligible and we still
1110480	1112480	have to ask why that would be true. Yeah.
1112480	1114480	Can't you define them other ways
1114480	1116480	like the truth tables that
1116480	1118480	don't seem to
1118480	1120480	imply or, you know,
1120480	1122480	don't seem to presuppose anything
1122480	1124480	or like that? Let's try that.
1124480	1126480	Okay, so
1126480	1128480	we have A, B,
1128480	1130480	and then A and B
1130480	1132480	and we're going to set up truth
1132480	1134480	tables so I say, well, there are four possibilities
1134480	1136480	here. These might both be true.
1136480	1138480	A true, B false.
1138480	1140480	A false, B true, both false.
1140480	1142480	And now I'm going to say that
1142480	1144480	A and B is true if and only if
1144480	1146480	well both are true otherwise false.
1148480	1150480	So I write a table like that
1150480	1152480	and that seems to establish a convention
1152480	1154480	that specifies the meaning of AND.
1154480	1156480	Now have I in any sense
1156480	1158480	presupposed the meaning of AND
1158480	1160480	or other logical
1160480	1162480	particles? I mean one thing I've
1162480	1164480	posed right is
1164480	1166480	universal character. You might say
1166480	1168480	the schematic letters A and B
1168480	1170480	already assume that I understand
1170480	1172480	something about universal quantification.
1172480	1174480	But have I in any sense
1174480	1176480	assumed something of the meaning of AND here?
1176480	1178480	Well, you wouldn't be able to write
1178480	1180480	the truth values on the right side
1180480	1182480	if you didn't know AND already meant...
1182480	1184480	Well, that's true.
1184480	1186480	Although
1186480	1188480	yeah, one way of looking at it
1188480	1190480	is to say, where am I coming up
1190480	1192480	with these? I must not really understand
1192480	1194480	if I'm going to do that. Now, of course
1194480	1196480	I could say, no, no, no, I'm not doing that.
1196480	1198480	I'm doing that in a purely formal way.
1198480	1200480	In fact, I could say, given that
1200480	1202480	there are two terms here
1202480	1204480	I'm just interested in defining
1204480	1206480	certain connectives with two
1206480	1208480	truth values. There are 16
1208480	1210480	different truth functions. And so
1210480	1212480	I could really just be specifying all of
1212480	1214480	those. And then once I've specified
1214480	1216480	them all, I say, oh look at this one. I'm going to call that
1216480	1218480	AND. And that's my convention.
1218480	1220480	That's the convention about AND.
1220480	1222480	And, you know,
1222480	1224480	that might be fine. So others
1224480	1226480	we might have to think a while to realize
1226480	1228480	what on earth is, if anything,
1228480	1230480	that corresponds to a natural language.
1230480	1232480	Yeah. Yeah, I think, but
1232480	1234480	in this case, it's tempting to say
1234480	1236480	what Quine does, because AND is part of
1236480	1238480	our language, and you kind of have
1238480	1240480	to, you know,
1240480	1242480	understand what, it seems like
1242480	1244480	you have to understand what AND is to fill out the table,
1244480	1246480	but you can do something purely arbitrary
1246480	1248480	with like a three,
1248480	1250480	you know, something that takes in three inputs
1250480	1252480	that has no analogy
1252480	1254480	in our language, you know,
1254480	1256480	it's just some arbitrary
1256480	1258480	truth table that you can define by convention.
1258480	1260480	Yeah, right.
1262480	1264480	This is really off topic,
1264480	1266480	but I can't resist
1266480	1268480	telling you about one of my favorite connectives.
1268480	1270480	This is post negation.
1270480	1272480	Okay. Suppose we have
1272480	1274480	three truth values, truth,
1274480	1276480	indeterminacy, and falsehood.
1276480	1278480	Well, a post negation,
1278480	1280480	and I don't know
1280480	1282480	exactly how to write a post negation,
1282480	1284480	so
1284480	1286480	I'll just say post A.
1288480	1290480	Is this? It's true
1290480	1292480	if this is false.
1292480	1294480	It's indeterminate if it's true, and it's false
1294480	1296480	if it's indeterminate.
1296480	1298480	So what it does is mathematically
1298480	1300480	very interesting. It just rotates
1300480	1302480	all the truth values one place, right?
1302480	1304480	So it rotates it back
1304480	1306480	like this one place, and so it's super useful.
1306480	1308480	It turns out that
1308480	1310480	in a many valued logic, this is
1310480	1312480	a wonderful way of getting a functionally
1312480	1314480	and complete set of connectives.
1314480	1316480	But now,
1316480	1318480	what does that mean?
1320480	1322480	I mean, ordinary negation would be
1322480	1324480	true if this is false, and false
1324480	1326480	if that's true. Here it's indeterminate if that's true.
1326480	1328480	And if A
1328480	1330480	is indeterminate, it's let's say
1330480	1332480	a borderline case of vagueness, for example,
1332480	1334480	but this is just false.
1334480	1336480	I can't think of what that means
1336480	1338480	in English. I can't come up with any
1338480	1340480	English equivalent. And as soon as
1340480	1342480	you get to either three truth values
1342480	1344480	or more than two
1344480	1346480	positions here, it's very easy
1346480	1348480	to come up with connectives where you say,
1348480	1350480	well, I don't know how to say that in English.
1350480	1352480	It doesn't seem to correspond to anything.
1352480	1354480	With one or with two, it's not too hard.
1354480	1356480	Usually it comes up with some
1356480	1358480	English expression that captures the meaning.
1358480	1360480	But a third truth
1360480	1362480	value or a third term
1362480	1364480	in the collection
1364480	1366480	here in that compound
1366480	1368480	sentence becomes very easy
1368480	1370480	to generate. So you could say,
1370480	1372480	look, that's just arbitrary. Don't worry
1372480	1374480	in other words about this part. That's
1374480	1376480	something maybe we could just say, we
1376480	1378480	arbitrarily filled out. Then we arbitrarily
1378480	1380480	assign the word and to that meaning
1380480	1382480	and thereby establish a convention.
1382480	1384480	So I don't think this
1384480	1386480	is going to be the source
1386480	1388480	of the objection that the client would have.
1388480	1390480	But is there another one?
1390480	1392480	Yeah? So that post-negation
1392480	1394480	thing, I know it's about topic, but like
1394480	1396480	so what
1396480	1398480	are there any institutions in the
1398480	1400480	world that would apply?
1402480	1404480	I don't know what use is it.
1404480	1406480	What use is it? Well,
1406480	1408480	because in a many-valued logic
1408480	1410480	the way it's usually done,
1410480	1412480	we introduce connectives in
1412480	1414480	a kind of intuitive way and negation would be
1414480	1416480	just true if this is false, false
1416480	1418480	if that's true and then indeterminate like that.
1418480	1420480	So that's a typical negation
1420480	1422480	in a many-valued logic.
1422480	1424480	But it turns out that
1424480	1426480	when you do this in the kind of natural way
1426480	1428480	introducing this third
1428480	1430480	truth value of indeterminacy
1430480	1432480	there are all sorts
1432480	1434480	of truth functions you cannot express
1434480	1436480	in that basic language. Because what happens
1436480	1438480	is you get a fixed point at
1438480	1440480	indeterminacy, for example.
1440480	1442480	If all the inputs are indeterminate, the
1442480	1444480	output is always indeterminate.
1444480	1446480	And so in standard
1446480	1448480	many-valued logics
1448480	1450480	once you sort of hit indeterminacy
1450480	1452480	you can't get out. And the same thing is
1452480	1454480	true of determinacy. If all the inputs are
1454480	1456480	indeterminate, the output is always
1456480	1458480	indeterminate. So you can't actually
1458480	1460480	define a truth function that takes
1460480	1462480	determinacy into indeterminacy or vice-versa.
1462480	1464480	And that's a real
1464480	1466480	mathematical limitation of the system.
1466480	1468480	You might think it's also a real
1468480	1470480	meaning limitation since it seems
1470480	1472480	as if we ought to be able to
1472480	1474480	take indeterminate inputs
1474480	1476480	and get a determinate output. For example
1476480	1478480	if somebody says, oh, it's indeterminate that
1478480	1480480	we ought to be able to actually
1480480	1482480	then say, oh, that's true because
1482480	1484480	all the inputs are indeterminate.
1484480	1486480	And so it means
1486480	1488480	that illogic has it standardly done. You
1488480	1490480	can't express things like
1490480	1492480	it is determinate whether or it is
1492480	1494480	indeterminate that and so forth.
1494480	1496480	And so this
1496480	1498480	is a way of letting you define all of those
1498480	1500480	things. It's a very mathematically
1500480	1502480	elegant way of letting you define them.
1502480	1504480	It's also just a mysterious way
1504480	1506480	of letting you define them from an English
1506480	1508480	sort of human point of view. But that's
1508480	1510480	why it's useful. How do you get to that,
1510480	1512480	though? How do you just change it?
1512480	1514480	How does that work?
1514480	1516480	Well, in math you can do anything you want
1516480	1518480	to. Just, you know,
1518480	1520480	instead of saying, you know, you can just say,
1520480	1522480	well, take a logic with or and
1522480	1524480	and not define the usual way and then
1524480	1526480	oh, add the post-connective
1526480	1528480	and boom, you can now define anything.
1528480	1530480	You can define, it is determinate whether
1530480	1532480	or it is indeterminate that.
1532480	1534480	Or it's definitely true, and I mean true
1534480	1536480	and not false and not indeterminate that
1536480	1538480	and so on.
1538480	1540480	And so it's really useful.
1540480	1542480	It just requires something that we can't
1542480	1544480	assign a real meaning to in English.
1544480	1546480	Yeah.
1546480	1548480	So just going back to the original question.
1548480	1550480	Yeah.
1550480	1552480	We have several different systems of logic
1552480	1554480	and you've just shown another one and
1554480	1556480	you can define some logics in terms of
1556480	1558480	other logics.
1558480	1560480	So why doesn't that show that
1560480	1562480	logics can be defined conventionally
1562480	1564480	so long as the conventions are based on other
1564480	1566480	logics? Like why can't you just kind of do a
1566480	1568480	circle? Well, good question.
1568480	1570480	There are a lot of contemporary logicians
1570480	1572480	who think, yeah, logic is true by convention
1572480	1574480	and indeed, you can see it
1574480	1576480	as soon as you move to some of these other
1576480	1578480	logics and you think what convention should
1578480	1580480	we establish? In fact, just the idea
1580480	1582480	that we could have more than two truth
1582480	1584480	logics who think, ooh, what should we say
1584480	1586480	that about and, about or, about not
1586480	1588480	in such a logic?
1588480	1590480	And it feels in many cases as if you're being
1590480	1592480	asked to define certain conventions,
1592480	1594480	not as if you're being asked to
1594480	1596480	presuppose what you already
1596480	1598480	mean or already do.
1598480	1600480	And it certainly has that feeling
1600480	1602480	when you are characterizing something like
1602480	1604480	quantum logic or certain other logics
1604480	1606480	for highly specific purposes.
1606480	1608480	So it is a defensible position.
1608480	1610480	But now, let's get back
1610480	1612480	to the client's objection. How would he object to it
1612480	1614480	there or here?
1614480	1616480	It's not going to be on the basis of this,
1616480	1618480	although that's very tempting to say
1618480	1620480	yeah, look,
1620480	1622480	it's in somehow filling that in
1622480	1624480	that we're establishing a convention. Here it has
1624480	1626480	that feeling strongly because this isn't capturing
1626480	1628480	the meaning of anything we're presupposing. It's not like
1628480	1630480	oh, come on, we were all using the post-negation
1630480	1632480	all the way along, right? No, we weren't.
1634480	1636480	But in this case, let's go back to this
1636480	1638480	because it's a much simpler case and then we'll
1638480	1640480	go back. Here,
1640480	1642480	what is this first row of the table?
1642480	1644480	How do I explain what's going on in the first row?
1646480	1648480	I said,
1648480	1650480	suppose A
1650480	1652480	is true and B is true.
1652480	1654480	A is true
1654480	1656480	and B is true.
1656480	1658480	A is true and B is false.
1658480	1660480	A is false and
1660480	1662480	B is true.
1662480	1664480	Just in explaining what the table was,
1664480	1666480	I used and, right?
1666480	1668480	And I don't know how to avoid that.
1668480	1670480	So I've already got
1670480	1672480	and sort of built in here.
1672480	1674480	That seems very odd because
1674480	1676480	you could do all of those, do all the tables
1676480	1678480	just as I said with just and,
1678480	1680480	but and is not logically complete.
1680480	1682480	Right.
1682480	1684480	Which seems very strange, right? You can base it all
1684480	1686480	on something not logically complete.
1686480	1688480	All right, good, good, good, good.
1688480	1690480	Yeah, notice what I, in this example
1690480	1692480	and really with any of these where I use the schematic
1692480	1694480	letters, it looks like, what am I presupposing?
1694480	1696480	I'm presupposing something about universal
1696480	1698480	quantification.
1698480	1700480	Whether I stated explicitly
1700480	1702480	or whether it's really just in the background
1702480	1704480	by me using letters like A and B.
1704480	1706480	And then here, do you even explain
1706480	1708480	the row of the truth table? Before I get to this,
1708480	1710480	I've got to be using
1710480	1712480	and.
1712480	1714480	And we've seen that here.
1714480	1716480	I've got both A and B so I can do
1716480	1718480	A and B, etc.
1718480	1720480	I suppose
1720480	1722480	you could argue, I've presupposed it then
1722480	1724480	if both of these are true then
1724480	1726480	that's true.
1726480	1728480	So maybe I've presupposed
1728480	1730480	if in that way. In fact, once I get
1730480	1732480	to this, here I've
1732480	1734480	just got A, right? So I'm not presupposing
1734480	1736480	and, but I am saying if A is
1736480	1738480	true then this post-connective
1738480	1740480	applied to A is indeterminate.
1740480	1742480	And so I seem to be
1742480	1744480	presupposing if then.
1744480	1746480	What about not?
1746480	1748480	When we got to negation
1748480	1750480	it looked like I had to say something
1750480	1752480	about not. I had to say
1752480	1754480	not A is true if and only if
1754480	1756480	A is not true.
1756480	1758480	And so maybe I've presupposed not.
1758480	1760480	But now if I've got all of that
1760480	1762480	I do have a functionally
1762480	1764480	complete set. So you're absolutely right
1764480	1766480	that if I look at individual ones
1766480	1768480	I'm not using all of those. I might
1768480	1770480	depending upon the way I'm doing it
1770480	1772480	be committed to let's say here
1772480	1774480	all and and maybe if then.
1774480	1776480	But that's not functionally
1776480	1778480	complete. Only certain things are going
1778480	1780480	to actually require negation.
1780480	1782480	And then
1782480	1784480	I'm going to end up presupposing the whole thing.
1784480	1786480	If you did the entire
1786480	1788480	if you did the truth table for the
1788480	1790480	Shephard stroke to build an entire logic
1790480	1792480	counter. Would you need
1792480	1794480	all a logically complete thing to
1794480	1796480	define it? That's a good question.
1796480	1798480	Would you need the not? Let's do it.
1802480	1804480	Let's do Shephard stroke.
1804480	1806480	Which is the not A.
1806480	1808480	Okay. So it means basically
1808480	1810480	not both A and B.
1810480	1812480	Well, if you've got both A
1812480	1814480	and B it's false.
1814480	1816480	Here
1816480	1818480	you don't have both A and B. So it's true.
1818480	1820480	And true and true.
1820480	1822480	Okay.
1822480	1824480	Now what did I presuppose in doing that?
1824480	1826480	Well, I said
1826480	1828480	if this and that then this.
1828480	1830480	So I've got and and if
1830480	1832480	I've got the schematic letter.
1832480	1834480	So I've got the universal.
1834480	1836480	I never need the negation.
1836480	1838480	I ever have to presuppose negation.
1838480	1840480	Since this means not A
1840480	1842480	you'd think surely I did.
1842480	1844480	But how?
1850480	1852480	You might think it's already implied in the false
1852480	1854480	but
1854480	1856480	not necessarily right.
1856480	1858480	Because we don't have to think of false
1858480	1860480	as just not true. And the possibility
1860480	1862480	of many value logics indicates
1862480	1864480	why we might think that's not right.
1864480	1866480	But for example here I said
1866480	1868480	if this is true and that's false
1868480	1870480	then this is true.
1870480	1872480	Didn't seem like
1872480	1874480	I had to use negation there.
1874480	1876480	Now in thinking about
1876480	1878480	I did I had to think oh it means
1878480	1880480	not both A and B. So
1880480	1882480	here they are both true so
1882480	1884480	if this is not true it's false.
1884480	1886480	That went on in my head
1886480	1888480	but in terms of actually just stating
1888480	1890480	what the convention is I didn't have to do.
1890480	1892480	So I think it's kind of interesting
1892480	1894480	that I don't at least see why this presupposes
1894480	1896480	not.
1896480	1898480	Does it also presuppose truth values
1898480	1900480	or would that not fit under there?
1900480	1902480	Well yeah it does
1902480	1904480	presuppose truth and false.
1904480	1906480	So true and false
1908480	1910480	get in here too.
1912480	1914480	And I suppose you might say
1914480	1916480	there's got to be someone there.
1916480	1918480	Moreover if I've got false
1918480	1920480	then actually can't I define not?
1920480	1922480	Some people have tried
1922480	1924480	to do that and said yeah
1924480	1926480	not A for example
1926480	1928480	is just if
1928480	1930480	A then
1930480	1932480	false.
1936480	1938480	And so if that
1938480	1940480	would work as a definition of negation then
1940480	1942480	by having false in there I can actually already
1942480	1944480	get negation out.
1944480	1946480	But anyway I think it's a good question
1946480	1948480	you're raising and something to climb
1948480	1950480	in both of these papers just glides over quickly.
1950480	1952480	Just like oh well
1952480	1954480	the presupposes logic I can't get
1954480	1956480	I can't state the convention, I can't apply the convention
1956480	1958480	unless I've already got logic.
1958480	1960480	But that's really sloppy.
1960480	1962480	What I need depends on the nature of the convention
1962480	1964480	right?
1964480	1966480	And maybe in the end
1966480	1968480	I need all the first order logic
1968480	1970480	but maybe I don't.
1970480	1972480	That's something that really has to be argued for.
1972480	1974480	It's not just something to vaguely allege.
1974480	1976480	So thank you for raising these questions
1976480	1978480	and if it seems like I've gone off on a long logical
1978480	1980480	regression here. Not really
1980480	1982480	because the whole idea here is that
1982480	1984480	in stating these conventions we're presupposing
1984480	1986480	not just a little tiny fragment
1986480	1988480	of logic but logic
1988480	1990480	period and
1990480	1992480	so it matters what we're actually presupposing
1992480	1994480	to evaluate quite
1994480	1996480	the time.
1998480	2000480	Now
2000480	2002480	let's move on to math.
2004480	2006480	It's supposed to be okay
2006480	2008480	to worry about the conventionalism
2008480	2010480	of mathematics. Again he's not
2010480	2012480	committed to claiming that math is true by convention
2012480	2014480	but just that the question makes sense
2014480	2016480	with mathematics.
2016480	2018480	So
2018480	2020480	before we guess that, maybe we should do physics.
2020480	2022480	What's wrong with saying that certain
2022480	2024480	things in law in physics are true by convention?
2024480	2026480	Now nobody's going to want to say all of physics
2026480	2028480	is true by convention.
2028480	2030480	It's obviously an empirical science and there's a lot of
2030480	2032480	experimental stuff and observation
2032480	2034480	required but
2034480	2036480	could there be certain things that are established just by
2036480	2038480	convention? You might say
2038480	2040480	for example in classical mechanics
2040480	2042480	well let's say Newton's laws
2042480	2044480	of motion. One of them
2044480	2046480	is force
2046480	2048480	is, I keep writing things low
2048480	2050480	in the blank, force is
2050480	2052480	mass times acceleration.
2052480	2054480	Now is that
2054480	2056480	an empirical claim
2056480	2058480	that requires observational backing
2058480	2060480	or is it a definition of force?
2062480	2064480	Is that something that we could say is true by definition?
2064480	2066480	The definition.
2066480	2068480	All right,
2068480	2070480	suppose we say it's true by definition.
2074480	2076480	Now what does that imply about certain other things?
2080480	2082480	What's another physical
2082480	2084480	law that involves force?
2086480	2088480	Well for example, work is
2088480	2090480	force times distance.
2092480	2094480	Is that a definition?
2098480	2100480	All right, so suppose we say it's
2100480	2102480	true by definition. Then we've got
2102480	2104480	work is equal to
2104480	2106480	well gosh,
2106480	2108480	distance times mass times acceleration.
2110480	2112480	And presumably that now follows for our definition.
2112480	2114480	That's just an analytic truth.
2116480	2118480	Well what about this relationship?
2118480	2120480	Kinetic energy
2120480	2122480	is equal to one half m v square.
2124480	2126480	Is that a definition of kinetic energy
2126480	2128480	or is it an empirical claim?
2134480	2136480	I don't know.
2136480	2138480	Moreover,
2138480	2140480	how about this?
2140480	2142480	Momentum
2142480	2144480	is mass times velocity.
2144480	2146480	It's not very clear
2146480	2148480	what I should take as definition.
2148480	2150480	I might axiomatize physics
2150480	2152480	in the way that I might axiomatize geometry.
2152480	2154480	But the point is that
2154480	2156480	it's sort of arbitrary which of these
2156480	2158480	I take as definitions and which I take
2158480	2160480	as actual
2160480	2162480	empirical claims.
2162480	2164480	And his point is, in a certain sense, physics
2164480	2166480	stands or falls with all of these.
2166480	2168480	It's not as if,
2168480	2170480	well for example, I've chosen
2170480	2172480	this example. Neutronian mechanics.
2172480	2174480	In part because we now think this theory is wrong.
2174480	2176480	Okay, we teach it to all our
2176480	2178480	high school students. We teach it to people in
2178480	2180480	intro physics classes in college.
2180480	2182480	But it's false.
2182480	2184480	Now why is it false? Well because
2184480	2186480	the speed of light should really be in here.
2186480	2188480	We need to distinguish between inertial mass
2188480	2190480	and rest mass.
2190480	2192480	And so forth.
2192480	2194480	Now where's the falsehood?
2194480	2196480	You might think, ah, certain of these things are just
2196480	2198480	analytic. So the falsehood all has to be in the
2198480	2200480	empirical claim.
2200480	2202480	But that seems a screwy way of doing it.
2202480	2204480	The fact is we have to just figure out
2204480	2206480	and for example, this is one of the places we
2206480	2208480	make some adjustments typically.
2208480	2210480	And so if we
2210480	2212480	start adjusting that in relativistic mechanics,
2212480	2214480	you might say, well maybe that
2214480	2216480	really wasn't a definition.
2216480	2218480	Or you might say maybe our concept of energy
2218480	2220480	has changed. Certainly our concept of
2220480	2222480	mass has changed when we distinguish rest mass
2222480	2224480	from inertial mass.
2224480	2226480	So in a way here, Klein's point is just,
2226480	2228480	it's not that it's unintelligible.
2228480	2230480	It's just arbitrary.
2230480	2232480	It's this
2232480	2234480	great line that says asking
2234480	2236480	which of these physical claims are really
2236480	2238480	axioms and are really
2238480	2240480	definitions is really
2240480	2242480	kind of like asking which points in Ohio
2242480	2244480	are starting points.
2244480	2246480	And presenting the theory, I can introduce
2246480	2248480	anything as a definition I want
2248480	2250480	as long as it has the right logical form.
2250480	2252480	And then other
2252480	2254480	things will emerge as empirical claims.
2254480	2256480	But it's really kind of arbitrary how you would do
2256480	2258480	that. It's not like
2258480	2260480	some of these are just obviously
2260480	2262480	definitions and others are obviously empirical
2262480	2264480	claims. So we adjust that with our
2264480	2266480	presentation of the theory. Just as we do
2266480	2268480	in geometry, what should we take as the
2268480	2270480	axioms of geometry? Well,
2270480	2272480	you could take all sorts of things as
2272480	2274480	axioms of geometry and
2274480	2276480	then derive other things as theorems.
2276480	2278480	There's nothing about a certain kind of claim that
2278480	2280480	just says, oh, that's going to be a fundamental
2280480	2282480	axiom. What we take as basic
2282480	2284480	is just a matter of how we present
2284480	2286480	the theory.
2286480	2288480	But Klein's point on the other hand
2288480	2290480	is just that, look,
2290480	2292480	in the end, when we change a physical theory
2292480	2294480	it's not like certain things are analytically true
2294480	2296480	and are off the table. We have to figure out
2296480	2298480	how to adjust things in the theory. And some of the
2298480	2300480	things in the theory we keep, other things
2300480	2302480	we throw out, sometimes we take
2302480	2304480	one notion and replace it with two notions
2304480	2306480	and in short, draw a distinction we hadn't
2306480	2308480	drawn before. And there's no way
2308480	2310480	to predict which of these things are
2310480	2312480	libel and empirical challenge
2312480	2314480	and which ones are immune from that because they're
2314480	2316480	analytic. Yeah.
2316480	2318480	Do any of them have to be definitions or
2318480	2320480	can they all be empirical?
2320480	2322480	Yeah, they can all be empirical. We don't
2322480	2324480	have to make any of them definitions, right?
2324480	2326480	And in a sense, Klein's point is that in
2326480	2328480	the end, yeah, that's really the right way to say it.
2328480	2330480	I mean, if I'm writing
2330480	2332480	a physics textbook and I want to present
2332480	2334480	some as really just defining
2334480	2336480	the term momentum, let's say, or defining this or
2336480	2338480	that, then okay, I can do that.
2338480	2340480	I can do that as a matter of my presentation.
2340480	2342480	But that's a question of how
2342480	2344480	I'm presenting the theory. It's not like
2344480	2346480	something that is fundamentally true
2346480	2348480	within each of the subjects. So
2348480	2350480	for example, in thinking
2350480	2352480	about actually every day in class
2352480	2354480	how to come in and talk about what I'm going to talk about,
2354480	2356480	I think, well, where do I start?
2356480	2358480	But it's not as if
2358480	2360480	I look at the subject matter.
2360480	2362480	In this case, the Klein-Karab debate
2362480	2364480	and just see, aha,
2364480	2366480	there is the foundational question.
2366480	2368480	I try to identify what I think
2368480	2370480	the foundational questions are, but in terms of
2370480	2372480	my presentation, where do I start?
2372480	2374480	It's not like I look in and just find starting
2374480	2376480	points in these debates.
2376480	2378480	I have to think how am I going to structure
2378480	2380480	this, how am I going to discuss it
2380480	2382480	and explain it, and I pick a place to start.
2382480	2384480	And in short, it would be like that.
2384480	2386480	So it's not as if
2386480	2388480	in the physics book we couldn't introduce any definitions.
2388480	2390480	It's just that
2390480	2392480	we're doing that as a matter of presentation,
2392480	2394480	as convenience, not as a way
2394480	2396480	of reflecting that there really is a distinction
2396480	2398480	in the underlying physical claims.
2398480	2400480	So I suppose in that sense
2400480	2402480	it could be easily misconstrued.
2402480	2404480	It would be in a way a bad idea
2404480	2406480	in a physics book to say, ah,
2406480	2408480	just true by definition of that.
2408480	2410480	Because that sort of implies that it's
2410480	2412480	really true about the claim
2412480	2414480	rather than just by way of talking about it.
2414480	2416480	And indeed, physics books generally
2416480	2418480	don't. They're wise enough
2418480	2420480	not to think, oh, this is a definition
2420480	2422480	of force or a definition of kinetic energy
2422480	2424480	or something.
2424480	2426480	Now, we should
2426480	2428480	end with mathematics.
2428480	2430480	What makes this question
2430480	2432480	intelligible for that?
2436480	2438480	Well, all math adds to luck,
2438480	2440480	as we saw last time, was that
2440480	2442480	and then other things that can be defined
2442480	2444480	in terms of membership. All we need
2444480	2446480	really is certainty.
2446480	2448480	So,
2448480	2450480	how can we
2450480	2452480	introduce that? Now, here, Klein says,
2452480	2454480	actually at this point we are
2454480	2456480	doing something like
2456480	2458480	leading by convention.
2458480	2460480	Does my introduction of that
2460480	2462480	actually presuppose sense?
2462480	2464480	He thinks it doesn't.
2464480	2466480	And so, I don't fall into the trap
2466480	2468480	of logic falsification.
2468480	2470480	On the other hand, neither is it purely
2470480	2472480	arbitrary
2472480	2474480	because after all, I'm not just
2474480	2476480	dealing with a bunch of empirical claims
2476480	2478480	in characterizing the world of sense.
2478480	2480480	I'm not investigating the sense. It's like,
2480480	2482480	ooh, there's a set of students in the room
2482480	2484480	that study the scent.
2484480	2486480	I don't do set experiments
2486480	2488480	like that.
2488480	2490480	Instead, what do I do? Well,
2490480	2492480	I'm characterizing an idea that I'm
2492480	2494480	in effect making up.
2494480	2496480	So, what would I
2496480	2498480	actually do?
2498480	2500480	When I characterized that theory, we talked about this
2500480	2502480	some last time,
2502480	2504480	but today maybe we should do it a little more
2504480	2506480	officially.
2506480	2508480	Here is a principle
2508480	2510480	that we tend to adopt.
2510480	2512480	Extensionality
2512480	2514480	and what it says in logical terms
2514480	2516480	is that
2516480	2518480	well, it establishes an identity
2518480	2520480	criterion for sense.
2520480	2522480	It says for any sense x and y
2522480	2524480	x equals y
2524480	2526480	if and only if for all z
2526480	2528480	z belongs to x
2528480	2530480	if and only if
2530480	2532480	z belongs to y
2532480	2534480	and so
2534480	2536480	to put it in English
2536480	2538480	sets are identical
2538480	2540480	if and only if
2540480	2542480	if and only if
2544480	2546480	they have the same members.
2552480	2554480	Now notice
2554480	2556480	that in doing that
2556480	2558480	I am certainly presupposing
2558480	2560480	logic, right? I'm assuming
2560480	2562480	you understand universal quantification
2562480	2564480	and if and only if and something about
2564480	2566480	well, actually identity is being defined here
2566480	2568480	that's not being presupposed
2568480	2570480	even though when I say it this way
2570480	2572480	the same members might think
2572480	2574480	it sounds like I am, but really
2574480	2576480	I can characterize that just in terms
2576480	2578480	of the if and only if and the all.
2578480	2580480	So this is presupposing
2580480	2582480	logic.
2586480	2588480	Is it arbitrary?
2588480	2590480	Well
2590480	2592480	no, not really
2592480	2594480	I mean I can treat it
2594480	2596480	as a definition of identity with respect to
2596480	2598480	sets or I can treat it as a claim
2598480	2600480	a substantive claim about the nature
2600480	2602480	of sets, but
2602480	2604480	the fact is it does feel like
2604480	2606480	I'm establishing a convention that lays down what a
2606480	2608480	set is. How is a set different
2608480	2610480	from a property for example where this is not
2610480	2612480	true? So it does have the
2612480	2614480	feel of a convention. Now
2614480	2616480	is it exactly a convention
2616480	2618480	do I have to be a convention when I'm talking
2618480	2620480	about it? Well no, I can argue
2620480	2622480	that there is an underlying truth about sets
2622480	2624480	and so forth, so he doesn't want to say
2624480	2626480	this question is decided, but it's not
2626480	2628480	absurd to say I'm establishing this by convention
2628480	2630480	it's not really arbitrary
2630480	2632480	because I
2632480	2634480	do need
2634480	2636480	I do need
2636480	2638480	I do need identity conditions
2638480	2640480	for sets and moreover
2640480	2642480	it has the feel
2642480	2644480	it's a stipulative definition
2644480	2646480	remember
2646480	2648480	stipulative definitions
2648480	2650480	were ones that he thought actually
2650480	2652480	do a set or something like an analytic
2652480	2654480	plane. Why? Because
2654480	2656480	I'm just saying let blah blah blah
2656480	2658480	I introduce
2658480	2660480	a term and I just define it in a certain
2660480	2662480	way and I'm not trying to capture previous
2662480	2664480	use it, I'm not
2664480	2666480	introducing this in the context of a broad
2666480	2668480	theoretical understanding, I'm just saying
2668480	2670480	let this be that
2670480	2672480	you know, let a metric space be
2672480	2674480	blah blah blah blah
2674480	2676480	and that defines a metric space
2676480	2678480	I'm just introducing the term in that way, it's not like
2678480	2680480	I have some previous concept on that, yeah
2680480	2682480	but isn't the
2682480	2684480	set
2684480	2686480	symbol in the definition?
2686480	2688480	the set symbol is in the definition
2688480	2690480	oh, I see what you're saying, so wait a minute
2690480	2692480	why don't I presuppose
2692480	2694480	sets? This seems like twice as clear
2694480	2696480	as the logic of why it would presuppose
2696480	2698480	yeah, right
2698480	2700480	what I end up doing
2700480	2702480	is introducing a bunch of different
2702480	2704480	axioms
2704480	2706480	all of which are going to involve this symbol
2706480	2708480	and so
2708480	2710480	now I end up saying, yeah, really
2710480	2712480	I can treat it as a definition of this
2712480	2714480	but what about that?
2714480	2716480	am I presupposing the sets in all of this
2716480	2718480	by putting in that symbol?
2718480	2720480	I think the
2720480	2722480	claim is meant to be, no, I'm giving
2722480	2724480	you a bunch of statements about
2724480	2726480	that symbol and then that symbol
2726480	2728480	is supposed to be defined as whatever those claims
2728480	2730480	are true of
2730480	2732480	but yeah, that's
2732480	2734480	that's a doctrine
2734480	2736480	called implicit definition, Russell's
2736480	2738480	well, other people were fond of it actually
2738480	2740480	at one point, Russell said it had
2740480	2742480	all the advantage of theft over honest
2742480	2744480	toy
2744480	2746480	and so
2746480	2748480	in a way, that's why Gwynne thinks
2748480	2750480	look, it's a meaningful question but
2750480	2752480	it would be possible to say
2752480	2754480	can I treat it that way?
2754480	2756480	his claim is that that isn't presupposed
2756480	2758480	it's in part characterized by this
2758480	2760480	you could do the same thing for logic though
2760480	2762480	right, couldn't you do implicit
2762480	2764480	definition and just call it
2764480	2766480	implicit and say it's not presupposed
2766480	2768480	it's whatever, yeah, yeah, well
2768480	2770480	that's a good question
2770480	2772480	unfortunately, we're past
2772480	2774480	of time
2774480	2776480	so, next time we'll think about that
2776480	2778480	question and we'll look at Carnap's
2778480	2780480	paper, empiricism, mathematics and
2780480	2782480	ontology and see how he tries
2782480	2784480	to avoid these problems
