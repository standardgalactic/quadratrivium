0	9640	Hi, I'm going to talk to you today about Hume's method.
9640	12840	Hume is an empiricist par excellence.
12840	19320	Locke, you might say, is one of those philosophers who has an idea, in theory of knowledge, empiricism,
19320	23440	but he's trying to combine that with all sorts of other insights, and so he, for example,
23440	25600	tries to prove the existence of God.
25600	31560	He talks unapologetically about powers, about capacities, about causation.
31560	35720	He does a variety of other things that later empiricists have thought are dubious things
35720	37220	to do.
37220	41960	He develops an extensive political philosophy and other works where he talks about obligations
41960	46720	and rights, and a variety of other things that it's rather hard to reconcile with his
46720	49520	empiricist foundations.
49520	50600	Hume is not like that.
50600	54680	If Locke is somebody who is combining a bunch of different insights about a bunch of different
54680	60240	areas and trying to make them fit together in a complex philosophical framework, Hume
60240	62120	is somebody who has one idea.
62120	67000	He takes over that idea from Locke of empiricism, and he says, I'm going to pursue that to
67000	69520	a bitter end, and that's what he does.
69520	73340	So he finds out that all sorts of things have to be rethought.
73340	76900	He doesn't take anything like our common sense conception of causation or obligation
76900	83080	or rights or anything else, really, and say, somehow we have to build that into the empiricist
83080	84080	framework.
84200	85200	Locke's mission.
85200	89180	Hume instead develops a method and says it either fits or it doesn't, and if it doesn't
89180	90880	fit, out with it.
90880	97640	So Hume is going to interpret empiricism rather differently, even though you might say, look,
97640	102560	his method is basically just Locke's, yes, but used in a rather different way.
102560	108520	So his classic work is a treatise of human nature, and there is my well-loved copy of
108520	109520	it.
109520	112400	Hume wrote that when he was only 23 years old.
112400	117040	That's a remarkable masterpiece for someone who was so young.
117040	122640	Later he wrote a small book, The Inquiry, which was meant to summarize and publicize
122640	123720	this.
123720	128720	He wrote it with great expectations of having produced a great philosophical work, but then,
128720	132240	as he put it later, it fell stillborn from the press.
132240	134120	It didn't attract much attention.
134120	139080	Nobody paid any real attention to it at all, even to refute it, and it took a long time
139080	142880	for Hume to be recognized as a great philosopher.
142880	146640	Even throughout the 19th century, he would have been viewed as somebody notable, but
146640	149240	not one of the true philosophical greats.
149240	154120	Whereas on the contemporary scene in England and the United States, Australia, New Zealand,
154120	158760	in short, in the English-speaking world, he's viewed as one of the most important philosophers
158760	164360	in history, and a treatise of human nature is now viewed as one of the greatest philosophical
164360	166880	classics.
166880	170920	With Hume outlines his method there, and we've talked about some of the basic elements, so
170920	175520	I'm going to review them here just to remind you, because they're crucial to understanding
175520	178800	where that method is coming from and how it's being used.
178800	180600	They're simple and complex ideas.
180600	185320	The complex ideas are built out of the simple ideas, and they come from simple impressions.
185320	188200	Moreover, they represent them exactly.
188200	192700	We build more complex ideas, often we stray very far from experience, and maybe from any
192700	199020	content at all, but at the level of the simple ideas, we've got a direct and exact match
199020	200780	to simple impressions.
200780	204660	So Hume says all our simple ideas in their first appearance have derived from simple
204660	210140	impressions, which are corresponded to them and which they exactly represent.
210140	216580	Those simple impressions are things that Locke would have referred to as sensations, or reflections,
216580	220860	that is to say, awarenesses of our own mental states.
220860	226140	This method, as we've seen, is to take things we think we know, but might just turn out
226140	230660	to be faith, or opinion, or even superstition, and try to figure out whether those beliefs
230660	234100	count as knowledge by tracing them back to their origins.
234100	240060	We trace the ideas that are part of that knowledge, or belief, and go back to where
240060	241460	we got those ideas.
241460	246780	We trace them to the origins and experience to find out whether this really counts as
246780	251340	knowledge, whether we have good evidence for our beliefs, whether any of those would
251340	253220	count as certain, and so on.
253220	258380	We want to understand which ones are really just opinion and which ones are knowledge.
258380	262420	Well, the empiricist method in general is inspired by that.
262420	267900	We take complex ideas, we examine the simple ideas they're made of, we find the origins
267900	273540	of those simple ideas and the simple impressions and experience that they come from, and here's
273540	280580	the idea, the content of the idea lies in those simple impressions from which it comes.
280580	286820	So we trace things back to what it, well, what gave rise to it, what it popped out of
286820	289060	in experience.
289060	292180	But there is a complication, even at that basic level.
292180	296820	It's partly because we abstract, combine, negate, disjoin, and do all sorts of other
296820	300300	things with our ideas that we can diverge far from reality.
300300	301620	But it's not only that.
301620	307620	There are other problems as well, because our ideas are weak in comparison with impressions.
307620	312420	Even the simple ideas are weak in comparison with the impression itself, even though there's
312420	313420	the same content.
313420	318380	The content matches exactly, but the force and the vacity, as Hume puts it, are very
318380	319380	different.
319380	325380	He says all ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure.
325380	327460	The mind has but a slender hold of them.
327460	330260	There have to be confounded with other resembling ideas.
330260	333740	And when we have often employed any term, though without a distinct meaning, we're
333740	337460	up to imagine it has a determinate idea next to it.
337460	341020	So ideas are relatively faint, obscure, or weak.
341020	343780	And that's true even at the relatively simple level.
343780	348060	If we think about ideas of colors, those ideas are fairly weak.
348060	351940	If I show you the impressions, it's easy to tell them apart.
351940	355460	I might show you two different shades of paint I'm considering.
355460	360100	And when I hold the paint patches up, you can very clearly discern the difference between
360100	360940	them.
360940	364540	And the impression, the sensation is very strong, it's very vivid.
364540	366060	You see that they're different.
366060	370060	But now, you forget their names, you go back to the paint store and you say, well, I know
370060	373220	I like that one better than the other.
373220	374900	But which one was it?
374900	379900	And you go and you look at the chart now and you say, maybe you have luckily the same thought,
379900	381660	but maybe there's no chart.
381660	384820	Maybe the guy at the paint store says, well, I'm sorry, we're all out of charts, but what
384820	387100	was the name of the paint?
387100	389580	And you suddenly go, I don't remember.
389580	391060	And you try to call it up your mind.
391060	394180	He says, well, was it this one?
394180	395660	I don't know.
395660	398180	I have the idea of that color.
398180	403900	Maybe I can do remember the name or something like it, but the problem is I can't now distinguish
403900	404900	it.
404900	410420	If somebody says, yeah, all these things got mixed up and they're all mislabeled.
410420	414220	So is it this or is it that?
414220	415300	You may not know.
415300	418380	And maybe you've seen it, but maybe you no longer remember it.
418380	420860	The idea is weak in comparison with the impression.
420860	423580	The content's the same, but it lacks the same force.
423580	425260	It lacks the same velocity.
425260	428060	Well, impressions in contrast are strong.
428060	431660	When you're right there looking at the chip of paint, it's very prominent to you, right?
431660	432660	It's very strong.
432660	437340	It hits you hard as a word mentally, whereas the idea, the memory of it and so on, that's
437340	439140	much weaker.
439140	444980	So Hume says all impressions, all sensations, either outward or inward are strong and vivid.
444980	448060	The limits between there are more exactly determined.
448060	451060	Or is it easy to fall into any error or mistake in regard to them?
451060	455620	I can tell the difference between the paint chips when I'm looking at them directly, but
455620	460660	trying to remember them later or just saying, okay, I remember one was called Belgian chocolate
460660	467180	and the other was called German chocolate and which was which and which one did I like
467180	471060	better and what exactly did that German chocolate thing look like?
471060	473660	I may not be able to remember that.
473660	478740	Well Hume's method then is to say, if I want to understand the content of my ideas, I have
478740	480140	to go back to the impressions.
480140	484300	I have to go back to what they come from in experience.
484300	488460	Now in the case of a paint color, all right, that's not too hard.
488460	490580	I know what impression that came from.
490580	491860	And so I can go back to that.
491860	495700	I know the idea was a content and not where, yeah, you're just making up that German chocolate
495700	496700	thing.
496700	497700	No, no, no, I saw the chip.
497700	498940	I know, I saw it.
498940	502940	I may not remember now exactly what it looks like, but I know I saw it.
502940	506140	But a lot of more abstract ideas are not like that.
506140	510060	A few years ago, somebody came and gave a talk in the English department.
510060	514540	And the main concept of their talk was the concept of hegemony.
514540	519700	There was an older professor in the audience who heard the talk and stood up at the end
519700	524460	to ask a question and said, I have a very simple basic question.
524460	527380	What is hegemony?
527380	531300	And the speaker didn't know how to answer that, didn't know how to give a definition.
531300	536180	And that's one of those things where you might say, well, okay, a lot of academic discourse
536180	537180	is like that.
537180	542020	A lot of things that go on in the university involve terms that are very abstract, very
542020	543980	far removed from experience.
543980	547820	It's not at all like, oh, that German chocolate color I saw at the Sherwin-Williams store.
547820	550100	No, it's like something else.
550100	551100	It is much more abstract.
551100	553540	And you might think, wait, what is the content?
553540	554540	I don't know.
554540	559100	Here's somebody who had written a doctoral dissertation on it and couldn't give a definition.
559100	560540	And so you might think, well, wait a minute.
560540	564820	I mean, if that person doesn't know what the content is, how am I supposed to know what
564820	565820	the content is?
565820	570860	Now, that's not to say that particular concept or any other particular concept is meaningless
570860	573460	or contradictory or absurd or anything.
573460	578060	But humans say, look, it's super easy in that kind of abstract discourse to start talking
578060	582300	about things without really having a clear idea of what you're talking about, to use
582300	587500	terms without any ideas that are so vague, we have no idea what their content is.
587500	591420	So to understand this kind of thing, we have to trace it back.
591420	597780	Now, a lot of early analytic philosophers inspired by Hume thought that philosophers
597780	602700	of their era, and often they were idealists, personalists, for example, around the turn
602700	603940	of the century.
603940	608940	Or people like Heidegger, they attacked us using all sorts of meaningless concepts.
608940	614380	And indeed, a lot of those philosophers say things that are rather bizarre, absolute idealists
614380	620220	around the turn of the century were fond of talking about a world's soul, a soul of
620220	623260	a person that's already hard enough, but a soul of the world?
623260	624900	What does that mean?
624900	627340	What content could that possibly have?
627340	631540	Or Heidegger talks about nothingness, the nothing, as if that's an object.
631540	635100	I mean, what do you mean the nothing?
635100	636620	That's very strange.
636620	638660	Heidegger talks about the horizon.
638660	643860	Well, I think that actually does have a precise meaning, but it's not obvious what it is.
643860	649340	And so the analytic philosophers, look, I have a shirt.
649340	652300	I might have a personality, but do I have a horizon?
652300	653900	I don't know.
653900	658020	And he didn't mean, by the way, the physical horizon of where the earth meets the sky.
658020	659860	He meant something much more abstract.
659860	663220	So in short, you might say, I don't know what content these things have.
663220	667940	If they do have a content, I want to trace that back to experience.
667940	673780	So Hume often entertains a suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about.
673820	677860	And he says, when that happens, when we entertain any suspicion that a philosophical term is
677860	683780	employed without any meaning or idea, as is but too frequent, we need but inquire from
683780	687860	what impression is that supposed idea derived?
687860	692260	And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion.
692260	696980	By bringing ideas into so clear a light, we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute,
696980	700940	which may arise concerning their nature and reality.
700940	706100	So if somebody starts talking about some abstract idea, whether it's the nothing or
706100	713700	the horizon or hegemony or the world soul, Hume says, all right, look, from what impression
713700	714700	is this derived?
714700	717340	Okay, tell me what an experience generates this.
717340	720260	You've got an idea of a world soul?
720260	723620	Well, what do you mean?
723620	724620	Where'd you get that idea?
724620	730820	So maybe, well, I studied Neoplatonism, well, where'd the Neoplatonists get that idea?
730820	732980	Come on, I mean, what do you mean?
732980	736380	It's hard enough to figure out what a soul of a human being would be.
736380	738100	I don't know what this even means.
738100	739460	So where's the impression?
739460	741700	What are you talking about in the end?
741700	746020	And later, pragmatists will adapt this to their own purposes, as we'll see, and start
746020	747860	talking about the cash value of an idea.
747860	750060	What difference does it make to practice?
750060	752940	Say there is a world soul, or say there isn't, who cares?
752940	754540	What difference does it make?
754540	758500	And you might say something similar here, but Hume means something more specific, not
758500	761120	just what difference does it make in practical terms.
761120	762740	He means trace it back.
762740	765220	Where inexperience did this come from?
765220	769260	And if you just made it up out of thin air without an experience to back it up to give
769260	772580	it content, I'm going to say it has no content.
772580	775500	Maybe of course it will turn out it has a content that's very different from what you
775500	776500	think it is.
776500	777500	You've lost the thread.
777500	780740	And so, yeah, it did mean something, but you know what?
780740	784380	That makes everything you're saying absurd, if that's the meaning of it.
784380	786380	So we've got to watch out for both things.
786380	788020	Maybe it doesn't mean anything.
788020	791580	Maybe it means something really different, and you're misusing it.
791580	794500	Well Hume's method then is this.
794500	798340	We take our ideas and we're trying to figure out which ones are adequate, which ones actually
798340	800180	match experience.
800180	804340	So we trace them back to their simple impressions from which they're derived.
804340	806780	That's their real content.
806780	808860	Sometimes it will turn out we can't do it.
808860	811380	There is no real impression underlying this.
811380	815260	And so we end up saying this is just, you know, and maybe with world soul that's what's
815260	816260	going on.
816260	818300	There just is no content to that.
818300	820060	There is no impression underlying it.
820060	821060	We said, meaningless.
821060	823660	It doesn't mean anything at all.
823660	825420	Sometimes maybe it's contradictory.
825420	829660	We take apart the idea and we find out in the end it's not that it doesn't have any
829660	831340	corresponding impression.
831340	834220	It's that it has corresponding impressions that clash.
834220	836820	So in the end it looks like, gosh, it has a content.
836820	839540	But the content is sort of like round square.
839540	841500	It's something that is itself contradictory.
841500	843660	It makes no sense.
843660	846700	Sometimes it will turn out it does have a content, but it's not what we thought.
846700	850180	And so much of what we're saying about it turns out to be false.
850180	854380	So Hume will say, look at things like this, especially when you start entertaining this
854380	857100	suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about.
857100	859500	Say, look, what are you talking about?
859500	862300	Sometimes it's going to turn out to be nothing.
862300	866900	Sometimes it will be, well, something, but completely incoherent and contradictory.
866900	871220	Sometimes it just will be something surprising that isn't what they seem to be talking about
871220	873900	at all.
873900	879060	I want to go back to remind us quickly of what an empiricist thinks, because it brings out
879060	881900	another aspect of the method.
881900	887860	The question between judgment empiricists and judgment rationalists is the question of synthetic
887860	889620	a priori judgment.
889620	892420	Those other three categories everybody agrees about.
892420	896620	There are things that are analytic and a priori, synthetic and a posteriori.
896620	899460	Nobody thinks there's anything that's analytic and a posteriori.
899460	903220	The question is whether there can be anything that is synthetic a priori.
903220	907140	Something that's synthetic truly about the world and not just about language, but on
907140	912460	the other hand a priori, knowable independently of experience of the world.
912460	914500	The empiricist says, well, obviously not.
914500	917700	How could you know what the world without having experience of the world?
917700	919540	But the rationalist says, you can.
919540	923460	You can through reason alone, through reflection, through thought experiments, through things
923460	925100	like that.
925540	931500	The judgment empiricist says, yeah, I'm not going to believe that I can get anywhere purely
931500	936940	by examining my own mind purely through this idea of thought experiments and so on.
936940	940500	All that does is tell me about the relations of ideas inside my mind.
940500	944740	It doesn't take me outside my mind to the world.
944740	949420	That implies that from an empiricist point of view, there are only two kinds of knowledge.
949420	954700	All knowledge, assuming that there is any content at all to what somebody claims to know, it's
954700	957260	got to go back to one of those two categories.
957260	961820	It's got to be either analytic and a priori or synthetic and a posteriori.
961820	966340	Either it's an empirical truth about the world as natural sciences, that's the synthetic
966340	972940	a posteriori part, or it's analytic a priori in the sense that it is purely verbal, purely
972940	978100	a matter of logic, but in that way doesn't tell us anything directly about the world,
978100	981660	but still it's something knowable independently of experience.
981660	984700	Lots of things are like that from an empiricist point of view, at least from the point of
984700	991220	view of Hume and many other empiricists, logic is like that, knowledge on the basis of definitions
991220	993860	is like that, mathematics is like that.
993860	998780	So I can know that a bachelor is a bachelor, or that a bachelor is unmarried, or that one
998780	1001980	plus one is two, purely on the basis of definitions.
1001980	1005980	I don't need experience of the world because they're not really about the world.
1005980	1010220	But anything that really is about the world, like there are more than a dozen chairs in
1010220	1012780	this room, that requires experience.
1012780	1018540	I can't know that just by reflecting on chairs and rooms, I have to actually have experience
1018540	1020060	of the room.
1020060	1024060	And that means that's synthetic and a posteriori.
1024060	1028180	I need experience to gain that knowledge of the world.
1028180	1030420	So there are two kinds of knowledge.
1030420	1034540	Basically there's a kind of knowledge you find in logic, in definitions, in mathematics,
1034540	1038740	in dictionaries, there's the kind of knowledge you find in natural science, history and other
1038780	1043180	things that are really describing the world on the basis of experience.
1043180	1045220	That's it, there's nothing else.
1045220	1047100	So what does that exclude?
1047100	1051780	Well we might take a look at various things that rationalists have called synthetic a priori
1051780	1052780	truths.
1052780	1056740	We've looked at this list before, so I'll just remind you a little bit of the kind
1056740	1057740	of thing here.
1057740	1061620	Avicenna talks about the whole being greater than the parts, or things equal to the same
1061620	1063220	thing being equal to each other.
1063220	1065860	For Descartes, I think, I am.
1065860	1067260	Nothing's made from nothing.
1067260	1069860	What's been done can't be undone.
1069860	1072460	Nothing could be and not be at the same time.
1072460	1077780	Could exist and not exist at the same time, but also, for example, could not be red and
1077780	1081180	green all over at the same time.
1081180	1085860	Leibniz, no fact without a sufficient reason why it should be so and not otherwise.
1085860	1088180	Kant, every event has a cause.
1088180	1092300	Seven plus five is twelve and every other mathematical truth, including the truths of
1092300	1096780	geometry, like between any two points lies one and only one line.
1096780	1100740	All of those are examples of synthetic a priori truths, and of course philosophers have
1100740	1102620	had their candidates, too.
1102620	1107500	Things like God exists, the soul is immortal, the world consists of substances and attributes,
1107500	1112700	the will is free, every substance has an essence, you ought to seek the good, happiness is intrinsically
1112700	1115860	good, courage is a virtue, and so on.
1115860	1120900	Well, if we take a look at all of these, you've says, and examine them and try to understand
1120900	1125900	where they're coming from and whether they're legitimate, we only have a few choices.
1125900	1129820	So he gives us a test for nonsense.
1129820	1135260	Hume says, when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make?
1135260	1139820	If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us
1139820	1144660	ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?
1144660	1145660	No.
1145660	1150060	Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?
1150060	1151060	No.
1151060	1156580	Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.
1156580	1159500	So Hume is saying something rather remarkable here.
1159500	1161020	Commit it to the flames.
1161020	1165020	Either it's got abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number, in other words, it's got
1165020	1169540	logic and mathematics in it, in which case it's knowledge, it's analytic, it's not really
1169540	1174940	knowledge of the world, but it may be highly useful anyway, or what about experimental reasoning
1174940	1177500	concerning matter of fact and existence?
1177500	1178500	That's highly useful.
1178500	1180940	That's what natural science is in a different way.
1180940	1184300	It's what history is, political sciences, economics is, and so on.
1184300	1187940	All of those are really expressing truths about the world.
1187940	1191580	Don't think of experimental here as just within a laboratory.
1191580	1195740	Really it's a question of matters of fact about the world.
1195740	1197340	That's fine too.
1197340	1200220	But there are all sorts of other things that aren't like that.
1200220	1204300	So let's run down that list and find out what we do with them.
1204300	1210300	Nothing has to be classified as either analytic or synthetic, or as utterly meaningless.
1210300	1211300	So we look through.
1211300	1215780	As empiricists, the whole is greater than its parts, almost certainly Hume would say,
1215780	1216780	that's analytic.
1216780	1219700	It's just a question of the meaning of whole in part.
1219700	1221740	Things equal to the same thing or equal to each other.
1221740	1225740	He said that's part of the meaning of equality, analytic.
1225740	1227380	Nothing's made from nothing.
1227380	1229700	Now that seems to be a claim about the world.
1229700	1231820	Nothing just pops into existence.
1231820	1233460	Nothing is made out of nothing.
1233460	1235500	Things have to be made out of other things.
1235500	1239980	If I'm going to have a factory that is going to produce some object, I've got to have inputs
1239980	1240980	to my factory.
1240980	1245140	I can't just say, Alakazam, and poof, it goes out of nothing.
1245140	1247020	But that seems like a claim about the world.
1247020	1253500	There's no conceptual absurdity about a magician or a wizard suddenly creating something out
1253500	1254860	of thin air.
1254860	1255860	Could happen.
1255860	1259060	It's not incoherent in the sense of being logically contradictory.
1259060	1262540	So it's not an analytic truth that nothing is made from nothing.
1262540	1264300	It's a claim about the world.
1264300	1268660	So humans say, well, but look, it's pretty darn well established, right?
1268660	1270780	It's on the basis of experience.
1270780	1273500	We say that things don't just pop out of thin air.
1273500	1275900	Things are made out of other things.
1275900	1278660	It's impossible for anything to be and not be at the same time.
1278660	1283940	Well, be and not be, it's part of the meaning of negation, that that's true, he would say.
1283940	1286120	What's been done can't be undone.
1286120	1288300	That seems to be a claim about the world.
1288300	1291260	After all, I can erase what I've written on a page.
1291260	1294180	Here we mean really go back into the past.
1294180	1297500	It's something like saying time travel is impossible.
1297500	1300860	Well, that's a claim about the world.
1300860	1304420	That's not just an analytic truth, and it can't be anything else.
1304420	1306540	It's a factual claim about the world.
1306540	1307540	Might turn out to be true.
1307540	1309140	Might turn out to be false.
1309140	1313500	Kurt Girdle showed that there are actually circular time loops that are consistent with
1313500	1315780	the axioms of general relativity.
1315780	1317540	So who knows?
1317540	1319340	Every event has a cause.
1319420	1321780	Similarly, that's a claim about the world.
1321780	1322780	Might turn out to be true.
1322780	1328860	Might turn out to be false if there are truly random events in quantum mechanics, for example.
1328860	1333540	But then we turn to the philosophical ones, and now Hume says, look, a lot of these might
1333540	1335460	turn out to be meaningless.
1335460	1336460	God exists.
1336460	1337460	That's surely not analytic.
1337460	1339140	It's a claim about the world.
1339140	1341620	Might be true or false about the world.
1341620	1343460	And does it even have a meaning?
1343460	1349060	We have to inquire into the content of the concept God, and trace that back to its origin
1349180	1350180	and experience.
1350180	1351780	Maybe we can do that.
1351780	1352780	Maybe we can't.
1352780	1357660	And so some empiricists have said we can, some others have said we can't, controversial.
1357660	1359860	So it might be a synthetic claim.
1359860	1363900	It might, on the other hand, be meaningless if you think that your concept of God is one
1363900	1366980	that can't be tied back to any kind of impression.
1366980	1368860	What about the soul is immortal?
1368860	1373820	Well, depends on this question of the soul, right?
1373820	1378900	I mean, mortal, that we can find the origins for an experience.
1378940	1379940	People experience death.
1379940	1381580	They see things die.
1381580	1383180	So that's not a problem.
1383180	1387260	We can negate the concept of being mortal and get immortal.
1387260	1389660	But what about soul?
1389660	1392020	Here we have to say, well, I don't know.
1392020	1394420	So that's why that was also controversial.
1394420	1398180	Maybe it's a factual claim about the world that there are such things as souls in the
1398180	1402420	world and that those things can survive death.
1402420	1406620	But on the other hand, maybe it's really meaningless if it turns out that we can't make any sense
1406620	1407980	of the idea of soul.
1407980	1412260	So once again, there's a place where we may or may not be able to use the empiricist method
1412260	1415820	to trace back the content of our concept of a soul.
1415820	1416940	What about the freedom of the will?
1416940	1418820	Well, it's the same thing in a way.
1418820	1421700	It's similarly controversial.
1421700	1422980	What do we mean by the will?
1422980	1424660	What do we mean by freedom?
1424660	1429100	Maybe we can make good sense of that, but if we can, that seems to be a claim about the
1429100	1432500	world and about this thing called the will.
1432500	1436220	But maybe we can't, in which case that's really a meaningless claim.
1436220	1438620	Maybe substance has an essence.
1438620	1444420	Again, this idea of a substance, well, Locke thinks we can trace that back to experience.
1444420	1446620	Hume and Barclay think we can't.
1446620	1448460	What about an essence?
1448460	1453620	Actually all of these empiricists after Locke tend to be suspicious of that notion.
1453620	1457140	Locke thinks we can make good sense of the concept of an essence.
1457140	1458860	Barclay and Hume deny it.
1458860	1462580	So we're going to see a sharp divide among empiricists on that one.
1462580	1464020	You ought to seek the good.
1464020	1468820	Well, we might worry that obligation or the good actually turns out to be meaningless
1468820	1472140	and we can't trace it back to experience in the right way.
1472140	1476380	So maybe that turns out to be meaningless, or maybe it's simply analytic.
1476380	1480260	That's how the good is defined, that which is worth seeking.
1480260	1482580	And then finally courage is a virtue.
1482580	1487020	Maybe that's just part of the definition of courage, but maybe it's a synthetic claim
1487020	1492220	about the world that in general it's a good thing to be courageous, or maybe we end up
1492220	1495140	saying courage or more likely virtue.
1495140	1499100	We don't know how to make sense of that in purely experiential terms.
1499100	1501820	So with all of these we apply Hume's method.
1501820	1505260	And sometimes we say, that's not synthetic a priori.
1505260	1510060	That's not a real truth about the world that we can only discover through reason alone,
1510060	1515020	but that, well I shouldn't say only discover, that we can discover through reason only without
1515020	1516940	experience of the world.
1516940	1523980	Instead we have to say either it's analytic, like holes are greater than their parts, or
1523980	1528980	it's a synthetic claim about the world, like you can't go back and change the past, or
1528980	1531620	it's something that's utterly meaningless.
1531620	1534060	So what if it's utterly meaningless?
1534060	1539260	Well Hume says quite figuratively, I hope, commit it to the flames.
1539260	1543620	Or more rationally you might say, don't pay any attention to it.
1543620	1545060	You can gain nothing from it.
1545060	1546060	It's meaningless.
1546060	1547500	It has no content.
1547500	1548780	So you will learn nothing from it.
1548780	1550740	You can gain no knowledge from it.
1550740	1552620	And lots of people talk nonsense.
1552620	1555820	You would say, look, this isn't a problem if people didn't talk nonsense all the time,
1555820	1557260	but they do.
1557260	1562140	And so hang around the university for a while, you'll find all sorts of people talking nonsense.
1562140	1564780	And it's not just in universities, tune into the media.
1564780	1566600	A lot of people are talking nonsense.
1566600	1568300	It happens all around you.
1568300	1569860	And it happens day to day.
1569860	1571880	It happens in almost every setting.
1571880	1574540	You encounter people, they start talking about things.
1574540	1576420	Sometimes those things are really things about the world.
1576420	1577740	You understand their content.
1577740	1578740	Maybe they're true.
1578740	1579740	Maybe they're false.
1579740	1581980	But sometimes they don't mean anything at all.
1581980	1584580	So Hume says, be on your guard.
1584580	1588100	And even though I am not going to tell you, commit anything to the flames, I think it's
1588100	1592580	a really bad idea, I will tell you there are things that you really should ignore.
1592580	1596380	And you should simply say, yeah, I'm going to learn nothing out of this.
1596380	1597620	Nothing good can come from this.
