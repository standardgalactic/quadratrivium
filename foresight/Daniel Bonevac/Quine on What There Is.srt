1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Well, now let's start talking about Klein and his analysis of ontology.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,520
Klein's way of thinking about Oziloffical Matters has been hugely significant.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,360
The thing starts, you might say, his project starts in the 1930s.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,240
He goes to Vienna, he's working with Karnapp, takes a position at Harvard and stays at Harvard

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,440
his entire career, ends up shaping the Harvard Department in crucial ways and turning it

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,280
into one of the, well, for the entire time he was there, really, one of the top two or three

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,240
departments of philosophy in the United States.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,600
Klein's influence was felt partly through the power of his work.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,400
He's a great writer and so has a lot of influence, partly because it is important

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,960
philosophically, partly because the stylistic excellence of this makes him fun to read.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,360
And it's not often you encounter philosophy that's fun to read.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,360
So I think a lot of people read Klein when they might have been tempted not to read a similar set of ideas

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,960
from another writer just because he's such a great writer.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,480
But also because Klein's students end up having a huge amount of power in the profession and well-deserved power.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,360
He has many of the greatest philosophers of the next generation studying with him.

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,560
And so there are lots of people whose views he shapes.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:32,880
Saul Kripke, David Lewis, a variety of other people are Klein students and end up shaping the world of philosophy in the realm.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,640
So Klein's influence is both direct and indirect.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Now last time we were examining Klein on autology and we saw there was something key that he develops.

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,600
It becomes known as Klein's criteria of logical commitment.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,400
There are different ways of putting this, but the most famous formulation, as we saw, was just this.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:15,280
To be is to be a value of a variable.

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,640
And last time we talked about what that meant.

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,320
The idea was really that we have some statement like this.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,520
And what does that say? There is an x such that a holds true of x.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,560
Or in other words in English that says there are a's.

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,240
Now understood in terms of its meaning, what this really means is that there is some domain of objects.

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,800
And then we identify some of those as a's.

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
So there are some objects x in here such that a is true of x.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:03,800
And we might think, okay, so one way of looking at this is that there is some non-empty subset of that domain consisting of a's.

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
And so you might think, yeah, that's the a's in our domain.

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,320
And that's what this means.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:17,960
So we could even think about the English but what, when we con Knight ourselves ontologically to something when they say there are such things.

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:26,280
To ontologically commit yourself to people is to say there are people, to ontologically commit yourself to red things is to say there are red things.

35
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,380
Does ontologically commit yourself to numbers is to say there are numbers, to ontologically commit yourself to attributes is to say there are attributes.

36
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,300
And all of those could be put in logical terms

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,580
in this sort of way.

38
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,940
They could be put in English terms

39
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,460
by just saying there are these things.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,340
We can think of it in terms of model theory, which

41
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,780
is what this way of interpreting the logic comes to.

42
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,500
These things are understood as models.

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,460
There's a domain of objects and then properties and relations

44
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,780
that can be defined on that set of objects.

45
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,420
And to say there are attributes is just

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,020
to say some of the things in our domain are attributes.

47
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,740
To say there are red things, some of the things

48
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,620
that are domain are red.

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,060
There are people, some of the things in the domain are people.

50
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,820
So we can think of this in sort of syntactic terms,

51
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,740
either formally or informally.

52
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,660
We can think of it in semantic terms,

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,140
as saying there are certain kinds of things in our domain.

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,380
And ultimately, the domain is the domain of all things.

55
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,220
That's right.

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
Well, yes.

57
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,540
This can be understood as the domain of just everything,

58
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,820
all things.

59
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,340
On the other hand, in a lot of contexts,

60
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,180
we don't have in mind everything.

61
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,420
So for example, suppose I am thinking

62
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,380
about the various people in this class

63
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
and how you're doing on your papers,

64
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,580
then actually the domain that's relevant to that

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,420
are the people in the class and the papers.

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,340
And I'm not worried about the rest of the word.

67
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,820
If somebody says, but what about Vladimir Putin?

68
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,540
I don't think.

69
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,300
Oh, yeah, Vladimir Putin's an art domain.

70
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,100
I better think about him, too.

71
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,180
No.

72
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,980
I'm just going to say, yeah, the domain of objects

73
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
that's relevant to this particular context

74
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,620
is one involving students and papers.

75
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,580
And that's it.

76
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,660
So frequently in language, what happens

77
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,020
is we don't focus on this entire domain of everything.

78
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,260
If I say, everyone's here.

79
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,300
I don't mean everyone in the universe here.

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,580
I mean, everyone in the class, for example, is here.

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,220
So often in language, we really are talking about a much

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,980
more restricted domain.

83
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,500
But yes, in the abstract, we could

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,260
be talking about everything.

85
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,500
And indeed, when we're thinking about ontology

86
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,860
in the broadest sense, that's what we want to do.

87
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,260
Think about the way Klein opens his famous essay

88
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,460
on what there is.

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,340
A curious thing about the ontological problem

90
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,740
is its simplicity.

91
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,060
It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.

92
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,020
What is there?

93
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,180
It can be answered, moreover, in a word, everything.

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,620
And everyone will accept this answer is true.

95
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,540
So in a sense, if we're asking that basic ontological

96
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,780
question, what is there, then the answer is everything.

97
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,060
And so we do want this domain to include everything

98
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,580
for those purposes.

99
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,460
However, this is merely a saying that there is what there is.

100
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,580
There remains room for disagreement over cases.

101
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,500
And so the issue is stabilized after centuries.

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,420
And so that tells us when we're doing metaphysics,

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,900
we typically have in mind a domain that just consists

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,020
of everything.

105
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,900
Well, OK, so this looks like a very simple picture.

106
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,980
But it's actually not quite so simple.

107
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,940
Because even in his essay from 1939,

108
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,220
a logistical approach to the ontological problem,

109
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,300
after saying that to be is to be a value of a variable,

110
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,500
he says, well, of course, sometimes we

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,420
speak as if certain sync-categorical expressions

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,060
were names of entities.

113
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,540
We talked last time about the roundness of pebbles,

114
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,500
or the roundness of the clock.

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,660
And you might think, actually, roundness

116
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,860
is something I don't want to recognize.

117
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,460
Admittedly, it looks like I'm quantifying over that.

118
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,060
If I say pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.

119
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,020
But I might want to think, no, that's

120
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,900
an avoidable way of speaking.

121
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,380
And there might be other things that it

122
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,460
looks like I'm committed to by my use of a noun

123
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,500
that I want to retreat and say there's no such thing.

124
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,300
Actually, one of Quine's favorite examples

125
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,700
is to say for the sake of something.

126
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,180
I did it for her sake.

127
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,740
Does that mean there is an x such that I did it for her x?

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,500
No, I mean, sakes aren't things, right?

129
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,340
That's something we'd want to paraphrase in some other way.

130
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,340
If I did that for my wife's sake,

131
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,820
then I want to be ontologically committed to my wife.

132
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,340
But I don't want to be ontologically committed

133
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
to her sake.

134
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,700
I don't know what that would even be, right?

135
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,180
So sometimes he says, we speak as if these things are actually

136
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,460
names of entities, but we hold that these are merely

137
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,740
manners of speaking, that the expressions are not actually

138
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,180
names, that the alleged entities are convenient fictions.

139
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,300
This notion of fiction can be given a clear meaning

140
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,260
from the point of view of the present developments

141
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,980
to speak as if certain expressions were names

142
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,540
is to allow those expressions to replace and be replaced

143
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,180
by variables according to the laws of quantification.

144
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,580
But if this is to be merely a convenient and theoretically

145
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,340
avoidable manner of speaking, we must

146
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,460
be able to translate such usage into another idiom, which

147
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,420
does not require the expressions in question

148
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,540
to replace and be replaced by variables.

149
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,980
So there is another possibility that emerges here.

150
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,900
This is, you might say, the basic way to be committed.

151
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,780
But now we can also say sometimes these things

152
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,980
are avoidable.

153
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,020
So we can say, here's a criterion

154
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,180
of being committed to something.

155
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,420
To be is to be a value of a variable.

156
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,940
It's for us to include it in the domain.

157
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,060
But then we can say, well, all right,

158
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,700
there's another way of looking at this.

159
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,860
Sometimes we do that, and yet we think, nevertheless,

160
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,900
the term is really synchro-grammatic.

161
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,580
We're not really committed, OK?

162
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,140
And so when we really have commitment,

163
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,980
when we can't avoid this.

164
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,660
So sometimes, Quine just puts it this way.

165
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,100
But sometimes he puts it in a different way.

166
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,660
And we'll see an exact formulation

167
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,380
of that in his essay on what there is.

168
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,660
It's really, to be is to be something

169
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,860
that has to be in the domain for what

170
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,140
we're saying to be true.

171
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,780
And it might be that it has to be in the domain directly

172
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,860
because we're saying there are a's and there are a's in the domain.

173
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,340
But sometimes it's the case in this very indirect fashion.

174
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,860
We say there are a's, but really that's

175
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,620
an avoidable way of speaking.

176
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,860
And in the end, what we are quantifying over in our final

177
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,220
domain is just the things we have to recognize,

178
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,100
some things we translate.

179
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,020
So in short, there's this possibility

180
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,340
of, well, reduction of translation,

181
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,100
of eliminating certain ways of speaking.

182
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,420
And before we formulate that in official terms,

183
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,180
I want to give us some examples and see

184
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,780
how he thinks about this.

185
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,060
So let's turn back to on what there is.

186
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,900
Because here he formulates a nice puzzle right at the outset.

187
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,460
Suppose there are two philosophers,

188
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,100
MacEx and I, differing over ontology.

189
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,940
Suppose MacEx maintains there is something which I maintain.

190
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,100
There is not.

191
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,540
MacEx can, quite consistently with his own point of view,

192
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,780
describe our difference of opinion

193
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,820
by saying I refuse to recognize certain entities.

194
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,340
I should protest, of course, that he's

195
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,060
wrong in his formulation of our disagreement,

196
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,180
for I maintain there are no entities in the kind which he

197
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,860
alleges for me to recognize.

198
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,420
But my finding him wrong in this formulation of our disagreement

199
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,700
is unimportant, for I'm committed to considering him wrong

200
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,380
in his ontology anyway.

201
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,460
When I try to formulate our difference of opinion,

202
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,780
on the other hand, I seem to be in a predicament.

203
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,100
I can't admit that there are some things which MacEx

204
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,940
countensess and I do not, for admitting that there are such

205
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,700
things I should be contradicting my own rejection of them.

206
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,380
Now notice what he can't say.

207
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,580
Yeah, there's some things that MacEx countensess that I don't.

208
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Because if I am saying that, look what I'm saying.

209
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,140
There are things that he recognizes that I don't.

210
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,700
And it sounds like I'm saying there are things

211
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,580
that I don't believe in.

212
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,380
But wait a minute.

213
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,460
If I confess that there are things that I think there aren't,

214
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,900
it sounds like I'm contradicting myself, right?

215
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,620
Or at least I'm saying that my own beliefs are false.

216
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,540
I'm saying, yeah, you know, there are these things

217
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,820
that I don't think there are.

218
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
And so it looks like I'm in trouble.

219
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,060
Now, he says, it looks like this reason

220
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,940
can sound that anybody in the logical dispute who's

221
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,020
denying the existence of anything is a severe disadvantage.

222
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,860
Because the moment you try to say, yeah, there

223
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,060
are these things that I don't accept,

224
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,900
it looks like you're actually committing yourself

225
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,460
to the things and undermining your own position.

226
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,260
Well, this, he says, is the old platonic riddle of non-being.

227
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,140
Non-being must, in some sense, be.

228
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,580
Otherwise, what is it that there is not?

229
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,500
This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's beard.

230
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,940
Historically, it's proved tough, frequently dulling

231
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,100
the edge of Occam's reason.

232
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,500
That's some of that great writing that I was mentioning.

233
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,820
So he says, consider Pegasus.

234
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,060
We want to say something like this.

235
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,180
Does Pegasus exist?

236
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,680
No.

237
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,820
No, right?

238
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,100
Pegasus is supposedly a winged horse.

239
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,460
But there are no winged horses, so we might say yes.

240
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,380
Pegasus does not exist.

241
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,420
But now you might think, well, this is a problem.

242
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,020
What does our logic do with constants, with names?

243
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,420
Well, they have to stand for things in the domain.

244
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,100
So you might think, ah, OK, so I see what's happening here.

245
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,780
This is like saying, gosh, my shirt is not blue.

246
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
And what's going on there?

247
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,540
Well, I'm referring to the shirt.

248
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,260
And then I'm saying something about it, right?

249
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,620
That it is not blue.

250
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,580
So I may think, OK, so similarly here,

251
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,540
I'm saying something about Pegasus.

252
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,540
This winged horse.

253
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,780
Yeah, horses have manes, they have eyes.

254
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,860
So there we go.

255
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,180
Pegasus, OK?

256
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,260
And I'm saying it doesn't exist.

257
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,420
Like saying, my shirt is not blue, there's Pegasus.

258
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,300
And Pegasus doesn't exist.

259
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,900
But now, that's weird, right?

260
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,500
For one thing to say it doesn't exist,

261
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,540
that's a bad thing to predicate an object.

262
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,820
But secondly, it looks like I have to have an object.

263
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,780
So my domain has Pegasus in it.

264
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,420
And then I'm saying, but Pegasus doesn't exist.

265
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,220
And so I'm in trouble.

266
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,180
Now, gosh, what do I do about it?

267
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,500
It's a problem with all of these names

268
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,900
that don't denote anything.

269
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,100
How should I, in general, deal with those things?

270
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,740
It becomes a problem in logic.

271
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,940
And so there are various ways of dealing with it.

272
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,860
Quiet outlines one in this essay.

273
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,820
There's an entire branch of logic called free logic

274
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
that tries to accept that there are terms like Pegasus that

275
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,500
don't denote anything and to allow them in the logic.

276
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,660
But then what you do, you can't allow yourself

277
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,260
to go from Pegasus doesn't exist to, OK,

278
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,580
there are things that don't exist.

279
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,500
And in fact, that's a good test case.

280
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,620
Suppose I say, there are things that don't exist.

281
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,740
Does that make sense?

282
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,620
Or is that somehow self-contradictory?

283
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,300
Self-contradictory.

284
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,060
OK, Klein wants you to think, yes, that's self-contradictory.

285
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,740
There are things that don't exist.

286
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,300
What do you mean?

287
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,420
You're saying there are things that there aren't?

288
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,060
That's absurd, OK?

289
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,820
And so he's trying to get that intuition going.

290
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,100
Now, there were other philosophers

291
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,980
who think it makes perfectly good sense.

292
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,900
Terence Parsons writes a book on non-existent objects, in fact.

293
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,780
And one of the things he says right at the start

294
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,580
is there are some things that don't exist, like Pegasus.

295
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,940
For example, and he thinks that's just fine,

296
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,180
and we can say that without any problem.

297
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,180
In fact, it's great.

298
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,940
His dedication is to my parents, without whom I might have

299
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,380
been one, and mine is to love it.

300
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,580
So anyway, that's something that you could say is up for dispute,

301
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,540
whether you can say intelligently there

302
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,700
are things that don't exist.

303
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,660
But many of it, let's get back to Pegasus.

304
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,820
Pegasus doesn't exist.

305
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,180
We don't want that model of what's going on here.

306
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,700
But what can we do?

307
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,220
Well, our philosopher, Meg X, is thinking about this.

308
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,180
And says, well, actually, I don't want to say

309
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,100
there are rain horses, right?

310
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,580
In fact, it looks like I've got a problem.

311
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,980
Because if I've now got Pegasus in my domain,

312
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,220
and I've got this, like Pegasus is a horse.

313
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,020
That seems true.

314
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,380
Pegasus is white.

315
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,060
Pegasus is winged.

316
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,100
Now I've got white winged horses in my domain.

317
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,740
And so we can actually get Pegasus out there to say,

318
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,100
look, some horses have wings.

319
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
And it will turn out to be true, right?

320
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,060
But I don't want to say that's true.

321
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,340
And it doesn't help to say, of course, some horses have wings.

322
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,780
Pegasus, for example, you still want to say,

323
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,140
no, Pegasus isn't real.

324
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,020
And so what can you do?

325
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,660
Well, one way to do it is to try to turn Pegasus

326
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,100
into something else.

327
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,620
So Meg X here, for example, says, ah, yeah, of course,

328
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,540
I don't want to say there's an actual horse that is white,

329
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,020
it has wings, and is written by Valerafon, and so on,

330
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,820
as in medical stories.

331
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,860
No, instead, I'm saying there is something

332
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,100
like the idea of Pegasus, the idea, the concept of Pegasus.

333
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,900
So maybe this exists in the realm of ideas, or concepts,

334
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,620
or something like that.

335
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,580
And indeed, we can say, yeah, a fellow doesn't really exist,

336
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,300
but a fellow exists in the realm of characters,

337
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,500
for Shakespeare.

338
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,940
And so we could have realms of ideas, of concepts,

339
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,980
of characters, of fictions, and so forth,

340
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,740
where we want to say the object exists,

341
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,460
but in that special world.

342
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,620
So maybe this is ideas, maybe this is a realm of fictions,

343
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,140
maybe it's a realm of characters,

344
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,940
or of mythological creatures, whatever

345
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,380
we want to say about this, we find some way of putting it

346
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,460
in a place where it doesn't do any harm,

347
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,180
and where we don't have to admit that it's a real horse.

348
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,940
Well, Klein doesn't like that option of saying,

349
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,260
it's just an idea.

350
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,180
And so when I say Pegasus doesn't exist,

351
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,420
I'm referring to an idea, or a fiction, or a character,

352
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,460
or a mythological creature, and saying that it doesn't exist.

353
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,260
Now, why doesn't he like that option?

354
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,140
What's wrong with that?

355
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,700
Does he talk about meaning and beings?

356
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Is that where he goes with this?

357
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,700
Well, eventually, yes.

358
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,540
But the outset, there's something wrong with just the idea part.

359
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,220
Think about something that does exist.

360
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,940
Are you going to, is that a claim about an idea too?

361
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:35,100
Suppose I say that Harvey Friedman exists.

362
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,340
There really is a person named Harvey Friedman.

363
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,020
He's giving a talk at four o'clock today.

364
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,980
And so there really is that guy.

365
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,060
And now, if I say Harvey Friedman exists,

366
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,580
am I saying that, oh, am I talking about the idea

367
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,140
of Harvey Friedman, or a mythological creature

368
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,660
of Harvey Friedman, or a character, or a fiction?

369
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,300
No, right?

370
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,340
I'm actually talking about this person, this mathematician.

371
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,180
And it looks as if, in that case, you say, well, gee,

372
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,340
it's very clear, right?

373
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,580
I've got this here I am, let's say, and here's my mind.

374
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,980
And I've got this idea of Harvey Friedman.

375
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,620
But then here's Harvey Friedman.

376
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,140
Wow, that's a great picture of him.

377
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,900
He wears glasses.

378
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,540
That's ridiculous.

379
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,700
But anyway, I'm not tempted to confuse Harvey Friedman

380
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,060
with my idea of Harvey Friedman.

381
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,940
My idea of Harvey Friedman is mental,

382
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,980
but Harvey Friedman isn't mental.

383
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,860
He's an actual guy.

384
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,740
He's an actual mathematician.

385
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,500
And so you might say, look, I'm in no danger with that.

386
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,940
His example in the essay is the Parthenon.

387
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm not going to confuse the Parthenon, which

388
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,780
is on the Acropolis, from my idea of the Parthenon,

389
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,900
which is in my head.

390
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,820
And so it's very clear there when

391
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,900
I'm talking about the Parthenon or Harvey Friedman,

392
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,780
and when I'm talking about my idea of the Parthenon

393
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,100
or my idea of Harvey Friedman.

394
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,980
Yet, if I look at Pegasus, well, now,

395
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,420
it looks like I'm getting confused.

396
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,740
Pegasus doesn't exist.

397
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm talking about the horse, right?

398
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,580
It's saying it doesn't exist, but I'm talking about my idea.

399
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,220
Yeah?

400
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,780
How does this relate to idealism?

401
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,940
Is this kind of what gave rise to the idea

402
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,220
of everything not just in your head?

403
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,540
Because this seems to presuppose some sort of realism,

404
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,180
right?

405
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,300
That there is a Harvey Friedman in the real world,

406
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,100
and not just in the mind.

407
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,700
Well, Coyne is thinking of realistic terms.

408
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,900
He's framing this in realistic terms.

409
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,820
MacEx historically probably stands for MacTigert,

410
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,380
who is an idealist.

411
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,260
And so one way to interpret what's going on in this essay

412
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,340
is that it is an attack on idealism.

413
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,940
On the other hand, I'm not sure that's

414
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
the best way to look at it.

415
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,700
Because everything, and in fact, I

416
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,580
think it's part of the reason that Coyne refers

417
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,500
to fictional philosophers here, rather than actually engaging

418
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,860
specific people.

419
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,820
It's because even the idealist is

420
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,580
going to have to draw a distinction between the things that

421
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,860
are mind dependent in this way and the things that

422
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,180
are mind dependent in that way, right?

423
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,620
So the Parthenon will be mind dependent if I'm

424
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,740
an idealist, holding that everything is mind dependent.

425
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,540
But I can also then refer to my idea of the Parthenon.

426
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm not identifying them as an idealist.

427
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,340
Moreover, I still want to draw the distinction between Pegasus

428
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,420
and the Parthenon.

429
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,740
The Parthenon really exists.

430
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,300
And Pegasus doesn't.

431
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
They both are, in a sense, mental projections or constructions

432
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,380
from an idealist's point of view.

433
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,940
But they have a really different character.

434
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,060
You can actually go to see the Parthenon.

435
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,980
But you can't go see Pegasus.

436
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,820
And so there's something fundamental.

437
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,980
You can go hear Harvey Friedman talk.

438
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,660
But if I say Santa Claus is going to be on campus

439
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,940
on December 25th, you can't wait around and go here

440
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,220
and talk by Santa Claus.

441
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,500
So something different is going on, even

442
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,460
from an idealist's point of view.

443
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,740
Idealists would distinguish between their idea of the Parthenon

444
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,620
and the actual Parthenon.

445
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,380
Sure, I think they have to.

446
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,700
Now, there's going to be an intimate relationship

447
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,620
between them.

448
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,100
What is that going to look like?

449
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,380
Suppose we took the following idea.

450
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,700
We thought, and Russell thinks this at a certain stage,

451
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,260
so does John Stuart Mill.

452
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,780
They are in this stage of their thinking phenomenalist.

453
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,500
And so they're, in a sense, saying,

454
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,580
what we call a physical object is really

455
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,060
just a collection of actual and possible sensations.

456
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,220
Now, since sensations are mental,

457
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,860
this is a way of being an idealist.

458
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,580
And if you take that view, then what's

459
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,140
the difference between Pegasus, for example,

460
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,820
and the Parthenon?

461
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,780
Well, in both cases, you're identifying the object

462
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,540
with these actual and possible sensations of them.

463
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,940
But now, yeah, so what does existence

464
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,420
come to for an idealist?

465
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,020
How do we distinguish that actual and possible,

466
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,540
I should say, the collection of actual and possible sensations

467
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,300
of a real thing as opposed to a collection

468
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,460
of actual and possible sensations of a fictional?

469
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,820
Presumably all of those are possible, right, but not actual.

470
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,900
These are, well, there are some actual ones,

471
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,260
but possible ones.

472
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,860
On the other hand, they're real things that nobody's seen.

473
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,340
And so I don't want to just say, oh,

474
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,900
it's the difference between actuality and possibility,

475
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,540
because there might be something we've had no actual sensations

476
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,380
of that we hope to gain sensations of.

477
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,420
So how could we do it before I do this?

478
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,460
Yeah, some of you are.

479
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,780
So there's one, I mean, it's a problem

480
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,860
that any idealist needs to face.

481
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,900
And interestingly enough, if you think about classic ideals,

482
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,740
what would Barclay say about this, for example?

483
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,060
What would Kant say about this?

484
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,580
My answer is, I have no idea, because they don't address

485
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,780
this question at all.

486
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,820
What's Kant's account of fictional entities, or Barclay's

487
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,460
account, this is not a problem they ever talk about.

488
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,460
And so in a certain sense, you could say, gosh,

489
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,380
have idealists recognize that they actually

490
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,460
have a task to perform here?

491
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,660
But let's help them out.

492
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
What could you say?

493
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,300
Collective belief.

494
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,620
Collective belief, well, how would that help?

495
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,460
I don't know, if multiple, well, I

496
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,740
guess if you have some kind of threshold problem,

497
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,860
people believe in something, and then that threshold

498
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,420
is fulfilled, and you can turn that

499
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,580
into an actual thing that exists.

500
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,460
Oh, well, I should say, OK, look, here's the difference.

501
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,100
Not many people believe in Pegasus.

502
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Lots of people believe in the Parthenon.

503
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,740
That's what it comes down to.

504
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,220
But gosh, that means if a religious revival sweeps through

505
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,820
and everybody starts believing in God, God exists now, right?

506
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,060
Or if people give up on religion, then God no longer exists.

507
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,260
But that seems silly, right?

508
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,780
Whether there's a God or not doesn't

509
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,500
depend on how many people believe it.

510
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,660
So that's one thing that's problematic.

511
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,020
Secondly, it looks like it's going

512
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,740
to wreak havoc with science, because suppose scientists

513
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,300
become convinced that there is such a thing as flogistan,

514
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,540
for example.

515
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,460
And then our physical theory changes.

516
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Well, now, what do we say?

517
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,860
Oh, yeah, there used to be this stuff called flogistan.

518
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,660
And when you burn something, it was an escape of flogistan.

519
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,580
But now, and it had negative weight and stuff,

520
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,500
which is why it went up to the air and so on.

521
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,580
But then it stopped existing.

522
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,340
And all of a sudden, things started oxidizing.

523
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,220
Gosh, before oxidation wasn't a thing.

524
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,060
No, it's a thing.

525
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
Flogistan used to be a thing.

526
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,260
Found it all over the medieval world.

527
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,060
But then around 1750, flogistan just went out of existence.

528
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,540
And that seems ridiculous, right?

529
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,140
That's not right.

530
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,500
So it isn't entirely easy to figure out what to say.

531
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,300
We might say, look, it's a question of systematic,

532
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,060
predictable collections of actual and possible sensations.

533
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,940
So then if I go and visit the Parthenon,

534
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,020
I'm there on the Acropolis.

535
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,220
I'm looking at it.

536
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,620
I close my eyes, open them again.

537
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,740
It's still there.

538
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,380
I walk around to this side.

539
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,740
It's still there.

540
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,860
Whereas Pegasus, that's not necessarily the case.

541
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,100
Suppose I'm imagining Pegasus, and then

542
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,780
I stop imagining Pegasus.

543
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,500
Do I suddenly then start imagining Pegasus again?

544
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,020
No, right?

545
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,820
It's not nearly so systematic.

546
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,060
So you might say there's a kind of patterning

547
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,380
to actual and possible sensations of the Parthenon,

548
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,500
but there isn't the case of Pegasus.

549
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:39,940
Yeah.

550
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,180
Why can't the idealist just say that the Parthenon is an idea

551
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,580
in the mind, and Pegasus is an idea of an idea?

552
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,940
Parthenon is an idea, and Pegasus is an idea of an idea.

553
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,500
And that's basically what Pegasus is.

554
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,580
Well, but then how do we explain that Pegasus

555
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,460
is a horse seems true?

556
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,460
We'll just say, no, Pegasus is an idea of a horse.

557
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,100
I say, no, no, no, no, no.

558
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,820
Polarifon wrote Pegasus.

559
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
No, you're saying the idea of Polarifon

560
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,420
wrote the idea of Polarifon, Pegasus.

561
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,980
So anyway, yeah, of all horses.

562
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,780
Yeah, I don't know.

563
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,880
I mean, there's an appealing thought there

564
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,540
that it feels like there's some sort of difference in level.

565
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,140
And yet, as soon as you start trying to think about how then we'd talk about these things,

566
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,220
it's going to get really weird fast.

567
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,260
So that's how to say we can't deal with that weirdness, maybe we can, and find a translation

568
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,580
pattern that makes it make sense.

569
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,340
But it's at least going to be an obstacle to that approach.

570
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Yeah?

571
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Yeah.

572
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,340
I mean, it seems like, I don't know if this is even helpful at all, but when I'm talking

573
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,980
about my idea of Parthenon and my idea of Pegasus, they can interact very easily in

574
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
my ideas.

575
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,020
I can talk about Pegasus landing on the Parthenon, and that's not problematic that they go together

576
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,020
very well.

577
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,860
So that you have ideas that could be fictional of real things, just like you have ideas of

578
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
fictional things.

579
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,340
Well, okay, good, good.

580
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,780
Yes, this turns out to be a mess because of exactly what you're pointing out.

581
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,980
There are all sorts of mixtures of real things and fictional things, right?

582
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,100
Often stories that are fictional stories include some real things.

583
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
But maybe not.

584
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,860
Maybe in a science fiction universe, you're dealing with something where everything is

585
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,020
really strictly imaginary, but often fiction isn't like that.

586
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,340
It's based on something real.

587
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,860
So Sherlock Holmes lives in London.

588
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
London is a real place.

589
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,220
It's not just fiction.

590
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,860
But Sherlock Holmes is fictional, and so you've got this mixture of the fictional and the

591
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
non-fictional.

592
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Similarly, you might have Pegasus landing on the Parthenon.

593
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,620
Well, Pegasus in the story is a mythological creature, but on the other hand, the Parthenon

594
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,260
is not mythological, and we mix them together in certain ways.

595
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,100
And so if we've suddenly got some big difference in level, that's like, well, an idea landed

596
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,020
on this, right?

597
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
And that's going to be bizarre.

598
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,700
How can an idea land on a building?

599
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,580
So there's something very strange about those mixtures, and that's going to make it super

600
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,220
hard to really sustain the difference in levels throughout.

601
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,900
We want fictional things and non-fictional things to interact, at least in the fictions.

602
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,700
So, oh gosh, maybe a case that's extreme in this instance is a historical novel.

603
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,500
When I was a kid, I used to love these books called You Were There.

604
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,540
You Were There at the Battle of Hastings.

605
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,180
You Were There at the Battle of Guadalcanal or something, and it's written as if you're

606
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
actually there.

607
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
It's like, wow.

608
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,620
In fact, if I were really there at the Battle of Guadalcanal or something, that'd be terrifying.

609
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,500
But all of a sudden it's like, yes, you're nine years old and you were really there

610
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,060
watching all the battle take place, and they were very effective fictions written for elementary

611
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,540
school kids, putting you there in that situation.

612
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,100
But of course, now what's going on is partly actual events from the battle.

613
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,620
But it's partly, you know, you're not really there, and there are other characters you

614
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,660
meet who are fictional characters, but inserted into this real historical situation.

615
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,900
And so in historical novels, this sort of thing is going on all the time.

616
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,660
If all of that's true, you might think, well, yes, we're going to have trouble actually

617
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:25,180
referring to Pegasus in a way that separates these levels and keeps that distinction of

618
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,900
levels going throughout.

619
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,500
Intuitively speaking, there's something that feels right about it.

620
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,900
We think, but wait, Pegasus is something like a character, is a fiction, is a mythological

621
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,700
preacher.

622
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,100
And yet to say, well, that just makes Pegasus mental in a certain way, that other things

623
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
are not.

624
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Looks like it's going to be puzzled, not only from an idealist point of view, but from

625
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,180
anybody's point of view.

626
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,700
So what if we took another strategy?

627
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,660
He says, ah, yes, now we have another philosopher, why?

628
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,420
Who says, here's the way to think about this.

629
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,380
And by the way, it's not just sort of a hypothetical approach.

630
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,740
This is something taken by many people in free logic.

631
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,540
This was the approach taken by Leblanc and Thomas in 1968, and it has a lot of intuitive

632
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,700
appeal.

633
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:19,220
The idea is really that we should think about a domain of possible objects.

634
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,500
And then some of those are the actual objects.

635
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,700
So if I say that Harvey Friedman exists, or the Parthenon exists, I'm putting Harvey

636
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,900
Friedman or the Parthenon in the realm of actual objects.

637
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,260
But Pegasus, if I say Pegasus doesn't exist, what I mean is Pegasus is out here in the

638
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,380
realm of merely possible objects.

639
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,380
So here's Harvey Friedman, here's the Parthenon, they're inside there.

640
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:53,620
But now Pegasus or Sherlock Holmes, they are out here in the realm of merely possible objects.

641
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,820
And then I can say exists.

642
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,820
I understand what that means.

643
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,820
It just refers to that subset of things.

644
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:05,980
Okay, so just as we said here, ah, these are the things that are a's at some subset of

645
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
our domain.

646
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,340
The things that exist are some subset of the domain of possible objects.

647
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,820
Now, actually, there is something intuitively plausible about that.

648
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Why does Quine object to that?

649
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,700
The bald man in the doorway.

650
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,820
Okay, good.

651
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,300
There are really two arguments he gives.

652
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,700
And one of them is precisely that one, the bald man in the doorway.

653
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:38,700
The other one is concerning the round square cupola of Berkeley College, okay?

654
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:50,300
So the first difficulty is now contradictory descriptions.

655
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:59,300
The round square cupola.

656
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:05,780
And then the second one is this thing about identity conditions.

657
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,660
It becomes one of Quine's main themes, no entity without identity.

658
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,220
For me to say there are such things as a's, for example, I not only have to postulate

659
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,460
their existence, I have to give you some identity criteria.

660
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,980
At least if a is a count now, there's a distinction between count nouns and mass nouns.

661
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,980
Things like water, gold.

662
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:34,980
And to say there is water, that would be just as the treat this as a master.

663
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,580
How do you deal, how do you understand those as complicated, but a count noun like there

664
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:47,380
is a person, there is a piece of chalk, there is a flying horse, etc., those things seem

665
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,700
to require not only do we say these things exist, but to give us some idea of what makes

666
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,220
for there being one or two or three of these.

667
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,940
We seem to need criteria of identification and individuation.

668
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,340
How do I tell one piece of chalk from another?

669
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,180
How do I re-identify something as the same piece of chalk?

670
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,060
Well those questions of identity are crucial for actually talking about objects of a certain

671
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,900
kind and we need that, he says, for these.

672
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,340
So let's take the first argument, contradictory descriptions.

673
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,460
What do we do with the round square cupola?

674
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,860
Do we put it in the realm of possible objects?

675
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,020
That's going to trouble, right?

676
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,620
Because then we're saying it's possible that there's something that's both round and square.

677
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,220
Could anything be both round and square?

678
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,420
No.

679
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,940
So the difficulty here is that it looks like that's impossible.

680
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,300
But now I could either take the description or I could give it a name.

681
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:48,300
I could say, ah, yes, Franklin, that beautiful round square cupola on Berkeley College.

682
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,620
And now you might say, wait a minute, Franklin is now denoting an impossible object.

683
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,420
So I seem to have a choice.

684
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,620
I can either say something that is false, right, that something could be both round

685
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:05,540
and square, and I'm going to get contradictions out of that, or I say, well actually I need

686
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:12,260
a broader realm now out here of impossible objects.

687
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,060
And quite doesn't really go into that in detail, but now I'm going to have a realm of things

688
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,860
that are both round and square.

689
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,180
I'm going to have a realm of things that have both two and three parts.

690
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:30,660
I'm going to have a realm of things that are both white and black and red all over.

691
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,900
And so I'm going to have all sorts of trouble if I introduce those, you might think.

692
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,500
At least you might think.

693
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,820
By the way, Klein does not actually deduce a contradiction from this, right?

694
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,940
He says all sorts of embarrassing questions could be raised about those.

695
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,900
He doesn't actually go through and raise those questions and attack this.

696
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,740
However, he catches Wyman saying, actually I think something like this is meaningless,

697
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,580
and that's very strange to say as Wyman points out.

698
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,060
Something that is white and red and black all over is different from something that's

699
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,700
both round and square, right?

700
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,780
We cannot understand the meaning of both.

701
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,700
In fact, it's by virtue of understanding the meaning that we realize there could be no

702
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
such thing.

703
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,100
That won't fly at all.

704
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,300
So it looks like this is problematic.

705
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,940
What about the identity conditions?

706
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,700
This is perhaps the most famous passage in the essay.

707
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,220
Can I just ask you some questions here?

708
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:36,300
So when he's saying that, no, that's not meaningless because it has meaning, does that go back

709
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:44,580
to sort of what Karnat was doing is like the logical optimists are saying all these

710
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,060
things have no meaning because they can't be very...

711
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,140
Okay, yes.

712
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,780
We are here floating around with that same question of significance.

713
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
What has meaning?

714
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
What doesn't have meaning?

715
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,580
Can we draw a distinction?

716
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,460
And there are going to be several things that are difficult about this one.

717
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,140
One that he points out is a purely logical problem.

718
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,780
Church's theorem implies that in the Rommel first horiologic, validity is undecidable.

719
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,540
There is no decision procedure for validity.

720
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,060
That means there is no decision procedure for contradictoryness.

721
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,060
So if whether something is possible, consistent or contradictory, is at issue, that's an undecidable

722
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
question.

723
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,540
But it's weird to think that it's undecidable whether something has meaning or not.

724
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,860
We'd like to have not only some criterion, but some way of deciding in principle in a

725
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,260
finite time whether this is meaningful or not.

726
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,700
And so he wants to say, look, if it turns out that contradictions are meaningless, you're

727
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,860
already basically saying the distinction between the meaningful and the meaningless is undecidable.

728
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,540
And that's a creepy thing to say.

729
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,180
So there's that problem.

730
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:59,740
But in addition to that, you might think there is a difficulty about, well, you might...

731
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,140
Let's relate to Hepple's criteria.

732
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,420
Remember he said there's a criterion of adequacy.

733
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,940
And one of the things that was a corollary from that is that A should be meaningful

734
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,300
if and only if not A is meaningful.

735
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,300
If I understand a sentence, putting in a not should preserve meaning, or taking a not away

736
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,220
should preserve meaning.

737
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,580
But what happens here is basically something that is a contradiction.

738
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,900
The negation of that will be a logical truth.

739
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,100
If I've got something that comes down to P and not P, but then I negate that, I've got

740
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,540
a logical truth.

741
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,740
And so if it turns out that contradictions are meaningless, it's also got to turn out,

742
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,100
if Hepple's right, that logical truths are meaningless.

743
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,300
And so actually we won't just say the round square, oh, meaningless, we're going to have

744
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,900
to say the claim that nothing could be both rounded square is meaningless.

745
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,860
And some philosophers are willing to do that.

746
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,300
Wittgenstein in the Tractatus actually thinks about x equals x.

747
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,420
Actually, is it in the, I'm sorry, I've forgotten now whether it's in the Tractatus

748
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,300
or the Investigations.

749
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,500
But Wittgenstein at some point thinks about x equals x.

750
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,860
And he says that has no use.

751
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,220
It has no function.

752
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,180
So actually the claim that x is equal to x is meaningless.

753
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,860
And that's a very strange thing to say.

754
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,020
But you can see maybe why somebody would be led to think it.

755
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,460
Because A should be meaningful if not only if not A is meaningful.

756
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,220
So to say x equals x is meaningful is basically to say that x is not equal to x is

757
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,300
meaningful, which it is, it is meaningful.

758
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,380
But anyway, it's going to turn out not only contradictions have to be meaningless

759
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,220
on this criterion, so would logical truths.

760
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,180
And that's a hard thing, I think, to swallow.

761
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,220
But now let's get back to the identity conditions argument.

762
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,500
Wyman's overpopulated universe is in many ways unlovely.

763
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,940
It offends the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes.

764
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,300
But this is not the worst of it.

765
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,460
Wyman's slum of possibles is a greedy crowd for disorderly elements.

766
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,700
Take, for instance, the possible fat man in that doorway.

767
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,780
And again, the possible bald man in that doorway.

768
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,460
Are they the same possible man or two possible men?

769
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,540
How do we decide?

770
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,980
How many possible men are in that doorway?

771
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,660
Are there more possible thin ones than fat ones?

772
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,860
How many of them are alike?

773
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,660
Or would there be a like, make them one?

774
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,260
Are no two possible things alike?

775
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,260
Is this the same as saying it's impossible for two things to be alike?

776
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,460
Or finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable

777
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,980
to unactualized possibles?

778
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,900
But what sense can be found with hugging of entities

779
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,340
which cannot meaningfully be said to be identical with themselves

780
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,780
and distinct from one another?

781
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,900
These elements are well-nigh and original.

782
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,820
By fregian therapy of individual concepts,

783
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,900
some members might be made of rehabilitation.

784
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,740
But I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum

785
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,700
and be done with it.

786
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,260
Now, is there an argument there?

787
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
And if so, what kind of argument is it?

788
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,580
Well, let's look at the doorway.

789
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,180
Is there a possible fat man in that doorway?

790
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,540
Yes.

791
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,060
OK, if we're going with this way of thinking about things, sure.

792
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,100
Sure, right?

793
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,900
All that is to say, there could be a fat man in that doorway.

794
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,660
Now, presumably, it couldn't be too fat or you couldn't get into the doorway.

795
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,420
But nevertheless, sure, there could be a fat man in that doorway.

796
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,180
Could there be a bald man in that doorway?

797
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,740
Sure.

798
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,820
So there's a possible bald man in it.

799
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,620
Are they the same?

800
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Well, good.

801
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,940
Yeah, there are some possible men in that doorway

802
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,780
that are both bald and fat.

803
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,780
There's some that are bald and not fat, right?

804
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,460
How many of them are there?

805
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,340
What should Wyman say?

806
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,180
Well, I think Wyman would say there was infinite, right?

807
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,100
Infinitely many, yeah.

808
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,940
There are infinitely many, right?

809
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,580
Infinitely many possible bald men in the doorway.

810
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,820
Infinitely many possible fat men in the doorway.

811
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,260
Infinitely many that are both bald and fat.

812
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
And so on.

813
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,380
OK, so I think Wyman would actually

814
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,420
be able to answer my questions.

815
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,020
Now, how many of them are alike?

816
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:16,060
Oh, could there be two, qualitatively, indiscernible fat bald

817
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,300
possible men in the doorway?

818
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,700
Sure, right?

819
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,660
They could be identical twins.

820
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,500
Sure, they could be alike.

821
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,420
Is this or no two possible things alike?

822
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,260
Well, sure, some of them are alike, right?

823
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,300
And in fact, I could say, yeah, there

824
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,140
could be a fat man in the doorway who goes away

825
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,740
and then reappears, same possible fat man appearing.

826
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,460
And so it doesn't seem as if these questions are really

827
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,260
unanswerable if we go seriously about this and say,

828
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,420
yeah, look, I'm talking about this domain to say

829
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,500
there is a possible object here is to just say

830
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,100
there could be an object such that blah, blah, blah.

831
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,060
And I can say there could be the same object in that doorway,

832
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,820
et cetera.

833
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,740
So all of that can go out here would seem.

834
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,940
And sure, I don't myself find this a very powerful argument.

835
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,580
It seems to me easy for somebody who has Wyman's view

836
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,420
to respond to these arguments.

837
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,500
Now, the first one is more serious,

838
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,500
because what do I do about things

839
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,220
like the round square cupola?

840
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,140
And if I'm doing it with respect to that, whatever I do,

841
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,180
why don't I do the same thing with Pegasus and the detective

842
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,660
in such and such a story and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

843
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,180
So I think this is in a way a more serious problem

844
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,020
just because of a viable way of solving it.

845
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,500
Why can't I use it across the board?

846
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,660
But this one seems to me a bit fishy.

847
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,380
Anyway, whatever you think about that,

848
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,820
Klein doesn't like this approach either.

849
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,380
He wants to clear the slum and be done with it.

850
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,140
So what does he do?

851
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,540
How can we solve the problem?

852
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,380
Russell.

853
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,700
Russell, exactly.

854
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,780
We rustled it.

855
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,980
I've spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard

856
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,500
and hinted that it's tangled.

857
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,180
I've dwells at length on the inconveniences

858
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,020
of putting up with it.

859
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,300
It's time to think about taking steps.

860
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,900
And so the answer is Russell.

861
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,180
Now, how does Russell help us here?

862
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,860
Well, we can think about Pegasus not existing

863
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,060
and say, let's think about this in a slightly different way.

864
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,740
Let's think about what we would do

865
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,820
with something like the present king of France's ball.

866
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,500
We don't say, aha, so there is a present king of France.

867
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,980
But of course, he's just mythological, he's fictional.

868
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,060
He's just an idea or he's a merely possible object.

869
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,460
Instead, what Russell taught us

870
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,420
is that we don't have to do any of that.

871
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,020
We don't commit ourselves to a present king of France.

872
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,700
We just say that saying there is one and only one king

873
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,860
of France and that person is bald.

874
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,460
But there isn't one and only one king of France, so false.

875
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,220
And we're never committed there

876
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,300
to there being a present king of France.

877
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,500
So do the same thing with Pegasus.

878
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,140
Now, we have to turn the name into some kind of description.

879
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,740
And so we do have Pegasus as a name.

880
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,300
Well, directly speaking, Russell's theory of descriptions

881
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,460
doesn't apply to it.

882
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,580
But even Russell thought proper names of this kind

883
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,820
should be translated really into descriptions.

884
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,140
And so it could be like the winged horse

885
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,540
written by Bolairefond.

886
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,340
It could be just the thing that Pegasizes.

887
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,220
And so Quine says, you could just turn this into a verb.

888
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,100
And so it could be the Pegasizer.

889
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:42,980
But you can also just say the thing called Pegasus, which

890
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,180
might seem a little bit less peculiar than the Pegasizer.

891
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,740
In any case, what do we do if we do it that way?

892
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,820
Then Pegasus doesn't exist to become something like this.

893
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,580
There is, well, actually, yeah, Pegasus.

894
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,340
Let's start with Pegasus as a horse.

895
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:13,020
There is one and only one Pegasizer,

896
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:19,020
or a thing called Pegasus, and it's a horse.

897
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Now, is that true or false?

898
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,020
False.

899
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,020
It's false, right?

900
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
There is no such thing as Pegasus.

901
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,020
There's nothing Pegasizes in the actual universe.

902
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,020
And so we end up saying that's false.

903
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,020
So the strategy was that Pegasus is, of course, false.

904
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,020
What about Pegasus doesn't exist?

905
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,020
What's going to happen there?

906
00:45:49,020 --> 00:46:00,020
It looks like we have to say there is one and only one Pegasizer,

907
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,020
and it doesn't exist.

908
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,020
But that sounds self-contradictory.

909
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,020
That sounds like we're saying there's one and only one thing,

910
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,020
and there is no such thing.

911
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,020
And so it looks like that's not just false, but logically false.

912
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,020
So this becomes logically false.

913
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,020
So, actually, if we just try this strategy of Rossellian descriptions

914
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,020
and apply it literally to this, we get trouble,

915
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,020
because it looks like actually now,

916
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,020
Mik-X can say hi-hi, don't you?

917
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:37,020
It turns out this is actually contradictory.

918
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,020
And so we're in trouble.

919
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Now, what can we do?

920
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,020
Well, remember Rossell had this distinction

921
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,020
between primary and secondary occurrences.

922
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,020
So we can say, ah, wait a minute.

923
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,020
This is the same thing as with the present king of France.

924
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,020
That's not the way to do it.

925
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,020
The way to do it is to say this.

926
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,020
Not that there is one and only one thing and it doesn't exist,

927
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,020
but to say it's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer

928
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,020
and it exists.

929
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,020
And then that's true.

930
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,020
It's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer.

931
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,020
And now it exists part is actually irrelevant.

932
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,020
And so now we get something that's true and that occurs.

933
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,020
But notice what this means.

934
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,020
It means that actually something like Pegasus doesn't exist

935
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,020
is ambiguous between a statement that's contradictory

936
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,020
and a statement that is true.

937
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Now, why doesn't exactly bring that up?

938
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,020
Partly because he doesn't like this as a predicate.

939
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,020
He doesn't really want to think that it should be understood that way.

940
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,020
But now the same thing is going to arise with attributes.

941
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,020
We'll have to postpone until next time our talk of roundness

942
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,020
and other sorts of attributes like redness.

943
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,020
But what happens when we apply this strategy to it?

944
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,020
Well, Friday we'll figure out how that all goes.
