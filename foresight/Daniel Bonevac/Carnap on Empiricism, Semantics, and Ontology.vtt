00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Well, today we're going to be talking about Karnab's paper,

00:03.600 --> 00:05.700
empiricism, semantics, and ontology.

00:05.700 --> 00:10.920
Some people consider this the last gasp of logical empiricism.

00:10.920 --> 00:15.300
Even its opponents tend to treat it as an extremely important paper,

00:15.300 --> 00:20.160
and there is a fundamental distinction that it introduces that has become part of,

00:20.160 --> 00:23.600
you might say, common currency philosophically.

00:23.600 --> 00:29.480
And so it's a useful thing to be exposed to and to think through,

00:29.480 --> 00:32.480
even if in the end you think Karnab is wrong.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.080
Now, there are a lot of people, on the other hand,

00:34.080 --> 00:37.880
who think Karnab is actually getting at something deep and important here.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.380
And there is a philosophical strategy that emerges in this paper

00:41.380 --> 00:47.180
that I think is really important independently of the way that he in particular replies it.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.080
One way of putting it is this.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.980
Suppose we're interested in a certain concept or set of concepts,

00:52.980 --> 00:57.380
and we're trying to analyze what that's all about philosophically.

00:57.380 --> 01:03.280
Karnab's point, in a way, is just that we should approach it in the following fashion.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.280
Think about language, which did not have that set of terms

01:07.280 --> 01:10.380
or the ability to express those concepts.

01:10.380 --> 01:14.980
And think what would have to be added to give that language the ability

01:14.980 --> 01:18.580
to include those terms or express those concepts.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.680
And so the way of thinking about it isn't exactly analysis

01:22.680 --> 01:26.780
in the more traditional sense in which the early writers in this tradition,

01:26.880 --> 01:31.980
like Bertrand Russell or G. E. Moore or even Wittgenstein,

01:31.980 --> 01:34.380
were thinking instead it's something like,

01:34.380 --> 01:37.980
think about what would be like not to speak a language,

01:37.980 --> 01:40.480
in which we could talk about propositions, for example,

01:40.480 --> 01:42.580
or in which we could talk about mental entities,

01:42.580 --> 01:45.680
or in which we could discuss abstract entities

01:45.680 --> 01:50.280
and think what resources would we have to add to that language to be able to do that.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.980
So he's not approaching this from the point of view of X is a number,

01:53.980 --> 01:56.880
if and only if we translate that into something else.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.280
He's instead saying, imagine a language where we have no way of expressing numbers.

02:01.280 --> 02:06.080
What would we have to add to the language in order to be able to express numbers?

02:06.080 --> 02:08.780
Now you might say, well, numbers, okay?

02:08.780 --> 02:13.780
And so you might think this has a very dumb sort of answer to it.

02:13.780 --> 02:17.980
And so to make it interesting, you could say, well, what's the smallest set

02:17.980 --> 02:21.180
or what are the smallest sets of resources we could add

02:21.180 --> 02:23.580
that would actually allow us to accomplish this?

02:23.580 --> 02:28.880
Also, another way of thinking about this is to say, well, yes, in some sense,

02:28.880 --> 02:31.780
obviously, we could just add and talk about numbers.

02:31.780 --> 02:38.080
But what we're interested in, in a sense, is what kind of move is made

02:38.080 --> 02:39.680
when we make that transition?

02:39.680 --> 02:42.580
If you make the jump to number, what exactly are you doing?

02:42.580 --> 02:46.380
And sometimes it surprises how little has to be added.

02:46.380 --> 02:51.980
So we've been discussing this idea of frameworks.

02:51.980 --> 02:57.880
And this is the paper which really starts thinking about things in terms of frameworks,

02:57.880 --> 03:02.580
a framework in which we can discuss propositions, for example, or mental states,

03:02.580 --> 03:07.980
or numbers, or other abstract objects such as properties and relations.

03:07.980 --> 03:12.080
And we think, what does it take to add such a framework?

03:12.080 --> 03:15.280
Cardapp starts out with a pretty bold claim.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.080
He says, here's what it takes.

03:17.180 --> 03:22.680
It takes something that is a term that talks about the things of this general category.

03:22.680 --> 03:30.880
So if we say, you know, yeah, actually, let me write down what I was saying just a moment ago.

03:30.880 --> 03:39.880
Think about a language or a framework if you want to keep it more general,

03:39.880 --> 03:51.580
in which we can't discuss x, whatever that is, and then ask the question,

03:51.580 --> 04:09.780
what would we have to add to have that capacity to obtain the ability to discuss things of this kind?

04:10.180 --> 04:12.080
And his answer is twofold.

04:12.080 --> 04:19.980
He basically says, first of all, we would have to add some term that covers things of the relevant kind.

04:19.980 --> 04:28.580
So a term like, for example, proposition, or property, or number, or whatever.

04:28.580 --> 04:31.280
So just a term covering the general category.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.480
Because after all, if we can't do this, presumably we can't actually.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.780
We don't already have such a term and we're going to need one.

04:37.780 --> 04:39.180
But then what else?

04:39.180 --> 04:41.280
Well, this is the surprising part.

04:41.280 --> 04:50.180
We just have to add variables for such things.

04:50.180 --> 04:56.380
Or propositions for properties, for relations, for numbers, for mental states, or something like that.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.680
And that's really all we have to do.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.780
So it turns out that introducing a framework for discussing a kind of entity, he says,

05:02.780 --> 05:04.580
is actually a pretty simple thing.

05:04.580 --> 05:08.780
Okay, just introduce a term and some variables for that kind of thing.

05:08.780 --> 05:10.880
Now let's start with something dumb.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.480
We don't tend to talk about witches anymore.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.680
But suppose we were to start doing that again.

05:17.680 --> 05:25.380
And said, okay, what would it take to introduce into our current framework a framework where there are witches?

05:25.380 --> 05:31.880
Or maybe if that's, since that used to be, maybe a better example would be something from the Harry Potter world.

05:31.880 --> 05:37.280
Okay, where it's really just, what's something that's distinctive to Harry Potter?

05:38.280 --> 05:38.780
Muggles?

05:38.780 --> 05:40.280
Well, yeah, but you and I are muggles.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.780
I mean, muggles is just sort of an ordinary person, right?

05:42.780 --> 05:44.680
So that's easy to translate.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.080
But, de-mentors, right?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.480
Okay, there isn't just sort of this old view about de-mentors.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.780
It's like that's specifically introduced by J.K. Rowling.

05:53.780 --> 06:02.080
So, okay, we might be puzzled about how to actually do an analysis of de-mentor.

06:02.080 --> 06:07.280
If we're thinking in terms of reducing that to something else, X is a de-mentor if and only if, what?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.380
You might say, yeah, I don't know how to do it that way.

06:09.380 --> 06:15.480
But what is it to introduce into a conceptual framework this concept, this ability to talk about de-mentors?

06:15.480 --> 06:21.080
Well, you need the term de-mentor and variables that will include de-mentors.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.980
The end, okay?

06:22.980 --> 06:24.580
They might be, oh, wait a minute, that's all?

06:24.580 --> 06:25.780
I mean, that's kind of trivial.

06:25.780 --> 06:32.280
That's sort of, gosh, what do I need to talk about?

06:32.280 --> 06:35.580
X, oh, the term X, right?

06:35.580 --> 06:38.880
And some things that it could apply to, some variables that it could apply to.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.380
But actually, the analysis is more interesting than that.

06:41.380 --> 06:48.780
So let's see how it goes with respect to propositions, for example.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.480
What does it take to introduce the framework of propositions?

06:52.480 --> 06:58.180
Now, we get back up, and before we really get to this, think, what is a proposition supposed to be?

06:58.180 --> 07:03.880
Philosophers have talked about propositions or something like that, ever since ancient times.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.580
But now, what is a proposition exactly?

07:06.580 --> 07:11.280
So suppose we started, we'll start in a traditional form.

07:11.280 --> 07:17.080
We'll think, let's do an analysis of the kind of Russell, or Moore might have had in mind.

07:17.080 --> 07:24.580
What is a proposition?

07:24.580 --> 07:29.680
What's the relationship between a sentence and a proposition?

07:29.680 --> 07:32.180
Something a sentence signifies.

07:32.180 --> 07:35.280
Good, it's something a sentence signifies or expresses, right?

07:35.280 --> 07:44.380
So one thing we can say is, okay, sentences express or signify propositions.

07:45.380 --> 07:54.380
Okay, what else is true propositions as traditionally conceived?

07:54.380 --> 07:55.380
They have a truth value.

07:55.380 --> 07:56.880
They have a truth value, yeah.

07:56.880 --> 08:08.880
So they bear truth values, and what else?

08:08.880 --> 08:20.480
It's really a third thing that I think is part of the traditional conception.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.680
Well, you can have attitudes with respect to them, right?

08:22.680 --> 08:25.780
You can believe them, you can know them, you can doubt them.

08:25.780 --> 08:28.180
You can wonder whether they're true.

08:28.180 --> 08:32.080
You can, gosh, maybe you can fear them.

08:32.080 --> 08:37.080
I fear that it will continue raining, and I didn't bring my umbrella.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.580
Or you can have other kinds of attitudes, presumably, totally.

08:40.580 --> 08:47.080
So they are objects of attitudes.

08:47.080 --> 08:52.580
Now, you might think, look, there is nothing that actually has all three of those properties.

08:52.580 --> 08:55.880
And so some people doubt that there are propositions.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.780
Just because they think actually those are three different functions,

08:58.780 --> 09:04.380
why should I be sure that any one person fulfills all those functions?

09:04.380 --> 09:08.080
You might think, gosh, I would like to have somebody landscape my yard,

09:08.080 --> 09:13.080
and fix my plumbing, and install some lights.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.780
Okay, so I need a landscaper, plumber, or electrician, right?

09:17.780 --> 09:19.980
I'm looking for somebody who fulfills all three of those.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.780
And it might be that nobody does that.

09:21.780 --> 09:24.880
You've got to have three different people doing those three different tasks.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.480
So it's a nontrivial philosophical assumption underlying this,

09:28.480 --> 09:32.180
that there is one kind of entity that does those three things.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.080
But let's put that aside for a moment.

09:34.080 --> 09:38.180
That's sort of how to think about this from a traditional point of view.

09:38.180 --> 09:41.480
Now, from Karnab's point of view, how do we think about it?

09:41.480 --> 09:47.280
Well, we think what is actually required to introduce this framework of propositions?

09:47.280 --> 09:50.380
Imagine that we have a language where we don't discuss them at all.

09:50.380 --> 09:54.080
Maybe we talk about sentences, maybe we just say things about the world.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.480
And then we introduce this idea of propositions.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.480
And so here's one way to introduce it, say, here's what a proposition is.

10:02.480 --> 10:07.280
But another way would simply be to introduce this linguistic frame.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.080
And so, what does he say about this?

10:11.080 --> 10:17.680
Well, if we want to talk about propositions,

10:17.680 --> 10:25.980
what we do is, let's see, where does it start?

10:25.980 --> 10:29.880
Okay, we introduce the general term proposition.

10:29.880 --> 10:34.280
So we need a term.

10:34.280 --> 10:41.980
In this case, it is indeed just proposition.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.480
And then what?

10:43.480 --> 10:47.180
Well, we have to have a style of variables.

10:47.180 --> 10:57.380
And so, we'll introduce something like, he is a proposition.

10:57.380 --> 11:04.780
So we have a certain style of variable here, makes that possible.

11:04.780 --> 11:09.380
But now, actually, there's one more thing.

11:09.380 --> 11:14.780
He says, the general term proposition is introduced.

11:14.780 --> 11:16.880
P is a proposition maybe defined.

11:16.880 --> 11:22.080
So the third thing that we actually add is something like a definition.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.680
But it's a definition of a surprising con.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.880
It doesn't look very much like that sort of definition.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.880
Instead, he says, we do it in the following way.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.280
We say P is a proposition, maybe defined by P or not P.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.380
And so here's how that ends up going.

11:40.380 --> 11:48.280
P is a proposition, it's just defined as P or not P.

11:48.280 --> 11:54.480
And that enables us to introduce the framework of propositions.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.080
Now, there's something important about this.

11:56.080 --> 12:02.480
Because what happens here is we get something, he says, that notice is analytic.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.180
It's analytic whether P or not P.

12:06.180 --> 12:09.480
Chicago is large or Chicago is not large?

12:09.480 --> 12:12.680
Yeah, that seems like a logical truth.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.480
So that Chicago is large is a proposition.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.780
We have to cheat there a little bit.

12:16.780 --> 12:22.880
Notice I have to introduce the word that and say that Chicago is large is a proposition.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.380
But I substitute other things for P that are inappropriate for the variable and

12:26.380 --> 12:29.780
hope we're count like Fred or not Fred.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.480
That doesn't make any sense.

12:32.480 --> 12:37.280
Molecule or not molecule, that doesn't make any sense.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.280
Between or not between, that doesn't make any sense.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.180
So I have to have the right kind of thing going in here.

12:42.180 --> 12:44.780
It has to be a sentence, for example.

12:44.780 --> 12:48.880
But his point is this, if I've got sentences in my language,

12:48.880 --> 12:52.480
then it actually doesn't take much to introduce talk of propositions.

12:52.480 --> 12:58.580
All I have to do is have a term proposition, some variables that can range over propositions

12:58.580 --> 13:03.080
and then introduce a way of making sense of that.

13:03.080 --> 13:07.480
So with the dementor example, I would introduce the term dementor,

13:07.480 --> 13:10.980
have a variable for that, let's say D is a dementor.

13:10.980 --> 13:14.780
But then I do have to actually give some kind of characterization of it.

13:14.780 --> 13:18.580
But notice in this case, it's not this kind of definition.

13:18.580 --> 13:22.180
It's something that has a sort of surprising feature.

13:22.180 --> 13:27.580
What happens is that I take something that wasn't functioning as a singular term,

13:27.580 --> 13:29.180
I turn it into one.

13:29.180 --> 13:34.580
So here, the thought is supposed to be a little bit different.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.380
I am actually taking predicates that I can make sense of,

13:38.380 --> 13:43.180
and then using those to characterize what a proposition is.

13:43.180 --> 13:47.680
Here, I'm actually just taking something of a different grammatical category

13:47.680 --> 13:50.980
and allowing it to play a new role.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.880
So Chicago is large, or Chicago is not large.

13:54.880 --> 13:58.980
But then, well, in English, we signify that by putting it over that.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.380
That Chicago is large is a proposition.

14:01.380 --> 14:04.880
I've taken something that was functioning just as a sentence,

14:04.880 --> 14:08.580
and I've turned it into something that can function as a singular term,

14:08.580 --> 14:13.680
referring to an object, in this case a proposition.

14:13.680 --> 14:19.680
Okay, so if that's the general strategy, then what kind of thing can we do with other sorts of terms?

14:19.680 --> 14:26.680
So let's think about properties.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.280
Are there such things as properties in the world?

14:29.280 --> 14:31.080
Think about this in a big platonic sense.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.180
Are there such things as forms?

14:33.180 --> 14:40.180
Plato says, you and I are really just shadows of the form of personhood.

14:40.180 --> 14:50.180
And these desks are really just shadows of the form of deskhood.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.880
Well, that feels really dense.

14:51.880 --> 14:57.680
But some of these things, you sort of think, okay, that's sort of the overall picture.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.180
Now, whether you think that shadow business works or not, you could think,

15:01.180 --> 15:09.480
well, look, we do talk about properties such as, well, being a desk or being a personhood.

15:09.480 --> 15:15.180
There's a big debate about personhood and what that is and what it covers in ethics, for example.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.880
But we can talk about properties in all sorts of other ways.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.880
We can worry about triangularity or justice.

15:21.880 --> 15:28.780
And so those are things that seem to be, well, talk about properties of various kinds.

15:28.780 --> 15:32.780
Now, what does it take to introduce talk of properties?

15:32.780 --> 15:35.780
Well, from this point of view, it's not so surprising.

15:35.780 --> 15:39.180
First of all, we introduce the general term property.

15:39.180 --> 15:43.180
So we have a way of talking about these things.

15:43.180 --> 15:45.680
Secondly, we introduce a new style of variable.

15:45.680 --> 15:53.380
So let's let that be, I don't know, maybe capital P to be a style of variable that we'll use for properties.

15:53.380 --> 15:57.680
And then we have to say something about what a property is.

15:57.680 --> 16:06.580
So we define P is a property to be the same as, now what?

16:06.580 --> 16:12.580
The whole point of this strategy is not then to give a sort of definition in the standard way,

16:12.580 --> 16:19.580
but instead to take P and use it in a different grammatical role where it's not a singular term.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.080
So how could we do that?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.580
P is a set.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.080
Well, we could do it that way.

16:37.080 --> 16:42.080
We could think, ah, let's represent P as a set of objects that have the property, for example.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.080
And that's a very Vercelian or even Freyian way of thinking about this.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.080
But actually, Carnap has in mind something different,

16:49.080 --> 16:53.580
because that's a way of taking an object that we've already constructed and identifying with this.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.580
And notice what Carnap did here.

16:55.580 --> 16:59.580
He didn't construct an object and say that object is a proposition.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.080
He just said P is a proposition if and only if P or not P.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.080
He didn't build up an object.

17:05.080 --> 17:10.080
Instead, now, later, by the way, people think of propositions in different ways,

17:10.080 --> 17:12.080
for example, as sets of possible worlds.

17:12.080 --> 17:16.580
So they're using your strategy of building up an object and saying let's call that a proposition.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.080
That's not what he's doing.

17:18.080 --> 17:25.080
He's really just taking something and allowing you to use things as singular terms without building an object.

17:25.080 --> 17:29.080
And so you might say there's this traditional strategy of construction

17:29.080 --> 17:33.080
that he was concerned with early in the logical structure of the world

17:33.080 --> 17:35.080
that Russell was pursuing a logical atomism.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.580
Notice this is not constructed.

17:37.580 --> 17:40.080
He's not actually constructing an object and saying,

17:40.080 --> 17:45.080
aha, now we have something that can play the role of a proposition or a property or something like that.

17:45.080 --> 17:52.080
Instead, he's just sort of, well, pulling what feels like a logical trick.

17:52.080 --> 17:57.080
Allowing you to use something as a singular term but wasn't used as a singular term.

17:58.080 --> 18:02.080
So one way to do this would be to construct a set, something of that sort,

18:02.080 --> 18:05.080
but his strategy in this paper is different.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.080
The earlier Carnap would have done just what you're saying.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.080
But Carnap at this stage says, actually, there's a different way of doing it.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.080
Now, think about a property like justice.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.080
Okay?

18:17.080 --> 18:20.080
Justice is a property if and only if.

18:20.080 --> 18:24.080
And now, what do we want to, what do we have in our language already

18:24.080 --> 18:26.080
that isn't an abstract term like justice?

18:26.080 --> 18:32.080
But nevertheless, it might apply to individual objects or individual events, influences or actions.

18:35.080 --> 18:40.080
You could say, he's a property if an object has or doesn't have it.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.080
Yeah, it has or doesn't have it.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.080
But that's already to use it as a singular term.

18:44.080 --> 18:49.080
So to say that an action has justice, for example.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.080
What's a simpler way of saying that?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.080
An act is just.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
It's just, exactly.

18:54.080 --> 18:58.080
So, if px or not px.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
Okay?

19:03.080 --> 19:05.080
So justice is a property if and only if.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.080
Well, for any x, x is just or x is not just.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.080
Triadularity is a property if and only if.

19:12.080 --> 19:16.080
Well, x is triadular or x is not triadular.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
Notice what happens here.

19:17.080 --> 19:22.080
There we had that sort of acting as the thing in English

19:22.080 --> 19:24.080
that signals a singular term.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.080
Here what happens?

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
Well, we have something that signals this.

19:28.080 --> 19:38.080
It's like turning triangle into triadularity or just into justice or kind into kindness, et cetera, et cetera.

19:38.080 --> 19:43.080
There are all these ways of putting on a suffix that turns something into an abstract term.

19:43.080 --> 19:48.080
And that's an indication that we've done this and we're now using this as a singular term.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.080
But he says, don't think that singular term has to refer to something.

19:52.080 --> 19:57.080
Instead, just think, well, we're building it up from a predicate.

19:57.080 --> 20:01.080
And we're doing it by adding this and allowing it to play the role of a singular term.

20:01.080 --> 20:07.080
But nothing philosophically huge is going on there.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.080
Now, there are two ways of taking this.

20:09.080 --> 20:17.080
One way of taking Carnap's general strategy here is to say he's a nominalist and he's giving you the key to nominalism.

20:17.080 --> 20:25.080
He's saying you can talk about justice or triangularity or propositions without committing yourself to abstract objects.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.080
You can think everything in the world is just a particular thing.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.080
That is triangular is not triangular.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.080
That is just or is not just.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.080
That is true or not true or something like that.

20:36.080 --> 20:41.080
And then add this abstract language without really any ontological commitments.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.080
And a lot of people have interpreted Carnap that way.

20:44.080 --> 20:53.080
But actually, Carnap himself seems to say, what I'm doing is showing that this question of nominalism is actually not a very interesting question.

20:53.080 --> 20:59.080
So he doesn't see himself, I think, as pursuing a strategy of nominalism here.

20:59.080 --> 21:06.080
But instead of saying the whole traditional debate about realism, conceptualism, nominalism, and so on,

21:06.080 --> 21:09.080
is based on the idea that there's a real metaphysical question here.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.080
And there isn't.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.080
Why?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.080
What are we doing?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.080
We're introducing a framework like this.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.080
And now we can distinguish two kinds of questions.

21:19.080 --> 21:26.080
There are internal questions, questions that are internal to a framework.

21:26.080 --> 21:37.080
Like, let's say within the framework of propositions, we ask, are there propositions?

21:37.080 --> 21:43.080
Well, within this framework, what's the answer to that question?

21:43.080 --> 21:44.080
Sure.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.080
Right?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.080
Are there propositions?

21:46.080 --> 21:51.080
Well, all that means is, yeah, is there a P such that P is a proposition?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.080
So is there a P such that P are not P?

21:54.080 --> 21:59.080
Is there a sentence such that it's true or not true?

21:59.080 --> 22:01.080
Yeah, sure.

22:01.080 --> 22:09.080
And so the answer is always a sort of trivial yes or no.

22:09.080 --> 22:13.080
I mean, if the framework is not one that includes that.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.080
Maybe.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.080
But normally it's just a trivial yes.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
Of course.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.080
If you ask the person teaching you, let's say you're in first grade,

22:22.080 --> 22:25.080
the teacher is teaching you some basic arithmetic.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.080
You're counting, right?

22:27.080 --> 22:31.080
One, two, three, four.

22:31.080 --> 22:36.080
And then you can complicate things like one plus one is two.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.080
And you say, I have a question, Ms. Walters.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.080
Are there really numbers?

22:43.080 --> 22:48.080
What's Ms. Walters going to say?

22:48.080 --> 22:49.080
Sure.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.080
Sure.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.080
Yeah, like one is a number, right?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.080
Two is a number.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.080
So sure there are numbers like one, two, three.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.080
And it's a kind of trivial question, right?

23:00.080 --> 23:04.080
If you say, are there even numbers that are greater than 100?

23:04.080 --> 23:08.080
She's going to say sure, like 102, 104, et cetera, right?

23:08.080 --> 23:10.080
If you say, are there any numbers at all?

23:10.080 --> 23:11.080
Sure.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
One, two, three.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.080
It's a trivial question.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
Are there any propositions?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.080
Sure.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.080
The one plus one is two.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.080
The Chicago is large, right?

23:18.080 --> 23:21.080
I'm now speaking to you.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.080
And so within the framework, this is very simple.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
Are there propositions?

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
Well, sure.

23:25.080 --> 23:29.080
Similarly, are there properties within the framework of properties?

23:29.080 --> 23:33.080
Sure.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.080
Yes.

23:34.080 --> 23:39.080
And notice that in this case, it's just the analytic pieces that that's true.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.080
It's just the analytic that there are properties.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.080
It is analytic that there are propositions.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.080
Why?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
Because it's analytic that p or not p.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.080
It's analytic that px or not px.

23:48.080 --> 23:53.080
And so within the framework, these are utterly trivial questions.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.080
But now suppose we're not in the framework.

23:56.080 --> 24:00.080
Suppose we say, yeah, but look, I'm not asking that kind of question.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.080
Right?

24:01.080 --> 24:02.080
Ms. Walters says, of course there are numbers.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.080
One, two, three.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.080
And you say, no, no, no.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.080
I'm asking a deeper question.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.080
Numbers are abstract objects.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.080
I want to know if there are abstract objects.

24:12.080 --> 24:19.080
Ms. Walters, what's your position on the realist, conceptualist, novelist debate?

24:19.080 --> 24:24.080
And then I think Ms. Walters sends you to the principal.

24:24.080 --> 24:31.080
But it could be that she said, well, you're, oh, you want to ask a deeper question.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.080
Well, there is a deeper question here.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.080
Right?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.080
And that is the external question.

24:36.080 --> 24:39.080
But it's not really the metaphysical question either.

24:39.080 --> 24:45.080
The external question is just should be.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.080
Adopt that framework.

24:48.080 --> 24:54.080
The framework of propositions, the framework of properties, the framework of work of numbers.

24:54.080 --> 24:58.080
And so from that point of view, the right way to answer this deeper question the first

24:58.080 --> 25:05.080
framework has is to say, well, sure, there's numbers like one, two, three, and four.

25:05.080 --> 25:10.080
And if you're asking why we should do arithmetic at all, why we should accept any of that,

25:10.080 --> 25:14.080
the question is because arithmetic is really useful.

25:14.080 --> 25:23.080
It's important that we actually be able to count things, that we be able to add numbers together

25:23.080 --> 25:25.080
and do other kinds of things.

25:25.080 --> 25:30.080
And in short, what Ms. Walters has to do is defend the utility of arithmetic.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.080
But notice that when she's doing that, she's not giving some metaphysical argument.

25:33.080 --> 25:38.080
She's just saying, look, pragmatically, it's really useful to introduce this framework of numbers

25:38.080 --> 25:40.080
and talk about numbers.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.080
So this sort of question ends up being analytic and trivial.

25:44.080 --> 25:48.080
This sort of question is just pragmatic.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.080
It's just a matter of thinking, well, is it worth adopting that framework?

25:52.080 --> 25:54.080
It has advantages.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.080
It has some disadvantages.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.080
Right?

25:57.080 --> 26:01.080
As the first grader is learning arithmetic, you may be painfully aware of the disadvantages

26:01.080 --> 26:03.080
of introducing this framework.

26:03.080 --> 26:08.080
You have to learn all this stuff and count stuff and learn the rules of addition and multiplication

26:08.080 --> 26:10.080
and back, back, back, back, back.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.080
Right?

26:11.080 --> 26:16.080
And so there can be all sorts of pragmatic arguments forward against us to reframe them.

26:16.080 --> 26:19.080
For example, introducing this framework of propositions.

26:19.080 --> 26:24.080
What are some advantages of introducing this framework of propositions?

26:24.080 --> 26:26.080
The external question here isn't the simple one.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.080
Are there propositions?

26:27.080 --> 26:28.080
Oh, of course.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.080
Chicago is large or not large.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.080
So Chicago is large is the proposition.

26:31.080 --> 26:36.080
It's instead to say, what's the value of introducing that talk of propositions?

26:36.080 --> 26:40.080
And now we can think about positive and negative consequences.

26:40.080 --> 26:45.080
So what are some positive things that happen if we introduce this framework of propositions?

26:45.080 --> 26:49.080
Why do people talk about propositions and not just talk about sentences?

26:49.080 --> 26:51.080
After all, that's Chicago is large.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.080
It's different from just, quote, Chicago is large.

26:54.080 --> 27:01.080
What's the advantage of moving from that to talk of propositions?

27:01.080 --> 27:03.080
Convenience in language.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.080
It's just easier.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.080
Okay, it is easier.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.080
Now, why is it easier?

27:07.080 --> 27:12.080
Why does it let us do easily that otherwise would become hard to do?

27:12.080 --> 27:15.080
Evaluate the truth of something.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.080
Evaluate the truth.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.080
Well, let's see.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.080
I say Chicago is large.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.080
And you think, I don't know how to think about that.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.080
But if I think, is it true that Chicago is large?

27:24.080 --> 27:25.080
Oh, no, I see.

27:25.080 --> 27:30.080
And how do you know you're actually talking about what we connotate Chicago as currently?

27:30.080 --> 27:34.080
Or you know it's not really meant to denote something else?

27:34.080 --> 27:37.080
Well, there, yeah.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.080
Okay, good.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.080
That's an interesting point.

27:39.080 --> 27:44.080
Because when I talk about the sentence Chicago is large, I'm just talking about a set of

27:44.080 --> 27:45.080
marks, right?

27:45.080 --> 27:51.080
Or maybe a type of mark or a type of, I mean, it's actually kind of complicated to figure

27:51.080 --> 27:54.080
it out because it can be written down, it can be spoken, et cetera.

27:54.080 --> 27:58.080
But it's a syntactic object of some kind, or maybe a phonological object of some kind

27:58.080 --> 28:00.080
or some combination of those.

28:00.080 --> 28:04.080
But as soon as I say that Chicago is large, you do get the sense that now I'm talking

28:04.080 --> 28:07.080
about this as interpreted, right?

28:07.080 --> 28:12.080
And now the referent of Chicago seems relevant and the referent of large.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.080
So you're right.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.080
Both of those are actually vague.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.080
Chicago, do you mean the city boundaries?

28:16.080 --> 28:19.080
Or do you mean the metropolitan area?

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
Do you mean in population?

28:20.080 --> 28:23.080
Do you mean in geographical area?

28:23.080 --> 28:26.080
What Chicago denotes there may seem vague.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.080
But also large, they can seem vague.

28:29.080 --> 28:34.080
It's actually not only between geographically large and large in population, but there's

28:34.080 --> 28:36.080
a lot of vagueness to large, right?

28:36.080 --> 28:38.080
Is Austin a large city?

28:38.080 --> 28:39.080
I don't know.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.080
It's kind of large.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.080
Actually, this was a better example 20 years ago.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.080
Then it was kind of large.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.080
Now it sort of just is large.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.080
It's used in a large city.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
It's used well.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.080
It's used in a large city.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.080
There I think you can just say, yeah, sure.

28:52.080 --> 28:57.080
But what are some cities that might be on the borderline of this?

28:57.080 --> 29:02.080
Where you say it's that large and you say, oh, I don't know.

29:02.080 --> 29:07.080
Kind of sort of Perth.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.080
Perth Australian?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.080
Perth, maybe.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
I don't.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
Good.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.080
Take a obscure city that I don't know about.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.080
Sorry for those Australian viewers.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.080
But yeah, I don't know much about Perth Australia.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
You might be right.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
It's a small city.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.080
Yeah.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.080
I mean, there are some cities where very clearly we say no.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
It's not large, right?

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
I say, oh gosh, what's?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.080
Salt Flat, Texas.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.080
Population 10 is a large city.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.080
No, it is really not.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.080
It's not a city then.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.080
It's not really a city at all.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.080
That's true.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.080
City is vague in addition to this vagueness of large.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.080
So what counts as a city?

29:44.080 --> 29:51.080
You might think, yeah, in fact, in that sense, what is a city but a large population center?

29:51.080 --> 29:55.080
And so you might, somebody might say it's just analytic that cities are large.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.080
Because otherwise, we wouldn't call them cities.

29:57.080 --> 30:03.080
But presumably, there can be small cities like Akron, Ohio, maybe, or maybe like Perth,

30:03.080 --> 30:09.080
Australia, or gosh, Sioux City, Iowa, or something like that.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
Where you say, look, it's a city.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.080
It's called Sioux City.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.080
So it's got to be a city.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.080
But it's a small city.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
Yeah.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.080
Large probably means like large if it's tight, right?

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
And you say, good.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.080
It does mean large for a city, right?

30:23.080 --> 30:27.080
So yeah, city is sort of already large for a population center.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.080
But then a large city is large for a city.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.080
So it's large for a large population center.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
Yeah, exactly.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.080
So there are really two senses of large there.

30:35.080 --> 30:39.080
Now, notice that if we're just talking about the sentence, Chicago is large.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.080
We don't necessarily have to get into this.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.080
But the moment we talk about propositions, you might think all of this becomes relevant.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.080
What proposition are you expressing?

30:46.080 --> 30:48.080
You say Chicago is large.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.080
And now we can say, what do you mean?

30:51.080 --> 30:55.080
If I just say, ah, consider the sentence, single quote, Chicago is large.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.080
You could think, OK, that's clear.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.080
I know what you're saying.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.080
Right?

30:59.080 --> 31:03.080
To say what that expresses, that's where all this vagueness and ambiguity, et cetera, come in.

31:03.080 --> 31:10.080
So one thing we could think happens here is we've now got something that has real semantic input.

31:10.080 --> 31:13.080
Now, the sentence has a semantics, too.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.080
We could interpret it.

31:14.080 --> 31:20.080
You might think an act of interpretation has already gone on when we moved to the proposition.

31:20.080 --> 31:26.080
Now, something like Chicago is large shows us this because there are these levels of ambiguity introduced.

31:26.080 --> 31:33.080
Another classic case of this, which shows utility, is something that involves a pronoun.

31:33.080 --> 31:37.080
I say, I wonder whether it's raining.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.080
And you think, Dan wonders whether it's raining.

31:40.080 --> 31:44.080
And there's a sense in which we're both expressing the same proposition.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.080
Those are two different sentences.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.080
I've said, I wonder whether it's raining.

31:48.080 --> 31:53.080
You've said, he wonders whether it's raining, or Dan wonders whether it's raining.

31:53.080 --> 31:58.080
And yet we want to say all of those express the same proposition.

31:58.080 --> 32:05.080
Now, what are some other advantages besides getting away from the difficulty of the I, in that sense?

32:05.080 --> 32:10.080
By the way, some people have argued that the traditional concept of omniscience attributed to God is incoherent,

32:10.080 --> 32:17.080
because I can know that I am wondering whether it's raining, but God can't know that I am wondering.

32:17.080 --> 32:22.080
God knows that Pan-Bonevac is wondering, let's say, if God knows everything.

32:22.080 --> 32:27.080
But God can't know it in this day-say, personal way that I do.

32:27.080 --> 32:30.080
Now, yeah, I think this is a laughable objection.

32:30.080 --> 32:36.080
But one way of arguing that it's a laughable objection is to say, well, to say that God is omniscient

32:36.080 --> 32:38.080
means God knows all the propositions.

32:38.080 --> 32:43.080
It doesn't mean God knows I am hungry when I am hungry, I consider.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.080
So, yeah, it seems so.

32:45.080 --> 32:51.080
But introducing the term proposition can be a way of seeing why that's a silly objection.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.080
By the way, people have actually talked about this at the American Philosophical Association meetings,

32:55.080 --> 33:01.080
which is why, if you ever think, whoa, I bet that is a forum for deep and wise thinking.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.080
It's not always true.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.080
In fact, most of the time not true.

33:07.080 --> 33:11.080
Now, so it gives us that advantage.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.080
What are some other advantages?

33:13.080 --> 33:18.080
It allows us to abstract away, in other words, from indexicals and illustratives like this and that

33:18.080 --> 33:21.080
and other things that introduce a kind of context dependence.

33:21.080 --> 33:25.080
And so it allows us to talk about what's being said or what's being thought

33:25.080 --> 33:31.080
without being tied to a specific context, and that can be really useful.

33:31.080 --> 33:36.080
Are there other things that are like that, taking it out of a context?

33:36.080 --> 33:39.080
Suppose we speak different languages.

33:39.080 --> 33:44.080
And so I say, that is red.

33:44.080 --> 33:48.080
And a German speaker says, das ist gut.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.080
We're expressing the same proposition, right?

33:50.080 --> 33:55.080
And yet using two very different sentences in different languages to express the same proposition.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.080
You might say, gosh, we're thinking the same thing, we're saying the same thing,

33:58.080 --> 34:01.080
even though we're speaking different languages.

34:01.080 --> 34:07.080
Can you see other advantages of talking about propositions?

34:07.080 --> 34:11.080
Actually, that's a big one when you think about objects of attitudes.

34:11.080 --> 34:17.080
Because suppose the German speaker has that belief that would be expressed by that sentence.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.080
And I have the belief expressed by the sentence in English.

34:19.080 --> 34:22.080
Are we believing the same thing or different things?

34:22.080 --> 34:27.080
If we're talking about propositions as objects of belief, we can say we're believing the same thing.

34:27.080 --> 34:30.080
And we can easily express that using this language of propositions.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.080
In sentences, what would we have to do?

34:32.080 --> 34:37.080
We'd have to say, well, the German speaker has a relation to that sentence.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.080
And I have a relation to this sentence.

34:40.080 --> 34:45.080
And then those sentences are inter-translatable or mean the same thing or something.

34:45.080 --> 34:51.080
So maybe we could say that, but it's a lot more complicated to say.

34:51.080 --> 35:01.080
Are there other advantages to introducing an abstract term like proposition?

35:01.080 --> 35:04.080
Well, let's turn it around and ask the other question.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.080
Are there disadvantages?

35:06.080 --> 35:11.080
What would be an argument pragmatic against introducing talk of propositions

35:11.080 --> 35:15.080
or properties or other abstractions like this?

35:15.080 --> 35:20.080
I mean, it kind of just sets sentences into either being true or false.

35:20.080 --> 35:25.080
So I feel like that kind of takes away from what a sentence could actually mean.

35:25.080 --> 35:33.080
Oh, well, all right, yes, it does abstract away from the details of the individual sentence.

35:33.080 --> 35:39.080
And at times that can be an advantage, but at times you might be losing information that matters.

35:39.080 --> 35:45.080
For example, I ask whether John believes that the morning star is the evening star.

35:45.080 --> 35:50.080
And you happen to know that those actually refer to the same object.

35:50.080 --> 35:55.080
Now, is that proposition the same as the morning star is the morning star?

35:55.080 --> 35:58.080
Ask John, is the morning star the morning star?

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
Sure.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.080
Is the morning star the evening star?

36:02.080 --> 36:04.080
Ooh, I don't know.

36:04.080 --> 36:10.080
And so now we might say, in this case, it matters what sentence is being used.

36:10.080 --> 36:14.080
But depending on our view of propositions, we couldn't upsay it,

36:14.080 --> 36:17.080
but those things express the same proposition.

36:17.080 --> 36:21.080
So it would be a mistake to move away from the sentences in that case

36:21.080 --> 36:23.080
and move to talk about propositions.

36:23.080 --> 36:28.080
Now here, are we committed about the identity conditions of propositions?

36:28.080 --> 36:31.080
When is P the same proposition as Q?

36:31.080 --> 36:34.080
Notice this doesn't really say anything about that.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.080
We don't really have identity conditions here.

36:37.080 --> 36:41.080
After all, P or not P is equivalent to Q or not Q

36:41.080 --> 36:44.080
in the sense that they're both just logical truths.

36:44.080 --> 36:47.080
So we can't very easily introduce identity conditions here

36:47.080 --> 36:50.080
and get a good answer to the question of whether the morning star is the morning star

36:50.080 --> 36:55.080
and the morning star is the evening star expressed the same proposition as propositions.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.080
Now, in a way, that's good.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.080
We are committed to a bad consequence here.

36:59.080 --> 37:03.080
But from another point of view, you might say there's something that's really ill-defined here.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.080
And the same truth of this is triangularity.

37:06.080 --> 37:11.080
The same property is tri-laterality, having three angles, having three sides.

37:11.080 --> 37:14.080
Are they the same property or different properties?

37:14.080 --> 37:17.080
Well, things have three angles or not.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.080
Things have three sides or not.

37:19.080 --> 37:23.080
We don't really get an answer to that question, right?

37:23.080 --> 37:26.080
There are different P's that go in there.

37:26.080 --> 37:30.080
So I suppose you could say that's an argument that there are different properties.

37:30.080 --> 37:34.080
Just as here, the morning star is the morning star and the morning star is the evening star

37:34.080 --> 37:37.080
are different sentences, so maybe that's an argument that there are different properties.

37:37.080 --> 37:41.080
But we've got to be careful because we want, I'm hungry and Dan is hungry,

37:41.080 --> 37:47.080
or I'm wondering whether it's raining and Dan's wondering whether it's actually expressed the same proposition.

37:47.080 --> 37:52.080
So this, in a sense, doesn't commit us with respect to identity conditions.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.080
And that can be dissatisfied.

37:56.080 --> 38:02.080
I mean, quite at one point, introduces the slogan, no entity without identity.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.080
And we don't have identity conditions here.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.080
So Kwan will be unhappy.

38:06.080 --> 38:10.080
He'll say, I don't know whether that's the same proposition as that,

38:10.080 --> 38:12.080
whether this is the same property as that,

38:12.080 --> 38:18.080
whether there are one or infinitely many possible fat men in the doorway, et cetera, et cetera,

38:18.080 --> 38:23.080
because possibilities might be something introduced along similar lines.

38:23.080 --> 38:28.080
And so in short, there might be that kind of disadvantage,

38:28.080 --> 38:30.080
or there are other disadvantages we might have to worry about.

38:30.080 --> 38:33.080
Losing information is one, in other words.

38:33.080 --> 38:39.080
And this lack of identity conditions is another closely related one.

38:39.080 --> 38:47.080
Are there other disadvantages?

38:47.080 --> 38:48.080
Yeah?

38:48.080 --> 38:51.080
So kind of quite along with the losing information one,

38:51.080 --> 38:53.080
I'm in another linguistic anthropology class,

38:53.080 --> 38:55.080
and we're just talking about linguistic relativity,

38:55.080 --> 38:58.080
where it's like, because people aren't speaking the same language,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.080
like even though you're saying the same thing,

39:00.080 --> 39:03.080
we still have a different kind of meaning associated with it,

39:03.080 --> 39:07.080
even though it's relating to referencing the same thing.

39:07.080 --> 39:11.080
So kind of, we're losing that level of information also.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.080
That's a good point.

39:12.080 --> 39:16.080
You might think that the kind of information being conveyed

39:16.080 --> 39:19.080
really does depend on the rest of the linguistic framework.

39:19.080 --> 39:23.080
And it's not clear, especially in so far as we're now able to identify things

39:23.080 --> 39:25.080
across linguistic frameworks,

39:25.080 --> 39:28.080
you might worry that we're losing a certain kind of context.

39:28.080 --> 39:32.080
So if this could happen in a kind of anthropological setting,

39:32.080 --> 39:36.080
where, for example, we have a very rich set of color words,

39:36.080 --> 39:38.080
we go to study a tribe's language,

39:38.080 --> 39:42.080
and we realize they only have, let's say, three color terms.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.080
They divide the whole spectrum up into just these three things.

39:45.080 --> 39:49.080
And the question is, well, how do we translate those words they use?

39:49.080 --> 39:51.080
Here's one proposal.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.080
They are white, black and red.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.080
Okay?

39:54.080 --> 39:55.080
Here's another proposal.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.080
Well, they're really red, yeah,

39:58.080 --> 40:00.080
but the others are more like light and dark.

40:00.080 --> 40:04.080
Because after all, what we would describe as brown, for example,

40:04.080 --> 40:06.080
they're going to call black.

40:06.080 --> 40:12.080
And so you might worry about how we sort of capture the content of this proposition.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.080
And that's, so there's that worry.

40:15.080 --> 40:19.080
There's also this kind of worry in a scientific context with theory change.

40:19.080 --> 40:24.080
We move from traditional Newtonian mechanics to relativistic mechanics,

40:24.080 --> 40:28.080
and all of a sudden, do we have the same concept of kinetic energy

40:28.080 --> 40:30.080
or a different concept of kinetic energy?

40:30.080 --> 40:33.080
Does kinetic energy really function as the same term there,

40:33.080 --> 40:35.080
or should be viewed differently?

40:35.080 --> 40:39.080
Is it, if we think of it as an abstract property that something has,

40:39.080 --> 40:41.080
is it the same property or a different property?

40:41.080 --> 40:44.080
And so I think you're right that, in a sense,

40:44.080 --> 40:47.080
it may be good that this doesn't commit us to a specific view of that,

40:47.080 --> 40:50.080
but you might think, look, there's a tension here,

40:50.080 --> 40:54.080
because insofar as we gain the advantage of pulling things out of their context,

40:54.080 --> 40:58.080
we get the disadvantage that we're losing information provided by that context.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.080
Right?

40:59.080 --> 41:04.080
And we've got to, in some cases, it's super easy to put in that information.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.080
I pull, I am hungry away from the speaker.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.080
I don't know who it is anymore,

41:09.080 --> 41:11.080
but I can fill that in with a proper name,

41:11.080 --> 41:14.080
designating the person who's hungry and problem solved.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.080
But in a case like the one you're describing, right?

41:17.080 --> 41:20.080
The whole question is, in a sense, what term would I substitute?

41:20.080 --> 41:23.080
And it might be really hard to do that.

41:23.080 --> 41:27.080
This is the kind of worry, actually, that's going to lead Quine

41:27.080 --> 41:31.080
to one of his most dramatic theses that we'll study later in the course,

41:31.080 --> 41:34.080
which is the thesis of the indeterminacy of translation,

41:34.080 --> 41:37.080
where even in pretty simple cases, he's going to ask you,

41:37.080 --> 41:41.080
it's not all clear how we should translate native utterances,

41:41.080 --> 41:47.080
partly because of this question of conceptual schemes that don't match up precisely,

41:47.080 --> 41:50.080
but partly because when it comes to basic metaphysical questions,

41:50.080 --> 41:55.080
he's going to say there's no real content to the idea of, let's say,

41:55.080 --> 41:58.080
running into a tribe, all of them turn out to be plainness,

41:58.080 --> 42:01.080
or another tribe that are thorough and go anomalous,

42:01.080 --> 42:05.080
and he'll say, you know, look, I can't tell the difference between these tribes.

42:05.080 --> 42:09.080
And so there's something unintelligible about that.

42:09.080 --> 42:14.080
In a way, that finding a tribe with a different set of color concepts isn't absurd.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.080
That really could happen.

42:16.080 --> 42:22.080
But to say, oh, we've discovered this tribe of plainness that he thinks is absurd,

42:22.080 --> 42:24.080
even though intuitively you might think,

42:24.080 --> 42:27.080
but go back to Plato's Academy in the old days,

42:27.080 --> 42:30.080
and isn't that a tribe of plainness right there?

42:30.080 --> 42:34.080
Well, never mind. We'll get to that soon enough.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.080
But yes, there's one last.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
Anyway, I think that's a critical point.

42:39.080 --> 42:43.080
Insofar as we gained flexibility to use this independently of context,

42:43.080 --> 42:49.080
linguistic context, cultural context, context of the speaker at the time, et cetera, et cetera,

42:49.080 --> 42:52.080
all of those things are going to be, in a sense,

42:52.080 --> 42:55.080
abstracting away from certain information we might care about.

42:55.080 --> 42:58.080
The last one is we have to learn this, right?

42:58.080 --> 43:01.080
And not only is there that kind of burden,

43:01.080 --> 43:04.080
we have to learn to speak proposition and ease or properties and so on,

43:04.080 --> 43:06.080
but it can mislead us.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.080
Now, what's potentially misleading about it?

43:12.080 --> 43:17.080
We've got all of these things functioning, the singular terms,

43:17.080 --> 43:19.080
and it looks like they're referring to objects.

43:19.080 --> 43:22.080
But are they really referring to objects?

43:22.080 --> 43:24.080
Not really.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.080
Right?

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
I mean, this just transits as P or not.

43:27.080 --> 43:29.080
That's not referring to an object.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.080
Justus is a property.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.080
That just translates into X is just or X is not just.

43:35.080 --> 43:40.080
So, actually, these are kind of pseudo singular terms.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.080
They're not really referring to an object.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.080
They're doing something else.

43:44.080 --> 43:48.080
Now, notice this has an implication, which is part of the reason why he hates it.

43:48.080 --> 43:50.080
Because one question to ask here is,

43:50.080 --> 43:52.080
why does one find it so objectionable?

43:52.080 --> 43:55.080
Why do he and Karnab get into a big debate about all of this?

43:56.080 --> 43:59.080
Part of it is because this really undermines

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
Quine's Criterion of Ontological Commitment.

44:01.080 --> 44:05.080
Remember, he said to be is to be a value of a variable.

44:05.080 --> 44:11.080
And so, once I've got this, notice I can existentially quantify with respect to this.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.080
I can now say there are propositions.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.080
In fact, there's a proposition that both you and I believe.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.080
We can say all sorts of things like this.

44:19.080 --> 44:25.080
And similarly here, we can say, sure, there is a P, such that P is a property.

44:25.080 --> 44:30.080
Namely, for example, justice or triangularity or redness, blah, blah, blah.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.080
Of course, those things are analytic.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.080
And so, there is a P such that this is the case.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.080
That's going to be a trivial truth.

44:37.080 --> 44:42.080
And yet, Karnab's point is that doesn't actually commit me to an object like justice

44:42.080 --> 44:44.080
or triangularity or redness.

44:44.080 --> 44:49.080
Why? Because all I'm really doing is abstracting away from usages like this.

44:49.080 --> 44:52.080
And so, the big conclusion of...

44:52.080 --> 44:55.080
Well, I think there are a number of big conclusions of this.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.080
Let's spell them out explicitly.

45:01.080 --> 45:10.080
One is to be is not to be a value of a variable.

45:10.080 --> 45:17.080
In fact, we might say variables are cheap.

45:17.080 --> 45:21.080
Can I ask the reason for that?

45:21.080 --> 45:27.080
It's because there are things that are values of variables that don't really exist.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.080
Is that the argument?

45:29.080 --> 45:32.080
Well, yeah, that...

45:32.080 --> 45:35.080
Well, actually, yeah, you're right.

45:35.080 --> 45:39.080
I mean, maybe the value here is that...

45:39.080 --> 45:42.080
Because in a sense, we can talk about there being properties

45:42.080 --> 45:45.080
without actually having any properties as values of variables.

45:45.080 --> 45:49.080
So maybe, actually, I'm putting it in a misleading way.

45:49.080 --> 45:53.080
A better way of putting it would really be that existential and universal quantifications

45:53.080 --> 45:56.080
are not good guides to ontology.

45:56.080 --> 45:59.080
So, let me put that more precisely.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.080
And now I'm running out of room or time.

46:02.080 --> 46:06.080
I'll get rid of properties here like a good novelist.

46:06.080 --> 46:11.080
And so we can say a better way of putting that really is quantification.

46:14.080 --> 46:21.080
Is must the guide to ontology.

46:25.080 --> 46:28.080
And the second big implication is really just that

46:28.080 --> 46:31.080
if we ask these basic ontological questions, or their properties,

46:31.080 --> 46:34.080
or their propositions, or their numbers, et cetera,

46:34.080 --> 46:40.080
really they're either trivial if they're internal questions or they're pragmatic.

46:40.080 --> 46:52.080
So, so-called metaphysical questions

46:52.080 --> 47:00.080
are either trivial if they're internal or practical questions.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.080
If they're external questions.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.080
There is no deep metaphysical question.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.080
Are there numbers?

47:06.080 --> 47:07.080
Are there propositions?

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
Are there properties?

47:08.080 --> 47:09.080
Are there relations?

47:09.080 --> 47:11.080
Are there mental states?

47:11.080 --> 47:13.080
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.080
All right.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.080
All of those end up current up things.

47:16.080 --> 47:19.080
Being either trivial questions as asked within the framework.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
We've introduced the framework.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.080
Numbers.

47:22.080 --> 47:23.080
Are there numbers?

47:23.080 --> 47:24.080
Sure.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.080
One, two, three, four.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.080
Right?

47:26.080 --> 47:28.080
Oh, you mean external question?

47:28.080 --> 47:29.080
Then it's a practical question.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
Is it worth doing arithmetic?

47:31.080 --> 47:33.080
Is it worth talking about propositions?

47:33.080 --> 47:35.080
Is it worth talking about properties?

47:35.080 --> 47:40.080
In that way could Pegasus become a pragmatic object?

47:40.080 --> 47:43.080
Oh, suppose we talk.

47:43.080 --> 47:47.080
Well, for one thing, Pegasus doesn't give us something of a new kind really

47:47.080 --> 47:49.080
in the sense that we have to now introduce a new kind

47:49.080 --> 47:52.080
that forces us to change grammatical categories.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.080
But if we introduce a category of dementors or of Pegasus,

47:55.080 --> 47:57.080
the question is in a sense,

47:57.080 --> 47:59.080
well, I'm telling you the story about Pegasus, right?

47:59.080 --> 48:01.080
I'm, well, Irofon wrote to me.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.080
He was white.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.080
He was winged.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.080
He did this and that.

48:04.080 --> 48:10.080
Within the myth, of course, Pegasus exists, right?

48:10.080 --> 48:13.080
If I ask a journal question, it's really to say,

48:13.080 --> 48:16.080
so is this myth something we should accept?

48:16.080 --> 48:18.080
The same thing would be true of the dementors.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.080
Within the story of the Harry Potter world,

48:20.080 --> 48:21.080
of course there are dementors,

48:21.080 --> 48:23.080
but you say, oh, they really exist.

48:23.080 --> 48:27.080
You're saying, should we accept this myth or this, you know,

48:27.080 --> 48:29.080
Harry Potter world as reality?

48:29.080 --> 48:32.080
And then, for all sorts of practical reasons, we should.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.080
We'll go around looking for dementors.

48:34.080 --> 48:35.080
We'll fear them.

48:35.080 --> 48:38.080
We'll think we have to come up with a pre-patronist.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.080
And none of that's true.
