1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
I want to talk in this video about David Hume's ethical thinking.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,960
Hume here is not only developing a line of thinking about ethics that has been very influential

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,680
and very important in its own right, but also really defines a problem.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,440
A problem that philosophers now call the problem of normativity that I take to be fundamental.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,320
It's a fundamental problem not only in philosophy, but in our culture.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,000
I teach an entire course called Ideas of the 20th Century, which takes this as its starting point.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,040
And I see the 20th Century as driven, maybe more than any other single issue, by the problem of normativity.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,120
Not only in philosophy, but in art, in literature, in music, and in politics.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,960
It's something that it seems to me our culture is still grappling with, and our civilization has not yet solved.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
So we need to understand what this problem is supposed to be.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,720
More important than Hume's ultimate ethical theory, I think, is actually his definition of the problem,

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,560
and his phrasing it in terms that have made it something that, ever since the Enlightenment,

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
has been an absolutely central intellectual problem.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,320
Not only a central problem in ethics, but a problem in every intellectual field.

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Well, what is that problem? What's the issue?

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,960
Before I get to his version of it, I want to think more generally about a kind of problem we face in making decisions.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:40,200
I've sketched out here for another video a general problem of, well, practical action that we might face.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,960
And here I am. I survey my options for my decision.

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I think about the various goals I have and the motives those give me.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,640
And then I have to make a decision.

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,520
Well, that decision is going to issue in an intention to act in a certain way.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,400
If all goes well, I will act in that way, then that action will have certain consequences.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Of course, I'm framing this decision in a certain kind of setting, in a certain kind of context in the world,

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,600
given my character and my own character traits, my virtues and vices, the things I know, the things I don't know.

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,160
I do it in a framework that includes institutions, that includes an entire civilization that I'm part of.

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,720
I end up ranking those options from better to worse, perhaps.

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,200
But whatever I do, I'm doing that and making a judgment of evaluation.

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,840
However, what am I doing when I describe these various options?

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,600
I am describing them.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,160
And yet what I want to come out of this is a prescription.

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,240
I should do this.

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,600
I am coming up with something that is an evaluation.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
This is better.

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:53,320
This is worse on the basis of a description of the various possible actions open to me.

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,000
And so I'm somehow going from a pure description of the world to something that is an evaluation of the world.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Philosophers have talked about the distinction between description and prescription,

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,600
between description and evaluation, roughly speaking, between is and ought.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,000
And the question is really how you could possibly get from one to the other.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,480
How can you make room in a world that we think is fully described, for example, by science,

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,920
but even if you don't think necessarily by science, by science, by history,

41
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,880
by our common sense experience of the world, by whatever it is, right, we describe what the world is like.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,960
But then we try to draw conclusions for action about what we ought to do, about what the world ought to be like,

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,040
about what consequence would be better than what other possible consequence.

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,760
We're making evaluations.

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,080
We're going to ought or right or wrong or better or worse.

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,400
How on earth can we get there if all we have is description?

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,480
That's the problem of normativity.

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,320
Normativity because we're dealing with norms.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,080
Norms for action, norms for character, norms of all sorts of kinds,

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,960
where we're saying this is right, this is wrong.

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,880
This is correct, this is incorrect.

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,120
You ought to do this, you shouldn't do that.

53
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,680
This is permissible, this is not permissible.

54
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,360
This is better than that.

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,280
All of those are making evaluative judgments, stemming from or relating to some kind of norm,

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,800
some kind of standard for evaluating things for making such judgments.

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
But where do those norms, those standards of evaluation come from?

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,040
If all we've got in descriptions of the world, on whatever basis, are pure descriptions.

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,520
It looks like we're describing the world.

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,800
Then we evaluate it.

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,720
Where's that evaluation coming from?

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,080
It doesn't look like it's coming from anything in our description of the world.

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,240
Well, that in a nutshell is not just the problem of normativity.

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,080
It is the problem that Hume is pointing out.

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,680
It is the key to what we're going to look at.

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Hume tells us that morality is not a matter of reason.

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,160
And here's his argument in a nutshell.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Morals, he says, have an influence on actions and affections.

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Morals are the kind of thing that does evaluate things as better or worse,

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
that tells me to do or not do something, that draws me towards something,

71
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,320
or that pushes me away from something.

72
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,960
Okay, so morality is supposed to have an influence on my actions.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,600
The whole reason I'm interested in evaluating when I'm deliberating is that I wanted to affect my action.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm thinking, what should I do?

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,600
And so I evaluate certain options as better or worse options.

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
I choose one.

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,640
The whole point of going through that exercise and doing the evaluation is to affect my action.

78
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,720
It also affects my feelings, my affections, as he puts it.

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,920
If I think this is better, I'm going to prefer that one.

80
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm not going to like this one as well.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm going to think, yes, I approve of that action.

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,640
I don't approve of this one.

83
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,480
That's going to get me into trouble.

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,680
And so it is something that is done as, well, its main point, you might say.

85
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,320
It's not incidental to morality and to thinking about norms,

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,800
that it has an influence on actions and affections.

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,280
That's the whole point of it.

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,240
They're norms for action or norms for feeling or norms for thinking or norms for speaking.

89
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,400
But the whole point is to govern action and to have some effect on what we do.

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Well, he says reason alone can have no such influence.

91
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Reason can just take me from descriptions of the world to more descriptions of the world.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
It can't draw me toward anything.

93
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,280
It can't push me away from anything.

94
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,760
It can't give me a reason to act.

95
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,720
It can't affect my feelings.

96
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
It's just a description.

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,800
And so he says morality is not a conclusion of reason.

98
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,760
Reason cannot affect my actions, can't affect my affections.

99
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,000
But morality does.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Norms do.

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,600
So morality cannot be a matter of reason.

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,120
It consists of no matter of fact.

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,960
If it were a matter of fact that this is wrong, for example, or that this is better than this,

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,920
I could do some research and discover that fact.

105
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,880
But in fact, when I take out my options, describe them, and then try to choose and decide what's better than what,

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm not merely describing anymore.

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm not finding some additional matter of fact.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,720
Instead, what I'm doing is making an evaluation that is not ultimately based on reason.

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
Here is how Hume puts it, very famously and most dramatically.

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,680
In every system of morality I've met with, I've noticed that the author proceeds for some time,

111
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,800
reasoning in the ordinary way to establish the existence of a god or making points about human affairs,

112
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,880
and then he suddenly surprises me by moving from propositions with the usual copula, is or is not,

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,640
to ones that are connected by ought or ought not.

114
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,120
This seems like a very small change, but it's highly important,

115
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,560
for as this ought or ought not expresses some new relation or affirmation,

116
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,960
it needs to be pointed out and explained,

117
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,720
and a reason should be given for how this new relation can be inconceivably a deduction from others

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,400
that are entirely different from it.

119
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,360
From merely is, I can never get to ought, okay?

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,280
So he says moral, well, reasoning, quote unquote,

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,800
what people call moral reasoning seems to go from is and is not to ought and ought not.

122
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,520
It goes from this is this and that's that, to this is better than this.

123
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,360
Where is it getting that? How could we possibly go from is to ought?

124
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,520
How could we go from is not to ought not?

125
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,560
How could we go from this is this and that is that, to this is better than that?

126
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,800
Reason doesn't do that, reason supplies no connection.

127
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,000
So he's saying, look, we can describe the world and do that in rational terms.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,960
Good, good thing that we do that, important to understand matters of fact.

129
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,720
We can relate ideas, that's important too.

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,040
That's the other main way in which we obtain knowledge.

131
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,320
We relate ideas, we gain knowledge of matters of fact through experience.

132
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,000
But now, we come with conclusions like you ought to do this,

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,080
or this is better than that, or that's virtuous, that's vicious.

134
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,960
Where is that coming from?

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,920
It's not in our description, there's no matter of fact.

136
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,120
If somebody says, yeah, look, he killed that guy, that's wrong, murder is wrong.

137
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't go out and say, well, let me go back to the crime scene.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,440
I found the blood stains and I found the murder weapon, but I didn't find this wrongness.

139
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,840
Let me go do another search of the crime scene.

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
That's not going to help, right?

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
It's not like there's some additional matter of fact I need to discover.

142
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,120
It's not something else about the crime scene that's going to tell me that it's wrong.

143
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,280
And so, neither is it some additional matter of reasoning.

144
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,160
He's saying, look, it's not like you can take the existing facts and say, well, all right,

145
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,120
let me analyze those more carefully and try to see what rational and deductive conclusions

146
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,320
I can get out of those matters of fact.

147
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,160
You're never going to get to the is or is not.

148
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,080
You're never going to get to the murder is wrong or this murder is wrong from any of that.

149
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,000
And so, it's not a question of an additional matter of fact or some new deduction from

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,320
some set of matters of fact.

151
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,520
That's not what's going on.

152
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,320
Something of a very different kind is happening.

153
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,160
When I invoke norms and move to an is or is not, ought, ought not.

154
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,960
When I move from, sorry, an is or is not to an ought or ought not, this is better than that.

155
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,360
This is virtuous, this is vicious, and so on.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,680
Here, in short, assumes problem.

157
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
Once again, I appeal to the underpants gnomes.

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
I've got a description.

159
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
This is this way.

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,120
The world is like this.

161
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,680
It's all in terms of is.

162
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,200
I've described things.

163
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,440
And now, phase two, oh, hocus pocus.

164
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,600
And now, phase three, something that involves norms.

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,240
Now I get normativity, ought, ought not, good, bad, evil, better than that, worse than that.

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,720
Where did any of that come from?

167
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,360
How could I possibly go from those descriptions to an evaluation?

168
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,400
How could I go from those prescriptions to a prescriptions?

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
There is no way to do it.

170
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,000
It looks like it's completely mysterious.

171
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm going from that to profits.

172
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
How do I do that?

173
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
Where's phase two?

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,760
That, in effect, assumes problem.

175
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,280
I don't see how it's possible for anyone to go from is to ought.

176
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,600
So what on earth is going on here?

177
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,920
Whatever it is, I'm pretty sure it's not a matter of reason.

178
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,200
Well, Hume says, let's take a couple of cases.

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
We think that cruelty is wrong.

180
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,480
We think that generosity is good.

181
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,400
But why?

182
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,120
Why is cruelty wrong?

183
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,040
Why is generosity good?

184
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,200
There's no fact of the matter to be found in them, he says.

185
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,160
It's not as if you take a case of cruelty and you say, OK, I see what happened here.

186
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,240
In this, there are two, let's take two really similar cases.

187
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,320
In both of these cases, there are two children playing in the park.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,880
And the first child pushes the second one into the pond.

189
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,640
And you think, well, OK, huh, I describe this.

190
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,440
Child A pushes child B into the pond.

191
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Looks like same description in both cases.

192
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,440
But now in the first case, here's what was going on.

193
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
It was a case of cruelty.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,040
That child was just saying, oh, man, look at this.

195
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,600
Beautiful pond, isn't it?

196
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,840
And the other one says, yeah, look at the duck swimming.

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,880
That kid says, you know, I wish I could swim out there with the ducks,

198
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,440
but I'm really afraid of water.

199
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm afraid of swimming.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,080
And so that's when the other child says, you're afraid of swimming, huh?

201
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,800
Can't swim?

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,880
Afraid of the water?

203
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,200
Boom!

204
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,440
That's an act of cruelty.

205
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,080
That seems wrong.

206
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,720
But now here's case two.

207
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
Again, description in the same way.

208
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,600
These two children are there by the pond.

209
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,000
Child A pushes child B into the pond.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,600
But what was happening there?

211
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
The one child said to the other, I feel so hot.

212
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,920
I feel so hot and so thirsty.

213
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,880
This would really, maybe we should get you some water.

214
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
Think I could drink that water?

215
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,680
No, I don't think you should drink that water, but, you know, let me look at you.

216
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,320
You're, wait, your skin is cold and clammy.

217
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,080
I don't think you're doing well.

218
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
You've got to cool down.

219
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Well, what do I do?

220
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,320
What do I do?

221
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,280
Get in the water.

222
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,040
It'll cool you down.

223
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,640
I'm afraid.

224
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,280
I don't know what's in there.

225
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,360
There are ducks in there.

226
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm scared of ducks.

227
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,920
Look, you should get in the water right now.

228
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,400
And child C, I want to push in the water.

229
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Okay, in one case, this is an act of generosity.

230
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,080
The child is saying, look, I think you've got heat stroke.

231
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,000
I think you really need to cool your body down.

232
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm pushing you in the water, whether you want to go or not, because I think you need

233
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,680
to be in that water.

234
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,560
In the other case, the child is saying, you're afraid of the water.

235
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,880
And so those are really different.

236
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,240
But the description, if we ignore that history anyway, looks like it's just the same.

237
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,000
Now, you might say, Hume's cheating here.

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I gave you the history to tell you why one of these is a case of generosity, and you

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,080
say that's good, and the other is a case of cruelty, and you say that's wrong.

240
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,200
But the action itself seems the same.

241
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,480
And Hume says, there's no matter of fact to be found in the action.

242
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
Now, what did we do there?

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,600
I went into the background, and I gave you some additional facts about the background.

244
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,800
It didn't affect the actual act, which was the pushing of one child into another,

245
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,240
or of another into a pond.

246
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,320
But what happened, you might say, is, well, something we morally evaluate on the basis

247
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,040
of, in this case, finding out a few additional facts, true.

248
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,840
But even given the additional facts, what leads us from those facts to that was,

249
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,480
for example, generous?

250
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,400
A pushed B into the pond.

251
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,600
I tell you, A thought B was exhibiting signs of sunstroke, heatstroke.

252
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,360
So push.

253
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,400
You say that was generous.

254
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,160
I mean, actually, no, that child was OK.

255
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,360
And this was a false panic.

256
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,360
But still, the child was being generous in doing this, was not being cruel.

257
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,960
But it's like, wait, wait.

258
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,600
I mean, yes, those additional facts get us to the conclusion that, in this case, it

259
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
was generous and good.

260
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,240
And in that case, it was not generous.

261
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
It was cruel and bad.

262
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,960
But exactly how is it doing that?

263
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,240
Hume says, I don't see how reason is actually getting us there.

264
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
You're just supplying more facts.

265
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
You just supplied some conversation.

266
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,880
Maybe you told me something about motives.

267
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,120
OK, motives.

268
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,280
It was done from this motive or that motive.

269
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,680
But then you're making a judgment, but that was a good motive or a bad motive.

270
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,040
And now I was nowhere near to get that.

271
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
Why is that motive bad?

272
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,360
You did it because you thought this child had heatstroke.

273
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,520
You did this because you thought the child was afraid of water.

274
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,720
Why is one of those bad, the other good?

275
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,240
They are.

276
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Hume says, look, I'm not questioning that.

277
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm not saying they are bad or good.

278
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm just saying, what reasoning did you use to get there?

279
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,200
He ends up saying, it wasn't reasoning at all.

280
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,840
It's the object of feeling, not of reason.

281
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,000
It lies in yourself, not in the object.

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,320
An action or sentiment or character is virtuous or vicious.

283
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,200
Why?

284
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,920
Because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness

285
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
of a particular kind.

286
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,840
So let's go back to that case.

287
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,680
We think, why was that act of cruelty wrong?

288
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
Well, think about that case as I described.

289
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,200
The one child pushes the other into the pond

290
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,600
because they thought they were afraid of water

291
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,280
and wanted them to be terrified.

292
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,720
That seems wrong.

293
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,040
And why do you draw that conclusion?

294
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,960
It's before you invoke any reasoning and you think, well, fear is not good.

295
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,560
And the child would have got it.

296
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,840
You just think, oh, that's bad, right?

297
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,880
And so often it's the case where something just seems bad.

298
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,760
And before the reasoning even kicks in,

299
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,040
you just come to the conclusion it's wrong.

300
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,200
If I were to bring a cat in here and I were suddenly

301
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,280
just slap it for no reason, you'd say, that's terrible, OK?

302
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,640
And it's not that you have some view about animal rights

303
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,800
and so on that you think about, well, I guess, you know, gosh,

304
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't know if cats have rights exactly, but they have.

305
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,040
You don't have to do any of that.

306
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
That's really wrong.

307
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,960
The feeling is there first.

308
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Then you might invoke reasons after that,

309
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,800
but it's the feeling that pushes you from is to ought.

310
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,520
And the same thing is true when one child thinks

311
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,840
the other child is in trouble and so pushes them into the pond.

312
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,280
You think that's good.

313
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,560
Why?

314
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Because you hear the story and you think, oh, that's nice.

315
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
The child was trying to help.

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,720
Even if it turned out they were wrong about this,

317
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
they were trying to help.

318
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,560
And so it's feeling that takes you from one to the other.

319
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,360
Later you might think about reasons and trying to help

320
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
and the fact that there's a moral principle of trying

321
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
to help people, but where does that come from?

322
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,720
Does that come from reason?

323
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,200
That's Hume's problem.

324
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,000
But we could say, OK, yes.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,680
It's not a question of an additional fact of the matter.

326
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,000
What gets me there is primarily a feeling.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
I have a feeling.

328
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,040
I approve of that or disapprove of that.

329
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,640
It makes me feel good inside or bad inside.

330
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,120
It causes a pleasure or an uneasiness of various kinds.

331
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
So here's what takes us from is to ought.

332
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,160
How do I get there?

333
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,800
What is phase two?

334
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,760
Well, it's sentiment or feeling.

335
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,600
The phase one description, it's just a description of the world.

336
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,080
Here's the matter of fact.

337
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,360
Here's the way the world is.

338
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Phase two feelings, I respond in a certain way.

339
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,920
That arouses a feeling of approbation or disapprobation,

340
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,720
as you would say.

341
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,880
In me, I feel approval or disapproval.

342
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,600
It makes me feel good inside or bad inside.

343
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,640
And so it is that sentiment within me

344
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,280
that then leads me to say, that was good, that was generous,

345
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
or that was cruel, that was wrong.

346
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
You ought to do this, or you shouldn't have done that.

347
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,240
And so in those cases, what's happening

348
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,640
is it is feeling taking me to that conclusion.

349
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,720
Now, there are modern psychological theories,

350
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,440
very powerful, maybe our best modern psychological theories

351
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,240
of moral reasoning, how people actually do it.

352
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
And I find it very interesting that they agree with you.

353
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,400
They say, it's not that we don't actually

354
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,000
talk about reasons, that we don't engage in moral reasoning,

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,120
we do, but actually it comes second.

356
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,040
See how quickly somebody forms a moral conclusion,

357
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,720
and then see when they come up with a reason for it.

358
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
It's quick.

359
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
It's quick, so you really have to do

360
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
psychological experiments to find out.

361
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,280
But the conclusion comes first.

362
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,640
Then the person supplies the reasons.

363
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,760
And in some cases, the feeling comes,

364
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,600
and they draw the conclusion without any reasons at all.

365
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,120
And psychologists have constructed elaborate test cases

366
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,040
where they basically anticipate all the possible reasons

367
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,880
and build the case so that they don't apply.

368
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,760
And then they say, well still, is it right or wrong?

369
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,280
And the person says, it's wrong.

370
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,520
I know it's wrong.

371
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,360
I can't tell you what's wrong with it, though.

372
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,280
And they're immediate in that it's wrong reaction.

373
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,720
So the psychologists say, it's actually

374
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,080
our moral feelings, our intuitions, our sentiments

375
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,520
that come first, reasons come later.

376
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,840
And that's precisely Hume's position.

377
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,720
He's saying it's really feeling that takes us to the art.

378
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,560
Then maybe we back up and come up with some mumbo-jumbo

379
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,920
about how we got there.

380
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,840
But the fact is, it's feeling.

381
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,800
It's like, that made me feel bad.

382
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,960
That was wrong.

383
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,760
And in the end, it really is sentiment and feeling

384
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,120
and nothing else that takes us there.

385
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,000
So let's go back to what he said.

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,720
When I call something virtuous or vicious, right or wrong,

387
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,480
good or bad, admirable or evil, it's

388
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,960
because I am constituted in such a way that I have a feeling.

389
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
I have a response to it emotionally.

390
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
That's what's really underlying that.

391
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
And when I talk about it as wrong,

392
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
I really just mean in the end, it makes me feel bad.

393
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,800
It gives me an unpleasant feeling.

394
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,280
And that's really all that's going on.

395
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,560
So here's his conclusion, a shocking conclusion actually

396
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,240
for someone writing at the height of the Scottish

397
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,520
Enlightenment in the age of reason.

398
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,480
He says, reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions.

399
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,560
Well, it is shocking.

400
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,960
Wait, this is the height of the age of reason?

401
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,240
That it ought to be the slave of the passions?

402
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,960
But Hume says, really, that is what reason does.

403
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,120
It follows the passions.

404
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,480
It doesn't lead them.

405
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,600
Now, reason is useful in describing the world.

406
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,880
That it can do, and it can do very well.

407
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,000
However, as we've seen in other parts of Hume's theory,

408
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,160
actually, a lot of that, what we think of as description

409
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,920
is really projection out of that world, causation,

410
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,000
necessity, a variety of other things,

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,960
even the notion of an object as a continuing thing.

412
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,840
That's something we are imposing on the world.

413
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
It's not there in the world itself.

414
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,440
Well, guess what?

415
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,280
Moral qualities are the same.

416
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,320
That's good, that's bad, that's wrong, that's right.

417
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,640
Those aren't found in the world.

418
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
They're things we're projecting onto the world.

419
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,800
And in all of those cases, the origin

420
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
is an internal impression, something

421
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,920
like the feeling of expectation in the case of causation

422
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,520
or necessity.

423
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,880
But in this case, the feeling of approval or disapproval,

424
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,640
the feeling of discomfort, or the feeling of pleasure

425
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,560
we get in contemplating an action of a certain kind.

426
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,960
So he says, there is in us something

427
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,560
that we could fairly call a moral sense.

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,360
That moral sense, that ability to have those right feelings.

429
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,000
We feel, we respond, saying, ah, I sense that that's wrong.

430
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,280
We no more have a reason for thinking that's wrong

431
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,800
than we have a reason for thinking

432
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,840
that's red, or green, or white, or black, or purple.

433
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,640
We just see it.

434
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
We have a sense.

435
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,320
He says, similarly, we have a moral sense,

436
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,240
a capacity for these feelings that constitute the basis

437
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,280
for our moral judgments.

438
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,080
That moral sense gives us the right kinds of sentiments.

439
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,360
Well, if the right kind, there's no explanation.

440
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,200
They're just part of human nature.

441
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,400
Morality is built on those sentiments,

442
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,000
and those sentiments taken together constitute a moral sense.

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,800
So when is something right?

444
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,520
When our moral sense approves it?

445
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,400
When is something wrong?

446
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
When our moral sense disapproves it?

447
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,320
There's nothing else to say.

448
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,920
There is really no reason.

449
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,880
It's a matter of sensation, or something like sensation,

450
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,760
not of reasoning about the world.
