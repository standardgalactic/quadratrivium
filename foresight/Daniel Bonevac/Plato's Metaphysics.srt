00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Hi. I want to talk to you today about Plato's metaphysics. Plato is perhaps the greatest

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,100
metaphysician of the Western tradition. Alfred North Whitehead once said that all Western

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,280
philosophy is really a series of footnotes to Plato. And it's this part of his doctrine

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,300
that he really had primarily in mind. Plato gives us a distinctive view, so distinctive

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,500
that actually this general kind of view, even today, tends to be known as Platonism. It's

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,460
often also called realism, but realism can mean different things. It's a specific kind

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,900
of realism. But Platonism is still recognized as one of the most common, one of the most

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,720
powerful, and even today, one of the most popular approaches to philosophy. So what

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,820
is Platonism, and how do we understand it? I have a separate video in which I talk about

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,300
the distinction between universals and particulars. But it's crucial to getting us going, so

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,240
I want to remind you of the general shape of that distinction. A universal is something

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,540
that can have multiple instances, but a particular cannot. So particulars are things that there's

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,820
only one of. You can't have multiple instances of them. I'm a good example. Dan Bonobat,

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,940
or any other person for that matter, is a particular. I'm a particular person. As you

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,220
could probably tell from this slide, I was talking in another course when I first made

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,580
it up about the beginnings of the First World War. So the other person I had in mind was

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,900
Gavrilo Principi, the guy who started the war by assassinating the Archduke. The Empire

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,860
State Building, or the Pericostinata Library, a particular beach ball, a particular watch,

19
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,860
this grain of sand, a particular city like Austin, or the state of Texas, or Sarajevo,

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,620
a particular date or time, an event like the assassination of the Archduke. All of those

21
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,380
are examples of particulars. You can't have a bunch of them. Even if you somehow cloned

22
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,180
me and produced a bunch of people who looked like me, they would all be copies of Dan Bonobat.

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,980
And you might joke and say, oh, now there are many Dan Bonobats. But actually, that would

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,220
turn that term into a kind term. There would still be just one of me. There would then

25
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,980
be a bunch of copies of me. So particulars, there's only one of them. They can't have

26
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,500
multiple instances. But a universal has multiple instances. You can find it all over the place.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,860
So here are some examples. There are properties like red, or triangular, or large. Relations

28
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,740
like being between, being on something, or loving someone, being friends with someone.

29
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,780
Relations like tiger, or building, pencil, shortstop. Some of these are natural kinds,

30
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,300
like tiger. You find them there in nature. Others are human artifacts, or socially defined,

31
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,420
like pencil or shortstop. There can be books, books like the Bible, or the novel, Edwin

32
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,860
Mulhouse. They're musical works, Lucanbach, Texas, or Box, Takata, and Fugue, and D Minor.

33
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,860
You can find many copies of those musical works. You might find sheet music. You might

34
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,700
find them in a sort of digital form. They might be on a record album. They might be

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,300
on a CD. I might start humming the tune. And I could sit down at the piano, maybe, and

36
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,100
start playing the Takata, and Fugue, and D Minor. Actually, it's an organ piece. I would

37
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,460
get into trouble because I wouldn't have pedals. But in any case, those are things that there

38
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:35,540
can be many, many different instances of. Well, there's nobody much doubts that particulars

39
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,540
are real. You and I exist in the world, if anything does. But are universals real? Well,

40
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,540
there are different attitudes about that. The realist says yes. Not only do they exist,

41
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,140
but they're mind independent. They're really, in some sense, out there. They're not just

42
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,020
concepts. The conceptualist says, I agree with you, they really exist. But I think they are

43
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,020
just concepts. I think they are really, in the end, dependent on the mind. The nominalist

44
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,260
says, I don't think they exist at all. There are no such things. Everything that exists

45
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,500
is a particular object. There is no such thing as humanity. There are simply particular people.

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,740
There's no such thing as the color red. They're just a bunch of red things. And so, the realist,

47
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,780
and as we'll see, Plato is the paradigmatic realist, says yes, they really are constituents

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,860
of the world. And they're really out there. They're not in here. They are real mind independent

49
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,660
constituents of the world.

50
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,700
Well, as I've said, he is the paradigmatic realist. He is the first one who says yes,

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,660
universals are crucial to understanding anything. And he calls them forms. These forms are these

52
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,100
mind independent universals. So, in the Republic, but also in a variety of other works, he lays

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,940
out what is known as Plato's theory of forms, trying to explain what they're like, what

54
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,860
access we have to them, how they make possible all sorts of things about our relationship

55
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,300
to the world.

56
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,540
Now why on earth would you think these forms exist? What's the point of them? Well, here

57
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,020
is his idea. And it's, at first glance, an odd idea. He says, look, there is a sense

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,420
in which the mind is turned in two different directions whenever I have a thought. I see

59
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,980
something that is a triangle, like that object that I've depicted here on the slide, and

60
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,140
I think this is a triangle. So take that little stop sign looking thing as a mind and that

61
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,740
little squiggle as a thought within that mind. The content is there in the little bubble.

62
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:45,980
This is a triangle. When I do that, I am recognizing that object I am perceiving as a triangle.

63
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,020
And so I am partly directed toward that object and perceiving it, but partly I am directed

64
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,700
toward triangularity. I'm recognizing it as an instance of triangularity as a triangle.

65
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,980
Well that means whenever I have a thought like that about an object, about a particular,

66
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,180
yes, my mind is directed toward the particular, but it's also directed toward that universal.

67
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,460
I am directed both toward that particular triangle and also I'm thinking about triangularity.

68
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,620
In fact, I am able to recognize that object, that particular, as a triangle because my

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:30,700
mind has some contact with or awareness of triangularity, the form. So abstractions like

70
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,900
the forms, universals, make it possible for me to have thoughts about particular objects.

71
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,540
I couldn't do it. I couldn't think about that as a triangle unless I already had some

72
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,620
awareness of triangularity. That is one crucial reason we think the forms exist.

73
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,740
Why, however, more broadly should we think they exist? In addition to my ability to recognize

74
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,860
things as triangles, as red, as human beings, and so on. There are different explanations he gives,

75
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,660
and I think they fall broadly speaking under five categories.

76
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,300
The forms enable me to think general thoughts. They enable me to recognize regularities about

77
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,780
the world, to recognize and characterize universal and necessary laws that govern the world.

78
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,940
They allow me to explain how it's possible for human beings to communicate and how it's possible

79
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,620
for them to mean anything at all with their thoughts and with their words. And finally,

80
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,580
it explains, well, what philosophers like to call veridicality, something like accuracy,

81
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,620
a question of our thoughts or our statements matching the world. So it's a question of truth,

82
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,620
of objectivity, of accuracy, of faithful representation of the world. The forms he thinks

83
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,420
explain all of that. And if we don't have the forms, then he says we're not going to be able to

84
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,060
think general thoughts. We won't be able to recognize laws or regularities. We won't be

85
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,860
able to communicate, and we'll have no basis for thinking there's such a thing as truth.

86
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,180
We'll have to become skeptics, or even worse than that, we'll simply have to say,

87
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,580
there's no such thing as truth. There's no such thing as communication. Really, in the end,

88
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,580
everybody has their own ideas. We're all confined in our own little worlds, incapable of interacting

89
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,060
meaningfully with anyone else. Let's turn to that first point. The forms make it possible for us

90
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,300
to think general thoughts. Here we can say the general thought, the general principle behind

91
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,620
this general thought argument is this. There must be something all Fs have in common by virtue of

92
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,100
which they are Fs, whatever F happens to be. So I see a herd of horses. Well, there's something

93
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,660
that those animals have in common. What is it? There must be something they have in common.

94
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,460
I call them all horses. What enables me to do that? Now, the nominalist is going to say,

95
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,740
I don't need any universals around. I can just look at those particular objects. And I see

96
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,780
they're similar. And so, hey, I introduce a term for them, horse. I use it for things that are

97
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:09,260
similar to things like that. But Plato says, wait a minute. Why are they similar? You're recognizing

98
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,900
they have something in common, right? But take that seriously. They have something in common

99
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,900
by virtue of which they are similar. Here's what they have in common. They're horses.

100
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,340
They exemplify the general kind, horse. And so what you're doing in recognizing that they're

101
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,300
similar and that you can apply the same term to them is that you're recognizing the universal that

102
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,300
is present in all those particular animals. So that's an example of that universal and

103
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,420
a contact with the universal making us making it possible for us to think that general thought.

104
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,420
The same would be true of cats. I see a variety of cats and I think, hey, they have something

105
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,700
in common. They're similar. I'll call them cats. What are they similar in what respect?

106
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:00,060
They're all cats. They have something in common. This is explicit even in the early dialogues.

107
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,740
In the Lockhees, which we talked about separately, for example, about courage,

108
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,980
Socrates says to Lockhees, I was asking about courage and cowardice in general.

109
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,300
I'll begin with courage and once more ask, what is that common quality,

110
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,380
which is the same in all these cases and which is called courage? Notice he's saying,

111
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,540
I'm looking for the thing they have in common. They're courageous people. They're courageous

112
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,460
actions. What do they have in common? There must be some common quality, some form of courage that

113
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,900
is present in all these courageous people in all these courageous actions. They are considered

114
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,580
similar and we call them all courageous for a reason. It's because they exemplify courage.

115
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,660
Okay, there is some quality they all have in common. So even in the early dialogue, Socrates

116
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,340
is already saying there has to be a universal present here. Tell me about that universal.

117
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,580
Don't tell me about particular cases or instances of courage, like standing and fighting and not

118
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,700
running away. Tell me about the universal. Tell me about that common quality. Universals,

119
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,740
we can find in all sorts of different places and sometimes they are abstract things like

120
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,740
triangularity or redness or kindness or courage. Other times they may be tied in some way to a

121
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:16,460
particular and that's quite possible. Let's return to the theme of thinking general thoughts.

122
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:22,700
I see a variety of trees, for example, and I think they are similar in some way. They have

123
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,340
something in common. Now it is not trivial what they have in common by any means. It's a hard

124
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,820
biological question what they have in common and there may be vague boundaries. I may say,

125
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,780
well, is this a bush or a tree? I don't know. In fact, things have started growing in my backyard

126
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,220
and I think I don't know what this is. Is this a weed? Is this a bush? Is this a tree? I let it go

127
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,740
and in several cases it's now a 40 or 50 foot tall tree. It wasn't really planned. It was just

128
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,940
this thing that started growing and well, let's see what it is. But in any case, that's something

129
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,460
that is a hard question, what exactly the nature of this thing is, but to notice they have something

130
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:04,140
in common is in a way to say, yeah, what is that thing? It is being a tree. It is something like

131
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:12,220
the universal of being a tree. And we can apply the same principle to other cases. So I see a

132
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,900
bunch of triangles. I think, huh, look at all those. Gee, they seem to have something in common.

133
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:24,300
And then I think, yes, there is something they have in common. They're all triangles. I recognize

134
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,020
triangularity there and that is what enables me to think of them as triangles.

135
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,740
Here is how Plato puts it. Don't you know that though they make use, they hear people doing

136
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,700
mathematics and specifically geometry, they make use of the visible forms and reason about them.

137
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,700
But they're thinking not of these, instead of the ideals they resemble, not of the figures they draw,

138
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,540
but of the absolute square and absolute diameter and so on. The forms they draw or make and which

139
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,180
have shadows and reflections and water of their own are converted by them into images. But they're

140
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,860
really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind.

141
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,660
Perhaps you've taken a geometry course and you've done things like this.

142
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,260
Somebody has written something on the blackboard. Let's say they've said, consider this triangle

143
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,500
and they've given you some information about it.

144
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:31,660
And then they say, prove that the triangle ABC, let's say, is a right triangle. In other words,

145
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,660
that this is a right angle. Well, here's one way you might think of it doing it. In fact,

146
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,820
my daughter at one point, when she was first learning geometry, was I showed that this is a

147
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,780
right triangle. She took out a protractor and said, see, it's a right triangle, 90 degrees.

148
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Well, that's not what geometry is about. It's not a question of this particular drawing I just made.

149
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,500
In fact, this is just a representation or an image of what we're really talking about,

150
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,580
a triangle with certain characteristics. And if I look at it carefully, I realize it's actually

151
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,820
a pretty sloppily drawn. For example, these two lines don't even meet. And this one sort of curves

152
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,140
there near the end and here they kind of crisscross. So you might say, well, actually, that's not even

153
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,820
a triangle. It's kind of close to being a triangle. But that shouldn't worry us, right? If the geometry

154
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,380
teacher writes this down and you say, I'm sorry, those two lines don't exactly meet. So it's not

155
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,580
a triangle. That's not an answer. We're not talking about this particular drawing. We're talking about

156
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,180
the abstract form. And so Plato says, if you doubt any of the rest of it, think about what

157
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,140
people are doing in mathematics in geometry, in other areas where they're talking about numbers,

158
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,620
let's say, or sets or functions or any kind of mathematical object. They are talking about

159
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,140
things that are abstract. They're not talking about something that is particular. You know,

160
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,780
if I'm talking about the number two, and I hold up my fingers like this, I'm not talking about

161
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,460
these two fingers in particular. I'm talking about the number two. And the same thing with this

162
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,820
triangle. I'm talking about something abstract, something that isn't just written down, but

163
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,340
instead is that form that can only be seen with the eye of the mind. Now, I think that's

164
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,300
an intriguing phrase, the eye of the mind. We're not talking here about what we see,

165
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,860
the individual people, or trees, or diagrams. We're talking about what we can only see with

166
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,740
the eye of the mind, the general kind, or the general property of being a tree, or being red,

167
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,980
or being a triangle of a certain kind. That's what's really at issue. We're thinking about

168
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,780
universals, in other words, not just particular drawings, or particular plants, or particular

169
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,060
colors, or instances of colored objects, or other things like that. We're not discussing

170
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:52,140
particulars. We're talking about something that lies behind them. His second argument is based

171
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:58,140
on regularities. We notice all sorts of regularities in the world, and we do it on the basis of

172
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,700
particulars, but we then abstract from those particulars to universals. It might be that the

173
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,980
world just looks like one thing after another to us, and it's all a jumbled mess, but eventually

174
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,580
we start making sense of it. Maybe we're children who are experiencing a severe thunderstorm for

175
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,620
the first time, lots of lightning, lots of thunder, and to us it's just chaos, lightning,

176
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,820
thunder going on, and it's just scary. But eventually we start noticing a pattern,

177
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:34,620
and we start thinking, wait, I think I can predict the next bout of thunder. I watch for the

178
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:41,020
lightning, and so I start realizing, wait, those flashes, that's lightning, those booms, that's

179
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,860
thunder, and hey, the thunder tends to follow the lightning, and so I recognize a regularity

180
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,140
that the lightning tends to produce the thunder, and so suddenly the storm starts having a pattern,

181
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,980
and recognizing that pattern, recognizing those regularities is possible because I can categorize

182
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:05,500
those flashes as a kind, as being reflections of a certain more universal type of thing,

183
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:12,700
lightning, and those booms as thunder, and then seeing a general connection between those universals.

184
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:19,900
So any regularity, any pattern is made possible by those abstract forms, those universals.

185
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,340
The same thing is true of laws. When I formulate a scientific law of any kind, I'm not talking

186
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,700
about this particular electrical circuit, for example, I'm talking about any circuit of that

187
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,860
kind. I'm talking about the universal pattern. If I'm thinking about Newton's laws and focusing on

188
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,380
F equals ma, for example, or looking at a mathematical law like the quadratic formula,

189
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,900
or thinking about something involving the reflection of light, or any other scientific law,

190
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,660
I'm thinking about the general universals here. I'm thinking about the relation between mass and

191
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,140
acceleration and force, for example, and it's not a question of that particular force and that

192
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,420
particular mass. It's not a question of, ah, yes, this chalk and the force I apply to it,

193
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,340
and it's rolling and accelerating away. No, I'm talking about the general kinds here.

194
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,180
I'm talking about something universal, and that's what gives it its universality and necessity.

195
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,740
If it weren't for that, it would just be life being one thing after another,

196
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,620
and the scientists would just say, yeah, a lot of stuff happens, I don't know.

197
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,340
We wouldn't be able to formulate regularities or laws. Communication is the same way.

198
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,020
What makes it possible for me to mean anything with my words, for my thoughts to have meaning,

199
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,860
for me to be able to communicate them to anyone else? Well, at first glance, this is hard, right?

200
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,820
I have some idea, and I'm trying to communicate it to you, but why should I think that's even

201
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,940
possible? Why should I think the words I'm using mean anything at all and will mean anything like

202
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,860
the same thing to you? Well, Plato says, look, without anything universal, I have no reason

203
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,180
to expect that. There are just particular thoughts in my head, particular sounds I make,

204
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,300
particular thoughts then in your head. Who knows? They don't really have anything in common,

205
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,820
so there's no way to talk about communication or meaning or that kind of transfer of knowledge

206
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:21,020
or information being possible. However, it is possible for two people to mean the same thing,

207
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,940
to think the same thought. Here's a silly example. He said it, meet us here at recess at the monkey

208
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:34,620
bar. Yeah, well, anyway, it is possible for people to misunderstand. We don't want to rule that out.

209
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,180
Sometimes we latch on to the wrong universal and grasp the wrong meaning, and it can happen even

210
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,540
with me myself. Me, earlier in the day, me later in the day, I might think, oh, I had a thought

211
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,380
about that this morning. What was it? And I might have trouble remembering or maybe I misremember.

212
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,900
So those problems of meaning and communication can happen within me at different times or in

213
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,980
different situations, maybe in one situation. I say something. Does it mean the same thing?

214
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,700
And do I remember it? Does it have the same significance? Can I communicate when I'm in a

215
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,180
different situation? Well, intuitively, we want to say, yeah, there can be problems here, but

216
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,820
overall, yes, I can mean the same thing that I meant this morning. I can remember and think

217
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,700
the same thought I thought this morning. I would think the same thought and give you the same

218
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,900
lecture on Play-Doh, even if it were a different day of the week. And so I might say, look, it

219
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,740
should be independent of all that, or at least it's possible for it to be independent of all that.

220
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,940
But if so, then meaning isn't tied to particular objects. Neither is the possibility of communication.

221
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:44,060
They depend on something universal. How does that go? Well, I must latch on to universal. If I say

222
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:50,860
this is a triangle, then what I'm doing is linking not just to this particular diagram I've drawn,

223
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:57,100
for example, but to triangularity itself. When you understand what I mean and say, oh, yes,

224
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:03,340
that is a triangle, you are recognizing this as a triangle because you have grasp of the same

225
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:10,540
universal triangularity. And so if you want to think of it this way, here you are thinking about this.

226
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:19,820
Here I am. We've got two different thoughts going on here. And both of us are thinking, hey, triangle.

227
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,820
But what enables our thoughts to have that significance? And how do we know that we're

228
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,700
thinking anything in common? Answer is, our thoughts must be connected to something like

229
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,820
this universal of triangularity that ties into the contents of our thought. And without that,

230
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,580
he says, look, just something happens in my mind. Something happens in your mind. We have no reason

231
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,380
to expect them to have anything in common or to tie to anything about this particular diagram.

232
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:57,180
But if there is a universal, then it's possible for it to not only be present in this individual

233
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,020
diagram, but it's possible for our thoughts to latch onto it. So if it's possible for us to mean

234
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,980
anything at all, to communicate even with ourselves at a different time or a different situation,

235
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,420
not to mention other people, it must be the case that we can latch onto these universals to

236
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,820
something outside my mind or your mind that enables us to think the same thought, to communicate

237
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,740
the same thing, to mean the same thing by our words. If that's not possible, it looks like

238
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,500
meaning and communication aren't possible either. Finally, this explains how we can have

239
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,820
accurate thoughts, how things we say can be true, how they can be objective truths about the world.

240
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,220
It really relates to the diagram that I was just drawing. The triangularity is not only

241
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,180
something that is in some sense present in my thoughts and in your thoughts when we communicate

242
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,780
about it, and both think of this as a triangle. It's there in the diagram itself. That diagram,

243
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:05,260
as Plato puts it, participates in triangularity. So when I say something true, I'm saying something

244
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,700
that links to a universal that really is there in the world. That particular really is exemplifying

245
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,820
that universal. The diagram here is a diagram of a triangle, and you and I recognize it as a triangle,

246
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,300
and in getting that right, in having veridical thoughts, that is to say, and in having true

247
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:31,660
statements, this is a triangle, then what's going on here is, well, we are tied into the very form

248
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,980
that is in some sense present in that drawing. This is the relationship sometimes described as

249
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:46,140
participation or exemplification. That diagram is a triangle. It exhibits triangularity. It

250
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,460
participates in triangularity, and it's that participation, that link between the particular

251
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,220
and the universal that makes it possible for me to have knowledge, makes it possible for you and I

252
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,340
to think the same thought, makes it possible for us to get things right about the world.

253
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,820
Otherwise, I have no reason to think my thoughts have anything to do with the world,

254
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,580
and that anything like accuracy, truth, objectivity are possible. But if those same universals

255
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:20,780
can be present in my thoughts and in a different sense in the world, then I can explain this.

256
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:28,620
So Plato's philosophy of mind gives us this picture of the mind as directed in two ways,

257
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:34,940
toward the object, in particular, through perception, for example, and also toward the form.

258
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,100
The content of my thought is linked to the form, my perception, and that representation in my mind

259
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,980
is linked to the form, but the object is linked to it too. And when they link to the same form,

260
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,860
that's when I've got accuracy. That's when I say something true, it's when my thoughts

261
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,140
are veridical or correct representations of the world. But of course, there is a problem here.

262
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,980
We don't perceive the forms. We don't directly see triangularity, for example,

263
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,020
or humanity. We see particular people in particular triangles. If that's true,

264
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,140
how do we know anything about them? Aristotle's answer is we abstract the universals and our

265
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,500
knowledge of universals from the particulars. But Plato says that won't do at all. I recognize that

266
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,100
as a triangle because I already understand triangularity. I can't in some way see a bunch

267
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,260
of triangles and then abstract the idea of triangularity. I've got to first recognize

268
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,500
they have something in common, namely being triangles. So he gives us two answers in different

269
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,340
dialogues. One answer is I recall it. And he tells us a sort of beautiful mythical story

270
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,420
about the soul being in contact with the realm of forms before we were even born.

271
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,100
We forget about that at birth, but we can be reminded by contact with particulars.

272
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:56,220
The other story is about the form of the good. He ends up saying that I am impelled toward the good

273
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,420
by, well, what exactly? I'm not sure, but in some way the form of the good

274
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:10,060
illumines the entire realm of forms for me. And so once that happens, the good somehow shines a

275
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:16,140
light on my mind and makes it possible for me to recognize these forms through recollection,

276
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,100
or in some other way with what he calls the eye of the mind.

277
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:28,700
Now, is that a plausible account? Well, maybe. There is a problem here. We seem to be limited

278
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,300
in our causal contact to the realm of the senses. So how is it possible for us to have

279
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,940
knowledge of something that lies beyond the senses of this realm of universals of forms

280
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,460
that are not directly present to the senses? It looks as if I can't make sense of the world

281
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,620
and my own thinking about the world and my own communicating about it, unless I assume there are

282
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,980
such universals. But how do I know anything about them? How does that solve the problem exactly?

283
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,340
Surely then I must have some special faculty of knowledge. So it looks as if Plato has to

284
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,820
postulate some special faculty of knowledge, saying I really do have not only my physical eyes

285
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,460
that can perceive things through the senses, I have something like an eye of the mind

286
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,020
that can think about triangularity or humanity or being a tree or something else that is strictly

287
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:24,140
universal and not directly tied to particular objects. In fact, I can then make up new universals

288
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,860
that I've never seen exemplified in a particular once I've mastered a certain number of these

289
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,020
universals. But how is that possible? That becomes a difficult philosophical question

290
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:43,580
and occupies plateness for centuries to come.
