00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Hi, I'm going to talk to you today about Hume's method.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.840
Hume is an empiricist par excellence.

00:12.840 --> 00:19.320
Locke, you might say, is one of those philosophers who has an idea, in theory of knowledge, empiricism,

00:19.320 --> 00:23.440
but he's trying to combine that with all sorts of other insights, and so he, for example,

00:23.440 --> 00:25.600
tries to prove the existence of God.

00:25.600 --> 00:31.560
He talks unapologetically about powers, about capacities, about causation.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.720
He does a variety of other things that later empiricists have thought are dubious things

00:35.720 --> 00:37.220
to do.

00:37.220 --> 00:41.960
He develops an extensive political philosophy and other works where he talks about obligations

00:41.960 --> 00:46.720
and rights, and a variety of other things that it's rather hard to reconcile with his

00:46.720 --> 00:49.520
empiricist foundations.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.600
Hume is not like that.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.680
If Locke is somebody who is combining a bunch of different insights about a bunch of different

00:54.680 --> 01:00.240
areas and trying to make them fit together in a complex philosophical framework, Hume

01:00.240 --> 01:02.120
is somebody who has one idea.

01:02.120 --> 01:07.000
He takes over that idea from Locke of empiricism, and he says, I'm going to pursue that to

01:07.000 --> 01:09.520
a bitter end, and that's what he does.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.340
So he finds out that all sorts of things have to be rethought.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.900
He doesn't take anything like our common sense conception of causation or obligation

01:16.900 --> 01:23.080
or rights or anything else, really, and say, somehow we have to build that into the empiricist

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
framework.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
Locke's mission.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.180
Hume instead develops a method and says it either fits or it doesn't, and if it doesn't

01:29.180 --> 01:30.880
fit, out with it.

01:30.880 --> 01:37.640
So Hume is going to interpret empiricism rather differently, even though you might say, look,

01:37.640 --> 01:42.560
his method is basically just Locke's, yes, but used in a rather different way.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.520
So his classic work is a treatise of human nature, and there is my well-loved copy of

01:48.520 --> 01:49.520
it.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.400
Hume wrote that when he was only 23 years old.

01:52.400 --> 01:57.040
That's a remarkable masterpiece for someone who was so young.

01:57.040 --> 02:02.640
Later he wrote a small book, The Inquiry, which was meant to summarize and publicize

02:02.640 --> 02:03.720
this.

02:03.720 --> 02:08.720
He wrote it with great expectations of having produced a great philosophical work, but then,

02:08.720 --> 02:12.240
as he put it later, it fell stillborn from the press.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.120
It didn't attract much attention.

02:14.120 --> 02:19.080
Nobody paid any real attention to it at all, even to refute it, and it took a long time

02:19.080 --> 02:22.880
for Hume to be recognized as a great philosopher.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.640
Even throughout the 19th century, he would have been viewed as somebody notable, but

02:26.640 --> 02:29.240
not one of the true philosophical greats.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.120
Whereas on the contemporary scene in England and the United States, Australia, New Zealand,

02:34.120 --> 02:38.760
in short, in the English-speaking world, he's viewed as one of the most important philosophers

02:38.760 --> 02:44.360
in history, and a treatise of human nature is now viewed as one of the greatest philosophical

02:44.360 --> 02:46.880
classics.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.920
With Hume outlines his method there, and we've talked about some of the basic elements, so

02:50.920 --> 02:55.520
I'm going to review them here just to remind you, because they're crucial to understanding

02:55.520 --> 02:58.800
where that method is coming from and how it's being used.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.600
They're simple and complex ideas.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.320
The complex ideas are built out of the simple ideas, and they come from simple impressions.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.200
Moreover, they represent them exactly.

03:08.200 --> 03:12.700
We build more complex ideas, often we stray very far from experience, and maybe from any

03:12.700 --> 03:19.020
content at all, but at the level of the simple ideas, we've got a direct and exact match

03:19.020 --> 03:20.780
to simple impressions.

03:20.780 --> 03:24.660
So Hume says all our simple ideas in their first appearance have derived from simple

03:24.660 --> 03:30.140
impressions, which are corresponded to them and which they exactly represent.

03:30.140 --> 03:36.580
Those simple impressions are things that Locke would have referred to as sensations, or reflections,

03:36.580 --> 03:40.860
that is to say, awarenesses of our own mental states.

03:40.860 --> 03:46.140
This method, as we've seen, is to take things we think we know, but might just turn out

03:46.140 --> 03:50.660
to be faith, or opinion, or even superstition, and try to figure out whether those beliefs

03:50.660 --> 03:54.100
count as knowledge by tracing them back to their origins.

03:54.100 --> 04:00.060
We trace the ideas that are part of that knowledge, or belief, and go back to where

04:00.060 --> 04:01.460
we got those ideas.

04:01.460 --> 04:06.780
We trace them to the origins and experience to find out whether this really counts as

04:06.780 --> 04:11.340
knowledge, whether we have good evidence for our beliefs, whether any of those would

04:11.340 --> 04:13.220
count as certain, and so on.

04:13.220 --> 04:18.380
We want to understand which ones are really just opinion and which ones are knowledge.

04:18.380 --> 04:22.420
Well, the empiricist method in general is inspired by that.

04:22.420 --> 04:27.900
We take complex ideas, we examine the simple ideas they're made of, we find the origins

04:27.900 --> 04:33.540
of those simple ideas and the simple impressions and experience that they come from, and here's

04:33.540 --> 04:40.580
the idea, the content of the idea lies in those simple impressions from which it comes.

04:40.580 --> 04:46.820
So we trace things back to what it, well, what gave rise to it, what it popped out of

04:46.820 --> 04:49.060
in experience.

04:49.060 --> 04:52.180
But there is a complication, even at that basic level.

04:52.180 --> 04:56.820
It's partly because we abstract, combine, negate, disjoin, and do all sorts of other

04:56.820 --> 05:00.300
things with our ideas that we can diverge far from reality.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.620
But it's not only that.

05:01.620 --> 05:07.620
There are other problems as well, because our ideas are weak in comparison with impressions.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.420
Even the simple ideas are weak in comparison with the impression itself, even though there's

05:12.420 --> 05:13.420
the same content.

05:13.420 --> 05:18.380
The content matches exactly, but the force and the vacity, as Hume puts it, are very

05:18.380 --> 05:19.380
different.

05:19.380 --> 05:25.380
He says all ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure.

05:25.380 --> 05:27.460
The mind has but a slender hold of them.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.260
There have to be confounded with other resembling ideas.

05:30.260 --> 05:33.740
And when we have often employed any term, though without a distinct meaning, we're

05:33.740 --> 05:37.460
up to imagine it has a determinate idea next to it.

05:37.460 --> 05:41.020
So ideas are relatively faint, obscure, or weak.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.780
And that's true even at the relatively simple level.

05:43.780 --> 05:48.060
If we think about ideas of colors, those ideas are fairly weak.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.940
If I show you the impressions, it's easy to tell them apart.

05:51.940 --> 05:55.460
I might show you two different shades of paint I'm considering.

05:55.460 --> 06:00.100
And when I hold the paint patches up, you can very clearly discern the difference between

06:00.100 --> 06:00.940
them.

06:00.940 --> 06:04.540
And the impression, the sensation is very strong, it's very vivid.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.060
You see that they're different.

06:06.060 --> 06:10.060
But now, you forget their names, you go back to the paint store and you say, well, I know

06:10.060 --> 06:13.220
I like that one better than the other.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.900
But which one was it?

06:14.900 --> 06:19.900
And you go and you look at the chart now and you say, maybe you have luckily the same thought,

06:19.900 --> 06:21.660
but maybe there's no chart.

06:21.660 --> 06:24.820
Maybe the guy at the paint store says, well, I'm sorry, we're all out of charts, but what

06:24.820 --> 06:27.100
was the name of the paint?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.580
And you suddenly go, I don't remember.

06:29.580 --> 06:31.060
And you try to call it up your mind.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.180
He says, well, was it this one?

06:34.180 --> 06:35.660
I don't know.

06:35.660 --> 06:38.180
I have the idea of that color.

06:38.180 --> 06:43.900
Maybe I can do remember the name or something like it, but the problem is I can't now distinguish

06:43.900 --> 06:44.900
it.

06:44.900 --> 06:50.420
If somebody says, yeah, all these things got mixed up and they're all mislabeled.

06:50.420 --> 06:54.220
So is it this or is it that?

06:54.220 --> 06:55.300
You may not know.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.380
And maybe you've seen it, but maybe you no longer remember it.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.860
The idea is weak in comparison with the impression.

07:00.860 --> 07:03.580
The content's the same, but it lacks the same force.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.260
It lacks the same velocity.

07:05.260 --> 07:08.060
Well, impressions in contrast are strong.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.660
When you're right there looking at the chip of paint, it's very prominent to you, right?

07:11.660 --> 07:12.660
It's very strong.

07:12.660 --> 07:17.340
It hits you hard as a word mentally, whereas the idea, the memory of it and so on, that's

07:17.340 --> 07:19.140
much weaker.

07:19.140 --> 07:24.980
So Hume says all impressions, all sensations, either outward or inward are strong and vivid.

07:24.980 --> 07:28.060
The limits between there are more exactly determined.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.060
Or is it easy to fall into any error or mistake in regard to them?

07:31.060 --> 07:35.620
I can tell the difference between the paint chips when I'm looking at them directly, but

07:35.620 --> 07:40.660
trying to remember them later or just saying, okay, I remember one was called Belgian chocolate

07:40.660 --> 07:47.180
and the other was called German chocolate and which was which and which one did I like

07:47.180 --> 07:51.060
better and what exactly did that German chocolate thing look like?

07:51.060 --> 07:53.660
I may not be able to remember that.

07:53.660 --> 07:58.740
Well Hume's method then is to say, if I want to understand the content of my ideas, I have

07:58.740 --> 08:00.140
to go back to the impressions.

08:00.140 --> 08:04.300
I have to go back to what they come from in experience.

08:04.300 --> 08:08.460
Now in the case of a paint color, all right, that's not too hard.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.580
I know what impression that came from.

08:10.580 --> 08:11.860
And so I can go back to that.

08:11.860 --> 08:15.700
I know the idea was a content and not where, yeah, you're just making up that German chocolate

08:15.700 --> 08:16.700
thing.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
No, no, no, I saw the chip.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.940
I know, I saw it.

08:18.940 --> 08:22.940
I may not remember now exactly what it looks like, but I know I saw it.

08:22.940 --> 08:26.140
But a lot of more abstract ideas are not like that.

08:26.140 --> 08:30.060
A few years ago, somebody came and gave a talk in the English department.

08:30.060 --> 08:34.540
And the main concept of their talk was the concept of hegemony.

08:34.540 --> 08:39.700
There was an older professor in the audience who heard the talk and stood up at the end

08:39.700 --> 08:44.460
to ask a question and said, I have a very simple basic question.

08:44.460 --> 08:47.380
What is hegemony?

08:47.380 --> 08:51.300
And the speaker didn't know how to answer that, didn't know how to give a definition.

08:51.300 --> 08:56.180
And that's one of those things where you might say, well, okay, a lot of academic discourse

08:56.180 --> 08:57.180
is like that.

08:57.180 --> 09:02.020
A lot of things that go on in the university involve terms that are very abstract, very

09:02.020 --> 09:03.980
far removed from experience.

09:03.980 --> 09:07.820
It's not at all like, oh, that German chocolate color I saw at the Sherwin-Williams store.

09:07.820 --> 09:10.100
No, it's like something else.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.100
It is much more abstract.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.540
And you might think, wait, what is the content?

09:13.540 --> 09:14.540
I don't know.

09:14.540 --> 09:19.100
Here's somebody who had written a doctoral dissertation on it and couldn't give a definition.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.540
And so you might think, well, wait a minute.

09:20.540 --> 09:24.820
I mean, if that person doesn't know what the content is, how am I supposed to know what

09:24.820 --> 09:25.820
the content is?

09:25.820 --> 09:30.860
Now, that's not to say that particular concept or any other particular concept is meaningless

09:30.860 --> 09:33.460
or contradictory or absurd or anything.

09:33.460 --> 09:38.060
But humans say, look, it's super easy in that kind of abstract discourse to start talking

09:38.060 --> 09:42.300
about things without really having a clear idea of what you're talking about, to use

09:42.300 --> 09:47.500
terms without any ideas that are so vague, we have no idea what their content is.

09:47.500 --> 09:51.420
So to understand this kind of thing, we have to trace it back.

09:51.420 --> 09:57.780
Now, a lot of early analytic philosophers inspired by Hume thought that philosophers

09:57.780 --> 10:02.700
of their era, and often they were idealists, personalists, for example, around the turn

10:02.700 --> 10:03.940
of the century.

10:03.940 --> 10:08.940
Or people like Heidegger, they attacked us using all sorts of meaningless concepts.

10:08.940 --> 10:14.380
And indeed, a lot of those philosophers say things that are rather bizarre, absolute idealists

10:14.380 --> 10:20.220
around the turn of the century were fond of talking about a world's soul, a soul of

10:20.220 --> 10:23.260
a person that's already hard enough, but a soul of the world?

10:23.260 --> 10:24.900
What does that mean?

10:24.900 --> 10:27.340
What content could that possibly have?

10:27.340 --> 10:31.540
Or Heidegger talks about nothingness, the nothing, as if that's an object.

10:31.540 --> 10:35.100
I mean, what do you mean the nothing?

10:35.100 --> 10:36.620
That's very strange.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.660
Heidegger talks about the horizon.

10:38.660 --> 10:43.860
Well, I think that actually does have a precise meaning, but it's not obvious what it is.

10:43.860 --> 10:49.340
And so the analytic philosophers, look, I have a shirt.

10:49.340 --> 10:52.300
I might have a personality, but do I have a horizon?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.900
I don't know.

10:53.900 --> 10:58.020
And he didn't mean, by the way, the physical horizon of where the earth meets the sky.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.860
He meant something much more abstract.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.220
So in short, you might say, I don't know what content these things have.

11:03.220 --> 11:07.940
If they do have a content, I want to trace that back to experience.

11:07.940 --> 11:13.780
So Hume often entertains a suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about.

11:13.820 --> 11:17.860
And he says, when that happens, when we entertain any suspicion that a philosophical term is

11:17.860 --> 11:23.780
employed without any meaning or idea, as is but too frequent, we need but inquire from

11:23.780 --> 11:27.860
what impression is that supposed idea derived?

11:27.860 --> 11:32.260
And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion.

11:32.260 --> 11:36.980
By bringing ideas into so clear a light, we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute,

11:36.980 --> 11:40.940
which may arise concerning their nature and reality.

11:40.940 --> 11:46.100
So if somebody starts talking about some abstract idea, whether it's the nothing or

11:46.100 --> 11:53.700
the horizon or hegemony or the world soul, Hume says, all right, look, from what impression

11:53.700 --> 11:54.700
is this derived?

11:54.700 --> 11:57.340
Okay, tell me what an experience generates this.

11:57.340 --> 12:00.260
You've got an idea of a world soul?

12:00.260 --> 12:03.620
Well, what do you mean?

12:03.620 --> 12:04.620
Where'd you get that idea?

12:04.620 --> 12:10.820
So maybe, well, I studied Neoplatonism, well, where'd the Neoplatonists get that idea?

12:10.820 --> 12:12.980
Come on, I mean, what do you mean?

12:12.980 --> 12:16.380
It's hard enough to figure out what a soul of a human being would be.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.100
I don't know what this even means.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.460
So where's the impression?

12:19.460 --> 12:21.700
What are you talking about in the end?

12:21.700 --> 12:26.020
And later, pragmatists will adapt this to their own purposes, as we'll see, and start

12:26.020 --> 12:27.860
talking about the cash value of an idea.

12:27.860 --> 12:30.060
What difference does it make to practice?

12:30.060 --> 12:32.940
Say there is a world soul, or say there isn't, who cares?

12:32.940 --> 12:34.540
What difference does it make?

12:34.540 --> 12:38.500
And you might say something similar here, but Hume means something more specific, not

12:38.500 --> 12:41.120
just what difference does it make in practical terms.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.740
He means trace it back.

12:42.740 --> 12:45.220
Where inexperience did this come from?

12:45.220 --> 12:49.260
And if you just made it up out of thin air without an experience to back it up to give

12:49.260 --> 12:52.580
it content, I'm going to say it has no content.

12:52.580 --> 12:55.500
Maybe of course it will turn out it has a content that's very different from what you

12:55.500 --> 12:56.500
think it is.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
You've lost the thread.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.740
And so, yeah, it did mean something, but you know what?

13:00.740 --> 13:04.380
That makes everything you're saying absurd, if that's the meaning of it.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.380
So we've got to watch out for both things.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.020
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.580
Maybe it means something really different, and you're misusing it.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.500
Well Hume's method then is this.

13:14.500 --> 13:18.340
We take our ideas and we're trying to figure out which ones are adequate, which ones actually

13:18.340 --> 13:20.180
match experience.

13:20.180 --> 13:24.340
So we trace them back to their simple impressions from which they're derived.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.780
That's their real content.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.860
Sometimes it will turn out we can't do it.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.380
There is no real impression underlying this.

13:31.380 --> 13:35.260
And so we end up saying this is just, you know, and maybe with world soul that's what's

13:35.260 --> 13:36.260
going on.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.300
There just is no content to that.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.060
There is no impression underlying it.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.060
We said, meaningless.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.660
It doesn't mean anything at all.

13:43.660 --> 13:45.420
Sometimes maybe it's contradictory.

13:45.420 --> 13:49.660
We take apart the idea and we find out in the end it's not that it doesn't have any

13:49.660 --> 13:51.340
corresponding impression.

13:51.340 --> 13:54.220
It's that it has corresponding impressions that clash.

13:54.220 --> 13:56.820
So in the end it looks like, gosh, it has a content.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.540
But the content is sort of like round square.

13:59.540 --> 14:01.500
It's something that is itself contradictory.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.660
It makes no sense.

14:03.660 --> 14:06.700
Sometimes it will turn out it does have a content, but it's not what we thought.

14:06.700 --> 14:10.180
And so much of what we're saying about it turns out to be false.

14:10.180 --> 14:14.380
So Hume will say, look at things like this, especially when you start entertaining this

14:14.380 --> 14:17.100
suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.500
Say, look, what are you talking about?

14:19.500 --> 14:22.300
Sometimes it's going to turn out to be nothing.

14:22.300 --> 14:26.900
Sometimes it will be, well, something, but completely incoherent and contradictory.

14:26.900 --> 14:31.220
Sometimes it just will be something surprising that isn't what they seem to be talking about

14:31.220 --> 14:33.900
at all.

14:33.900 --> 14:39.060
I want to go back to remind us quickly of what an empiricist thinks, because it brings out

14:39.060 --> 14:41.900
another aspect of the method.

14:41.900 --> 14:47.860
The question between judgment empiricists and judgment rationalists is the question of synthetic

14:47.860 --> 14:49.620
a priori judgment.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.420
Those other three categories everybody agrees about.

14:52.420 --> 14:56.620
There are things that are analytic and a priori, synthetic and a posteriori.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.460
Nobody thinks there's anything that's analytic and a posteriori.

14:59.460 --> 15:03.220
The question is whether there can be anything that is synthetic a priori.

15:03.220 --> 15:07.140
Something that's synthetic truly about the world and not just about language, but on

15:07.140 --> 15:12.460
the other hand a priori, knowable independently of experience of the world.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.500
The empiricist says, well, obviously not.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.700
How could you know what the world without having experience of the world?

15:17.700 --> 15:19.540
But the rationalist says, you can.

15:19.540 --> 15:23.460
You can through reason alone, through reflection, through thought experiments, through things

15:23.460 --> 15:25.100
like that.

15:25.540 --> 15:31.500
The judgment empiricist says, yeah, I'm not going to believe that I can get anywhere purely

15:31.500 --> 15:36.940
by examining my own mind purely through this idea of thought experiments and so on.

15:36.940 --> 15:40.500
All that does is tell me about the relations of ideas inside my mind.

15:40.500 --> 15:44.740
It doesn't take me outside my mind to the world.

15:44.740 --> 15:49.420
That implies that from an empiricist point of view, there are only two kinds of knowledge.

15:49.420 --> 15:54.700
All knowledge, assuming that there is any content at all to what somebody claims to know, it's

15:54.700 --> 15:57.260
got to go back to one of those two categories.

15:57.260 --> 16:01.820
It's got to be either analytic and a priori or synthetic and a posteriori.

16:01.820 --> 16:06.340
Either it's an empirical truth about the world as natural sciences, that's the synthetic

16:06.340 --> 16:12.940
a posteriori part, or it's analytic a priori in the sense that it is purely verbal, purely

16:12.940 --> 16:18.100
a matter of logic, but in that way doesn't tell us anything directly about the world,

16:18.100 --> 16:21.660
but still it's something knowable independently of experience.

16:21.660 --> 16:24.700
Lots of things are like that from an empiricist point of view, at least from the point of

16:24.700 --> 16:31.220
view of Hume and many other empiricists, logic is like that, knowledge on the basis of definitions

16:31.220 --> 16:33.860
is like that, mathematics is like that.

16:33.860 --> 16:38.780
So I can know that a bachelor is a bachelor, or that a bachelor is unmarried, or that one

16:38.780 --> 16:41.980
plus one is two, purely on the basis of definitions.

16:41.980 --> 16:45.980
I don't need experience of the world because they're not really about the world.

16:45.980 --> 16:50.220
But anything that really is about the world, like there are more than a dozen chairs in

16:50.220 --> 16:52.780
this room, that requires experience.

16:52.780 --> 16:58.540
I can't know that just by reflecting on chairs and rooms, I have to actually have experience

16:58.540 --> 17:00.060
of the room.

17:00.060 --> 17:04.060
And that means that's synthetic and a posteriori.

17:04.060 --> 17:08.180
I need experience to gain that knowledge of the world.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.420
So there are two kinds of knowledge.

17:10.420 --> 17:14.540
Basically there's a kind of knowledge you find in logic, in definitions, in mathematics,

17:14.540 --> 17:18.740
in dictionaries, there's the kind of knowledge you find in natural science, history and other

17:18.780 --> 17:23.180
things that are really describing the world on the basis of experience.

17:23.180 --> 17:25.220
That's it, there's nothing else.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.100
So what does that exclude?

17:27.100 --> 17:31.780
Well we might take a look at various things that rationalists have called synthetic a priori

17:31.780 --> 17:32.780
truths.

17:32.780 --> 17:36.740
We've looked at this list before, so I'll just remind you a little bit of the kind

17:36.740 --> 17:37.740
of thing here.

17:37.740 --> 17:41.620
Avicenna talks about the whole being greater than the parts, or things equal to the same

17:41.620 --> 17:43.220
thing being equal to each other.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.860
For Descartes, I think, I am.

17:45.860 --> 17:47.260
Nothing's made from nothing.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.860
What's been done can't be undone.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.460
Nothing could be and not be at the same time.

17:52.460 --> 17:57.780
Could exist and not exist at the same time, but also, for example, could not be red and

17:57.780 --> 18:01.180
green all over at the same time.

18:01.180 --> 18:05.860
Leibniz, no fact without a sufficient reason why it should be so and not otherwise.

18:05.860 --> 18:08.180
Kant, every event has a cause.

18:08.180 --> 18:12.300
Seven plus five is twelve and every other mathematical truth, including the truths of

18:12.300 --> 18:16.780
geometry, like between any two points lies one and only one line.

18:16.780 --> 18:20.740
All of those are examples of synthetic a priori truths, and of course philosophers have

18:20.740 --> 18:22.620
had their candidates, too.

18:22.620 --> 18:27.500
Things like God exists, the soul is immortal, the world consists of substances and attributes,

18:27.500 --> 18:32.700
the will is free, every substance has an essence, you ought to seek the good, happiness is intrinsically

18:32.700 --> 18:35.860
good, courage is a virtue, and so on.

18:35.860 --> 18:40.900
Well, if we take a look at all of these, you've says, and examine them and try to understand

18:40.900 --> 18:45.900
where they're coming from and whether they're legitimate, we only have a few choices.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.820
So he gives us a test for nonsense.

18:49.820 --> 18:55.260
Hume says, when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make?

18:55.260 --> 18:59.820
If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us

18:59.820 --> 19:04.660
ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?

19:04.660 --> 19:05.660
No.

19:05.660 --> 19:10.060
Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?

19:10.060 --> 19:11.060
No.

19:11.060 --> 19:16.580
Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

19:16.580 --> 19:19.500
So Hume is saying something rather remarkable here.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.020
Commit it to the flames.

19:21.020 --> 19:25.020
Either it's got abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number, in other words, it's got

19:25.020 --> 19:29.540
logic and mathematics in it, in which case it's knowledge, it's analytic, it's not really

19:29.540 --> 19:34.940
knowledge of the world, but it may be highly useful anyway, or what about experimental reasoning

19:34.940 --> 19:37.500
concerning matter of fact and existence?

19:37.500 --> 19:38.500
That's highly useful.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.940
That's what natural science is in a different way.

19:40.940 --> 19:44.300
It's what history is, political sciences, economics is, and so on.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.940
All of those are really expressing truths about the world.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.580
Don't think of experimental here as just within a laboratory.

19:51.580 --> 19:55.740
Really it's a question of matters of fact about the world.

19:55.740 --> 19:57.340
That's fine too.

19:57.340 --> 20:00.220
But there are all sorts of other things that aren't like that.

20:00.220 --> 20:04.300
So let's run down that list and find out what we do with them.

20:04.300 --> 20:10.300
Nothing has to be classified as either analytic or synthetic, or as utterly meaningless.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.300
So we look through.

20:11.300 --> 20:15.780
As empiricists, the whole is greater than its parts, almost certainly Hume would say,

20:15.780 --> 20:16.780
that's analytic.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.700
It's just a question of the meaning of whole in part.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.740
Things equal to the same thing or equal to each other.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.740
He said that's part of the meaning of equality, analytic.

20:25.740 --> 20:27.380
Nothing's made from nothing.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.700
Now that seems to be a claim about the world.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.820
Nothing just pops into existence.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.460
Nothing is made out of nothing.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.500
Things have to be made out of other things.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.980
If I'm going to have a factory that is going to produce some object, I've got to have inputs

20:39.980 --> 20:40.980
to my factory.

20:40.980 --> 20:45.140
I can't just say, Alakazam, and poof, it goes out of nothing.

20:45.140 --> 20:47.020
But that seems like a claim about the world.

20:47.020 --> 20:53.500
There's no conceptual absurdity about a magician or a wizard suddenly creating something out

20:53.500 --> 20:54.860
of thin air.

20:54.860 --> 20:55.860
Could happen.

20:55.860 --> 20:59.060
It's not incoherent in the sense of being logically contradictory.

20:59.060 --> 21:02.540
So it's not an analytic truth that nothing is made from nothing.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.300
It's a claim about the world.

21:04.300 --> 21:08.660
So humans say, well, but look, it's pretty darn well established, right?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.780
It's on the basis of experience.

21:10.780 --> 21:13.500
We say that things don't just pop out of thin air.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.900
Things are made out of other things.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.660
It's impossible for anything to be and not be at the same time.

21:18.660 --> 21:23.940
Well, be and not be, it's part of the meaning of negation, that that's true, he would say.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.120
What's been done can't be undone.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.300
That seems to be a claim about the world.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.260
After all, I can erase what I've written on a page.

21:31.260 --> 21:34.180
Here we mean really go back into the past.

21:34.180 --> 21:37.500
It's something like saying time travel is impossible.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.860
Well, that's a claim about the world.

21:40.860 --> 21:44.420
That's not just an analytic truth, and it can't be anything else.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.540
It's a factual claim about the world.

21:46.540 --> 21:47.540
Might turn out to be true.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.140
Might turn out to be false.

21:49.140 --> 21:53.500
Kurt Girdle showed that there are actually circular time loops that are consistent with

21:53.500 --> 21:55.780
the axioms of general relativity.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.540
So who knows?

21:57.540 --> 21:59.340
Every event has a cause.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.780
Similarly, that's a claim about the world.

22:01.780 --> 22:02.780
Might turn out to be true.

22:02.780 --> 22:08.860
Might turn out to be false if there are truly random events in quantum mechanics, for example.

22:08.860 --> 22:13.540
But then we turn to the philosophical ones, and now Hume says, look, a lot of these might

22:13.540 --> 22:15.460
turn out to be meaningless.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.460
God exists.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.460
That's surely not analytic.

22:17.460 --> 22:19.140
It's a claim about the world.

22:19.140 --> 22:21.620
Might be true or false about the world.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.460
And does it even have a meaning?

22:23.460 --> 22:29.060
We have to inquire into the content of the concept God, and trace that back to its origin

22:29.180 --> 22:30.180
and experience.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.780
Maybe we can do that.

22:31.780 --> 22:32.780
Maybe we can't.

22:32.780 --> 22:37.660
And so some empiricists have said we can, some others have said we can't, controversial.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.860
So it might be a synthetic claim.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.900
It might, on the other hand, be meaningless if you think that your concept of God is one

22:43.900 --> 22:46.980
that can't be tied back to any kind of impression.

22:46.980 --> 22:48.860
What about the soul is immortal?

22:48.860 --> 22:53.820
Well, depends on this question of the soul, right?

22:53.820 --> 22:58.900
I mean, mortal, that we can find the origins for an experience.

22:58.940 --> 22:59.940
People experience death.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.580
They see things die.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.180
So that's not a problem.

23:03.180 --> 23:07.260
We can negate the concept of being mortal and get immortal.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.660
But what about soul?

23:09.660 --> 23:12.020
Here we have to say, well, I don't know.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.420
So that's why that was also controversial.

23:14.420 --> 23:18.180
Maybe it's a factual claim about the world that there are such things as souls in the

23:18.180 --> 23:22.420
world and that those things can survive death.

23:22.420 --> 23:26.620
But on the other hand, maybe it's really meaningless if it turns out that we can't make any sense

23:26.620 --> 23:27.980
of the idea of soul.

23:27.980 --> 23:32.260
So once again, there's a place where we may or may not be able to use the empiricist method

23:32.260 --> 23:35.820
to trace back the content of our concept of a soul.

23:35.820 --> 23:36.940
What about the freedom of the will?

23:36.940 --> 23:38.820
Well, it's the same thing in a way.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.700
It's similarly controversial.

23:41.700 --> 23:42.980
What do we mean by the will?

23:42.980 --> 23:44.660
What do we mean by freedom?

23:44.660 --> 23:49.100
Maybe we can make good sense of that, but if we can, that seems to be a claim about the

23:49.100 --> 23:52.500
world and about this thing called the will.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.220
But maybe we can't, in which case that's really a meaningless claim.

23:56.220 --> 23:58.620
Maybe substance has an essence.

23:58.620 --> 24:04.420
Again, this idea of a substance, well, Locke thinks we can trace that back to experience.

24:04.420 --> 24:06.620
Hume and Barclay think we can't.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.460
What about an essence?

24:08.460 --> 24:13.620
Actually all of these empiricists after Locke tend to be suspicious of that notion.

24:13.620 --> 24:17.140
Locke thinks we can make good sense of the concept of an essence.

24:17.140 --> 24:18.860
Barclay and Hume deny it.

24:18.860 --> 24:22.580
So we're going to see a sharp divide among empiricists on that one.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.020
You ought to seek the good.

24:24.020 --> 24:28.820
Well, we might worry that obligation or the good actually turns out to be meaningless

24:28.820 --> 24:32.140
and we can't trace it back to experience in the right way.

24:32.140 --> 24:36.380
So maybe that turns out to be meaningless, or maybe it's simply analytic.

24:36.380 --> 24:40.260
That's how the good is defined, that which is worth seeking.

24:40.260 --> 24:42.580
And then finally courage is a virtue.

24:42.580 --> 24:47.020
Maybe that's just part of the definition of courage, but maybe it's a synthetic claim

24:47.020 --> 24:52.220
about the world that in general it's a good thing to be courageous, or maybe we end up

24:52.220 --> 24:55.140
saying courage or more likely virtue.

24:55.140 --> 24:59.100
We don't know how to make sense of that in purely experiential terms.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.820
So with all of these we apply Hume's method.

25:01.820 --> 25:05.260
And sometimes we say, that's not synthetic a priori.

25:05.260 --> 25:10.060
That's not a real truth about the world that we can only discover through reason alone,

25:10.060 --> 25:15.020
but that, well I shouldn't say only discover, that we can discover through reason only without

25:15.020 --> 25:16.940
experience of the world.

25:16.940 --> 25:23.980
Instead we have to say either it's analytic, like holes are greater than their parts, or

25:23.980 --> 25:28.980
it's a synthetic claim about the world, like you can't go back and change the past, or

25:28.980 --> 25:31.620
it's something that's utterly meaningless.

25:31.620 --> 25:34.060
So what if it's utterly meaningless?

25:34.060 --> 25:39.260
Well Hume says quite figuratively, I hope, commit it to the flames.

25:39.260 --> 25:43.620
Or more rationally you might say, don't pay any attention to it.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.060
You can gain nothing from it.

25:45.060 --> 25:46.060
It's meaningless.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.500
It has no content.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.780
So you will learn nothing from it.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.740
You can gain no knowledge from it.

25:50.740 --> 25:52.620
And lots of people talk nonsense.

25:52.620 --> 25:55.820
You would say, look, this isn't a problem if people didn't talk nonsense all the time,

25:55.820 --> 25:57.260
but they do.

25:57.260 --> 26:02.140
And so hang around the university for a while, you'll find all sorts of people talking nonsense.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.780
And it's not just in universities, tune into the media.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.600
A lot of people are talking nonsense.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.300
It happens all around you.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.860
And it happens day to day.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.880
It happens in almost every setting.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.540
You encounter people, they start talking about things.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.420
Sometimes those things are really things about the world.

26:16.420 --> 26:17.740
You understand their content.

26:17.740 --> 26:18.740
Maybe they're true.

26:18.740 --> 26:19.740
Maybe they're false.

26:19.740 --> 26:21.980
But sometimes they don't mean anything at all.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.580
So Hume says, be on your guard.

26:24.580 --> 26:28.100
And even though I am not going to tell you, commit anything to the flames, I think it's

26:28.100 --> 26:32.580
a really bad idea, I will tell you there are things that you really should ignore.

26:32.580 --> 26:36.380
And you should simply say, yeah, I'm going to learn nothing out of this.

26:36.380 --> 26:37.620
Nothing good can come from this.

26:44.540 --> 26:45.540
Thank you.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.540
Bye.

26:46.540 --> 26:47.540

26:47.540 --> 26:48.540

26:58.540 --> 26:59.540

26:59.540 --> 27:00.540

27:00.540 --> 27:01.540

27:01.540 --> 27:02.540

27:02.540 --> 27:03.540

27:03.540 --> 27:04.540

27:04.540 --> 27:05.540

27:05.540 --> 27:06.540

27:06.540 --> 27:07.540

27:07.540 --> 27:08.540
Bye.

27:08.540 --> 27:09.540
Bye.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.540

27:10.540 --> 27:11.540

27:11.540 --> 27:12.540

27:12.540 --> 27:13.540
Bye.
