0	10000	In any case, let's back up a little bit and try to understand what's going on on what there is and in this last section of order of knowledge.
10000	23000	We've looked at one criteria of ontological commitment and he puts it in a logistical approach to the ontological problem by saying that to be is to be a value of a variable.
23000	32000	Well, he says it more explicitly or at least maybe less dramatically, but nevertheless more intelligently.
32000	35000	But I think it's the same criteria in some of the way it works.
35000	38000	And he then says, well, I'm not telling you what there is.
38000	42000	I'm not trying to give you a theory of beating of what there is directly.
42000	44000	I'm telling you what a theory says there is.
44000	48000	And so we might say, here's the idea.
48000	66000	A theory says there are a's if and only if it asserts there are a's.
67000	75000	Or in logical terms, there is an x subject able to prove x.
75000	79000	Now, when you put it that way, it's almost trivial, right?
79000	82000	When does a theory tell you there are certain objects?
82000	84000	Well, when it says there are those objects.
84000	88000	And so when he puts it that way, it should be clear.
88000	91000	He's meaning to say something that's kind of obvious.
91000	98000	Okay, when does my theory imply the existence of sense data when it says there are sense data?
98000	102000	When does it imply the existence of unicorns when it says there are unicorns?
102000	106000	When does it imply the existence of attributes when it says there are attributes?
106000	114000	And so we look to things that we are willing to, well, quantify over in this sense, say there are such things.
114000	119000	Now, put that way, it sounds like a very obvious point, right?
119000	123000	But then the question is, well, okay, suppose that is the criterion.
123000	126000	Notice it splits the ontological question in two.
126000	130000	And that's something that isn't very obvious in the earlier work.
130000	133000	It's something brought out by this reformulation.
133000	139000	Because if we just say to be is to be a value of a variable, we think we're getting a theory of what there is, a theory of being.
139000	143000	But if we say it this way, we realize there are really two questions.
143000	152000	The first question is, okay, what does?
152000	156000	Well, actually, this is telling you what a theory says there is.
156000	158000	So why don't we start with a prior question?
158000	169000	It's really, what theory about the world should we adopt?
169000	180000	And then secondly, what does it say there is?
180000	185000	In other words, he's really telling us what a theory claims about reality.
185000	188000	What does a theory say there is in the world?
188000	193000	And so if we're asking what is there in the world, really trying to address the fundamental question of ontology,
193000	196000	we have to ask, well, first of all, what theory should we adopt?
196000	200000	And then secondly, all right, what does it say there is?
200000	202000	Now, let's look at that first question.
202000	204000	What theory should we adopt?
204000	207000	We're trying to describe the world, right?
207000	212000	Well, a project of metaphysics is in a way to talk about the structure of the world.
212000	216000	It's structure in the sense of what ultimately exists.
216000	219000	How we talk about other things in terms of what ultimately exists.
219000	221000	How the mind relates to all of that.
221000	224000	All of that is broadly speaking metaphysics.
224000	228000	At the bottom, we've got this ontological question of what there is.
228000	235000	Well, in thinking about the world in this way, what sort of theory should we adopt?
235000	238000	Where do we start in thinking about this?
238000	243000	There are really only two options in Klein's view.
243000	246000	Really maybe three, I guess I should say.
246000	251000	But what are our options for this question of what theory we should adopt?
251000	253000	Nominalism and realism?
253000	257000	Well, we could adopt specific metaphysical theories like nominalism and realism.
257000	261000	But in a sense, he's asking a question that's even prior to metaphysics.
261000	267000	Prior to this question of what is real, like our attributes, universal forms, real or not.
267000	272000	He's saying, look, I'm just trying to get a metaphysical theory of the world.
272000	275000	And to do that, I just need to start with some theory of the world.
275000	278000	I need to start with something that talks about the way the world is.
278000	280000	And forget philosophy for a moment.
280000	283000	It's not a question of starting with a philosophical theory.
283000	289000	It's a question of just what are we, when we describe the world, what are we doing?
289000	291000	He says science.
291000	294000	Yeah, okay, one option here is science.
294000	297000	And indeed, that's his preferred option.
297000	300000	He says, yeah, we start with our best scientific theory.
300000	304000	And then we ask what that scientific theory says there is.
304000	306000	Well, that's one option.
306000	312000	Say, yeah, look, when we're really about the project describing the world, we do science.
312000	314000	And so we think science describes the world.
314000	320000	And in his way of thinking about it, science is really, it's an old Aristotelian idea in a way.
320000	322000	Science is like a layer page.
322000	327000	So this picture of science he's working with, and it's a very common picture,
327000	335000	is to say the most fundamental science, the one on which all the others rest, is physics.
335000	337000	Physics, exactly.
337000	341000	So physics is the thing that ultimately tells us what there is in the world.
341000	344000	And then on top of physics, we build chemistry.
344000	348000	And then on top of chemistry, we build biology.
348000	352000	And on top of biology, we build psychology.
352000	358000	And then on top of psychology, we build all the rest of the social sciences,
358000	361000	things like economics, sociology, and so forth.
362000	369000	And so if you have that picture of science, you're going to say, well, all right, yes,
369000	376000	we talk about, for example, income trends and social groups and things like that.
376000	379000	But in the end, those come down to questions of psychology.
379000	383000	Those reduce to questions of biology, which in turn reduce to questions of chemistry,
383000	385000	which ultimately reduce to physics.
385000	389000	And so in the end, the way he talks about science, really,
389000	393000	it becomes a question of what his physics state is.
393000	399000	So as Quine's thinking about this question, we really start broadly speaking with the language of science
399000	402000	and pretty quickly the language of physics.
402000	407000	I have a question about scientific language philosophers in general.
407000	414000	When you read someone like Stephen Hawking, he explicitly admits that all these things he's talking about
414000	416000	don't necessarily really exist.
416000	418000	They're mathematical models.
418000	422000	When you're talking about like Einstein radiation or something like that,
422000	426000	it's not like there's some entity there.
426000	431000	This ground state fluctuations are a model to describe a phenomenon.
431000	437000	How do these scientific language philosophers square their theories with that?
437000	439000	Great question.
439000	442000	When we look at science, notice it's doing something,
442000	446000	well, at the higher levels, it may just be much of the time anyway,
446000	450000	we're just systematizing things that we already think are there.
450000	456000	But when we get down to these levels, science is postulating a realm of hypothetical entities,
456000	460000	theoretical entities, that we don't have any access to in observation.
460000	464000	Things like microparticles, things like fields of certain kinds,
464000	473000	or in string theory, strings, maybe in theories of additional dimensions and things like that, hyperspace.
473000	478000	In the end, we've got certain objects, and indeed physics is quantifying over certain objects.
478000	481000	Well, what sort of objects?
481000	483000	And what do we say about those?
483000	487000	There are going to be entities here, but now there are two attitudes you might have about them.
487000	496000	You might be a realist who says, look, science says there are quarks, for example,
496000	498000	and that's our best scientific theory of the world.
498000	502000	It asserts that there are quarks, so I have reason to believe there are quarks.
502000	507000	And so the realist says the real objects, especially if he goes the path of flying here,
507000	510000	the real objects are just the objects postulated by science.
510000	512000	So in the end, what is there in the world?
512000	519000	Well, there are things like quarks and electromagnetic fields, and positrons, and neutrons, and so forth.
519000	525000	On the other hand, there's another attitude you might have towards science, an instrumentalist attitude,
525000	531000	which says, wait a minute, I'm postulating entities like quarks and fields and so on.
531000	537000	But to those things really exist, I'm saying they're useful calculating devices.
537000	542000	So one way of looking at it is the realist says, look, these basic objects of science,
542000	550000	let's call them theoretical objects, the theoretical objects exist,
550000	555000	and the scientific theory explains what it explains if those things exist.
555000	558000	But if they don't exist, there's something weird going on.
558000	561000	You've got something that's really just a calculating device.
561000	565000	The instrumentalist says, well, yeah, that's all it is. It is a calculated device.
565000	573000	And so the instrumentalist says, wait a minute, this whole idea of answering science is not going to give us the right answer.
573000	580000	What science does is hypothesize various things that might be behind the curtain to explain the appearances we have in the world.
580000	585000	But don't think those things being postulated as being behind the curtain are the real things.
585000	589000	They're just ways of calculating about the things we actually experience.
589000	596000	So the instrumentalist is going to say, look, don't take physics or science in general as the right way to do this.
596000	598000	It's not telling you what they're all about.
598000	603000	Yeah, it seems like the realist would run into immediate problems with no light.
603000	611000	Science says it's a particle and a wave, and those things are mutually exclusive if you take it in a realistic way.
611000	616000	We have to kind of view it as a mathematical, as an instrumentalist view.
616000	621000	And I think most physicists I've read seem to be more instrumentalists.
621000	626000	Right, lots of physicists are instrumentalists, partly because it's a way of avoiding carbon problems.
626000	630000	Like, are you saying that light is really a particle or is it a wave?
630000	633000	Is it some kind of weird combination of the two?
633000	637000	Some people have introduced this sort of a waveical for it, right?
637000	642000	And the realist has to grapple with those questions and says roughly after quantum mechanics,
642000	644000	yeah, this is what really is in the world.
644000	646000	You know what, the world is weird, man.
646000	648000	The world is unbelievably dear.
648000	653000	And indeed, the realist often says, yes, physics is describing the way the world is.
653000	656000	Ultimately, quantum mechanics is describing what the possible is in the world.
656000	657000	It turns out it's weird.
657000	659000	It doesn't fit our ordinary chemical words at all.
659000	662000	So it's very easy to go from this claim, a theoretical object,
662000	667000	so that the ones that really exist to say, look, the world is weird.
667000	673000	And a lot of physicists want to say, hmm, I don't know if the world is really that weird.
673000	677000	We've got a theory here that works really well, but it might be.
677000	679000	And indeed, if we think it's just a calculating device,
679000	682000	does it have to give us a picture of what light really is?
682000	684000	It doesn't have to answer that question.
684000	686000	You can say it in certain respects, it's like a particle.
686000	688000	In certain other respects, it's like a wave.
688000	691000	We've got the famous two-slit experiments,
691000	694000	and it's very hard to make sense of the intuitive terms.
694000	699000	But from this point of view, good, we don't have to make sense of the intuitive terms.
699000	704000	It's a mathematical theory, and it explains the appearances.
704000	707000	And the appearances are kind of strange and surprising.
707000	711000	But nevertheless, we don't take the object seriously.
711000	715000	Now, if we have this attitude, we're not going to say science is the path to this,
715000	717000	and that's the theory, not the theory we're going to be interested in.
717000	722000	What will we be interested in?
722000	725000	I mean, if we're instrumentalists about the objects introduced by science,
725000	731000	hypothetically, and theoretically, then what are we taking as fundamental?
731000	733000	What we see.
733000	734000	What we see, yeah.
734000	736000	So science is one option.
736000	738000	But there are other options.
738000	742000	One option would be, well, experience.
742000	745000	The objects of immediate experience.
745000	748000	So we've seen some philosophers who do that.
748000	753000	Okay, Russell, for example, talking about sense data,
753000	761000	or actually Karnam in the logical structure of the world,
761000	765000	and arguing that you can reduce all talk of physical objects
765000	768000	to objects of immediate sensation, something like sense data.
768000	771000	What's right before your senses at any given moment?
771000	774000	He also argues in that book, you can do it the other way around.
774000	778000	You can reduce talk of sense data to talk of physical objects.
778000	780000	And then he says, which should we take as primary?
780000	784000	Should we really think what there is in the world are physical objects?
784000	788000	Or should we think, no, it's a matter of the contents of immediate experience.
788000	790000	It's sensations.
790000	795000	And he ends up saying, you can do it either way, which is a little surprising.
795000	798000	But he says, what's directly before the mind,
798000	802000	and so what's epistemologically prior, are the sensations.
802000	805000	So he favors actually going in the direction of the sensations.
805000	807000	But he admits it goes both ways.
807000	810000	And part of what's in the background, in object decision,
810000	814000	that last section of word and object, is that Klein assumes you know Karnam.
814000	817000	And Klein is basically saying, yes, you can go in either direction.
817000	822000	But I favor, he says, going in the direction of taking physical objects as primary.
822000	825000	But not ordinary physical objects like tables and chairs,
825000	829000	necessarily in the end, the objects are hypothesized by science.
829000	833000	He's aware that Karnam and Russell and others would say, no, no, no,
833000	835000	go in this more instrumentalist direction.
835000	838000	And that's going to lead me to say it's experience that's the fundamental
838000	840000	theory I don't worry about.
840000	843000	And my reports of sensations.
843000	845000	And he says, we could do it that way.
845000	850000	But he thinks that our theory of objects in the world is just so well confirmed
850000	852000	and so explanatory.
852000	856000	Then he says, look, I know how to get through a day without referring to my own sensations.
856000	859000	I don't know how to get through a day without referring to people and tables
859000	863000	and chairs and other ordinary objects of experience.
863000	870000	And so he ends up saying, I'd much rather trust talk of objects than talk of sensations.
870000	872000	But there's yet another option.
872000	882000	What other option could there be?
882000	885000	When you talk about the world, sometimes you do science.
885000	887000	Sometimes you might be talking about your own experiences.
887000	892000	But what do we do most of the time?
892000	895000	I say, tell me about this room.
895000	902000	Do you immediately start saying, well, all right, let's introduce the wave function.
902000	904000	Our observations?
904000	906000	Well, you could be talking about our observations.
906000	908000	I mean, you could say, ah, tell me about the room.
908000	919000	Well, I'm sensing grayly and greenly and clockly and camera-ly and people-ly.
919000	921000	But you probably don't, right?
921000	922000	What do you do?
922000	923000	Yeah.
923000	924000	Perceptimals.
924000	925000	Yeah, exactly.
925000	928000	In other words, the objects of ordinary perception, right?
928000	930000	I look around saying, oh, what's in the room?
930000	932000	Sure, I'll describe the room for you.
932000	935000	It's got tile on the floor and a bunch of desks and there are people in the desks
935000	939000	and it's got clock at the back and blackboards all around and so forth and so on.
939000	942000	And I tell you about the ordinary objects of experience.
942000	945000	And so you might say, well, look, one place to look is science.
945000	950000	One place to look is the contents of experience in the sense of these sensations themselves.
950000	954000	But another place to look is just our everyday language, right?
954000	962000	So we can say, just look at natural language and our everyday uses of it.
962000	967000	After all, we ordinarily confront the world not just by talking about our own sensations,
967000	970000	not by doing science, but just by talking about stuff.
970000	972000	Go to lunch with somebody after class.
972000	974000	But what are you going to talk about?
974000	976000	I mean, maybe you're going to talk about physics.
976000	981000	Except you say, whoa, check out that electron.
981000	985000	Maybe you're going to talk about your own sensations.
985000	989000	I mean, I suppose that's actually plausible in certain settings.
989000	992000	People talk about their feelings and all that.
992000	995000	But often, you're not talking about your feelings or other sensations.
995000	997000	You're not talking about physics.
997000	1001000	You're talking about things and people around you.
1001000	1005000	And so that might be a place to start.
1005000	1009000	Now, the reason I mentioned that is that a lot of clients' effort in word and object
1009000	1013000	is to actually say, yeah, but don't worry about that.
1013000	1016000	We can explain the kinds of things we talk about there.
1016000	1020000	And if pushed to the wall, he ends up saying, well, anyway, they're not part of science,
1020000	1022000	so I don't have to worry about them.
1022000	1024000	But he doesn't start there.
1024000	1028000	If he really started there, he'd just say, here's the language in physics.
1028000	1030000	And here's what it's telling us.
1030000	1031000	He doesn't do that.
1031000	1037000	He talks about attributes and propositions and facts and models and glids and all these other things.
1037000	1039000	And why is he doing that?
1039000	1041000	Because we talk about the natural language.
1041000	1045000	And he feels compelled to say something about what we really have to be committed to.
1045000	1050000	Because he doesn't want to say that much of what we say is just false.
1050000	1054000	I say, well, I didn't see the light.
1054000	1058000	There was this glint of a mirror, a neighboring car.
1058000	1061000	And we don't want to be lying.
1061000	1066000	The officer might not believe you, but the officer isn't going to say,
1066000	1068000	yeah, listen, I've written word and object.
1068000	1070000	There are no such things as glints.
1070000	1073000	No, he's saying it's false.
1073000	1077000	We want to be able to make some sense of that kind of talk.
1077000	1080000	OK, so those are the options that are in front of us.
1080000	1085000	And then why, now, he doesn't really, although that's his ultimate position,
1085000	1087000	he doesn't just jump there.
1087000	1090000	He tries to actually say, look, most of the time,
1090000	1095000	we don't have to worry about the things that natural language introduces
1095000	1097000	in addition to the language of science.
1097000	1101000	So what does science really commit us to in his view?
1101000	1103000	Two things in that, right?
1103000	1107000	Well, two very broad categories of things.
1107000	1112000	What are they?
1112000	1120000	What does science talk about?
1120000	1123000	See, be brave.
1123000	1125000	Good physical objects, exactly.
1125000	1129000	I'm not looking for something deep like, oh, man, I forgot my hyperspace theory.
1129000	1131000	Yes, physical objects.
1131000	1132000	OK, good.
1132000	1135000	So yes, it talks about physical objects.
1135000	1138000	And what else does it use in talking about physical objects?
1138000	1140000	Abstract objects.
1140000	1142000	Abstract objects, exactly.
1142000	1144000	It introduces specifically mathematics.
1144000	1150000	And in the end, what does mathematics commit us to?
1150000	1154000	Well, you might say all sorts of things, right?
1154000	1161000	Mathematical facts, numbers, functions, relations, spaces, metric spaces,
1161000	1163000	monarch spaces, et cetera.
1163000	1165000	Here, we could give all those sorts of answers.
1165000	1168000	Groups, rings, fields, matrices.
1168000	1172000	Well, he just says it all comes down to what?
1172000	1176000	One logical and set.
1176000	1177000	Exactly.
1177000	1184000	It comes down to a theory of classes to use Russell's language or in more modern language sense.
1184000	1187000	Actually, there are some set theories that distinguish sets from classes.
1187000	1190000	But for the moment, let's not worry about that.
1190000	1194000	So in the end, we can build all of mathematics from that.
1194000	1197000	Now, in his early work, he is a novelist.
1197000	1202000	He thinks it loves to get rid of this, OK, and just have physical objects.
1202000	1204000	It's the things that are there in the world.
1204000	1206000	But he can't figure out how to do it.
1206000	1209000	In 1948, he is a novelist.
1209000	1211000	And in fact, he publishes a paper with Nelson Goodman
1211000	1214000	called Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism.
1214000	1217000	And it starts with a ringing declaration of nominalism
1217000	1219000	that there are no abstract objects.
1219000	1221000	And indeed, throughout much of his work,
1221000	1224000	he's trying to get rid of abstract objects like propositions
1224000	1228000	and attributes and various other things.
1228000	1232000	But in the end, he says, look, I don't know how to do without mathematics in science.
1233000	1237000	And mathematics seems to commit me to classes,
1237000	1239000	and I don't know how to get rid of them.
1239000	1244000	Now, Russell, in 1908, was convinced that classes were just a logical fiction
1244000	1246000	that he could get rid of them.
1246000	1249000	That's part of the project of Principia Mathemica.
1249000	1252000	But in the end, he couldn't do it.
1252000	1254000	Why does it turn out to be hard?
1254000	1259000	Why can't you just say, ah, come on, classes of objects, sets of objects.
1259000	1262000	We're just talking about the objects.
1262000	1266000	I could say, yes, consider the set of people in this room.
1266000	1269000	You might think, I'm just talking about the people in the room, right?
1269000	1271000	It's not like how many things are in the room.
1271000	1272000	Oh, there are these people.
1272000	1275000	And then, oh, I forgot the set of people in the room, too.
1275000	1278000	And so there's a powerful intuition that, look,
1278000	1282000	sets are just a ways of talking about the things in them.
1282000	1285000	And Frege and Russell start with that idea.
1285000	1288000	But it turns out to be harder to make sense of that than you might think.
1288000	1290000	Here's why.
1290000	1294000	We could say, all right, suppose we're talking about the set of A's.
1294000	1296000	We think there are such things, maybe.
1296000	1304000	And so I want to talk about the set of all the X's, such that A is true of X.
1304000	1308000	You might think, look, it's very easy to explain my talk that way.
1308000	1312000	What does it mean to talk about the set of objects that are A's?
1312000	1314000	This is just the set of A's, right?
1319000	1322000	Well, I've introduced that term.
1322000	1327000	And it turns out to be a very useful thing to do in math and in various other contexts.
1327000	1329000	What could I mean by that?
1329000	1331000	Well, you might think, oh, it's very easy.
1331000	1333000	I just have to worry about element to it.
1333000	1338000	In fact, in the end, in mathematics, all I really need is this one symbol
1338000	1341000	in addition to logic, is a member of.
1341000	1344000	And so you might think, I can explain this very easily.
1344000	1357000	Y is a member of this set of X's, such that A of X, if and only if A holds true of Y.
1357000	1360000	So let's say I'm talking about the set of people in the room.
1360000	1366000	Y belongs to the set of people in the room, if and only if Y is a person in the room.
1366000	1371000	Y belongs to the set of green things, if and only if Y is green.
1372000	1378000	Y belongs to the set of novelists, if and only if Y is a novelist, et cetera.
1378000	1381000	And so you might think, great, here I'm talking about sets, right?
1381000	1382000	I seem to be committed to sets.
1382000	1384000	But over here, I'm not.
1384000	1388000	I'm just talking about the Y's, whatever they are.
1388000	1390000	And I'm not talking about sets anymore.
1390000	1393000	And so if I could make that work, I could just say, see,
1393000	1395000	look, classes are just logical fictions.
1395000	1399000	They're just constructions out of the objects they're classes of.
1399000	1404000	And so actually, I could just get by with the physical objects.
1404000	1410000	Well, this is, in fact, the way we explain that notation.
1410000	1414000	And so can't we be happy and say, oh, there it is.
1414000	1416000	We can get rid of this talk of classes.
1416000	1417000	Silly quine.
1417000	1418000	We don't need.
1418000	1422000	We don't need no stinking classes.
1422000	1425000	No fans of the treasure of the Sierra Landry here.
1425000	1427000	Well, it was on TV the other night.
1427000	1429000	Forgive me.
1429000	1434000	Anyway, now I feel we need to explain this.
1434000	1437000	These bandidos come up, and Humphrey Bogart and the others
1437000	1439000	are trying to fight them off.
1439000	1443000	They claim to be federales, and they don't believe them.
1443000	1447000	And Humphrey Bogart says, if you're federales, show me your badges.
1447000	1448000	They say, badges?
1448000	1451000	We don't need no stinking badges.
1451000	1454000	I think the Mel Brooks version better, Blazing Saddle.
1454000	1455000	Oh.
1455000	1456000	Yeah.
1456000	1457000	Sorry.
1457000	1458000	It's quite not that good.
1458000	1459000	Yeah, no.
1459000	1461000	They're recruiting all the bandits to raid the town,
1461000	1464000	and the bandidos come up, and they're like, all right, you know,
1464000	1466000	here are your badges, and they laugh at you.
1466000	1468000	We don't need no stinking badges.
1468000	1469000	Very good.
1469000	1472000	So yes, you have the normalist's sets, and the normalist's sets.
1472000	1474000	I don't need no stinking sets.
1474000	1475000	All right.
1475000	1477000	And now here's the way to get rid of them.
1477000	1478000	But what's wrong with this?
1478000	1489000	Oh, come on.
1489000	1496000	Yeah, this is called Russell's Paradox.
1496000	1498000	It devastated poor Frank.
1498000	1501000	Frank was all excited about his theory.
1501000	1502000	Here it is.
1502000	1506000	And then Russell writes him like a two-page letter in which he says,
1506000	1508000	oh, you know, wonderful work.
1508000	1509000	There's one problem.
1509000	1511000	It's all inconsistent.
1511000	1512000	And here's the problem.
1512000	1516000	Consider the class of all classes that are not members themselves.
1516000	1525000	So in other words, just take AX as X is not a member of X.
1525000	1528000	Then what happens?
1528000	1531000	Oh, breaks my heart.
1531000	1533000	Because we end up saying, great.
1533000	1539000	Y belongs to the set of all X, such that X is not a member of X,
1539000	1541000	if and only if.
1541000	1542000	Now what?
1542000	1547000	A is true of Y, so Y is not a member of Y.
1547000	1550000	Y belongs to the set of sets that are not members themselves,
1550000	1553000	if and only if Y isn't a member of itself, right?
1553000	1557000	But now, wait a minute.
1557000	1561000	We've said, what about that set itself?
1561000	1567000	Does that set belong to itself or not?
1567000	1569000	It's a paradox.
1569000	1571000	Because now we've plugged that set in.
1571000	1574000	And so we can actually, let me give that set a name.
1574000	1576000	It'll make it easier to see what's going on.
1576000	1582000	Let's call this set just, well, R for Russell's set.
1582000	1589000	Then we can say, OK, Y belongs to R, if and only if Y doesn't belong to Y.
1589000	1591000	But now plug in R for Y.
1591000	1596000	Ask, does that set belong to itself or not?
1596000	1599000	And then we say, well, R belongs to R, if and only if.
1599000	1600000	Oh, yeah.
1600000	1604000	R doesn't belong to R.
1604000	1607000	And that's pretty bad.
1607000	1608000	That's just not pretty bad.
1608000	1610000	It's really bad.
1610000	1613000	And so it turns out this simple way of doing things,
1613000	1618000	which now is called naive set theory, doesn't work out.
1618000	1621000	So what do we do?
1621000	1625000	Well, there are various ways of trying to respond to this paradox.
1625000	1630000	And they were really the chief obsession of mathematical logicians
1630000	1633000	for the first several decades of the 20th century.
1633000	1637000	Russell discovered this and published it in 1902.
1637000	1639000	Well, I think the letter to Frager was 1902.
1639000	1641000	He published the result in 1903.
1641000	1645000	And right away people realized this is a fundamental problem
1645000	1647000	in the foundations of mathematics.
1647000	1650000	To explain why, I have to go back a little bit.
1650000	1652000	I won't say much about this.
1652000	1657000	But the calculus had been developed by Newton and by Leibniz
1657000	1659000	in the 17th century.
1659000	1661000	It turned out to be immensely useful in science.
1661000	1664000	We use the calculus in all sorts of ways.
1664000	1667000	In many, many different branches of science,
1667000	1669000	but definitely in physics.
1669000	1673000	And it turned out that it talked about infinitesimal quantities.
1673000	1676000	If you think about the definition of a derivative,
1676000	1679000	it's really, well, now we do it in terms of limits.
1679000	1683000	But then it was just done as really something that came to 0 over 0.
1683000	1686000	And 0 over 0 doesn't make any sense.
1686000	1692000	And so it was kind of like, ah, yes, f y minus f x over y minus x,
1692000	1697000	as we would now say, as y approaches x.
1697000	1699000	But then we think, well, wait a minute.
1699000	1701000	In the end, that is just 0 over 0.
1701000	1703000	What do we do?
1703000	1706000	Leibniz and Newton talked about infinitesimal quantities.
1706000	1710000	We'll divide this one infinitesimal quantity by this other infinitesimal quantity.
1710000	1712000	What do you mean infinitesimal quantity?
1712000	1717000	Now, Abraham Robinson did find a way in the later 20th century
1717000	1719000	to make sense of that talk.
1719000	1722000	But throughout the 19th century, people realized we're using the calculus,
1722000	1726000	but it's all based on kind of something unintelligible
1726000	1728000	that we don't really understand.
1728000	1731000	And in fact, certain contradictions began emerging
1731000	1734000	in the foundations of the calculus.
1734000	1738000	So people thought it was very important to try and construct it on a rigorous foundation.
1738000	1743000	And Koshy, Dedekin, and a variety of other people throughout the 19th century did that.
1743000	1746000	The great achievement, in a way, of 19th century mathematics
1746000	1748000	was the rigorization of mathematics
1748000	1752000	and setting it on a firm foundation developing theories of limits
1752000	1756000	of infinite sequences of convergence and so on.
1756000	1759000	And so all of that was a great achievement.
1759000	1761000	And Frager was basically saying,
1761000	1763000	and so you can do it all with classes,
1763000	1767000	but oh, there's an inconsistency in the way you've been thinking about this.
1767000	1770000	So it was as if people jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.
1770000	1773000	They had solved the problems in the foundations of the calculus
1773000	1777000	by using set theory and then realized, oh, crap.
1777000	1780000	Set theory as we've been using it is inconsistent.
1780000	1782000	What do we do?
1782000	1786000	Well, they addressed this in a variety of ways.
1786000	1788000	Russell developed the theory of types.
1788000	1790000	He was talking about objects and then classes of objects
1790000	1792000	and classes of classes of objects
1792000	1795000	and classes of classes of objects and so on.
1795000	1798000	And that's one way of approaching it.
1798000	1801000	Kline himself developed something called new foundations
1801000	1803000	that tried to prevent any circularities
1803000	1806000	and thought the problem was really the X belongings
1806000	1808000	who were not belonging to X,
1808000	1811000	ruling such things out as illegitimate.
1811000	1816000	The most standard way of doing this is Zermaylo-Frankl set theory.
1816000	1819000	These days called ZFC.
1819000	1822000	Zermaylo-Frankl and then the axiom of choice.
1822000	1825000	C isn't a person, but an additional axiom.
1825000	1829000	And the reason I mention it is not only is it the way that mathematics
1829000	1833000	is now standardly done, but it replaces this one principle
1833000	1835000	with a bunch of other principles.
1835000	1839000	It restricts this to say you can only do this within a certain background set.
1839000	1842000	So you can define a new set inside another set,
1842000	1844000	but not just out of thin air.
1844000	1846000	It says pairs of things.
1846000	1849000	You can basically, if you have two objects, X and Y,
1849000	1851000	you can have the pair set X, Y.
1851000	1855000	You can take the power set of a set, the set of all the subsets and so on.
1855000	1858000	All of these are ways of building sets out of other sets.
1858000	1862000	But there's one axiom that's different.
1862000	1866000	There is an axiom called the axiom of infinity.
1869000	1873000	And what it essentially says is there is
1873000	1875000	an infinite set.
1878000	1880000	Now, why is that scary?
1880000	1885000	Well, because it just makes that ball climb, right?
1885000	1887000	It just says there is such a thing.
1887000	1890000	And there's no way to get rid of that.
1890000	1892000	It's foundational in the theory.
1892000	1893000	And what is a set?
1893000	1895000	What is this infinite set?
1895000	1898000	Well, the way it's usually done, it turns out it's an all set
1898000	1901000	together with the set containing an all set and the set containing that
1902000	1905000	It's the set containing all those things.
1905000	1910000	And it's like, wait, I'm just coming out and saying that.
1910000	1912000	That's a pretty frightening thing to say.
1912000	1915000	But however you do it, what you're really claiming is that.
1915000	1918000	And now you can see, wait a minute, okay, the math part.
1918000	1921000	That just commits me to the claim there is an infinite set,
1921000	1922000	the way that's now done.
1922000	1924000	And there's no way to get rid of that.
1924000	1928000	There's no way to, in fact, if I try to replace that with some physical object,
1928000	1931000	what could it possibly be, right?
1931000	1933000	It would have to be an infinite object.
1933000	1937000	And it would have to contain infinitely many other objects.
1937000	1941000	You could maybe guess at what Freda thought near the end of his life about this.
1941000	1945000	And actually, what I tried to do in my dissertation,
1945000	1948000	which was to say, what could a physical object that's infinite
1948000	1956000	and contains infinitely many others as objects be?
1956000	1958000	Be a region of space time.
1958000	1960000	And so in the end, maybe,
1960000	1963000	Freda thought we could reduce set theory to geometry
1963000	1966000	and think of it as a theory of spatiotemporal regions.
1966000	1969000	But that seems like the only hope.
1969000	1973000	In any event, it looks like math really does commit us to abstract objects.
1973000	1976000	It commits us to at least one infinite set.
1976000	1978000	There's no obvious way of getting rid of that
1978000	1980000	in favor of just talking about physical objects.
1980000	1982000	So anyway, this whole story has been,
1982000	1985000	why Klein transformed from a novelist to a flatness.
1985000	1987000	Because, as Klein said in the end,
1987000	1989000	yes, physics commits me to all this,
1989000	1991000	and I don't see how to get rid of it.
1991000	1992000	Yeah?
1992000	1994000	How could a region be infinite?
1994000	1998000	Well, think of all the points inside that region.
1998000	2001000	Well, it's not a closed curve, if I close it.
2001000	2004000	Think of the points inside that region.
2004000	2006000	There would be incredibly many points.
2006000	2007000	But is that infinite?
2007000	2009000	Oh, yeah.
2009000	2010000	Yeah.
2010000	2013000	But that assumes the continuity of space-time for one thing.
2013000	2016000	And one of the big reasons I sort of gave up on this
2016000	2018000	is not so much technically that I couldn't do it.
2018000	2021000	It's that, first of all, the structure of space-time
2021000	2023000	didn't seem to be necessary
2023000	2025000	in the way that mathematical truths are necessary.
2025000	2028000	It feels as if the actual structure of space-time
2028000	2030000	is something that's contingent.
2030000	2031000	Right?
2031000	2032000	Is it Euclidean?
2032000	2033000	Is it non-Euclidean?
2033000	2035000	What's the curvature of space?
2035000	2038000	Is it discrete ultimately or continuous?
2038000	2041000	It feels like those questions could go either way.
2041000	2042000	Right?
2042000	2044000	Yeah, I don't want to say, all right, kids,
2044000	2045000	one plus one is two.
2045000	2047000	Provided that space-time is continuous.
2047000	2050000	You know, the curvature of space is blah, blah, blah.
2050000	2052000	So it's like, no, that's crazy.
2052000	2054000	So it introduces a contingency,
2054000	2056000	which is part of what bothered me about it.
2056000	2059000	But the other thing that bothered me about it
2059000	2062000	is that I see how to actually make sense of the idea
2062000	2065000	of an uncountable infinity.
2065000	2068000	But actually, so I've got something the size
2068000	2070000	of the real numbers there.
2070000	2072000	But wait a minute.
2072000	2074000	What I need are higher levels of infinity.
2074000	2077000	How do I get the idea of, like, now, the cardinality
2077000	2079000	of all of the power set of that,
2079000	2081000	of all the subsets of this?
2081000	2083000	It looks like, wait a minute,
2083000	2086000	the power set of all the subsets of that region
2086000	2088000	is just the region, right?
2088000	2090000	So it's not clear how you ever get above
2090000	2093000	the cardinality of the real numbers.
2093000	2095000	And I didn't know how to solve that problem either.
2095000	2097000	And I want more than the real numbers.
2097000	2099000	I want to be able to talk about functions on the real numbers,
2099000	2101000	which requires me to talk about sets of real numbers.
2101000	2104000	And so it requires something fancier
2104000	2107000	than regions of space-time.
2107000	2110000	And so then I had various tricks, technically.
2110000	2112000	But in the end, I thought philosophically,
2112000	2114000	it made no sense.
2114000	2116000	So in any event, that's why I, too,
2116000	2120000	stopped being an analyst at a little confession time.
2120000	2124000	But anyway, Kwan didn't really take that detour.
2124000	2126000	He just said, yeah, it seems to me
2126000	2128000	what we've learned from the paradoxes.
2128000	2130000	And the way of reformulating mathematics
2130000	2132000	in the life of the paradoxes is you can't get rid of
2132000	2135000	a commitment to abstract objects.
2135000	2139000	You end up having to commit yourself to sets.
2139000	2145000	Now, I see that excited a few of you
2145000	2147000	and bored to tears the rest of you.
2147000	2151000	So let's go back to the objects that might be introduced,
2151000	2154000	not by science, but by, for example, natural language.
2154000	2156000	So he's worried about these things.
2156000	2158000	And in the end, he says, yes, these things
2158000	2160000	we have to be committed to before to do science.
2160000	2163000	So he thinks those really do answer the question,
2163000	2164000	what is there?
2164000	2165000	What is there?
2165000	2167000	In the end, the physical objects, as described by physics,
2167000	2169000	and sets.
2169000	2172000	But now, what else might we worry about?
2172000	2176000	Well, one thing that he's concerned about is actual use.
2176000	2177000	Right?
2177000	2180000	In other words, proverbs.
2180000	2187000	Or more broadly, relations, et cetera.
2187000	2192000	Do we have to think that those things exist?
2192000	2195000	Well, last time, we looked at some examples,
2195000	2205000	like the clock has rattles.
2205000	2209000	We could existentially quantify it,
2209000	2211000	so the clock has something.
2211000	2212000	Remember that inference?
2212000	2214000	Actually, I think we talked about pebbles,
2214000	2218000	which is an example of what there is.
2218000	2220000	What should we do about that?
2220000	2227000	Doesn't it follow that, therefore, the clock has something?
2227000	2237000	In which case, we're committed to attributes.
2237000	2239000	If you're already committed to abstract objects,
2239000	2243000	why is committing to attributes as abstract objects
2243000	2245000	extend your anthropology?
2245000	2247000	That's a great question.
2247000	2250000	You might think, look, there are places to man the barricades
2250000	2253000	philosophically, and places not.
2254000	2257000	You might think, indeed, the nominalists think,
2257000	2260000	typically, abstract objects are the place to do it.
2260000	2261000	Universals.
2261000	2263000	By the way, Quine conflates those two issues.
2263000	2265000	There really are separate issues.
2265000	2268000	The abstract concrete distinction and the universal
2268000	2270000	particular distinction are not the same distinction.
2270000	2272000	He recognizes that in word and object.
2272000	2275000	He says, oh yeah, there are these kind of abstract
2275000	2277000	particulars like the equator.
2277000	2278000	Whatever.
2278000	2280000	Let's go on to typical cases.
2280000	2282000	But anyway, that aside, you might think,
2282000	2284000	yeah, look, abstract and concrete,
2284000	2286000	that's a big place to draw the fighting line.
2286000	2288000	After all, concrete objects are ones
2288000	2290000	I can come into contact with.
2290000	2292000	Maybe I can experience them.
2292000	2294000	At any rate, I can come into some kind of causal
2294000	2296000	contact with them, even some micro-particle
2296000	2298000	that I could never directly experience,
2298000	2300000	causally interact with me.
2300000	2303000	And I can have a theory of that causal interaction.
2303000	2306000	So concrete objects, I'm happy to admit into my
2306000	2309000	ontology because I'm interacting with them all the time.
2309000	2311000	And I explain how, therefore, I can know about them.
2312000	2314000	But an abstract object isn't the kind of thing
2314000	2316000	I can causally interact with.
2316000	2318000	It's not just that I can't experience it.
2318000	2321000	I don't see roundness in the way that I see
2321000	2323000	the clock, for example.
2323000	2326000	But also, and I don't see the number three,
2326000	2329000	for example, I might see three birds on a wire.
2329000	2331000	And so you might think, yeah, look,
2331000	2333000	I don't experience these.
2333000	2335000	I don't have causal contact with them.
2335000	2337000	And so this is a place to fight.
2337000	2339000	But once I've lost that fight,
2339000	2341000	once I have to recognize sense,
2341000	2343000	you might say, now, why not just
2343000	2345000	in for a penny, in for a pound?
2345000	2347000	I've already got sense.
2347000	2349000	I've already made that purchase.
2349000	2351000	Why not go ahead and buy the full package
2351000	2354000	and get HBO and Cinemax 2 as a word?
2354000	2356000	Might as well get attributes.
2356000	2359000	It might as well sign on for propositions
2359000	2361000	and facts and all the rest of it.
2361000	2364000	Because after all, they're a small additional cost.
2364000	2367000	Not true in the case of movie packages.
2367000	2369000	But you might think it is true.
2369000	2371000	Here, Fimmelsoff, why not?
2371000	2374000	Now, I think that's a great question.
2374000	2376000	Why does Quine spend a lot of time
2376000	2378000	worrying about these?
2378000	2380000	Two parts to the question, really.
2380000	2382000	If science is what tells us what there is,
2382000	2384000	who cares what we say in natural language?
2384000	2386000	And second part of the question is,
2386000	2389000	once you've, in effect, admitted these,
2389000	2391000	now, why should it matter to you
2391000	2394000	whether there are additional kinds of abstract objects
2394000	2397000	like attributes and relations and propositions
2397000	2400000	and meanings and so on?
2400000	2402000	Because they're different, right?
2402000	2403000	They are different.
2403000	2404000	Now, how are they different?
2404000	2406000	Why does he really resist them?
2406000	2408000	Because we love the dog.
2408000	2410000	Okay, good.
2410000	2414000	Like, doghood is completely different
2414000	2417000	from saying that this is a dog, an individual dog,
2417000	2419000	and then you have another individual dog, right?
2419000	2421000	Right.
2421000	2422000	Okay, good.
2422000	2424000	Now, Quine says that he's looking for something
2424000	2426000	that's explanatory.
2426000	2428000	And he says, are physical explanations
2428000	2429000	involve physical objects?
2429000	2431000	They involve mathematics.
2431000	2435000	But I don't think this explains anything, okay?
2435000	2436000	In other words, he said,
2436000	2438000	and in part is a willingness to say,
2438000	2441000	I'm happy to recognize
2441000	2444000	ontological commitments where something is introduced
2444000	2446000	to explain the experiences I have,
2446000	2449000	to explain the appearances, to explain the world.
2449000	2451000	But I don't think introducing a form like roundness
2451000	2453000	does any explaining at all.
2453000	2455000	You say, aha, the clock is round.
2455000	2456000	Why is the clock round?
2456000	2458000	The answer is, well, it has roundness.
2458000	2461000	Do I learn anything from that?
2461000	2463000	Does it explain anything?
2463000	2465000	I think his answer is no.
2465000	2468000	And so the way he sees it, it's like this.
2468000	2470000	I've got two ways of putting things.
2470000	2477000	I can say the clock is round.
2477000	2484000	Or I can say the clock has roundness.
2484000	2486000	And now he's saying,
2486000	2489000	which one of those is explanatory prime?
2489000	2492000	Does the clock have roundness because it's round?
2492000	2495000	Or is the clock round because it has roundness?
2495000	2496000	What should I say?
2496000	2500000	Which of those is more fundamental?
2500000	2506000	Which gives me an explanation.
2506000	2508000	The clock is round.
2508000	2509000	Yeah, exactly.
2509000	2511000	He says, look, the clock is round.
2511000	2514000	That's the thing that explains this other thing, right?
2514000	2516000	Why do I say it has roundness?
2516000	2518000	Because it's round.
2518000	2520000	That's the fundamental thing.
2520000	2524000	And saying it has roundness doesn't explain anything at all.
2524000	2527000	In fact, there's a sort of paradox you can keep going.
2527000	2529000	Why does it have roundness?
2529000	2532000	Because it has the property of having roundness.
2532000	2536000	Or it and roundness are in the participation margin.
2536000	2539000	And so if you start making this move,
2539000	2541000	this is something called the Bradley Regress.
2541000	2543000	You might worry it keeps going.
2543000	2545000	And a lot of nominalists have been motivated
2545000	2547000	by that Bradley Regress thinking,
2547000	2549000	I don't know where it stops.
2549000	2553000	If the clock is round, something like RC
2553000	2558000	is explained by C having R-ness,
2558000	2561000	that it seems like now I've got the relation of having
2561000	2565000	linking C and roundness.
2565000	2567000	And then you might say, oh, now I've got
2567000	2571000	some other special relation linking having
2571000	2574000	and C and roundness.
2574000	2578000	And well, you can see I can just keep doing this forever.
2578000	2583000	But even if you say, well, maybe I can stop this regress here,
2583000	2585000	it's not clear what that's accomplishing.
2585000	2587000	So I think that's part of his reason.
2587000	2589000	He thinks this isn't doing any explaining.
2589000	2591000	It's really derivative.
2591000	2595000	And there are other reasons too.
2595000	2599000	How do I know how to talk about roundness?
2599000	2603000	It's epistemologically by virtue of interacting with round things.
2603000	2606000	So the explanatory priority of this
2606000	2608000	is mirrored by its epistemic priority.
2608000	2611000	I encounter the clock and I see that it's round.
2611000	2614000	I don't encounter roundness in the same way.
2614000	2617000	It seems indirect by virtue of encountering round things.
2617000	2621000	And so you might say, I say this after learning
2621000	2623000	the talk of properties and attributes and so on,
2623000	2627000	because I think that's not the other way around.
2627000	2630000	The little baby doesn't start speaking as a Platonist.
2630000	2633000	Oh, Mama exemplified here.
2633000	2636000	But instead talks about Mama, OK?
2636000	2641000	And we'll learn to say, you know, green or something.
2641000	2645000	And so anyway, he's motivated in part by that.
2645000	2649000	Well, he thinks we can get rid of talk of meanings
2649000	2651000	of propositions of attributes.
2651000	2653000	And here's one way to do it, right?
2653000	2654000	The clock has roundness.
2654000	2655000	Oh, very easy.
2655000	2657000	Just translate that into the clock is round.
2657000	2659000	Now what about this?
2659000	2666000	Roundness is an attribute.
2666000	2673000	How do we get rid of that?
2673000	2676000	After all, roundness in that sort of having round this position,
2676000	2678000	that's easy to replace with a predicate.
2678000	2680000	But here we've got a subject position.
2680000	2683000	If Quine's right, we can rephrase all of these things.
2683000	2685000	And notice in the logic decision chapter,
2685000	2688000	he really, for that matter, on what there is,
2688000	2690000	he gives you a few examples, but he doesn't give you
2690000	2692000	any programmatic way of doing this.
2692000	2694000	So we've got to be creative here.
2694000	2697000	It's not like he tells us how to do most of this stuff.
2697000	2699000	He just gives us a couple of examples and says, see?
2699000	2708000	But now here, what could we do?
2708000	2709000	Yeah.
2709000	2712000	Is this maybe a good example of you turning roundness into a verb?
2712000	2717000	Like roundness is kind of doing a certain work,
2717000	2720000	like theoretically and trying to explain it.
2720000	2721000	Yes.
2721000	2722000	That's true.
2722000	2724000	And so one way to do it would be to say,
2724000	2726000	well, here our strategy was to replace
2726000	2728000	talk of roundness with talk of round things.
2728000	2730000	So maybe we could say round things.
2730000	2732000	Oh, we don't want to say have an attribute.
2732000	2735000	We could say round things are blank for some blank.
2735000	2738000	Or another way to do it, the way Carnap does it actually
2738000	2740000	in the logical syntax of language,
2740000	2742000	is to go into what he calls the formal mode
2742000	2744000	by what Quine later calls semantic ascent.
2744000	2753000	So this is just saying round is imaginative.
2753000	2755000	Which is a little weird because there we replace it
2755000	2757000	with round things, and here we replace it with round.
2757000	2760000	But that might be less strange if we think here
2760000	2768000	we're really saying, well, the word round is true of the clock.
2768000	2770000	Well, in the closing moment here,
2770000	2772000	let me just say something about how he gets rid of meanings.
2772000	2777000	Because this ends up being a major strategy for Quine.
2777000	2779000	How do we get rid of meanings?
2779000	2782000	Instead of talking about the meaning of a sentence,
2782000	2784000	he says we can just replace that with, first of all,
2784000	2786000	the talk of the sentence being meaningful.
2786000	2791000	So first of all, you draw a distinction between the meaningful
2791000	2795000	and the insignificant, the meaningless, I suppose.
2795000	2797000	That's one way.
2797000	2799000	But the other thing we need talk of meanings for
2799000	2801000	is to say when things have the same meaning.
2801000	2806000	And so it's that, and then we have identity, basically,
2806000	2809000	which is a matter here of saying when things have the same meaning,
2809000	2814000	we can talk about synonymy.
2814000	2818000	And so in general, this becomes his strategy.
2818000	2823000	We say, first there's the existence question,
2823000	2826000	whether something has a meaning or not.
2826000	2828000	And secondly, the identity question,
2828000	2831000	when does this have the same meaning as that?
2831000	2833000	And he's going to do that with all sorts of things.
2833000	2835000	Propositions.
2835000	2838000	It'll just be when does something express a proposition,
2838000	2842000	and then when does it express the same proposition.
2842000	2846000	So it will not be essentially equivalent to talking about meanings.
2846000	2847000	And in the end, all we have to do is talk about
2847000	2849000	significant or insignificant sentences,
2849000	2852000	and then sentences meaning the same as other sentences.
2852000	2854000	So that's the general recipe he's going to use
2854000	2856000	for a lot of these abstract objects.
2856000	2860000	Just introduce a way of talking about the existence of such a thing,
2860000	2862000	and then what is that, the same one of those,
2862000	2865000	and there's no need any longer to talk about the propositions
2865000	2868000	or the facts or the attributes of the meanings.
