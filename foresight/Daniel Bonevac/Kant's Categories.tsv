0	10680	I want to talk today about Kant's categories.
10680	13920	The categories in Aristotle are categories of being.
13920	17640	They're senses in which a thing may be said to be.
17640	20920	The same thing is true in the Vaisesha Kassutra.
20920	25200	Kant proposes a system of categories, but it's a rather different system as we'll see,
25200	26880	and it's doing something different.
26880	29080	These are not categories of being.
29080	32480	And these come out of logical functions of judgment.
32480	38240	He's looking at logic, and there's something that is fascinating in a biographical sense
38240	42280	when we look at this, because Kant, in his lectures on logic and in his little book on
42280	45840	logic, says, logic is a remarkable discipline.
45840	51040	It really hasn't changed for the past 2,000 years, and it seems to be a complete subject.
51040	52560	Nothing will ever be added to it.
52560	57960	Well, modern logic has added a lot to it, so he was writing that just a few decades
57960	62120	before there would be a major transformation in logic.
62120	66760	But nevertheless, when you look at the logical functions of judgment, he outlines, and look
66760	71920	at the categories, you realize, well, there's all sorts of stuff there that we can now explain
71920	75800	something of in logic, but that he couldn't have at all.
75800	80640	So even in his own terms, he should have realized, wait, there's a lot more to do in this subject.
80640	84880	My own logical functions of judgment include many, many concepts that aren't included
84880	87000	in my own logic book.
87040	90040	But that's just sort of a comic aside.
90040	93960	What is Kant doing with these categories?
93960	96520	We've talked about Kant as a rationalist.
96520	101360	He was a student of Wolf, who was a student of Leibniz, and he agrees that there are
101360	105320	innate ideas and that there is synthetic a priori knowledge.
105320	109360	The innate ideas he refers to is the pure concepts of the understanding.
109360	111440	Those are the categories.
111440	114720	But there are also synthetic a priori truths.
114720	117480	He calls them laws of the understanding.
117480	124440	And so what I want to talk about today is that duo, basically, the categories, the pure
124440	126120	concepts of the understanding.
126120	131080	So we'll see what Kant thinks are the innate ideas, and also what he takes these synthetic
131080	134520	a priori truths to be, the laws of the understanding.
134520	139960	It is important to recognize that unlike other rationalists, Kant thinks these apply only
140000	142360	within the realm of experience.
142360	146680	Descartes and Leibniz thought they were true about the world, and so we're happy to apply
146680	151520	them within experience and outside of experience, even to things we cannot experience.
151520	157600	But Kant says, no, they're really part of the way in which our mind constructs experience.
157600	163960	And so they apply only to the output of that process, not to whatever input might be present
163960	169800	or to whatever might be in the world beyond the realm of our experience.
169800	173240	He gives us, as we've seen, a transcendental argument.
173240	177960	He says the a priori concepts and the laws of the understanding are necessary conditions
177960	180560	for the possibility of experience.
180560	183840	But we do have experience, so of course it's possible.
183840	186320	So there must be a priori concepts.
186320	188800	There must be laws of the understanding.
188800	194720	So in short, for us to experience the world at all, we have to have some innate ideas,
194720	197960	these a priori concepts of the understanding or the categories.
197960	204080	We also have to have synthetic a priori knowledge through the laws of the understanding.
204080	205600	But that raises the question.
205600	209480	What are the necessary conditions for the possibility of experience?
209480	211400	What in particular do I need?
211400	214320	What are these pure concepts of the understanding?
214320	216200	What concepts do I need, Kant?
216200	221120	What principles must I assume as synthetic a priori principles in order to have experience
221120	223080	be possible?
223080	226840	Good questions, and he does answer them.
226840	228840	Let's think about some experiences.
228840	234680	I have visual experiences like this of the University of Texas Tower, or this of the
234680	249480	White House, or a field of flowers, or a sunset, or my cat Belle, or a pizza, or another pizza.
249480	252080	I'm fond of pizza.
252080	254280	Well what makes all of these things possible?
254280	257920	Yes, some of these are visual experiences, that's how you've seen them, but I can tell
257920	261440	you with the pizzas, it wasn't just visual.
261440	264120	There was a wonderful smell, a wonderful taste, and so forth.
264120	268520	So we experience the world through our five senses in all sorts of ways.
268520	271640	What makes that kind of experience possible?
271640	276240	Well the first thing Kant says, turning to sensibility now, he draws a sharp line between
276240	278680	sensibility and understanding.
278680	284240	In short between perception and reason, whatever our minds do on the basis of our experience
285040	288800	how we process and then draw inferences from our perceptions.
288800	290920	But let's turn first to sensibility.
290920	295960	Just for us to have those sensations, to be able to experience the White House, or sunsets,
295960	302200	or pizza, well those things have to be represented in space and time.
302200	307680	So space and time, he says, are a priori forms of sensibility.
307680	311480	Vision obviously represents things as being in space.
311520	318080	Vision does too, maybe less obviously, nevertheless, if you close your eyes and somebody around
318080	321240	you is making noise, you can tell where the noise is coming from.
321240	326320	Your auditory system does represent things as being in space and time.
326320	330480	Now smell, taste, well not so much.
330480	335440	But on the other hand, they still occur in time, you anticipate the taste of the pizza,
335440	339160	you actually enjoy the taste, afterwards you remember the taste.
339160	341720	And so that occurs in time.
341720	345080	We perceive things as being in space and time.
345080	350200	So here's something we can say, and we can say it a priori independently of experience.
350200	352880	Perceptible objects exist in space and time.
352880	355040	That is a synthetic a priori truth.
355040	360840	It is based on the general form of sensibility, the form of sensibility as representing things
360840	363920	in space and time.
363920	368440	I've referred to the metaphor in another video of a projector.
368440	372680	One sees the mind as something like a projector projecting an image on a screen.
372680	376440	We can know something about what's going to be on the screen and what couldn't be on
376440	379960	the screen on the basis of understanding the projector.
379960	383920	So he thinks, here's one thing I can tell you about the projector, just due to the nature
383920	389480	of our own faculty of sensibility and the way our mind processes whatever it receives,
389480	392320	things are perceived in space and time.
392320	396680	Things on that screen will have a spatial arrangement and they will occur in a temporal
396680	397680	series.
397680	400800	I can tell you that before anything appears on that screen.
400800	403040	So that's something I can know that's synthetic.
403040	405400	It's really about the things on the screen.
405400	410720	It's not just something purely logical or verbal, like a screen is a screen, what appears
410720	411720	will appear.
411720	413840	I mean, it's not like that, right?
413840	415600	It's something that gives you real information.
415600	416840	It will be in space.
416840	418320	It will be in time.
418320	422200	And I can know that not because I actually perceive them in space and time, and I say,
422200	426880	I'm figuring out, you know, I perceive things, I guess these things I perceive are in space
426880	427880	and time.
427880	428880	Who knew?
428880	431600	He'll say, no, I could really know that a priori.
431600	437360	I know that just by knowing something about the way my mind processes information.
437360	441320	Now the categories are the part that pertains to the understanding.
441320	443640	Space and time are forms of sensibility.
443640	445840	But there are also forms of understanding.
445840	449680	Things my mind does with the information it receives from sensation.
449680	452440	So sensibility gives the mind information.
452440	455360	And then he says a complex synthesis takes place.
455360	458800	A synthesis of the manifold of intuition is how he puts it.
458800	463640	And we construct objects out of that in, broadly speaking, a three-stage process.
463640	465640	I won't go through all the stages here.
465640	469880	What I'm interested in today is this question of the categories.
469880	475240	What pure concepts of the understanding are required in order for those stages of synthesis
475240	477160	to take place?
477160	482000	He says, well, we can find out by looking at the logical functions of judgment.
482000	486480	The traditional rationalists had thought about universality and necessity.
486480	491880	And indeed Kant says universality and necessity are absolutely fundamental for understanding
491880	497720	why we need synthetic a priori truths and why we need pure concepts of the understanding.
497720	501880	But if we want to know what those pure concepts are, they aren't just to universality and
501880	502880	necessity.
502880	504480	It's more complicated than that.
504480	508320	We look to the functions of judgment in logic.
508320	512520	And we say what is going on in a logical judgment?
512520	515360	Kant says there are basically four things going on.
515360	518880	And so there are four families of categories.
518880	523920	The first thing that goes on in a judgment is quantity.
523920	528920	We talk about things like Socrates was a philosopher.
528920	532040	We talk about sometimes groups of things.
532040	535280	Some ancient Greeks were prominent philosophers.
535280	537520	We talk sometimes about a totality.
537520	540160	Those were the universality comes in.
540160	545560	All forces applied to a mass accelerate that mass.
545560	548160	And so those are basic categories.
548160	552280	Things that today in logic would refer to as quantifiers or as determiners.
552280	561640	So things like sum, all, several, every, any, these things function as indicators of quantity.
561640	564160	They are part of the logical functions of judgment.
564160	566600	And the same thing is true about objects.
566600	571580	One, unity, plurality, telling the difference between one and more than one.
571580	580720	As well as demonstrative things like this, that, in effect, this one, that one, the.
580720	585360	All of those are things that fall under this general category of quality.
585360	588680	So those are words that indicate these general categories.
588680	593080	We have ways of talking about objects, of telling one from more than one, of talking
593080	598040	about some things, several things, all, every, each thing, anything.
598040	599800	All of those are categories.
599800	601460	Those have to be built into the mind.
601460	603600	Those aren't things we get from experience.
603600	608120	You can say, well, I've learned about pigs by having encounters with pigs and, you know,
608120	610080	working on a pig farm and so forth.
610080	612640	How did you learn about this?
612640	613640	Well, this what?
613640	615960	No, I just mean the word this.
615960	618760	How did you learn what each meant?
618760	621280	How did you learn several?
621280	624000	How did you learn to distinguish one thing from more than one thing?
624000	627960	The person's going to be like, well, do you mean how I learned the meaning of the word?
627960	629560	No, no, no, I don't mean that.
629560	634400	I mean, how you ever got the concept of one as opposed to more than one.
634400	642520	Well, can't point to an experience of that and constantly, yes, the mind came with that.
642520	644960	Okay, that was part of the building structure of the mind.
644960	650240	The mind is capable of combining things into objects, distinguishing one object from multiple
650240	656640	objects is capable of actually then explaining something about these pluralities of objects
656640	660920	and talking about one, some, several, and so forth.
660920	663900	And so all of those come as built-in structures.
663900	668240	We aren't gaining those logical meanings from experience.
668240	671600	We aren't understanding those logical concepts from experience.
671600	674960	The logical concepts are part of the structure of the mind.
674960	677240	Here's a second thing that goes on in judgments.
677240	679280	We judge quality.
679280	684280	So we affirm things, we deny things, and we express some limitations.
684280	690920	So Kant says, yes, we say Socrates is a philosopher or somebody can say, was Socrates the teacher
690920	691920	of Plato?
691920	694240	Yes, that's true.
694240	696740	Those things are actually affirming something.
696740	703780	We can also say Socrates was not a plumber and that Socrates was not the teacher of Aristotle.
703780	708900	We can say then the claim that Socrates lived after Aristotle is false.
708900	711100	So we can also deny things.
711100	717020	So our ideas of is and is not, true and false, yes and no.
717020	719980	These are things that are, again, built into the mind.
719980	721220	This, that.
721220	723120	We don't learn those things through experience.
723120	724220	We may learn the gesture.
724220	728060	We may learn the words, but we don't learn the concepts from experience.
728060	730340	The mind comes with those built in.
730340	733980	And the same thing he says is true with limitation.
733980	739860	Something like unhappy or ahistorical or inauthentic.
739860	742140	You might think, well, those are just denials.
742140	744740	But Kant thinks not really, okay?
744740	749580	Say I talk to somebody, I say, well, how are you feeling today?
749580	750580	You feeling happy?
750580	753860	They say, well, I don't know.
753860	754860	You're unhappy?
754860	756980	Well, I don't know.
756980	757980	Okay?
757980	762060	There's sort of a, sometimes we'll say, well, I'm not unhappy, right?
762060	764740	Is not unhappy the same as happy?
764740	765740	Not really, okay?
765740	768020	And that's what Kant's picking up on here.
768020	770380	He's saying, yeah, is that authentic?
770380	774220	Well, it's not inauthentic.
774220	777700	That's not simply an affirmation that it is authentic.
777700	782620	Or if I refer to that as ahistorical, does that just mean it is not historical?
782620	783940	Well, maybe.
783940	788260	But sometimes it really means, no, it goes contrary to the history.
788260	793420	And so anyway, I can easily, in fact, you might say most of us spend many hours of our
793420	797780	lives in states that are neither happy nor unhappy.
797780	802180	And so all of those things are built into the mind at the outset.
802180	806340	Well, another category is the category of relation.
806340	809620	And there are all sorts of interesting and important relations, Kant says.
809620	812620	Some of them involve inheritance and subsistence.
812620	817380	You might remember this from the categories of the Vaisesika tradition as they developed
817380	821180	beyond the original three in the Vaisesika Sutra.
821180	827660	So we've got is, the is of predication, like this is a hand.
827660	835700	We've got substance, quality, property, exemplifies, participates in, has, instantiates, for example,
835700	841900	for instance, such as, all of those refer to concepts that we're not gaining from experience.
841900	846820	The relation of this triangle to triangularity, we don't get that from experience.
846820	849700	That's something the mind is built understanding.
849700	854380	That is built into the structure of the mind, identifying things as objects, having the concept
854380	858540	of substance, of those qualities hanging together in something.
858540	863180	Notice these are just the things that empiricists, like Barkley and Hume said, I don't see how
863180	866940	you can get any of this from experience.
866940	869060	Kant says, of course you can't.
869060	871020	They come built into the mind.
871020	872680	They don't come from experience.
872680	874140	But of course we have these concepts.
874140	878140	Don't tell me we don't have the concept is that we don't have the concept of a substance
878140	885140	or quality or a property or of this participating in triangularity or exhibiting triangularity
885140	890140	or this being an example of this more general phenomenon, of course we have those concepts.
890140	893380	So and it's not just some internal custom of the mind.
893380	896860	It's something that the mind has built into it as its structure.
896860	900380	Now actually, there is a sense in which Kant's saying, well, it is a custom of the mind.
900380	905780	You're right about that Hume, but it's the structure of logic that is built into the
905780	906780	mind.
906780	908380	That's not some feeling or sentiment.
908380	909780	It's not outside of reason.
909780	912220	It is the very foundation of reason.
912220	915220	The same thing is true with causality and dependence.
915220	923020	If then relations cause, affect, because, depends, determines, grounds, all of those involve
923020	927420	various aspects of this relation of causality or dependence.
927420	932580	And then there are relations of community, of things being interdependent, reciprocity,
932580	939660	if and only if and or unless, part, whole, with, tons of these things happen in language
939660	942980	and they all refer to these relations of community.
942980	947980	The mind is built in such a way that it understands things as sometimes interrelated in various
947980	948980	ways.
948980	949980	It doesn't have to learn that.
949980	953900	Now it might have to learn a particular way in which things are interrelated, but the
953900	958660	idea that things can be related to one another in this way, the mind doesn't have to learn
958660	959660	that.
959660	963780	It comes built in recognizing that.
963780	967420	Then finally there are modal aspects of a judgment.
967420	972660	So we can talk about possibility, necessity, existence, non-existence.
972660	976180	He says there are three basic dichotomies here.
976180	980940	Possibility and impossibility, so words like possible can, may, might, could, and the concepts
980940	982900	they stand for.
982900	988780	Consistence and non-existence, so is, exists, will, and so forth.
988780	996060	Necessity and contingency, necessary, must, needs to, has to, would, all of those involve
996060	998020	some kind of modality.
998020	1000560	And he says those are important.
1000560	1002860	Those are built into the structure of the mind.
1002860	1003860	Hume's right.
1003860	1005580	We don't get necessity from experience.
1005580	1007660	We don't get causation from experience.
1007660	1010940	We don't get possibility from experience.
1010940	1013300	But they're crucial parts of logic.
1013300	1015580	They are part of the foundations of reason.
1015580	1019260	So don't tell me we have no such concepts, or that they're outside the realm of reason,
1019260	1022900	or that they're just emotions and feelings of expectation.
1022900	1023900	Nonsense.
1023900	1026140	They are part of the logical functions of judgment.
1026140	1029500	They're built into logic, the very foundation of reason.
1029500	1035420	Well, when we think about advances in logic since Kant's day, we can say maybe modern
1035420	1039580	logicians should recognize as a variety of other categories, still within his basic
1039580	1041460	families of categories.
1041460	1045420	Under the heading of quantity, there are lots of other words and concepts that go along.
1045420	1051340	In addition to the ones he mentioned, so many, few, most, more, less, finitely many, infinitely
1051340	1055060	many, countably many, uncountably many.
1055060	1058100	And then what I've marked here is a little null symbol.
1058100	1062100	In other words, I mean whatever we say, what we mean when we talk about things in terms
1062100	1069420	of bear plurals, tigers are striped for example, lions are tawny, cats meow, birds fly.
1069420	1074300	Tigers going on there, presumably that's a kind of quantity or kind of something that
1074300	1076060	is built into the mind.
1076060	1080900	They're qualities, and not only the things he mentions, but also things involving temporal
1080900	1081900	relations.
1081900	1087100	They arise through sensibility, but we also have built in concepts for understanding things
1087100	1089060	as arranged in time.
1089060	1094700	So verb tenses, for example, or various indicators of aspects, like the difference between runs
1094700	1096980	and is running and used to run.
1096980	1103980	And then prepositions like before, after, since, until, now, then, all of those are temporal
1103980	1106540	things that seem to be built into the mind.
1106540	1113140	Similarly, there are other relations, like equality or similarity, like, near, far, closer
1113140	1115460	than, between, belongs to.
1115460	1120300	And then maybe other modalities, ones he doesn't directly talk about, but like may, should,
1120300	1124660	not, things that again, human worries can't be derived from experience, and Kant would
1124660	1127660	say, yeah, they're built into the nature of the mind.
1127660	1132540	But also things like generally, typically, normally, maybe other things like knowing,
1132540	1138820	believing, seeing, fearing, wanting, maybe all of those are built into the mind as well.
1138820	1143780	Whatever we want to say exactly about the boundaries there, we should be able to say,
1143780	1150260	okay, things like that are presumably maybe part of this idea of the pure concepts of
1150260	1151780	the understanding as well.
1151780	1158380	They relate to the pure concepts in the sense that they relate to logical functions of judgment.
1158380	1162660	Well what kinds of principles of the understanding do we build out of these pure concepts of
1162660	1163940	the understanding?
1163940	1166260	Here are some examples Kant gives.
1166260	1170740	Every object stands under the necessary conditions of the synthetic unity of the manifold of
1170740	1173300	intuition in a possible experience.
1173300	1175700	Let me translate from the Kantian language.
1175700	1180100	He says, every object of experience, is in effect something that would be displayed
1180100	1182020	on that screen we've talked about.
1182020	1187660	I can know that all the objects have to conform to the conditions of being on that screen,
1187660	1189980	so they all have to conform to space and time.
1189980	1193620	They all have to conform to the logical functions of judgment.
1193620	1196020	And so they have to be one or many.
1196020	1199380	They have to either be related to one another or not.
1199380	1202360	They have to be in a relation of dependence or not.
1202360	1204600	They have to have some modal character.
1204600	1208920	Either they are there now or they could be there, they were there, they will be there.
1208920	1212200	We can say something about all those structures before they even appear.
1212200	1217400	They are subject to the conditions of the synthesis of the unity of the manifold.
1217400	1221600	In other words, the way in which projector forms objects and projects them onto the screen
1221600	1223280	of experience.
1223280	1227560	Secondly, in all change of appearances, substance is permanent.
1227560	1230680	Its quantum in nature is neither increased nor diminished.
1230680	1234880	A kind of law of conservation of substance, conservation of matter.
1234880	1239280	Well after Einstein, we're inclined to think, I don't know about that, that would cut.
1239280	1243280	But of course physics still maintains a law of the conservation of energy.
1243280	1247000	And when you think about this one, you can say, well, cut is onto something interesting
1247000	1248000	here.
1248000	1251760	What he's saying is that substance is that in which quality is in here.
1251760	1256040	And so whatever you want to say about that, whatever it is the quality is in here, and
1256040	1259560	maybe in modern physics we want to say, well it's not exactly substance, it's energy,
1259560	1262240	or it's waves, or something.
1262240	1266000	I mean whatever physical theory ends up saying about that.
1266000	1269000	Maybe it'll be a string in hyperspace, who knows.
1269000	1272440	But whatever it is, we could say that remains the same.
1272440	1277800	It's quality's change, but in the end we postulate that something is enduring across
1277800	1280000	these changes of quality.
1280000	1284600	So that idea that something endures across change, whether we call it substance or something
1284600	1288440	else, he says is a basic feature of the mind.
1288800	1293720	Third, all alterations, all changes take place in conformity with the law of the connection
1293720	1294720	of cause and effect.
1294720	1299200	In other words, things just don't happen randomly and spontaneously.
1299200	1301440	Things cause other things.
1301440	1303680	Things that happen are effects of other things.
1303680	1306320	So cause and effect applies to the world.
1306320	1310680	We can know that because we can know something about the projector, and knows that it projects
1310680	1313680	things as causally related to one another.
1313680	1318880	And finally, we know that it also projects them as interrelated with one another.
1318880	1323840	All substances insofar as they can be perceived to coexist in space are in thorough-growing
1323840	1325520	reciprocity.
1325520	1329760	So we know that the projector is such that the objects of experience are represented
1329760	1334520	as together there in space and time, as in some sense together there under the logical
1334520	1336680	functions of judgment.
1336680	1340920	So in effect he's saying, look, it's built into the mind that we're seeing things on
1340920	1346400	one screen, that we're building one universe, one universal experience.
1346400	1349840	It's not as if we're experiencing some multiverse.
1349840	1353440	And different things are going on, and there are these different realms of objects that
1353440	1355400	are simply completely unrelated.
1355400	1358840	The mind is projecting things on all sorts of different screens at once.
1358840	1363960	No, there is one screen of experience, he's saying, and everything is in some way on that
1363960	1370480	screen related to the same logical functions, related to one another, on the same screen
1370480	1374120	in the same spatiotemporal manifold.
1374120	1378480	So out of that he says we do get some synthetic a priori judgments.
1378480	1381120	Things like physical objects are in space and time.
1381120	1383680	Mathematics, he thinks, follows from this.
1383680	1388280	The world consists of objects having properties, standing in relation to one another.
1388280	1390240	Substances persist through change.
1390240	1391960	Every event has a cause.
1391960	1394600	Everything relates in some way to everything else.
1394600	1397440	Those he thinks we can know independently of experience.
1397440	1400320	But they apply only to the phenomena.
1400320	1405360	Only to the things as we perceive them, only to the objects of experience.
1405360	1407320	The categories apply to those.
1407320	1409440	The a priori principles apply to those.
1409440	1414920	We can know them with universality and necessity because they fall under the pure concepts
1414920	1416520	of the understanding.
1416520	1421480	But the numinal, the things in themselves, the categories don't apply to them.
1421480	1424040	The a priori principles don't apply to them.
1424040	1426640	We don't know about them at all.
1426640	1430800	So Kant says, think about our diagram over here.
1430800	1434980	Think about this picture of the mind projecting the objects of experience.
1434980	1440720	We can know things about those because in the projection the mind is representing them
1440720	1442760	as being in space and time.
1442760	1448040	The mind is representing them as being susceptible to the logical forms of judgment.
1448040	1449960	And so the categories apply to them.
1449960	1452240	We can say this is one triangle.
1452240	1454860	We can talk about it as an object.
1454860	1460060	We can do a variety of other things indicating what must be true of it.
1460060	1465540	And all of that indicates that those principles, those a priori principles, the laws of the
1465540	1467940	understanding apply here.
1467940	1474260	But now if we move down to the realm of things in themselves, the realm he refers to as the
1474260	1484460	numinal, the numinal realm, then we say, we can't say anything about those at all.
1484460	1489100	They are outside of what is on that screen of experience.
1489100	1494660	And so our concepts aren't applying to them, those pure concepts of the understanding.
1494660	1496940	Those laws of the understanding don't apply to them.
1496940	1500820	I can't say they have a certain character because the things projected on the screen
1500820	1501820	do.
1501820	1503620	I don't know what they're like.
1503620	1506940	And so in the end he says, I can know things a priori.
1506940	1513420	I can know things a priori about the objects of experience precisely because my mind is
1513420	1519740	taking information, synthesizing it in a multi-stage process and producing these objects
1519740	1521660	of experience.
1521660	1524940	And so I can know something about what they're going to be like.
1524940	1527460	I have no idea what the world beyond them is like.
