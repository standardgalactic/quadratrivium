0	14100	One of the most basic philosophical questions is the relation between mind and world.
14100	17080	How exactly does my mind relate to the world?
17080	21320	I hope to know things about the world, I hope to understand it, I hope to be able to act
21320	26760	in the world in a way that makes sense, is reasonable, and will let me succeed at achieving
26760	28880	my goals.
28880	29880	But it's hard to do that.
29880	35520	I don't know how the thoughts, the desires, the intentions, the plans I make, the other
35520	39240	aspects of my mental life correspond to the world.
39240	43720	So the question of the relationship between mind and world is really fundamental.
43720	48840	I want to know to what extent they correspond and various things that I think I want to
48840	52640	know whether they're reflecting things that are really going on in the world or whether
52640	58080	they're things that I am contributing, that I am maybe hoping for or fantasizing or in
58080	61160	some other way getting wrong about reality.
61160	64760	It's going to affect the way I act, it's going to affect the way I think, what I take
64760	69720	to be a belief, what I take to be knowledge, I'm going to get into a lot of trouble conceivably
69720	74640	if I've got a lot of things going on in my mind that correspond to nothing in the world.
74640	79000	Descartes and Locke draw a fundamental distinction that's supposed to help us understand this
79000	83920	question, the distinction between primary qualities of objects and secondary qualities.
83920	87400	The primary qualities are really in the things themselves.
87400	93400	They're inseparable from the things themselves, they're constant, whereas the secondary qualities
93400	96800	are a matter of how those things affect us.
96800	98840	They're being contributed by the mind.
98840	103840	So our ideas of secondary qualities, things like colors and tastes and textures, those
103840	107680	are not really in the world, those are being contributed by the mind.
107680	113040	But things like extension, solidity, mass, movement, those are really in the world, those
113040	116280	are primary qualities of the things themselves.
116280	119960	So to some extent our minds are getting the world right, Descartes and Locke think.
119960	122600	They are matching characteristics of the world.
122600	127440	Descartes and Locke are what we had called today scientific realists.
127440	132160	Science is revealing the real essences of things, the true nature of things, and the
132160	136800	qualities that are identified by science as going on in the world, those are the real
136800	138520	qualities of objects.
138520	142120	But everything else is something that our mind is contributing, it's a question of
142120	146360	how those things are affecting our perceptual and cognitive faculties.
146360	150120	They're not really in the world.
150120	155000	That kind of distinction between the qualities that are really in the things themselves,
155000	159180	and described by science, and the things that are not really in the things themselves but
159180	165360	contributed by the mind, came under surprising and sustained attack.
165360	170560	It was begun by Bishop Barkley, responding to Locke, continued by David Hume, and then
170560	175760	spawns an entire idealist tradition that has dominated much of the philosophical world
175760	178080	for the last couple of centuries.
178080	183080	So it's sort of surprising that that took place, given that our ordinary attitude I
183080	187200	think is very much in line with a primary, secondary quality distinction.
187200	191880	But today I want to talk about Barkley and Hume and their attack on that distinction,
191880	193640	their conception of qualities.
193640	197920	They're going to say there is no place for the kind of distinction that Descartes and
197920	203640	Locke are drawing, no way for us to say those qualities are really in the objects themselves.
203640	207280	In fact, in their view, everything is going to end up being something like a secondary
207280	212080	quality, everything really turns out to depend on the mind.
212080	217520	Well, Bishop George Barkley himself was the Dean of Derry.
217520	221040	He was Irish, lived in Northern Ireland specifically.
221040	226600	He was a philosopher of the 18th century, as you can see here, and he was a very notable
226600	231520	character, important in the history of philosophy for starting that entire tradition within
231520	233160	Western philosophy.
233160	239720	Here you see him pictured with a group of people referred to as his entourage.
239720	245160	Barkley held that idealism, the thesis that everything in the world is mind dependent,
245160	249160	that the entire world, as we understand it, is really a projection or construction of
249160	250160	the mind.
250160	253880	That's the best defense of common sense against skepticism.
253880	258560	He thinks in particular that Descartes and Locke's ideas of objects make no sense and
258560	261800	attacks the concept of a primary quality.
261800	266520	He correspondingly attacks the concept of a substance, of a material object in general.
266520	269200	In the end, he says there are only ideas.
269200	271840	The entire world is a construction of the mind.
271840	276120	The world has to be understood as fundamentally mental or spiritual.
276120	280720	Well, how does this constitute a defense against skepticism?
280720	283200	You might think of it as a surrender to the skeptic.
283200	286840	After all, Barkley seems to be saying, well, gosh, mind.
286840	289480	Everything is really mind, so nothing corresponds to the world.
289480	292240	Wow, why aren't we skeptics as a result?
292240	294040	He doesn't think that's what he's doing.
294040	299040	Instead, he thinks what's happening is that the danger of skepticism is the gap between
299040	300040	mind and world.
300040	302360	I've got a set of ideas about things.
302360	307760	I think certain things are true about the world, and if there's a gap between the way
307760	311880	I think and what's really going on in the world, then there is the danger that a lot
311880	317760	of my thinking diverges, and a lot of my beliefs diverge from the way the world really is.
317760	319840	That's what gives skepticism its power.
319840	324340	We think about scenarios where I'm wrong about this or that, or maybe everything as
324340	326840	in Descartes' evil deceiver scenario.
326840	330400	Well, how does he propose to get rid of that?
330400	334040	Notice Descartes and Locke are saying, let's use science to help address that.
334040	336640	Some things, yes, we're going to have to surrender to the skeptics.
336640	338280	There really are no colors.
338280	340200	There really are no textures.
340200	342660	But there really is such a thing as mass.
342660	345240	There really is extension in space.
345240	349800	There really is solidity and motion and so forth.
349800	355160	Barkley and Hume both are going to say, I don't think that will do it.
355160	358060	Science will not give us a way of drawing that distinction.
358060	363040	The best way of getting rid of the gap between mind and world is to push the world up into
363040	364680	the mind.
364680	370120	If the world is mental through and through, if all we've got are ideas, there's no problem
370120	372280	that how our ideas match the world.
372280	374400	The world consists of our ideas.
374400	375400	That's it.
375400	378680	So there's a sense in which it does get rid of skepticism.
378680	383080	It gets rid of the gap between mind and the world because the world is entirely mental.
383080	385980	It is itself a projection or construction of mind.
385980	387440	So there is no gap.
387440	392020	There's no place for the skeptic to get a foothold and drive a wedge and say, maybe
392020	393560	we're wrong about this.
393560	394560	What do you mean?
394560	396280	We're wrong about our own ideas?
396280	398800	Our ideas are our ideas.
398800	399800	That is the world.
399800	400800	That's all there is.
400800	403080	There isn't any longer any gap.
403080	406720	Well, that's an unusual strategy.
406720	410480	But let's go back to what Descartes and Locke have in mind and see why Barclay thinks it
410480	411480	doesn't work.
411480	415400	A primary quality is in the object itself.
415400	416400	It's constant.
416400	420960	It's the thing that we find even in the most minute part of the object.
420960	427760	So things like extension, figure, motion, rest, solidity, impenetrability, number.
427760	430400	These are things that are there in the wheatberry.
430400	433320	They're also there in the flour.
433320	435680	The secondary qualities can differ.
435680	438440	They are the powers of the object to affect us.
438440	441600	They are often not in its minute parts.
441600	446440	So the color of the object, once we pound it, may become quite different.
446440	448680	The way it sounds may be quite different.
448680	453120	Drop a pound of flour on the floor, it's going to sound differently from a pound of wheatberries
453120	455400	being dropped on the floor.
455400	460000	And in general, the secondary qualities are going to change between the large parts of
460000	462760	the object and the small parts of the object.
462760	465440	Sometimes we will perceive them that way, sometimes not.
465440	471120	They are dependent on the mind, dependent on our own perceptual and cognitive faculties.
471120	473400	Well, that's the distinction.
473400	475080	That's the way it's supposed to go.
475080	480120	But Barclay says, actually, we have no basis for thinking that any of our ideas correspond
480120	482840	to some mind-independent reality.
482840	487520	The whole idea here is supposed to be that some ideas, like the idea of mass or the idea
487520	492960	of velocity, the idea of motion, the idea of taking up some space, those really correspond
492960	494240	to the world.
494240	496880	But things like color and texture and taste don't.
496880	501160	Barclay says, actually, I don't see how there's a basis for thinking that any of them do,
501160	503320	even the primary ones.
503320	505600	There are several reasons he gives for this.
505600	509920	One of the arguments is that we can't judge their resemblance to reality.
510000	513040	Locke and Descartes say the primary qualities are adequate.
513040	515960	They correspond to the way the world really is.
515960	517960	Barclay says, how would you know?
517960	524080	Our perceptions of heights, of weight, of width, and so on, he says moreover, are not
524080	525080	constant.
525080	528000	They vary while the objects remain unchanged.
528000	529640	So that's the second argument.
529640	532200	First argument is there's no way to judge this resemblance.
532200	533200	We can't have access.
533200	537760	We basically can't get outside of our heads to judge whether our ideas are matching the
537760	538760	world.
538760	544240	One is, you say the test is whether they're constant and invariable and inseparable.
544240	548200	Actually primary qualities are just as inseparable, just as variable.
548200	552000	So let's look at those arguments in turn.
552000	554280	Here is the first argument about resemblance.
554280	558160	Barclay says an idea can be like nothing but an idea.
558160	562120	A color or figure can be like nothing but another color, another figure.
562120	566760	If we look but ever so little into our thoughts, we shall find it impossible for us to conceive
566760	570160	a likeness except only between our ideas.
570160	575560	So the whole thought of Locke and Descartes of a primary quality is it's an idea that
575560	576560	matches the world.
576560	579400	But what do you mean, match the world?
579400	583760	What do you mean there's a resemblance between this, that it's adequate in the sense that
583760	587640	it matches or corresponds to what's in the world exactly?
587640	592960	How would we know is partly Barclay's issue, and partly the issue is what without even
592960	593960	mean.
593960	594960	An idea is an idea.
595080	599840	It's something in my mind, and it's supposed to be something that corresponds to or matches
599840	603080	precisely or resembles something that's really in the world.
603080	606560	Well, I don't understand what this sense of resemblance could be.
606560	610880	So I don't know what it would mean for an idea to resemble something that's not an idea,
610880	615600	but also even if that made sense, I wouldn't know how on earth to get outside the realm
615600	620520	of my ideas to be able to compare it to a thing unaffected by my ideas.
620520	625760	So in a way he's giving us a version of that argument from comparison, saying I am always
625760	632600	perceiving a thing as processed by my faculties, I am always perceiving the thing by virtue
632600	633800	of an idea.
633800	635720	What's before my mind is always an idea.
635720	639000	I can't compare the idea to something that is not an idea.
639000	644520	I can compare ideas to ideas that I can do, but I can't compare ideas to something else.
644520	651360	So not only do I deny he's saying that there is any way for there to be a resemblance here,
651360	653560	but even if there were, how could I know it?
653560	657600	I'd never be able to get at the thing itself to compare.
657600	662680	So I think what really is going on here is something that relates to Locke's conception.
662680	667040	When we were talking about Locke on ideas, I pointed out that the way he characterizes
667040	669400	them is actually somewhat puzzling.
669400	674160	He says that an idea is whatsoever is the object of the understanding what a man thinks.
674160	678400	It's whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking.
678400	681600	It's what his mind is applied about while thinking.
681600	686720	Well, I tried to reconstruct that in terms of first-order cognitive abilities, but Barclay
686720	690640	is taking Locke's words very literally and very directly.
690640	692840	He's saying it's what I'm thinking about.
692840	695240	It is what is before my mind when I'm thinking.
695240	701800	Well, if that's right, then I can never think about the triangle, for example, directly.
701800	705800	I never think about the paper directly.
705800	708960	Always what's before the mind is my idea of the paper.
708960	712800	So my thoughts are really about the idea.
712800	717000	Now that's what worried us before about Locke's definition, but Barclay is going to push that
717000	718000	in a certain direction.
718000	722680	He's going to say, look, if what's before my mind when I'm thinking is always an idea,
722680	726840	and then you ask me to judge resemblance, what am I doing?
726840	728600	What's before the mind here?
728600	730360	Let's say it's these two hands.
730360	733320	I'm asked to judge whether this is similar to that.
733320	738560	OK, I can know how to do that because they're hands, but what am I doing when I do it?
738560	743920	I've got two ideas, two perceptions in my mind, and I'm comparing those.
743920	746480	So I'm doing it by comparing the ideas.
746480	749600	Now you say, don't compare the two hands to one another.
749600	752960	Don't compare the two ideas of the hands you have to one another.
752960	758640	Instead, compare the idea of this hand to the hand as it is in itself without using an
758640	760080	idea.
760080	764560	But wait, whatever's before my mind when I think is an idea according to Locke, I never
764560	770080	get at the thing itself without an idea in the way, without an idea in between.
770080	771480	So I can't do it.
771480	776160	A, I don't know what it even means since I have no experience of these things in themselves
776160	779440	to say what that kind of resemblance would even be.
779440	784400	But even if it makes sense, I can't get out of the realm of ideas to do it.
784400	787960	Every time I employ my mind in thinking, I've got an idea.
787960	793040	So at best, I could compare my idea of the thing to the idea of the thing.
793040	794360	Maybe I could do that.
794360	797360	But to compare the idea to the thing, impossible.
797360	799360	No way for me to do it.
799360	803800	Here is a little diagram that might indicate the general kind of thing that Locke seems
803800	808080	to have in mind and what drives Barclay crazy about it.
808080	811600	Within my mind, I have a certain thought of a triangle, let's say, since that's my favorite
811600	813640	example throughout this course.
813640	816960	That thought has a certain content, hey, that's a triangle.
816960	820200	It's using the content of my idea of a triangle.
820200	823400	And that represents that individual object.
823400	826360	Well, okay, that's supposed to be the picture.
826360	830120	And indeed, often that's described as the representative theory of perception.
830120	834400	I represent the triangle in my mind.
834400	836040	But wait a minute, Barclay says.
836040	839080	I don't quite understand what's happening here.
839080	842880	Let's take a look at how this is supposed to develop.
842880	847080	I've got an object I'm perceiving here, like this triangle.
847080	852760	And I within my mind do that by having a thought.
852760	854240	There's a relation of perception.
854240	860000	I perceive the triangle, so in some way the triangle is causing me to have this perception.
860000	861400	And it's got a certain content.
861400	865560	It's related to my idea or concept of a triangle.
865560	871240	And that concept applies to that triangle.
871240	875600	I'm leaving out a lot of things here about the word that might go along and relations
875600	878560	of meaning and reference and all of that.
878560	881640	But the point emerges with something very simple.
881640	883160	Because notice what's going on.
883160	885280	How am I able to think about this triangle?
885280	888840	I think about it by virtue of the fact of having an idea.
888840	894360	Now I say whenever I'm thinking, that's what's before the mind, the idea.
894360	897680	So think of the mind as something like a screen.
897680	901280	And what's playing on the screen are my ideas.
901280	908920	Ah, now the question that Locke and Descartes are trying to solve is this question of the
908920	915360	relationship between my idea and the thing.
915360	920600	I want to know whether there is in particular the kind of resemblance that will allow me
920600	922960	to say this idea is adequate to the thing.
922960	925200	It's a good representation of the thing.
925200	929200	I want there to be a relation of representation here.
929200	933520	And so I need to judge the adequacy of this to use Locke's term.
933520	940520	And I'm going to do that, Barkley says, in terms of resemblance.
940520	942680	But now notice what's going on.
942680	946440	I have to judge the resemblance between my idea and the thing.
946440	952920	But everything that is within my mind here that I have access to is an idea.
952920	955040	So how do I get the thing itself?
955040	963640	I've got to compare now this, that idea, to this, this thing.
963640	966040	But how on earth do I do that?
966040	968160	You want me to think about that thing in itself?
968160	971480	Well, I do that by virtue of having this idea.
971480	979400	If you want me to think about the idea, OK, I guess I can have an idea of an idea.
979400	982840	But notice, that's not going to help me.
982840	984560	I still don't get at this relation.
984560	986760	I now have to think about this relation.
986760	988680	You say, well, think about the idea of that.
988680	991040	Well now I get something else here.
991040	993920	I can have ideas about my ideas about my ideas.
993920	994920	But you get the point.
994920	997600	I never get outside of my own mind to the thing itself.
997600	999680	So I can't judge the resemblance.
999680	1005040	So first of all, I have no experience of this kind of relationship between an idea and a
1005040	1006200	thing.
1006200	1008760	And remember, Barkley, like Locke, is an empiricist.
1008800	1014240	He's saying, if I have an idea, it's coming from some impression, some perception or experience.
1014240	1016320	But I don't have an experience of this.
1016320	1020760	All the mental experiencing I'm having of comparing is within my own mind of ideas to
1020760	1025080	ideas, or ideas of one thing to ideas of another thing.
1025080	1028480	And then, where could I do this?
1028480	1032880	It's the moment you ask me this question and make me think about it, I'm forming more
1032880	1034000	ideas.
1034000	1035720	And so I never get at the thing itself.
1035720	1037960	I can't get out of it.
1037960	1040960	Now that's part of what's driving Barkley crazy.
1040960	1045840	But part of it is, and this is beautiful in a way, he frames this in terms of a dilemma
1045840	1047000	for Locke.
1047000	1049680	He says, look, I don't understand.
1049680	1052400	In this kind of picture, can I think about the triangle?
1052400	1054440	Can I perceive the triangle?
1054440	1061280	He says, I ask whether these supposed originals or external things, of which our ideas are
1061280	1065840	the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or no.
1065840	1069360	If they are, then they're ideas.
1069360	1070920	And we've gained our point.
1070920	1075840	But if you say they're not, I appeal to anyone whether it be sense to assert that a color
1075840	1080520	is like something that's invisible, hard or soft like something that's intangible, and
1080520	1082620	so on of the rest.
1082620	1088440	So he's basically saying, OK, I want to ask you a question about this thing.
1088440	1094480	I want to ask a question about this triangle, the thing itself, this external object, this
1094480	1096360	original, as he puts it.
1096360	1098920	And I want to say, is that something I can perceive or no?
1098920	1101920	Locke, you've said that ideas are what's before the mind.
1101920	1105680	Well, you also characterize this in representational terms.
1105680	1109480	That idea is supposed to represent the thing out there in the mind, or out there in the
1109480	1110480	world.
1110480	1114480	Well, can I perceive that thing or not?
1114480	1120760	If you say yes, I can perceive that thing, wait a minute, what do I perceive?
1120760	1122960	Everything before the mind is an idea.
1122960	1128120	So if you answer yes, I can perceive this, you've just put it in the mind and made it
1128120	1131920	into an idea by your own definition of idea.
1131920	1134600	So as you say, no, I can't perceive it.
1134600	1138040	Only ideas are the things I perceive.
1138040	1142600	Then it's even worse, because now you're saying, OK, I can't perceive this.
1142600	1143600	I can't see it.
1143600	1144840	It's invisible.
1144840	1148960	And you're saying this idea is like something invisible?
1148960	1152600	That doesn't make any sense.
1152640	1154840	Little things don't have three sides and three angles.
1154840	1156600	This has three sides and three angles.
1156600	1157680	What are you talking about?
1157680	1163720	So in short, Barkley is saying there's something confused about the way that Locke is describing
1163720	1165520	this entire scenario.
1165520	1170800	What's before the mind is supposedly an idea, but the idea is supposed to represent a thing.
1170800	1174680	And yet whenever we think about anything, we're thinking about an idea.
1174680	1180080	Well, either that triangle, that thing is just another idea, and it's really mental
1180080	1183560	and mind-dependent, or it's not.
1183560	1186880	But then this whole talk of representation makes no sense.
1186880	1191080	So he thinks he's got Locke in a real trap.
1191080	1193760	What are you going to say about these external objects?
1193760	1195160	Can I perceive them?
1195160	1198920	If yes, they're mental by your own definition.
1198920	1202840	If not, then they can't resemble any of these things that are ideas.
1202840	1206600	And either way, the theory is sunk.
1206600	1210160	So in our diagram, we can put it this way.
1210160	1216000	Do I have a relation of perception between my thought and that actual triangle as external
1216000	1217160	to me?
1217160	1220120	If so, that object becomes an idea.
1220120	1222400	And if not, we can't evaluate resemblance.
1222400	1226360	There's no way to talk about adequacy or inadequacy.
1226360	1231240	The conclusion that Barkley draws is that there are no primary qualities.
1231240	1235280	Extension, figure, and motion are only ideas existing in the mind.
1235280	1237960	An idea can be like nothing but another idea.
1237960	1243360	Consequently, neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance.
1243360	1248680	Hence it's plain that the very notion of what's called matter or corporeal substance involves
1248680	1250520	a contradiction in it.
1250520	1254320	So notice here, he's arguing there are no primary qualities.
1254320	1259040	The moment you postulate some quality that is in the thing itself, I'm forced to talk
1259040	1260880	about the idea of that.
1260880	1264120	And ideas can be like nothing but another idea.
1264120	1266960	So actually, they can't exist independently of the mind.
1266960	1272360	If I'm to talk about adequacy or representation or any kind of match or resemblance, then
1272360	1278480	they have to be mental, along with the ideas that I can characterize in this way.
1278480	1280680	But then they aren't really substances.
1280680	1282240	They aren't really matter.
1282240	1283800	They're creatures of the mind.
1283800	1285680	And so there is no way to talk about qualities.
1285680	1289080	They're really out there in the thing itself, independently of the mind.
1289080	1291680	There is nothing independent of the mind.
1291680	1299280	Well, that is, he thinks, what follows from taking seriously Locke's talk that we think
1299280	1304680	by having ideas before the mind, and those ideas are meant to represent things.
1304680	1307120	Those things end up being mental.
1307120	1310120	And if that's true, there's no such thing as a primary quality.
1310120	1314200	There's no such thing as a material substance.
1314200	1318160	Let's take a look at the other argument he gives, an argument based on variability.
1318160	1322320	The whole way of distinguishing primary from secondary quality, he says, is supposed to
1322320	1325160	be that the primary qualities are inseparable.
1325160	1326680	They are constant.
1326680	1328200	But actually, they're not.
1328200	1331640	People's perceptions vary, says the argument from variability.
1331640	1335200	And there's no way to decide among them, so we should suspend judgment.
1335200	1340200	Well, Barclay goes back to that skeptical form of argument and uses it against Locke,
1340200	1344640	and says, you say this is a reason for us to think that the secondary qualities aren't
1344640	1345980	really in the world.
1345980	1347240	They can vary.
1347240	1348560	They can depend on context.
1348560	1350480	They can depend on the perceiver.
1350480	1354240	And there's no way to decide what would really be in the object, so we should suspend judgment
1354240	1358000	about that and, in fact, deny that they are in the object.
1358000	1362040	He says, but wait a minute, the same thing applies to the primary qualities, too.
1362040	1366000	They also vary, and there's no way to decide among them.
1366000	1370360	So you claim that this will allow us to draw the distinction.
1370360	1374060	This set of qualities is invariable and inseparable.
1374060	1377100	This one is variable and separable.
1377100	1378740	Barclay says they're all variable.
1378740	1380540	They're all separable.
1380540	1384220	Nothing ends up being a primary quality by that criterion.
1384220	1388580	The perceptions we have of primary qualities vary, too.
1388580	1389580	Now why?
1389580	1394360	Well, let's take a look, he says, at a mites view of the world.
1394360	1398740	This is an actual photograph of dust mites on a carpet.
1398740	1403060	Now to us, that carpet might look clean.
1403060	1405660	It might look bug-free.
1405660	1409300	It might look as if it's a smooth textured carpet.
1409300	1411140	To a mites, it looks very different.
1411140	1413020	It's crawling with other mites.
1413020	1417240	It's actually very rough and has a kind of texture that's quite complex.
1417240	1419500	It looks like a bowl of spaghetti.
1419500	1423980	And so the mites view of that is very different from our own view.
1423980	1427700	Even though notice here, we're not talking just about texture in the sense of being a
1427700	1433380	secondary quality, we're talking about the actual shape of the thing.
1433380	1437460	The shape looks really different from a mites point of view.
1437460	1440880	This is an even more disturbing photograph.
1440880	1443660	These are mites on human skin.
1443660	1449580	That is what human skin that feels smooth to us looks like to one of these mites.
1449580	1453020	Looks like a series of caverns, deeply disturbing.
1453020	1456020	Looks like that person badly needs some hand cream.
1456020	1460060	But whatever we want to conclude about that, the mites view, it is really different from
1460060	1461260	our view.
1461260	1463980	Even though again, we're talking about the shape.
1463980	1466260	We're talking about the extension of it.
1466260	1471620	We're talking about things that ought to be among the primary qualities.
1471620	1474460	But perceptions vary.
1474460	1476060	Among species, yes.
1476060	1477740	But even for us.
1477740	1483060	Phylonus, one of the characters in the dialogue here, says, from what you've laid down, it
1483060	1487660	follows that both the extension by you perceived and that perceived by the mite itself, as
1487660	1491860	likewise all those perceived by lesser animals, or each of them the true extension of the
1491860	1493100	mites foot.
1493100	1495900	After all, these are perceptions of a primary quality.
1495900	1499100	So they're supposed to be in the things themselves.
1499100	1503700	But Phylonus says, by that criterion, you're led into an absurdity.
1503700	1508660	We see this as having a certain kind of, now I don't want to say just texture, but a certain
1508660	1509860	kind of shape.
1509860	1512860	The mite views it as having a very different kind of shape.
1512860	1514140	What does that tell us?
1514140	1518260	If shape is a primary quality, that's supposed to be really in the thing.
1518260	1522300	But it's the shape as perceived by the mite that's in the thing, or the shape as perceived
1522300	1524300	by us that's in the thing.
1524300	1528740	We've got to say, if we really take that to correspond, in both cases, that they're
1528740	1529740	both in the thing.
1529740	1532140	But that's a manifest contradiction.
1532140	1536620	Well, it's not just a question of different species.
1536620	1540060	Maybe we want to say, I don't care how a mite sees things, or how an elephant would
1540060	1542060	see it, or a bat would see it.
1542060	1543500	I mean, maybe we should.
1543500	1547140	But suppose you say, let's stay in the human realm.
1547140	1548980	The same problem emerges.
1548980	1551780	Phylonus says, look, think about a human being.
1551780	1556900	As we approach an object or a seed from it, the visible extension varies, being at one
1556900	1559660	distance ten or a hundred times greater than another.
1559660	1565660	Doth it not therefore follow from hence likewise that it's not really inherent in the object?
1565660	1567700	My perceptions vary.
1567700	1571820	Depending upon, well, all sorts of things, maybe dependent on my mood, depending upon
1571820	1577380	the time of day, how tired I am, but also on the basis of my distance from the object.
1577380	1579780	So here's an example.
1579780	1583900	This is a mountain known as Shiprock in northwestern New Mexico.
1583900	1589300	It was something that was used as a guidepost by people who were on wagon trains across the
1589300	1592760	west headed for California and other destinations.
1592760	1595420	You can see it from hundreds of miles away.
1595420	1597740	And here it is from hundreds of miles away.
1597740	1601680	It looks rather small there, and it's hard to tell how far away you are.
1601680	1607080	That might be a smaller mountain, and you're not that far away, or it might be a very large
1607080	1609120	mountain and you're quite far away.
1609120	1619320	In any case, as you approach Shiprock, it looks bigger and bigger.
1619320	1622720	And by the time you get right up to it, you realize this thing is huge.
1622720	1627000	That's why you can see it hundreds of miles away and why it was a good guidepost for
1627000	1629360	people seeking to cross the desert.
1629920	1635160	Well, that sort of thing is not just something that happens in wagon trains, it's something
1635160	1636640	that happens all the time.
1636640	1639720	I see something across the room, and it looks very small.
1639720	1643280	In fact, you might ask me a question about it, and I might find it hard to answer.
1643280	1647920	I could hold up these keys, for example, and ask you about the shape of the keys, and you
1647920	1649800	might say, well, they look very small.
1649800	1653760	But if I bring it toward the camera, they look larger and larger.
1653760	1658880	And indeed, if I bring them closer to my eyes, they look bigger and bigger in my visual field.
1658880	1661200	That kind of thing is commonplace.
1661200	1663680	I see something far away as I'm driving.
1663680	1665520	It looks very small, far away.
1665520	1667360	I might be driving toward Dallas.
1667360	1670360	I see the Dallas skyline, but I'm far away.
1670360	1673000	And I think, well, Dallas doesn't look that impressive.
1673000	1677440	But then when I get up close to it, I realize, oh, this is a big city, and it looks much
1677440	1678920	more impressive.
1678920	1682360	The same thing can happen when you're flying over something.
1682360	1686200	Imagine being in an airplane looking down on, let's say, New York City.
1686200	1688300	I've often flown over New York City.
1688300	1693960	You look down, and from a distance or a very high height, it doesn't look that big.
1693960	1696400	And the buildings there are barely discernible.
1696400	1697640	It looks tiny.
1697640	1702240	But on the other hand, when you're flying much lower over it, things look large.
1702240	1706440	And of course, if you're there just in a building, like at the top of the Empire State Building
1706440	1709280	looking at it, it looks huge.
1709280	1712760	So New York City is something that looks gigantic.
1712760	1716000	When you're close up, it can look small if you're far away.
1716000	1720220	You might have had the experience being very in a very tall tower, a tall office building
1720220	1724680	or something like that, where you look down at the road and people look like ants.
1724680	1728680	Well, that's because they look really small when you're far away.
1728680	1733320	On the other hand, when you're up close, you realize, no, they're the normal size for people.
1733320	1736520	And that sort of phenomenon is every day.
1736520	1741360	So yes, the sizes of things can vary, not only from context to context.
1741360	1746480	I mean, something might look much smaller if I put it next to something that's really large.
1746480	1750960	And in fact, often people, to take a photograph of something really large, will put something
1750960	1754760	next to it or have a person stand next to it or something so that you get a sense of
1754760	1759040	scale and so that you can see, look, I know it looks small in the photograph, this thing
1759040	1761240	is really large.
1761240	1766800	And that's because all of these things can affect our perception, our perception of primary
1766800	1767880	qualities.
1767880	1771920	The same thing can happen with respect to something like mass or motion.
1771920	1777760	The same motion might feel very fast or very slow, depending upon the context.
1777760	1782240	In this case, not how close we are to it, though that can be true too, watch an airplane
1782240	1783320	go across the sky.
1783320	1786960	The plane is going at hundreds of miles an hour, but it looks for our vantage point
1786960	1790200	on the ground as if it's traveling very slowly.
1790200	1793200	The same thing can happen if you've ever flown a plane.
1793200	1794520	I have.
1794520	1800080	And when you stop flying a plane and get into your car, for example, the speed you're going
1800080	1803720	in a car feels so unbelievably slow.
1803720	1808920	I had a friend who was a pilot and he was constantly getting speeding tickets.
1808920	1812240	And it's not really just because he was the kind of person who speeds a lot and ignores
1812240	1813240	the law.
1813240	1818520	It's because when you've been up in an airplane, the speeds you get used to are the speeds
1818520	1820680	of going hundreds of miles an hour.
1820680	1826120	When you then are on the ground traveling at 60, it feels like you're crawling.
1826120	1830000	And so that kind of thing is a phenomenon we're familiar with.
1830000	1832920	But wait, velocity was a primary quality.
1832920	1836600	So is that airplane moving across the sky quickly or not?
1836600	1840680	Well, we're perceiving a primary quality of motion there.
1840680	1845840	But the feeling for the pilot and the feeling of us on the ground can't both be right.
1845840	1848760	They can't both match the actual velocity.
1848760	1854120	And the same thing is true of driving a car when you haven't driven in a while and then
1854120	1856280	when you've been flying an airplane.
1856280	1860560	It's the same velocity, but one time it feels fast to you, another time it feels slow.
1860560	1862600	It can't be both fast and slow.
1862600	1866380	But again, motion, velocity, is supposed to be a primary quality.
1866380	1870120	So it looks like we're immediately led into trouble.
1870120	1874080	Filonius concludes in the dialogue, this isn't in the object.
1874080	1878720	He says, is it not the very same reasoning to conclude that there is no extension or
1878720	1880520	a figure in an object?
1880520	1883880	Because to one eye, it shall seem little, smooth, and round, while at the same time
1883880	1886720	it appears to the other great, uneven, and regular.
1886720	1892600	Hylis, who is defending the Lochte-Cart point of view in the dialogue, says, the very same.
1892600	1894720	But does this latter fact ever happen?
1894720	1898920	Filonius says you may at any time make the experiment by looking with one eye bare and
1898920	1901000	with another through a microscope.
1901000	1907640	So doubt the examples I've given about mites, about speeds of airplanes, about other things.
1907640	1912200	Maybe they don't convince you, but Filo says, hey, look at a leaf.
1912200	1913960	Here's how a leaf looks every day.
1913960	1918960	And we can describe, not just its secondary qualities, its green and so on, but its primary
1918960	1927520	qualities, describe its shape, describe the actual figure that it corresponds to, describe
1927520	1931880	it in any way you like, and now look through a microscope.
1931880	1934240	It looks like that.
1935240	1941120	Now, yes, its secondary qualities have changed, but the primary qualities have changed too.
1941120	1944640	That bottom edge, for example, looks smooth.
1944640	1946000	It's not smooth.
1946000	1947720	It's pretty bumpy.
1947720	1952440	And the same thing is going to be true of all sorts of primary qualities of the thing.
1952440	1955680	Your perception will be very different through a microscope.
1955680	1958200	You'll be seeing it very up close.
1958200	1964200	And your perception of the size, of the velocity, of the shape, all of that is going to
1964200	1965840	be quite different.
1965840	1971280	Conclusion, Barclay draws, there's no distinction between primary and secondary qualities.
1971280	1973320	They're all in the mind alone.
1973320	1978280	If we insist on using those terms at all, the point is all of those qualities are really
1978280	1980240	secondary qualities.
1980240	1986280	And so we should be idealists about all qualities, none of them are in the things themselves.
1986280	1989160	They are all in the mind alone.
1989160	1992720	Everything is really a construction or a projection of the mind.
1992760	1996680	Every single quality we attribute to an object is mind dependent.
1996680	1997680	It is variable.
1997680	1998680	It is separable.
1998680	2005800	It is the kind of thing that is there in the mind, but is not there in the object.
2005800	2009320	I want to leave you with a question.
2009320	2013920	We've been attacking here with Barclay that distinction between the primary and secondary
2013920	2015520	qualities.
2015520	2017840	But could we do this in a different way?
2017840	2022680	Instead of saying all qualities are really primary, could we do it in the opposite way?
2022680	2024600	Actually, they're all in the object.
2024600	2026600	They're all primary qualities.
2026600	2032360	Now notice we would have to get rid of Locke's idea that everything before the mind is really
2032360	2033360	an idea.
2033360	2036040	We'd have to say, no, I can perceive the triangle.
2036040	2039240	I don't have to just have an idea before the mind.
2039240	2041920	The triangle can really be before my mind.
2041920	2049720	I would also have to say that actually these tests of constancy and invariableness, maybe
2049720	2051400	those aren't the right tests.
2051400	2053560	The right test is something else.
2053560	2058000	But even a secondary quality, maybe I could push all of those into the thing.
2058000	2062280	I can say, ah, you think the yellow isn't really in the paper?
2062280	2063440	What if it is?
2063440	2068080	What if we end up saying, look, being yellow is just reflecting certain wavelengths of
2068080	2069080	light.
2069080	2071400	And the paper really does reflect those wavelengths.
2071400	2074680	That really is a quality of the paper itself.
2074680	2081200	I think these arguments, as framed, are quite effective against the way Locke sets it all
2081200	2082400	up.
2082400	2087280	But maybe the general problem of mind and world here could be addressed in a kind of
2087280	2090360	Barclayan spirit, but in a different way.
2090360	2095600	Instead of pushing the world up into the mind, maybe we could push the mind in effect down
2095600	2103000	into the world and say, actually all of those ideas are about things in the world.
2103000	2105000	Our thinking is about the things.
2105000	2106880	It's not about the ideas.
2106880	2109080	The thing can itself be before the mind.
2109080	2113320	We can make direct reference to the thing in our thoughts and in our language.
2113320	2118480	And maybe we could instead then say, actually all those qualities are really in the things
2118480	2119480	themselves.
2119480	2121840	They're all primary qualities.
2121840	2125000	It's not just a question of affecting us in certain ways.
2125000	2129520	Being red might be reflecting wavelengths of light of a certain kind.
2129520	2131160	Same thing with being yellow.
2131160	2134840	Maybe the same thing is true of all of the other secondary qualities.
2134840	2140280	So even if Barclay succeeds at denying the distinction, maybe we don't have to become
2140280	2142680	idealists about everything.
2142680	2148160	Could we instead become realists about all of it and attribute all of this to the things
2148160	2148920	themselves?
