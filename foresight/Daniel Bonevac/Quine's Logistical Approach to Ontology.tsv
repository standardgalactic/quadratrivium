0	6000	It's very hard to talk about what I want to talk about today without any logic.
6000	10000	So we're going to have to actually introduce a little bit of logical terminology.
10000	12000	We've been using it to some extent.
12000	18000	And sometimes I think the best way to actually be introduced to logic as a philosopher is really just to see it appear
18000	23000	and start picking it up as a word without formal introduction.
23000	27000	I remember telling my advisors and undergraduates that I was interested in logic.
27000	29000	I thought I should take a course in logic.
29000	31000	And he said, don't do it. A complete waste of time.
31000	33000	If you can think or you can't.
33000	35000	If you can already think, you don't need logic.
35000	39000	And if you can't think, logic isn't going to help you.
39000	46000	However, it seems to me that actually logic can help you a lot in thinking about certain philosophical issues.
46000	50000	And so today we're going to have to actually encounter a little bit of logic
50000	54000	because Quine introduces in this paper that we're going to be discussing today
54000	58000	his famous thought that to be is to be a value of a variable.
58000	61000	And at first glance, that sounds absurd, right?
61000	65000	And so you have to think, well, what does he mean to be a value of a variable?
65000	66000	What is a variable anyway?
66000	68000	And how does it function in a logical system?
68000	73000	And so we're going to be led very quickly from questions about metaphysics to questions about logic.
73000	76000	And there's no avoiding that in a sense.
76000	79000	So I'm not going to do it in a very formal way,
79000	83000	in a way that I would do it if I were introducing logic as logic.
83000	87000	But nevertheless, we're going to have to actually confront that at certain points.
87000	93000	So this paper itself, as I found out over the weekend, is really hard to track down.
93000	100000	It was slated to appear in volume 9 of Her Ketnes, a journal of unified science in 1939.
100000	106000	Due to the outbreak of World War II, they moved the operations of the journal to Holland
106000	108000	and then the Nazis invaded Holland.
108000	111000	And so this journal issue never appeared.
111000	116000	Hence when I said, well, yes, I forgot to scan it in from the book and it's not in quintessence.
116000	118000	But hey, no problem.
118000	120000	I'm sure I can find a copy online.
120000	125000	It turned out to be impossible to do that because, well, it never appeared.
125000	131000	So even though it became a famous paper in this formulation that to be is to be a value of a variable,
131000	133000	it became a very famous idea.
133000	137000	It turns out that the paper in which it was actually articulated was not published
137000	141000	until 1966 when this collection of essays came out.
141000	144000	It was circulated more informally before that.
144000	150000	So let's start by taking a look at what Klein says here.
150000	152000	As you can see, this is a well-loved book.
152000	155000	The cover came off years ago.
155000	158000	I won't defile it with tapes of tape that can't go on.
158000	160000	So I just keep carefully in place.
160000	163000	Anyway, what does it mean to ask?
163000	167000	For example, whether there is such an entity as roundness?
167000	173000	Well, we've got here thrown out a major ontological, a major metaphysical question from the medieval era,
173000	181000	at least whether we ought to recognize as components of the world things like roundness.
181000	186000	Well, we can't even go back before the medieval era to Plato and think,
186000	188000	what is the ontological status of the forms?
188000	191000	Do the forms have some separate existence,
191000	196000	apart from the objects that might exemplify them or might participate in them?
196000	198000	So we can ask about roundness.
198000	200000	When we think about the ultimate constituents of the world,
200000	202000	what do we do with roundness?
202000	205000	Is that one of the things that these Russell's phrase would have to count
205000	208000	as part of the furniture of the world?
208000	210000	Well, before we go into the question in some detail
210000	213000	and what Klein would have to say about it,
213000	215000	let's think about that question all by itself.
215000	221000	First glance, just intuitively, if I ask you what's in this room,
221000	227000	would you say, among the various things you might say, roundness?
227000	228000	No.
228000	229000	Okay, no.
229000	230000	Klein agrees.
230000	232000	It's like, yeah, I would start saying,
232000	236000	well, it's actually puzzling, there are two trash cans by the door.
236000	239000	I guess they must think people in this room generate a lot of garbage.
239000	242000	There are a certain number of desks, there are people, there are blackboards,
242000	245000	there's a computer, et cetera, et cetera, there's a clock.
245000	248000	But I wouldn't stop to say, oh, yeah, right.
248000	250000	I mean, also the rectangularity of the blackboard
250000	252000	and the roundness of the clock.
252000	255000	And that means rectangularity, roundness.
255000	258000	And gosh, those lines are pretty straight, straightness,
258000	261000	and curvedness, and blah, blah, blah.
261000	264000	I wouldn't start listing all those abstract things, right?
264000	267000	Now, why not?
267000	271000	Why would I stop at talking about the clock and the blackboard
271000	278000	and not talk about rectangularity aroundness?
278000	282000	Because they're qualities that physical objects have.
282000	284000	Ah, all right, there's a good Aristotelian answer.
284000	286000	They're qualities that physical objects have.
286000	288000	So you might think, well, wait a minute.
288000	291000	Yes, we do talk about qualities and quantities and relations
291000	294000	and actions and affections and states and positions
294000	297000	and all the other things in Aristotle's categories.
297000	299000	But in the end, it all depends on substance, right?
299000	301000	So the things there are in Aristotle's way of thinking
301000	303000	about the world really are the substances.
303000	306000	And then, yeah, so it's things like the clock.
306000	308000	And then the clock does have roundness,
308000	310000	if we want to put it in that sort of language.
310000	313000	But on the other hand, it's the clock that really exists here
313000	317000	and the qualities, the relations and so on, all of that.
317000	320000	You might think if they have any sort of existence
320000	322000	at all, it's highly derivative.
322000	326000	So remember we drew a distinction between metaphysics
326000	328000	and ontology.
328000	336000	And ontology, we said, was the study of what there is.
336000	344000	Really, we should perhaps say, well, hey, what there, gosh,
344000	350000	really is, ultimately is.
350000	353000	And then we said metaphysics includes that,
353000	356000	but metaphysics is much broader.
356000	358000	Why is that true?
358000	363000	What does metaphysics include that ontology doesn't include?
363000	365000	How you perceive what really is.
365000	367000	Ah, how you perceive what really is.
367000	371000	So you might think the connection between mind and world
371000	375000	is something that ought to be included here,
375000	378000	not in other words just what the world ultimately consists of,
378000	382000	but also something about how our minds relate to it.
382000	386000	What else might be included under metaphysics?
386000	388000	Epistemology.
388000	391000	Well, usually epistemology is thought to be a separate topic,
391000	394000	so that there's one question of what the world is like
394000	397000	and so on and then another, how we know that.
397000	400000	So for example, if you say, well, ah, yeah, I mean,
400000	403000	perception and the sense of how it is that we relate to the world.
403000	405000	That is a very broad question.
405000	408000	It has epistemological aspects as well as metaphysical aspects.
408000	410000	Sometimes those get deeply intertwined.
410000	414000	And in fact, there are philosophers who think there isn't a sharp distinction
414000	417000	to be drawn between metaphysics and epistemology.
417000	421000	So if you're inclined toward idealism or any variety of anti-realism,
421000	425000	you're going to think, but yeah, wait a minute, it's all tied up together.
425000	429000	I can't sort of have some radically non-epistemic way of thinking
429000	432000	about the way the world is, in which case it looks like epistemology
432000	435000	and metaphysics fused into this one big unit.
435000	438000	But if we don't want to assume that from the start,
438000	441000	we might say, well, the question of how we know the world is one thing,
441000	444000	but then the question of what the world is like is another.
444000	447000	That's going to include in a broad sense this connection,
447000	449000	this question of the connection between mind and world,
449000	453000	but might not include specifics about, well, for example,
453000	458000	how exactly we know universal statements or something like that.
458000	461000	What else might be included in a metaphysical picture
461000	465000	that wouldn't be a matter of just counting the ultimate furniture in the universe?
466000	469000	The relations between the pieces of furniture.
469000	471000	Yeah, the relations between the pieces of furniture.
471000	472000	Exactly.
472000	479000	So you might say it's a question of identifying the structure of the world,
479000	482000	of the things that ontology identifies,
482000	485000	and not just those things and how they relate to one another,
485000	489000	but also how various things that aren't ultimate constituents
489000	491000	are structured in terms of those.
491000	493000	So you might think there's a question of, actually,
493000	496000	I think we drew a fuzzy picture where, in a sense,
496000	500000	ontology was a question of identifying these ultimate constituents.
500000	504000	But then those things are structured into all sorts of complexes,
504000	506000	as Russell might put it,
506000	509000	and then we can talk about how those complexes relate to one another,
509000	512000	and to the ultimate symbols, and so forth.
512000	516000	So there are all these relations, there are all these constructions.
516000	524000	Or if you want to think of this way, complexes and symbols.
524000	530000	Now, in a sense, I can't tell you what I'm looking for here
530000	533000	without committing to some particular metaphysical theory, right?
533000	535000	Because the moment I say complexes and symbols,
535000	539000	I'm now sort of invoking some kind of atomistic picture of the world.
539000	541000	And if I talk about constructions,
541000	545000	I'm already assuming these relations have a certain kind of character and so forth.
545000	549000	So I'm putting things here that we've already identified
549000	552000	as going on in analytic philosophy.
552000	555000	But actually, if you want to think much more broadly about this,
555000	559000	you should realize, I'm just talking here about examples of a kind of relation
559000	560000	you might have in mind.
560000	564000	Presumably you're going to have a different way of thinking about those relationships
564000	567000	if you've got another metaphysical nature.
567000	571000	Are there other things that fit into metaphysics?
576000	582000	Questions about things like God that might be outside of the world,
582000	584000	as we usually think of it?
584000	587000	Oh, okay, so yeah, we think about various objects in the world,
587000	590000	but then there are some that have special stats.
590000	595000	So, you might think, look, it's one thing to talk about, let's say, atoms,
595000	598000	physical atoms or minds or something like that.
598000	601000	It's quite another to actually talk about God,
601000	606000	which seems to be not just one more object in the world,
606000	608000	but to have some special status.
608000	611000	And the same thing you might think is true of personal identity,
611000	613000	because after all, if you're thinking, wait a minute,
613000	616000	I also want to know as part of metaphysics who am I
616000	618000	and what kind of thing am I?
618000	622000	And that's not just saying I'm an ultimate constituent or maybe I'm not.
622000	624000	Gosh, there's an ontological worry.
624000	627000	What if you add up all the things in the world and I'm not among them?
628000	631000	Well, don't worry, you might say.
631000	633000	It's a separate metaphysical question.
633000	635000	Just what kind of thing am I?
635000	636000	Who am I?
636000	637000	What am I?
637000	640000	And so, we might think that the nature of God,
640000	644000	and for that matter of me, personal identity,
644000	648000	becomes a crucial thing to think about here.
648000	651000	I care not only about the tables and chairs of the world,
651000	654000	the atoms and electrons and fields and so on,
654000	661000	but I also care about me and I care about whether or not there's a God.
661000	662000	Good.
662000	664000	This is a start to thinking about metaphysics.
664000	666000	It's something that includes a lot of stuff.
666000	669000	And as we see here, well, as we will see,
669000	671000	Kline's essay starts with ontology.
671000	674000	He really acts as if he's just dealing with this ontological question
674000	677000	about the ultimate constituents of the world.
677000	682000	Well, even more simply, just what it is to say that something is.
682000	686000	But then, actually, he does destroy the distinction
686000	688000	between these ultimate constituents and other things.
688000	692000	And so, we're going to have to think about the structuring
692000	695000	as well as just the sort of counting.
695000	699000	Now, so we've said, okay, for example, roundness.
699000	700000	Is there such an entity?
700000	702000	He says, note that we can use the word roundness
702000	705000	without acknowledging any such entity as roundness.
705000	709000	We can maintain that the word is in-categoromatic.
709000	716000	So, there's a distinction that is, well, where does it go back to?
716000	719000	It's found in, he mentions, well, actually, he doesn't mention.
719000	722000	A lot of people mention William Obokam in this connection.
722000	724000	It goes back at least to Peter of Spain.
724000	727000	And I'm not sure that Peter of Spain is the one in the 13th century
727000	730000	actually introduces this term for the first time.
730000	733000	But there's a distinction from medieval logic
733000	738000	between categoromatic terms and sin-categoromatic terms.
738000	747000	Now, Klein doesn't actually explain it.
747000	749000	He just assumes you know this already,
749000	752000	which is kind of an amazing thing because, like, who knows this?
752000	758000	Yeah, I'm the sort of person who, just to brush up on my Latin,
758000	762000	reads Peter of Spain in Latin because it's fun, okay?
762000	766000	But I assume that I'm very, very weird for doing that.
766000	771000	So, there aren't very many people who would just know what these terms mean often.
771000	774000	But the idea in medieval logic is this.
774000	779000	A sin-categoromatic term is one that doesn't really stand for anything.
779000	782000	A categoromatic term does, okay?
782000	789000	So, to just put it very broadly, this stands for something,
789000	794000	and often the medieval will say something definite.
794000	798000	They're worried about problems of vagueness and things like,
798000	801000	well, phrases like a man or whatever.
801000	804000	And a sin-categoromatic term is not like that.
804000	810000	It doesn't stand for anything.
810000	816000	So, if we think about items in language that we think of typically as
816000	819000	categoromatic as standing for something,
819000	822000	what would those include from a grammatical point of view?
822000	828000	What do we take in language to be standard for something?
828000	829000	A noun.
829000	833000	A noun, typically, yeah, exactly.
833000	841000	So, among both, for example, with proper names,
841000	843000	but then there might be other kinds of nouns,
843000	849000	maybe common nouns,
849000	854000	or maybe noun phrases, determiner phrases.
854000	858000	The details of that are going to vary with our linguistic theory.
858000	862000	But now, sin-categoromatic terms, well, they don't stand for anything.
862000	868000	So, what are some of the things in language we would think typically don't stand for anything?
868000	870000	Yeah, good.
870000	873000	So, we might think, well, adjectives are like that.
873000	876000	If I say that thing is round, the clock is round,
876000	880000	do I think that round names some entity?
880000	881000	Adverbs.
881000	889000	Good, adverbs.
889000	891000	He did it quickly.
891000	894000	Quickly, we don't think, stands for some object in the world.
894000	899000	Or I say, surprisingly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
899000	902000	You don't sort of think, oh, surprisingly, yeah, there's that thing again.
902000	903000	He keeps talking about that.
903000	905000	Interesting object, surprisingly.
905000	908000	No, there's no such thing that it's standing for.
908000	910000	And you might think, oh, not once you get going,
910000	911000	there are lots of these, right?
911000	913000	I mean, what about the parts of speech?
913000	915000	Don't stand for anything.
915000	916000	Prepositions.
916000	917000	Prepositions, yeah.
917000	921000	A preposition doesn't stand for anything.
921000	922000	Queen of England.
922000	924000	Well, I say, oh, well, actually, there are three objects there.
924000	927000	The queen, England, and of.
927000	929000	But that seems silly somehow.
929000	930000	Yeah.
930000	931000	Numbers.
931000	932000	Numbers.
932000	934000	Ah, yeah, numbers.
935000	939000	Now, if that's an interesting one, because it looks as if when we say
939000	944000	1 plus 1 is 2, those look like proper names and things, right?
944000	951000	On the other hand, we can talk about five birds on the wire, for example.
951000	954000	And there, five just seems to be an adjective.
954000	958000	And so, numbers are weird because sometimes they act as proper names
958000	960000	and sometimes they act as adjectives.
960000	963000	And we're going to have to say something about how that sort of thing is possible.
963000	967000	But yes, at least in the adjective version, it seems like it's hard to think of,
967000	969000	oh, yeah, what was on the wire?
969000	971000	There were these birds, and also the number five.
971000	972000	Yeah.
972000	973000	Yeah.
973000	978000	On road trips before, I've tried, just like when I've been bored as hell,
978000	983000	I've tried to think of things like numbers that we can't live without
983000	990000	or that we need to explain the world with, but that you can't point to physically.
991000	997000	What are other things that are like in that category?
997000	999000	I could never think of anything.
999000	1004000	All right, that's a great question, because in the end, this jumps us ahead a little bit.
1004000	1005000	But good.
1005000	1008000	Quine is going to say, look, I don't actually care very much.
1008000	1011000	What is required to make sense of your speech or my speech?
1011000	1015000	Because he's convinced that a lot of what we say is more or less nonsense.
1015000	1020000	And so the real question is going to be, what is required for the language of science?
1020000	1025000	And so you might say, yeah, this is all fine to talk about things in ordinary speech,
1025000	1027000	parts of speech, and so on.
1027000	1032000	But really, in the end, we're going to care about what science requires.
1032000	1038000	And if you and I find it a little bit difficult to talk about the objects we're passing by
1038000	1043000	on the road trip or our own thoughts and feelings, well, who cares?
1043000	1047000	In the end, we care about science, Quine says, and what science requires.
1047000	1051000	So one way of looking at this is to say, you and I in our common speech,
1051000	1056000	we're using language for all sorts of purposes that aren't just describing the world.
1056000	1061000	But the science, the job of science is really to focus on that question alone,
1061000	1064000	to think what is required to describe the world.
1064000	1068000	And so if I'm thinking about these questions of apology, what there really is,
1068000	1071000	or metaphysics about the structure of the world,
1071000	1075000	I mean, I care more about science than I care about ordinary language.
1075000	1080000	You might divide the philosophers we've been talking about, in fact, into three categories.
1080000	1086000	Depending upon their view of this, what are we really doing philosophy about?
1086000	1091000	In a sense, all of these early analytic philosophers think that language is key,
1091000	1096000	and that it's not just the language's useful tool in thinking about philosophical questions,
1096000	1100000	but in a sense, philosophical questions are questions of language.
1100000	1102000	But there are three types.
1102000	1111000	And so you might say, we've got some of these people that we could call ideal language philosophers.
1111000	1119000	Those are people like Fraga, Russell, Wittgenstein.
1119000	1121000	What does ideal mean in this?
1121000	1124000	Good question. What do I mean, ideal?
1124000	1129000	Well, yeah, what's special about the language of the Traptatus, for example?
1129000	1133000	Or special about Russell's way of thinking about definite descriptions?
1133000	1139000	He thinks it's more revealing than ordinary speech, but how so?
1139000	1146000	Ideally, in what respect?
1146000	1148000	It's not ambiguous.
1148000	1151000	Good, it's not ambiguous, so that's one thing.
1151000	1155000	It's got this, you know, clarity to it.
1155000	1158000	And so the clarity of the structure of this language is important.
1158000	1162000	Is there something else?
1162000	1163000	Yeah.
1163000	1165000	Closer to being true or accurately describing?
1165000	1168000	Yeah, closer to accurately describing the world.
1168000	1172000	So it's not only got this clear structure, but the underlying thought is,
1172000	1175000	it really reveals the underlying structure of the world.
1175000	1177000	And so it serves almost as a mirror of the world.
1177000	1184000	In fact, sometimes these philosophers seem to think the ideal language would really just be a mirror of reality.
1184000	1187000	And it leads you into funny questions.
1187000	1194000	Borges has a story where he's talking about somebody who is deciding they need a really perfectly adequate map of the world.
1194000	1199000	And they realized for it to be perfectly adequate, it would just have to be the world.
1199000	1203000	Because it would have to stand in one-to-one correspondence with all the things in the world.
1203000	1206000	And if it was really drawn to scale, it would just be the world.
1206000	1212000	And so in a certain sense, that's kind of a vision of what this ideal language would be like.
1212000	1220000	Ideal in being clear as opposed to ambiguous or vague, and also in respect to reflecting the underlying structures.
1220000	1229000	Then we're going to see some philosophers who are, might call them ordinary language philosophers,
1229000	1234000	who think that, no, it's a cheat to sort of introduce such an ideal language.
1234000	1237000	Partly it distorts what our ordinary speech is like.
1237000	1243000	And partly too, how can we say this is a language that mirrors the structure of the world,
1243000	1245000	unless we already know what the structure of the world is?
1245000	1249000	So this can't be taken as a tool for revealing the structure of the world.
1249000	1254000	If a criterion of its being ideal is that it does reveal the structure, we must then already know the structure.
1254000	1261000	So these people think, no, start with English or French or German or Chinese or some other natural language,
1261000	1265000	and think about metaphysics and so on in terms of that.
1265000	1268000	So who are some examples of this?
1268000	1271000	Well, we've already seen one, I think, Ryle.
1271000	1274000	J.L. Austin is a famous example.
1274000	1278000	P.F. Strassen.
1278000	1281000	Paul Reiss.
1281000	1290000	Let's see, oh, and of course the later Victor Stein.
1290000	1296000	Okay, but in between, you might say, there are these scientific language philosophers.
1296000	1300000	And they're the people we're studying right now, for the most part, have been.
1300000	1303000	We took a detour to Ryle.
1303000	1312000	And so here I have in mind the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle.
1312000	1319000	So figures like Carnab, Tempel, Schlick, Neuerer and so on.
1319000	1322000	And Klein is one of those.
1322000	1329000	Klein, in fact, went to Vienna and hung out with Vienna Circle for a while in the 1930s and studied in particular with Carnab.
1329000	1334000	And so somebody who was very much influenced by this.
1334000	1340000	Interestingly, Klein actually studied, got his degree at Harvard under people who were primarily pragmatists.
1340000	1347000	And so throughout his writings, as we'll see, there's this conflict going on between logical empiricism and pragmatism.
1347000	1353000	His teachers at Harvard were all pragmatists, but the guys he was hanging out with in Vienna were all logical empiricists.
1353000	1358000	And so you see in his work an attempt to synthesize these.
1358000	1364000	And actually one of our students visited Harvard and found wine in his office and said,
1364000	1370000	so throughout your work there are these two war intendents in psychological empiricism and pragmatism.
1370000	1374000	Suppose in the end you had to put your chips on one of them.
1374000	1378000	So suppose in the end it was like, I don't know.
1378000	1381000	He didn't use this phrase with Klein and Klein wouldn't have liked it.
1381000	1385000	But it's sort of like, you die and you're there at the gates of heaven.
1385000	1390000	And Saint Peter says so in Klein, you're kind of mixing these two strands together.
1390000	1395000	In the end, what is it? Is it logical empiricism or is it pragmatism?
1395000	1400000	What you get in depends on your answer.
1400000	1405000	And interestingly, Klein said logical empiricism.
1405000	1410000	So we're going to see him infusing more and more pragmatist themes into logical empiricism.
1410000	1413000	In the end, he would place himself clearly in there.
1413000	1417000	Okay, so anyway, the language of science is what he really cares about.
1417000	1420000	Now let me come back to your question, which is a key question.
1420000	1424000	In a sense, yeah, it's all fine to think about this in English.
1424000	1427000	But in the end, what is the language of science looked like?
1427000	1432000	What do we need for science?
1432000	1435000	What does the language of science look like?
1435000	1439000	It doesn't really have adverbs in it, for example, does it?
1439000	1442000	I mean, we can talk about the particle moving more swiftly.
1442000	1446000	But in the end, we don't really use adverbs in the language of science.
1446000	1449000	We introduce a term for that, acceleration.
1449000	1456000	And so what do we use in science?
1456000	1466000	We use symbols to represent things we can't necessarily see or perceive.
1466000	1469000	But good, for one thing, this is highly symbolic.
1469000	1473000	So we're going to have to understand what's going on in a symbolic language,
1473000	1477000	like the language of science, like the language of mathematics or logic,
1477000	1479000	as opposed to thinking about things primarily in English.
1479000	1483000	So although Klein starts this essay thinking about English and
1483000	1488000	categoromatic and syn-categoromatic terms, in fact, that's not where the real
1488000	1491000	test lies, where the rubber beats the road.
1491000	1493000	That's in the symbolic languages of science.
1493000	1498000	And so in that symbolism, I mean, just think about a few simple scientific laws,
1498000	1501000	like forces, mass times, acceleration.
1501000	1503000	What's going on there?
1503000	1506000	Well, we've got identity statements.
1506000	1508000	We've got mathematical quantities.
1508000	1511000	So there's a huge amount of math.
1511000	1517000	We do a lot of identification of, well, of what exactly?
1517000	1518000	What is force?
1518000	1520000	These aren't proper names, right?
1520000	1527000	What are they?
1527000	1530000	It depends on what you're talking about.
1530000	1531000	It depends on what we're talking about.
1531000	1532000	Yeah.
1532000	1537000	And so, well, actually, let's think about mass, because maybe it's simpler.
1537000	1540000	Like right now, I have a certain mass, right?
1540000	1542000	But that mass changes.
1542000	1546000	Actually, ever since Thanksgiving, it's been changing quite a bit in the wrong
1546000	1547000	direction.
1547000	1551000	You might notice that I'm wearing like that same three pairs of pants all the time.
1551000	1554000	It's because they're the only ones that fit me at the moment.
1554000	1556000	So, yeah.
1556000	1561000	Anyway, by the end of term, I promise I will start losing mass to get better at this.
1561000	1565000	But anyway, yeah, we've talked about an object having a mass at a time, right?
1565000	1568000	And so really, this is something like a function.
1568000	1572000	It's the mass of Dan Bonovac at time t.
1572000	1575000	And I might say, oh, yes, I've been gaining weight.
1575000	1578000	In other words, this function has been increasing over time.
1578000	1580000	I'm hoping to get it to decrease.
1580000	1585000	And so that's something you might think is, well, okay, a function.
1585000	1589000	So there are all sorts of things that are going to be expressed as functions.
1589000	1594000	And indeed, accelerations like that, too, I may be accelerating at a time, right?
1594000	1598000	Or decelerating at a time, or maintaining a constant velocity at a time.
1598000	1602000	So this, too, looks like it's an object at a time.
1602000	1607000	And so presumably, force is going to be, the force applies to an object at a given time.
1607000	1611000	So that's probably a function of objects at times.
1611000	1616000	But then there are all sorts of other things that are actually, even this is way too simple, right?
1616000	1621000	Because actually, if you think about velocity, for example, a physicist will often write
1621000	1625000	velocity not just as a v, but as a vector.
1625000	1630000	And why? Because the velocity is not just a question of moving at a certain rate,
1630000	1632000	but in a certain direction.
1632000	1637000	And so if we think, wait a minute, if that's true, then acceleration should also be understood as that.
1637000	1639000	And the same with force, those have a direction.
1639000	1643000	Then we're going to need vectors there as well as just positions and so forth.
1643000	1647000	So what this is a function of is actually going to be fairly complicated.
1647000	1652000	And if you start thinking, oh yes, we're going to need vectors and derivatives and integrals
1652000	1658000	and functions and all of this kind of stuff, you realize there's quite a lot of mathematics we're going to need here.
1658000	1665000	Now exactly how much depends on our physical theory and that's a complicated question.
1665000	1670000	But at the very least, we're going to need a substantial part of mathematics.
1670000	1673000	What else will we need?
1673000	1675000	We are going to have to have some idea.
1675000	1679000	Well, maybe the key is to just jump straight to this.
1679000	1688000	We're going to need things like variables, like an object x, like a time t, maybe a position p and so forth.
1688000	1694000	We're going to need variables that stand for the basic things that our language is going to be talking about.
1694000	1700000	So far we've been taking physics as an example and physics is often taken as the most basic science.
1700000	1703000	But we could also start thinking, well, what about chemistry?
1703000	1705000	Is it going to require additional things?
1705000	1711000	Maybe we're going to need terms for elements in physics and so forth, or in chemistry and so on.
1711000	1716000	So it turns out to be crucial to think, well, what does this language of science really require?
1716000	1719000	Now let's get back to the essay.
1719000	1722000	I feel like I keep pulling this fill of brief thing.
1722000	1726000	We've only gotten through two sentences, but let's see if we can do a little better.
1727000	1733000	So he says, really in the end, if we go back to this distinction between the categoromatic and the syn-categoromatic,
1733000	1738000	one way of thinking about it is that these categoromatic expressions are names of something.
1738000	1741000	These are not names of anything.
1741000	1744000	So he says we can ask an important question.
1744000	1746000	Is this the name of something?
1746000	1752000	To ask whether there is such an entity as roundness is thus not to ask the question of the meaningfulness of roundness.
1752000	1757000	It amounts rather to asking whether the word is a name or a syn-categoromatic expression.
1757000	1760000	Well, he says, this is a crucial point.
1760000	1765000	Ontological questions can be transformed in this superficial way into linguistic questions
1765000	1769000	regarding the boundary between names and syn-categoromatic expressions.
1769000	1773000	So we can think, aha, we can take an ontological question.
1773000	1774000	What is there?
1774000	1778000	And we can say, well, that's really a way of saying, how do I draw that line?
1778000	1780000	These are going to be names of things.
1780000	1783000	And so these are going to stand for something.
1783000	1784000	And so that's something.
1784000	1786000	That'll be something I recognize in my ontology.
1786000	1788000	It's something that is.
1788000	1791000	Whereas here, these things don't stand for anything.
1791000	1795000	So I don't have to worry about them from an ontological point of view.
1795000	1798000	And so I can say, well, what is that really?
1798000	1802000	That's a way of saying, which expressions in my language are categorical?
1802000	1805000	Which expressions in my language is going to stand for something?
1805000	1807000	So notice what's happened.
1807000	1812000	Ontology gets transformed into a question about language.
1812000	1814000	I go from the question, what is there?
1814000	1821000	It's the question of what's in my language stands for something.
1821000	1823000	Now, where does the boundary fall?
1823000	1826000	Well, he says, let's turn our attention to barriers.
1826000	1829000	If in this statement, pedals have roundness,
1829000	1831000	where I've been using the example of the clock.
1831000	1833000	The clock has roundness.
1833000	1838000	The word roundness is regarded as a mirrored and categoromatic fragment of this context,
1838000	1841000	like have or indeed bowls or mess.
1841000	1845000	If that's true, then the truth of one doesn't entitle us to infer pebbles have something.
1845000	1850000	So notice the inference that he's thinking about here.
1850000	1858000	Pebbles have roundness.
1858000	1874000	When I infer from that, that, therefore, there is some x such that pebbles have x.
1874000	1881000	In other words, to put this in language, from pebbles have roundness to pebbles have something.
1881000	1885000	Which is really just what that logical expression means.
1885000	1889000	So really, if you translate that, there is an x such that pebbles have x,
1889000	1896000	or in other words, pebbles have something.
1896000	1898000	Now, how is that an argument?
1898000	1901000	Pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.
1901000	1907000	The clock is round, so the clock has roundness, so the clock has something.
1907000	1909000	Some of you would like it, okay?
1909000	1911000	There's a plane that's sitting right over there.
1911000	1913000	Love it there, love it.
1913000	1916000	Pebbles have things, clocks have things, okay?
1916000	1918000	Everything has things.
1918000	1924000	And I don't know why I'm making a plane that sounds like a tough guy from New Jersey here,
1924000	1927000	but anyway, suppose you think of it, oh yeah.
1927000	1930000	Yeah, he's from the Jersey part of Athens.
1930000	1933000	So we've got that.
1933000	1934000	Pebbles have something.
1934000	1939000	And others of you are shaking your heads like, wait, what do you mean pebbles have something?
1939000	1943000	If I said, hey, I have some pebbles, but do the pebbles have anything?
1943000	1946000	You'd say, what do you mean do the pebbles have anything, right?
1946000	1950000	It'd be very odd to say, of course they do, they have roundness.
1950000	1952000	It feels like some weird philosophy joke.
1952000	1958000	And so Klein is sort of saying, yeah, you know, if you've drunk from the plate this Kool-Aid,
1958000	1960000	you might like pebbles have something.
1960000	1966000	In fact, you might think, actually, pebbles have roundness is the way to explain the fact that pebbles are round.
1966000	1968000	What is it for something to be round?
1968000	1969000	It's for it to have roundness.
1969000	1972000	And so pebbles are round by virtue of the fact that they have roundness.
1972000	1975000	This is really the revealing deep explanation.
1975000	1978000	But if you're not somebody who's drunk from the plate this Kool-Aid,
1978000	1980000	you might say, there's something weird.
1980000	1981000	It just sounds weird, right?
1981000	1982000	It sounds different.
1982000	1986000	In fact, I'd rather say pebbles are something, namely round,
1986000	1989000	than to say they have something like roundness.
1989000	1993000	And so if you have that instinct, and that's Klein's instinct,
1993000	1995000	he thinks there's something strange that's gone on here.
1995000	2001000	So he says, look, where have is understood in the context is have roundness,
2001000	2004000	and roundness is understood sin categorically.
2004000	2009000	The use of the variable x after have in pebbles have an x such that,
2009000	2013000	well, there is an x such that pebbles have x, or in other words, pebbles have something,
2013000	2019000	would be as ungrammatical as saying, you know, there is an x such that pebbles have x has roundness.
2019000	2023000	And so there's something that seems odd about this to him.
2023000	2024000	Well, now what?
2024000	2026000	Here we get a serious argument.
2026000	2031000	And this is something I think worth thinking very seriously, and thinking about hard.
2031000	2034000	He says variables are pronouns.
2034000	2040000	So what is a variable like this doing in a logical notation?
2040000	2045000	Or just, or something like that thing, maybe, and something?
2045000	2046000	The idea is this.
2046000	2049000	It's really acting as a kind of pronoun.
2049000	2053000	And so although Klein says here in the end to be is to be a value of a variable,
2053000	2063000	a way to put that in ordinary language terms is that to be is to be the kind of thing a pronoun can stand.
2063000	2066000	Variables are like pronouns in logic.
2066000	2069000	And so what do we use pronouns for?
2069000	2071000	Well, they stand in for nouns.
2071000	2074000	And so you might think, actually, that's a dumb way of thinking about it.
2074000	2075000	Just focus on the nouns.
2075000	2077000	They focus on the proper names, for example.
2077000	2082000	But Klein's worried about that because he knows you can introduce proper names for things that don't exist.
2082000	2085000	And so he says, yeah, look, Pegasus.
2085000	2090000	I don't want to be committed to Pegasus's existence, even if I use the term Pegasus.
2090000	2096000	And so I know it's possible to name things that are there and have proper names in my language that denote nothing.
2096000	2103000	So it's not wise to focus on names, but pronouns, that's something else.
2103000	2106000	So he says, really, variables are pronouns.
2106000	2116000	And now we can think pronouns are really ultimately the thing that reveals what we're talking about.
2116000	2124000	The kind of thing we can refer to as, oh, that, it, those, them, et cetera.
2124000	2128000	Those are the things that we're actually committed to talking about.
2128000	2134000	What would Russell's response be to this?
2135000	2142000	Well, I think Klein thinks of himself here as, in part, giving you the moral of Russell's treatment of descriptions.
2142000	2146000	And so overall, I think Russell would like this idea.
2146000	2150000	He doesn't quite put it in this way himself.
2150000	2155000	But if you start thinking, well, gosh, the present king of France is bald.
2155000	2158000	Does that involve some commitment to something?
2158000	2163000	Yeah, it does involve a commitment to the king of France, to their being a present king of France.
2163000	2169000	And if you wrote it out in logical terms, it would indeed be this, there was an X, such that X is king of France.
2169000	2171000	That would be the thing that causes the trouble.
2171000	2173000	So this works well with Russell?
2173000	2175000	I think it works really well with Russell.
2175000	2176000	And Klein is designing it for that.
2176000	2182000	He, in part, has Russell in mind, giving us a way of seeing what really matters here.
2182000	2184000	And so don't think it's a proper name.
2184000	2189000	Among the things over here, I should have written down are things like definite descriptions.
2190000	2197000	And Russell would be saying, I thought the moral of my story is, don't focus on this, don't focus on this.
2197000	2200000	And in the end, although he doesn't draw the consequence,
2200000	2205000	Klein says, think about the moral of that story, and the end is the variable that's doing the work in Russell.
2205000	2207000	It's the X of there is an X.
2208000	2216000	Okay, so we can reach this in other ways.
2216000	2225000	Yeah, and we can do it by thinking about a logical notation and how it functions.
2225000	2230000	So he says, it appears suitable to describe names simply as those constant expressions,
2230000	2235000	which replace variables and are replaced by variables according to the usual laws of quantification.
2235000	2237000	What are those laws of quantification?
2237000	2241000	What are the laws that govern things like this, there is an X?
2241000	2246000	At this point, I think we can get rid of our categorics and categoric distinction.
2246000	2254000	So let me erase this and think about the way that those items function in logic.
2258000	2262000	Okay, so we need something like the existential quantifier.
2262000	2264000	What does it do in logic?
2264000	2273000	The existential quantifier functions like that, and it goes in front of some formula in logic.
2273000	2279000	And typically, let's say, you might have a logical notation that requires this,
2279000	2284000	or it might just be the standard usage of it, that has some free variable X.
2284000	2288000	I can tell you officially what a free variable is and a bound variable and so on,
2288000	2290000	but I'm not going to.
2290000	2294000	Okay, it's easy to pick up in context.
2294000	2299000	So let's ignore some of the fine points and just think about how this functions.
2299000	2302000	What characterizes it?
2302000	2309000	We might think of it in terms of rules and think about what logical rules are involved in understanding this quantifier.
2309000	2316000	We also might think in terms of what it means, how we understand its meaning in a logical theory.
2316000	2318000	Let's first of all think about rules.
2318000	2321000	What rules typically go along with the existential quantifier?
2321000	2325000	Well, in thinking about logical rules, there are two kinds.
2325000	2330000	We can think about what it takes to introduce such a thing into the language,
2330000	2334000	or I should say what it takes to infer that from some premise,
2334000	2337000	and then what it takes to actually infer something from it.
2337000	2348000	So these are usually referred to as introduction and elimination rules.
2348000	2354000	So let's think about existential quantifier introduction, existential quantifier elimination.
2354000	2359000	What does it take to introduce something like there is an X such that A of X?
2359000	2364000	In other words, something like there is an X such that Pebbles have X.
2364000	2378000	We've actually got a perfect example of it right here.
2378000	2380000	A of X.
2380000	2385000	Yeah, we have the A of well now.
2385000	2390000	We could follow the rule, and many people do, so it's just A of X.
2390000	2393000	Or we could say, well, really, it's like having a name.
2393000	2398000	Pebbles have roundness, or I have something in my hand, this piece of chalk.
2398000	2402000	So you might say, I have a piece of chalk in my hand, so I have something in my hand.
2402000	2404000	I have this in my hand. I have something in my hand.
2404000	2407000	So in short, there's some constant here.
2407000	2412000	I will write A instead of X here, because usually we would set things up
2412000	2417000	so that this is really a name of something, a constant term rather than a variable.
2417000	2421000	So think of A as something like the constant.
2421000	2425000	The X is the variable.
2425000	2433000	So if I've got something true of this, it's true of something.
2433000	2435000	I am standing in front of the classroom.
2435000	2439000	Therefore, something is standing in front of the classroom.
2439000	2443000	Now, existential elimination, that's a lot harder.
2443000	2445000	And actually, many people have different rules for this.
2445000	2449000	Quine as his own favorite, which is, in my opinion, by far the best.
2449000	2451000	So I'll just go with Quine's way of thinking about it.
2451000	2456000	Suppose we have, there is an X, that's A of X.
2456000	2461000	What could we infer from that?
2461000	2464000	You might say, I have something in my hand.
2464000	2467000	Why is it?
2467000	2472000	I'm sure you like your kind of partners.
2472000	2474000	I have something in my hand.
2474000	2476000	What can you infer from that?
2476000	2478000	It's not nothing.
2478000	2481000	Well, it's not nothing, that's true.
2481000	2482000	That's true.
2482000	2484000	If I say, I've got something in my hand, they believe nothing.
2484000	2487000	Oh, he's a Heideggerian.
2487000	2490000	That's okay.
2490000	2491000	Yeah, I see it.
2491000	2492000	Well, I have four of you.
2492000	2494000	I have four of you, that's fine.
2494000	2496000	I've got to roll.
2496000	2498000	Okay.
2498000	2501000	Yeah, Quine's way of thinking about it is to say,
2501000	2504000	look, you've got something in your, I've got something in my hand.
2504000	2506000	And let's say we want to talk about it.
2506000	2508000	And so I might do that by using a pronoun, right?
2508000	2510000	By just using the variable.
2510000	2511000	So what do you think?
2511000	2512000	Is it white?
2512000	2513000	Is it round?
2513000	2515000	Does it have roundness?
2515000	2517000	I can ask you all these questions about it.
2517000	2519000	But suppose I don't want to use a pronoun.
2519000	2522000	I don't like the idea of just using this variable.
2522000	2525000	I want to introduce a name for it.
2525000	2526000	Okay.
2526000	2528000	As I might in mathematics, I might say, for example,
2528000	2530000	improving the mean value theorem.
2530000	2534000	There's some point in that interval at which blah, blah, blah,
2534000	2536000	the point is something has a property.
2536000	2539000	And typically what I do then is what?
2539000	2542000	I introduce some name for that point.
2542000	2547000	I say, so there is some number N such that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
2547000	2553000	Or suppose I've discovered that someone in the organization is leaking secrets.
2553000	2554000	We don't know who yet.
2554000	2559000	I could just keep talking about the person who is leaking secrets
2559000	2561000	to something else, but that's kind of difficult.
2561000	2567000	I could just use pronoun saying he or she if we don't know who it is.
2567000	2570000	But what else could I do?
2570000	2573000	Give them a new name that's not used before.
2573000	2574000	Exactly.
2574000	2575000	Give them a new name.
2575000	2578000	So I could say, yeah, let's call the leaker.
2578000	2580000	Gosh, what?
2580000	2582000	Deep throat has been taken.
2582000	2585000	So we'll call it deep shoe.
2585000	2588000	Something like that.
2588000	2592000	And then we can talk about deep shoe and give and effect this person a name.
2592000	2594000	So we can do the same thing here.
2594000	2597000	There is some object that has this property A.
2597000	2600000	Well, let's call that object something.
2600000	2602000	And so we introduce a constant.
2602000	2609000	Now notice this is a constant, but actually it's very important that it be a new constant.
2609000	2617000	If I say, ah, yes, the person who's been leaking these secrets.
2617000	2621000	Let's call him Bob as I look straight.
2621000	2622000	Bob.
2622000	2623000	That's not good.
2623000	2626000	I've got to introduce some name that doesn't expose anything.
2626000	2628000	My daughter, by the way, has a tendency to do this.
2628000	2633000	She won't know people's names, but she gets tired of talking to or talking about the person
2633000	2635000	fitting a certain description and so on.
2635000	2637000	So she just introduces a name to that person.
2637000	2641000	And this isn't always wise because then you get to know the person and you're constantly
2641000	2644000	tempted to call them by that name.
2644000	2651000	Over the weekend, she, yes, there's this organist who's recently been hired.
2651000	2657000	And anyway, she was talking to, as it happened, the organist's wife saying, oh, yeah, the
2657000	2659000	new organ, Billy.
2659000	2661000	And wait, I married him.
2661000	2662000	His name was Billy.
2662000	2663000	David.
2663000	2664000	I don't know.
2664000	2667000	Or she did that with various cats in my neighborhood.
2667000	2671000	So there's one cat I thought had, you know, was named Figaro or something.
2671000	2675000	And then I walked down with the circle and actually meet the owner of the cat.
2675000	2678000	I say, oh, Figaro is such a nice cat.
2678000	2681000	That cat's name is Tom or whatever.
2681000	2685000	I was like, oh, that's what I thought about my daughter just introducing all these names.
2685000	2689000	And I had thought for all these years, Jackson knew the names of these people and objects
2689000	2691000	instead of just making them up.
2691000	2693000	Anyway, this is what she did.
2693000	2695000	She was just making up new constants.
2695000	2697000	And so practicing good, quiet, and louder.
2697000	2700000	Now, it's very important that you not stop it, right?
2700000	2704000	That the conclusion you're ultimately aiming at and doing a proof using this rule does
2704000	2706000	not include this name.
2706000	2711000	Otherwise, you know, you can get to conclusions like the new organist's name is Billy and
2711000	2713000	you end up in a silly place.
2713000	2714000	Yes.
2714000	2719000	I know I don't have much time left, but I really am struggling to see how this helps
2719000	2723000	us talk about what there really is.
2723000	2724000	Good.
2724000	2725000	Good, good, good.
2725000	2729000	This is all just the way of introducing it and what we mean by the rules, but now we
2729000	2732000	can talk about the semantics.
2732000	2735000	So we can say, how do we interpret these darn things anyway?
2735000	2737000	Now, one is making two points here.
2737000	2745000	One is that it's not that we start with the idea of a name here and then really use this,
2745000	2747000	although it looks that way in the lot.
2747000	2752000	He wants to say, I understand by a constant the kind of thing that will let me infer this
2752000	2755000	or that I can infer from something like this.
2755000	2760000	So a constant is the kind of thing that, in other words, I've got the something.
2760000	2763000	I'm convinced that it's something and then I'm allowed to use a name for the thing in
2763000	2764000	the logic.
2764000	2768000	So I'm not allowed to actually use names that don't denote anything in this logical
2768000	2769000	language.
2769000	2772000	And the semantics of this is important to understand.
2772000	2778000	A model is going to consist of a domain of objects.
2778000	2779000	And what's the idea?
2779000	2783000	These constants stand for particular objects in the domain.
2783000	2788000	So here is, you might say, intuitively speaking, that object A, the thing that the constant
2788000	2790000	A stands for.
2790000	2794000	The variables will range over the things in this domain.
2794000	2798000	They can stand for various things in that domain.
2798000	2806000	And then the objects in this domain will have some properties and they will stand in
2806000	2807000	the relations.
2807000	2812000	And we will understand the property in terms of the sets of objects having the property
2812000	2816000	and the relations in terms of n tuples of objects standing in the relation.
2816000	2824000	But in the end, it's really the objects in this domain that all of this is about.
2824000	2831000	And so a logic characterized in these ways where we've got quantifiers like this where
2831000	2842000	they range over now objects, individuals in the domain.
2842000	2853000	This is all known as first order logic.
2853000	2858000	And what Klein is basically saying is that first order logic is the canonical language
2858000	2859000	of science.
2859000	2863000	In the end, what we need here are the symbolic things, mathematics, functions, variables,
2863000	2864000	and so on.
2864000	2871000	And in short, we need first order logic.
2871000	2872000	What is that logic like?
2872000	2877000	It's a logic that allows us to talk about, to quantify over a set of objects, to understand
2877000	2880000	them as having properties and relations.
2880000	2884000	And so as giving us a sort of Aristotelian picture of the universe.
2884000	2890000	Now, what is it going to be to be, well, it's just to be one of those things in the domain,
2890000	2893000	to be among the things the variables range over.
2893000	2905000	Hence, to be, well, to be one of those things, to be a value of a variable, which is another
2905000	2908000	way of saying to be in that domain.
2908000	2912000	Now, from one point of view, you could say, I've learned nothing.
2912000	2913000	What is it to be?
2913000	2916000	It's to be among the things that we're talking about.
2916000	2921000	And it's like, gosh, you could have said that without all this logic.
2921000	2924000	But next time, as we'll see, he thinks he's gotten something.
2924000	2928000	Because by the end, he says, well, there are things we talk about, but then we have some
2928000	2930000	way of transforming that into something else.
