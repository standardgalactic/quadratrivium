1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
I want to talk today about Kant's categories.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,920
The categories in Aristotle are categories of being.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,640
They're senses in which a thing may be said to be.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,920
The same thing is true in the Vaisesha Kassutra.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,200
Kant proposes a system of categories, but it's a rather different system as we'll see,

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,880
and it's doing something different.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,080
These are not categories of being.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,480
And these come out of logical functions of judgment.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,240
He's looking at logic, and there's something that is fascinating in a biographical sense

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,280
when we look at this, because Kant, in his lectures on logic and in his little book on

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,840
logic, says, logic is a remarkable discipline.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,040
It really hasn't changed for the past 2,000 years, and it seems to be a complete subject.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,560
Nothing will ever be added to it.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,960
Well, modern logic has added a lot to it, so he was writing that just a few decades

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,120
before there would be a major transformation in logic.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,760
But nevertheless, when you look at the logical functions of judgment, he outlines, and look

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,920
at the categories, you realize, well, there's all sorts of stuff there that we can now explain

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,800
something of in logic, but that he couldn't have at all.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,640
So even in his own terms, he should have realized, wait, there's a lot more to do in this subject.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
My own logical functions of judgment include many, many concepts that aren't included

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,000
in my own logic book.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,040
But that's just sort of a comic aside.

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,960
What is Kant doing with these categories?

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,520
We've talked about Kant as a rationalist.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,360
He was a student of Wolf, who was a student of Leibniz, and he agrees that there are

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,320
innate ideas and that there is synthetic a priori knowledge.

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,360
The innate ideas he refers to is the pure concepts of the understanding.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,440
Those are the categories.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,720
But there are also synthetic a priori truths.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,480
He calls them laws of the understanding.

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,440
And so what I want to talk about today is that duo, basically, the categories, the pure

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,120
concepts of the understanding.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,080
So we'll see what Kant thinks are the innate ideas, and also what he takes these synthetic

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,520
a priori truths to be, the laws of the understanding.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,960
It is important to recognize that unlike other rationalists, Kant thinks these apply only

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,360
within the realm of experience.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,680
Descartes and Leibniz thought they were true about the world, and so we're happy to apply

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,520
them within experience and outside of experience, even to things we cannot experience.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,600
But Kant says, no, they're really part of the way in which our mind constructs experience.

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,960
And so they apply only to the output of that process, not to whatever input might be present

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,800
or to whatever might be in the world beyond the realm of our experience.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,240
He gives us, as we've seen, a transcendental argument.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,960
He says the a priori concepts and the laws of the understanding are necessary conditions

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,560
for the possibility of experience.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
But we do have experience, so of course it's possible.

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,320
So there must be a priori concepts.

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,800
There must be laws of the understanding.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,720
So in short, for us to experience the world at all, we have to have some innate ideas,

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,960
these a priori concepts of the understanding or the categories.

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,080
We also have to have synthetic a priori knowledge through the laws of the understanding.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
But that raises the question.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,480
What are the necessary conditions for the possibility of experience?

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,400
What in particular do I need?

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,320
What are these pure concepts of the understanding?

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
What concepts do I need, Kant?

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,120
What principles must I assume as synthetic a priori principles in order to have experience

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,080
be possible?

58
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,840
Good questions, and he does answer them.

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's think about some experiences.

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,680
I have visual experiences like this of the University of Texas Tower, or this of the

61
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:09,480
White House, or a field of flowers, or a sunset, or my cat Belle, or a pizza, or another pizza.

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm fond of pizza.

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,280
Well what makes all of these things possible?

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,920
Yes, some of these are visual experiences, that's how you've seen them, but I can tell

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,440
you with the pizzas, it wasn't just visual.

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,120
There was a wonderful smell, a wonderful taste, and so forth.

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,520
So we experience the world through our five senses in all sorts of ways.

68
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,640
What makes that kind of experience possible?

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Well the first thing Kant says, turning to sensibility now, he draws a sharp line between

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,680
sensibility and understanding.

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,240
In short between perception and reason, whatever our minds do on the basis of our experience

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,800
how we process and then draw inferences from our perceptions.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,920
But let's turn first to sensibility.

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,960
Just for us to have those sensations, to be able to experience the White House, or sunsets,

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,200
or pizza, well those things have to be represented in space and time.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,680
So space and time, he says, are a priori forms of sensibility.

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Vision obviously represents things as being in space.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,080
Vision does too, maybe less obviously, nevertheless, if you close your eyes and somebody around

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,240
you is making noise, you can tell where the noise is coming from.

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Your auditory system does represent things as being in space and time.

81
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,480
Now smell, taste, well not so much.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,440
But on the other hand, they still occur in time, you anticipate the taste of the pizza,

83
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,160
you actually enjoy the taste, afterwards you remember the taste.

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,720
And so that occurs in time.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,080
We perceive things as being in space and time.

86
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,200
So here's something we can say, and we can say it a priori independently of experience.

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,880
Perceptible objects exist in space and time.

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,040
That is a synthetic a priori truth.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,840
It is based on the general form of sensibility, the form of sensibility as representing things

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,920
in space and time.

91
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,440
I've referred to the metaphor in another video of a projector.

92
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,680
One sees the mind as something like a projector projecting an image on a screen.

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,440
We can know something about what's going to be on the screen and what couldn't be on

94
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,960
the screen on the basis of understanding the projector.

95
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,920
So he thinks, here's one thing I can tell you about the projector, just due to the nature

96
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,480
of our own faculty of sensibility and the way our mind processes whatever it receives,

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,320
things are perceived in space and time.

98
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,680
Things on that screen will have a spatial arrangement and they will occur in a temporal

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
series.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
I can tell you that before anything appears on that screen.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,040
So that's something I can know that's synthetic.

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,400
It's really about the things on the screen.

103
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,720
It's not just something purely logical or verbal, like a screen is a screen, what appears

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
will appear.

105
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,840
I mean, it's not like that, right?

106
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,600
It's something that gives you real information.

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
It will be in space.

108
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,320
It will be in time.

109
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,200
And I can know that not because I actually perceive them in space and time, and I say,

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,880
I'm figuring out, you know, I perceive things, I guess these things I perceive are in space

111
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
and time.

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Who knew?

113
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,600
He'll say, no, I could really know that a priori.

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,360
I know that just by knowing something about the way my mind processes information.

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,320
Now the categories are the part that pertains to the understanding.

116
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,640
Space and time are forms of sensibility.

117
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
But there are also forms of understanding.

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Things my mind does with the information it receives from sensation.

119
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,440
So sensibility gives the mind information.

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,360
And then he says a complex synthesis takes place.

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
A synthesis of the manifold of intuition is how he puts it.

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,640
And we construct objects out of that in, broadly speaking, a three-stage process.

123
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
I won't go through all the stages here.

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,880
What I'm interested in today is this question of the categories.

125
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,240
What pure concepts of the understanding are required in order for those stages of synthesis

126
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,160
to take place?

127
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,000
He says, well, we can find out by looking at the logical functions of judgment.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,480
The traditional rationalists had thought about universality and necessity.

129
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,880
And indeed Kant says universality and necessity are absolutely fundamental for understanding

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,720
why we need synthetic a priori truths and why we need pure concepts of the understanding.

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,880
But if we want to know what those pure concepts are, they aren't just to universality and

132
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
necessity.

133
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,480
It's more complicated than that.

134
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,320
We look to the functions of judgment in logic.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,520
And we say what is going on in a logical judgment?

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,360
Kant says there are basically four things going on.

137
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
And so there are four families of categories.

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,920
The first thing that goes on in a judgment is quantity.

139
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,920
We talk about things like Socrates was a philosopher.

140
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,040
We talk about sometimes groups of things.

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,280
Some ancient Greeks were prominent philosophers.

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,520
We talk sometimes about a totality.

143
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Those were the universality comes in.

144
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,560
All forces applied to a mass accelerate that mass.

145
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,160
And so those are basic categories.

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,280
Things that today in logic would refer to as quantifiers or as determiners.

147
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:21,640
So things like sum, all, several, every, any, these things function as indicators of quantity.

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,160
They are part of the logical functions of judgment.

149
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,600
And the same thing is true about objects.

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,580
One, unity, plurality, telling the difference between one and more than one.

151
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:40,720
As well as demonstrative things like this, that, in effect, this one, that one, the.

152
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
All of those are things that fall under this general category of quality.

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,680
So those are words that indicate these general categories.

154
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,080
We have ways of talking about objects, of telling one from more than one, of talking

155
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,040
about some things, several things, all, every, each thing, anything.

156
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,800
All of those are categories.

157
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,460
Those have to be built into the mind.

158
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,600
Those aren't things we get from experience.

159
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,120
You can say, well, I've learned about pigs by having encounters with pigs and, you know,

160
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,080
working on a pig farm and so forth.

161
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
How did you learn about this?

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Well, this what?

163
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,960
No, I just mean the word this.

164
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,760
How did you learn what each meant?

165
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,280
How did you learn several?

166
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,000
How did you learn to distinguish one thing from more than one thing?

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,960
The person's going to be like, well, do you mean how I learned the meaning of the word?

168
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,560
No, no, no, I don't mean that.

169
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,400
I mean, how you ever got the concept of one as opposed to more than one.

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:42,520
Well, can't point to an experience of that and constantly, yes, the mind came with that.

171
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,960
Okay, that was part of the building structure of the mind.

172
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,240
The mind is capable of combining things into objects, distinguishing one object from multiple

173
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,640
objects is capable of actually then explaining something about these pluralities of objects

174
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,920
and talking about one, some, several, and so forth.

175
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,900
And so all of those come as built-in structures.

176
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,240
We aren't gaining those logical meanings from experience.

177
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
We aren't understanding those logical concepts from experience.

178
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,960
The logical concepts are part of the structure of the mind.

179
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,240
Here's a second thing that goes on in judgments.

180
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,280
We judge quality.

181
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,280
So we affirm things, we deny things, and we express some limitations.

182
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,920
So Kant says, yes, we say Socrates is a philosopher or somebody can say, was Socrates the teacher

183
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
of Plato?

184
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Yes, that's true.

185
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,740
Those things are actually affirming something.

186
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:43,780
We can also say Socrates was not a plumber and that Socrates was not the teacher of Aristotle.

187
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,900
We can say then the claim that Socrates lived after Aristotle is false.

188
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,100
So we can also deny things.

189
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,020
So our ideas of is and is not, true and false, yes and no.

190
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,980
These are things that are, again, built into the mind.

191
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,220
This, that.

192
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,120
We don't learn those things through experience.

193
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,220
We may learn the gesture.

194
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,060
We may learn the words, but we don't learn the concepts from experience.

195
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,340
The mind comes with those built in.

196
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,980
And the same thing he says is true with limitation.

197
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,860
Something like unhappy or ahistorical or inauthentic.

198
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,140
You might think, well, those are just denials.

199
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,740
But Kant thinks not really, okay?

200
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,580
Say I talk to somebody, I say, well, how are you feeling today?

201
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
You feeling happy?

202
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,860
They say, well, I don't know.

203
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
You're unhappy?

204
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,980
Well, I don't know.

205
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Okay?

206
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,060
There's sort of a, sometimes we'll say, well, I'm not unhappy, right?

207
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,740
Is not unhappy the same as happy?

208
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Not really, okay?

209
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,020
And that's what Kant's picking up on here.

210
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,380
He's saying, yeah, is that authentic?

211
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,220
Well, it's not inauthentic.

212
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,700
That's not simply an affirmation that it is authentic.

213
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,620
Or if I refer to that as ahistorical, does that just mean it is not historical?

214
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,940
Well, maybe.

215
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,260
But sometimes it really means, no, it goes contrary to the history.

216
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,420
And so anyway, I can easily, in fact, you might say most of us spend many hours of our

217
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,780
lives in states that are neither happy nor unhappy.

218
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,180
And so all of those things are built into the mind at the outset.

219
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,340
Well, another category is the category of relation.

220
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,620
And there are all sorts of interesting and important relations, Kant says.

221
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Some of them involve inheritance and subsistence.

222
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,380
You might remember this from the categories of the Vaisesika tradition as they developed

223
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,180
beyond the original three in the Vaisesika Sutra.

224
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,660
So we've got is, the is of predication, like this is a hand.

225
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:55,700
We've got substance, quality, property, exemplifies, participates in, has, instantiates, for example,

226
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,900
for instance, such as, all of those refer to concepts that we're not gaining from experience.

227
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,820
The relation of this triangle to triangularity, we don't get that from experience.

228
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,700
That's something the mind is built understanding.

229
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,380
That is built into the structure of the mind, identifying things as objects, having the concept

230
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,540
of substance, of those qualities hanging together in something.

231
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,180
Notice these are just the things that empiricists, like Barkley and Hume said, I don't see how

232
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,940
you can get any of this from experience.

233
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,060
Kant says, of course you can't.

234
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,020
They come built into the mind.

235
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,680
They don't come from experience.

236
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,140
But of course we have these concepts.

237
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,140
Don't tell me we don't have the concept is that we don't have the concept of a substance

238
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:45,140
or quality or a property or of this participating in triangularity or exhibiting triangularity

239
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,140
or this being an example of this more general phenomenon, of course we have those concepts.

240
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,380
So and it's not just some internal custom of the mind.

241
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,860
It's something that the mind has built into it as its structure.

242
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,380
Now actually, there is a sense in which Kant's saying, well, it is a custom of the mind.

243
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,780
You're right about that Hume, but it's the structure of logic that is built into the

244
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
mind.

245
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,380
That's not some feeling or sentiment.

246
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,780
It's not outside of reason.

247
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,220
It is the very foundation of reason.

248
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,220
The same thing is true with causality and dependence.

249
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:23,020
If then relations cause, affect, because, depends, determines, grounds, all of those involve

250
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,420
various aspects of this relation of causality or dependence.

251
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,580
And then there are relations of community, of things being interdependent, reciprocity,

252
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:39,660
if and only if and or unless, part, whole, with, tons of these things happen in language

253
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,980
and they all refer to these relations of community.

254
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,980
The mind is built in such a way that it understands things as sometimes interrelated in various

255
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
ways.

256
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,980
It doesn't have to learn that.

257
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,900
Now it might have to learn a particular way in which things are interrelated, but the

258
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,660
idea that things can be related to one another in this way, the mind doesn't have to learn

259
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
that.

260
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,780
It comes built in recognizing that.

261
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,420
Then finally there are modal aspects of a judgment.

262
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,660
So we can talk about possibility, necessity, existence, non-existence.

263
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,180
He says there are three basic dichotomies here.

264
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,940
Possibility and impossibility, so words like possible can, may, might, could, and the concepts

265
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,900
they stand for.

266
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,780
Consistence and non-existence, so is, exists, will, and so forth.

267
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:36,060
Necessity and contingency, necessary, must, needs to, has to, would, all of those involve

268
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,020
some kind of modality.

269
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,560
And he says those are important.

270
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,860
Those are built into the structure of the mind.

271
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Hume's right.

272
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,580
We don't get necessity from experience.

273
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,660
We don't get causation from experience.

274
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,940
We don't get possibility from experience.

275
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,300
But they're crucial parts of logic.

276
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,580
They are part of the foundations of reason.

277
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,260
So don't tell me we have no such concepts, or that they're outside the realm of reason,

278
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,900
or that they're just emotions and feelings of expectation.

279
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Nonsense.

280
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,140
They are part of the logical functions of judgment.

281
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,500
They're built into logic, the very foundation of reason.

282
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,420
Well, when we think about advances in logic since Kant's day, we can say maybe modern

283
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,580
logicians should recognize as a variety of other categories, still within his basic

284
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,460
families of categories.

285
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,420
Under the heading of quantity, there are lots of other words and concepts that go along.

286
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:31,340
In addition to the ones he mentioned, so many, few, most, more, less, finitely many, infinitely

287
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,060
many, countably many, uncountably many.

288
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,100
And then what I've marked here is a little null symbol.

289
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
In other words, I mean whatever we say, what we mean when we talk about things in terms

290
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:49,420
of bear plurals, tigers are striped for example, lions are tawny, cats meow, birds fly.

291
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,300
Tigers going on there, presumably that's a kind of quantity or kind of something that

292
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,060
is built into the mind.

293
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,900
They're qualities, and not only the things he mentions, but also things involving temporal

294
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
relations.

295
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,100
They arise through sensibility, but we also have built in concepts for understanding things

296
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,060
as arranged in time.

297
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,700
So verb tenses, for example, or various indicators of aspects, like the difference between runs

298
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,980
and is running and used to run.

299
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,980
And then prepositions like before, after, since, until, now, then, all of those are temporal

300
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,540
things that seem to be built into the mind.

301
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:33,140
Similarly, there are other relations, like equality or similarity, like, near, far, closer

302
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,460
than, between, belongs to.

303
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,300
And then maybe other modalities, ones he doesn't directly talk about, but like may, should,

304
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,660
not, things that again, human worries can't be derived from experience, and Kant would

305
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,660
say, yeah, they're built into the nature of the mind.

306
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,540
But also things like generally, typically, normally, maybe other things like knowing,

307
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,820
believing, seeing, fearing, wanting, maybe all of those are built into the mind as well.

308
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,780
Whatever we want to say exactly about the boundaries there, we should be able to say,

309
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:10,260
okay, things like that are presumably maybe part of this idea of the pure concepts of

310
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,780
the understanding as well.

311
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,380
They relate to the pure concepts in the sense that they relate to logical functions of judgment.

312
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,660
Well what kinds of principles of the understanding do we build out of these pure concepts of

313
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,940
the understanding?

314
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,260
Here are some examples Kant gives.

315
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,740
Every object stands under the necessary conditions of the synthetic unity of the manifold of

316
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,300
intuition in a possible experience.

317
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,700
Let me translate from the Kantian language.

318
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,100
He says, every object of experience, is in effect something that would be displayed

319
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,020
on that screen we've talked about.

320
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,660
I can know that all the objects have to conform to the conditions of being on that screen,

321
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,980
so they all have to conform to space and time.

322
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,620
They all have to conform to the logical functions of judgment.

323
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,020
And so they have to be one or many.

324
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,380
They have to either be related to one another or not.

325
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,360
They have to be in a relation of dependence or not.

326
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,600
They have to have some modal character.

327
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,920
Either they are there now or they could be there, they were there, they will be there.

328
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,200
We can say something about all those structures before they even appear.

329
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,400
They are subject to the conditions of the synthesis of the unity of the manifold.

330
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,600
In other words, the way in which projector forms objects and projects them onto the screen

331
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
of experience.

332
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,560
Secondly, in all change of appearances, substance is permanent.

333
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,680
Its quantum in nature is neither increased nor diminished.

334
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,880
A kind of law of conservation of substance, conservation of matter.

335
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,280
Well after Einstein, we're inclined to think, I don't know about that, that would cut.

336
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,280
But of course physics still maintains a law of the conservation of energy.

337
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,000
And when you think about this one, you can say, well, cut is onto something interesting

338
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
here.

339
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,760
What he's saying is that substance is that in which quality is in here.

340
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,040
And so whatever you want to say about that, whatever it is the quality is in here, and

341
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,560
maybe in modern physics we want to say, well it's not exactly substance, it's energy,

342
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,240
or it's waves, or something.

343
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
I mean whatever physical theory ends up saying about that.

344
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Maybe it'll be a string in hyperspace, who knows.

345
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,440
But whatever it is, we could say that remains the same.

346
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,800
It's quality's change, but in the end we postulate that something is enduring across

347
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,000
these changes of quality.

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,600
So that idea that something endures across change, whether we call it substance or something

349
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,440
else, he says is a basic feature of the mind.

350
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,720
Third, all alterations, all changes take place in conformity with the law of the connection

351
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
of cause and effect.

352
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,200
In other words, things just don't happen randomly and spontaneously.

353
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
Things cause other things.

354
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,680
Things that happen are effects of other things.

355
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,320
So cause and effect applies to the world.

356
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,680
We can know that because we can know something about the projector, and knows that it projects

357
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
things as causally related to one another.

358
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,880
And finally, we know that it also projects them as interrelated with one another.

359
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,840
All substances insofar as they can be perceived to coexist in space are in thorough-growing

360
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
reciprocity.

361
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,760
So we know that the projector is such that the objects of experience are represented

362
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,520
as together there in space and time, as in some sense together there under the logical

363
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,680
functions of judgment.

364
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,920
So in effect he's saying, look, it's built into the mind that we're seeing things on

365
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,400
one screen, that we're building one universe, one universal experience.

366
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,840
It's not as if we're experiencing some multiverse.

367
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,440
And different things are going on, and there are these different realms of objects that

368
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,400
are simply completely unrelated.

369
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,840
The mind is projecting things on all sorts of different screens at once.

370
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,960
No, there is one screen of experience, he's saying, and everything is in some way on that

371
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,480
screen related to the same logical functions, related to one another, on the same screen

372
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,120
in the same spatiotemporal manifold.

373
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,480
So out of that he says we do get some synthetic a priori judgments.

374
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,120
Things like physical objects are in space and time.

375
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,680
Mathematics, he thinks, follows from this.

376
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,280
The world consists of objects having properties, standing in relation to one another.

377
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,240
Substances persist through change.

378
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,960
Every event has a cause.

379
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,600
Everything relates in some way to everything else.

380
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,440
Those he thinks we can know independently of experience.

381
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,320
But they apply only to the phenomena.

382
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,360
Only to the things as we perceive them, only to the objects of experience.

383
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,320
The categories apply to those.

384
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,440
The a priori principles apply to those.

385
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,920
We can know them with universality and necessity because they fall under the pure concepts

386
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
of the understanding.

387
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,480
But the numinal, the things in themselves, the categories don't apply to them.

388
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,040
The a priori principles don't apply to them.

389
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,640
We don't know about them at all.

390
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,800
So Kant says, think about our diagram over here.

391
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,980
Think about this picture of the mind projecting the objects of experience.

392
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,720
We can know things about those because in the projection the mind is representing them

393
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,760
as being in space and time.

394
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,040
The mind is representing them as being susceptible to the logical forms of judgment.

395
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,960
And so the categories apply to them.

396
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,240
We can say this is one triangle.

397
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,860
We can talk about it as an object.

398
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,060
We can do a variety of other things indicating what must be true of it.

399
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,540
And all of that indicates that those principles, those a priori principles, the laws of the

400
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,940
understanding apply here.

401
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,260
But now if we move down to the realm of things in themselves, the realm he refers to as the

402
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:44,460
numinal, the numinal realm, then we say, we can't say anything about those at all.

403
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,100
They are outside of what is on that screen of experience.

404
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,660
And so our concepts aren't applying to them, those pure concepts of the understanding.

405
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,940
Those laws of the understanding don't apply to them.

406
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,820
I can't say they have a certain character because the things projected on the screen

407
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
do.

408
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,620
I don't know what they're like.

409
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,940
And so in the end he says, I can know things a priori.

410
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,420
I can know things a priori about the objects of experience precisely because my mind is

411
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:19,740
taking information, synthesizing it in a multi-stage process and producing these objects

412
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,660
of experience.

413
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,940
And so I can know something about what they're going to be like.

414
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,460
I have no idea what the world beyond them is like.
