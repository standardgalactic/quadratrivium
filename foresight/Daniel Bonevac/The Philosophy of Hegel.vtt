00:00.000 --> 00:13.160
Hi, today I want to talk about the philosophy of Hegel, one of the last great system builders.

00:13.160 --> 00:18.800
I am going to ignore the warning of some analytic philosophers that one must never finagle with

00:18.800 --> 00:24.600
Hegel, there can be no apology for his phenomenology, and instead talk about some of the ideas in

00:24.600 --> 00:29.200
his work, The Phenomenology of Spirit, and a number of other works, especially we're

00:29.200 --> 00:34.720
going to focus on Hegel's dialectic, his way of thinking about the way in which thought

00:34.720 --> 00:40.440
is transformed, the dynamics of thought, if you will, the way it changes over time.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.600
Logicians tend to think about the logical relations among propositions, what's a premise,

00:44.600 --> 00:46.440
what's a conclusion, and so forth.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.080
It's a very static picture.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.040
Occasionally they talk about how language changes, a logic might try to take into account

00:53.040 --> 00:57.920
the fact that sentences are said in sequences, building on one another, not merely as sets

00:57.920 --> 01:03.240
that all somehow get presented at the same time, but most logical systems abstract away

01:03.240 --> 01:04.240
from all of that.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.400
Hegel thinks that the most fundamental ideas of logic, however, should have to do with

01:08.400 --> 01:13.240
the dynamics of thought, the way in which thought progresses, thought changes.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.640
And that's a very different conception, so logicians who pick up Hegel's logic are

01:17.640 --> 01:21.440
going to be surprised, they're going to be finding very little that's familiar, and

01:21.440 --> 01:24.520
a great deal that seems to them very, very strange.

01:24.520 --> 01:29.360
It's because Hegel is interested in those dynamic questions, not in the static question

01:29.360 --> 01:35.240
of how this proposition relates to that proposition, but instead how people thinking about a problem

01:35.240 --> 01:39.440
in a certain way or having a certain kind of view are going to find themselves confronted

01:39.440 --> 01:43.400
with things that will then lead them to think about things in a different way.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.760
So he's interested in something like the dynamics of thinking, whereas you might say that most

01:48.760 --> 01:53.320
logicians are focused on the statics or the kinematics at most of thinking.

01:53.320 --> 01:58.600
So Hegel is giving us a very different conception, not just of logic, but of the philosophy of

01:58.600 --> 02:04.440
mind, of the nature of the world than we find in earlier philosophers, and his impact over

02:04.440 --> 02:08.240
the last two centuries has been immense.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.920
Let's begin by recalling some key facts about Kant.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.960
Kant's rationalism held that there were innate ideas, pure concepts of the understanding

02:16.960 --> 02:20.880
in his way of presenting it, the categories that were based on the logical functions

02:20.880 --> 02:22.140
of judgment.

02:22.140 --> 02:26.820
And then there were synthetic a priori truths or laws of the understanding, things that

02:26.820 --> 02:31.660
we used as part of our conceptualization of the world to actually construct the objects

02:31.660 --> 02:33.420
of experience.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.260
So Kant was a kind of idealist.

02:36.260 --> 02:40.980
The objects of experience are things we construct through our own mental activity.

02:40.980 --> 02:45.900
We receive information from sensibility, but then that gets processed in a multi-stage

02:45.900 --> 02:49.740
process into objects that we synthesize.

02:49.740 --> 02:55.180
And so we can know things about them, our priori, independently of experience by understanding

02:55.180 --> 02:57.300
that process of synthesis.

02:57.300 --> 03:00.340
But all of this applies only within the realm of experience.

03:00.340 --> 03:05.460
It applies to things that are being projected, not to the world itself.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.900
Hegel has a very different idea.

03:07.900 --> 03:13.580
So to think about what he is doing to change the picture, let me draw you a little sketch

03:13.580 --> 03:17.220
of what Kant had in mind.

03:17.220 --> 03:21.780
Kant's picture, as we've laid it out, is something like this.

03:21.780 --> 03:28.860
Kant, let's say, depicts a thought as occurring within a mind, a mind that is receiving information

03:28.860 --> 03:31.340
in some fashion from sensibility.

03:31.340 --> 03:36.540
So here we have sensibility, our faculties of sense, perception.

03:36.540 --> 03:45.380
And here out there is something that is generating that, the thing in itself, numina is his technical

03:45.380 --> 03:46.940
term for that.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.660
We relate, in a multi-stage process, the information coming from sensibility, let's

03:51.660 --> 03:56.700
say, through this perception, to some concepts here.

03:56.700 --> 04:00.300
Maybe some empirical concepts we've derived from experience.

04:00.300 --> 04:06.700
Maybe from, well, from our a priori concepts of the understanding.

04:06.700 --> 04:12.260
And then the mind projects on the basis of this an object of experience, the thing that

04:12.260 --> 04:15.140
we experience as a triangle.

04:15.140 --> 04:18.660
And we take our thought to be about that triangle.

04:18.660 --> 04:25.580
But really, it's not a direct line of that triangle affecting us, as in Plato or Aristotle

04:25.580 --> 04:27.300
or many earlier philosophers.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.540
Instead, this thing is an appearance.

04:30.540 --> 04:33.220
It is something that is being constructed.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.300
It's an appearance.

04:34.300 --> 04:37.700
He also refers to that as an object of experience.

04:37.700 --> 04:42.540
He uses the Greek term, this is a phenomenon.

04:42.540 --> 04:47.700
This is a numinon, that is to say, the thing in itself.

04:47.700 --> 04:52.900
So in general, the phenomena of experience, the objects of experience, are things that

04:52.900 --> 04:55.420
are the product of mental activity.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.100
I compared this, in my talk about Kant, to a projector.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.020
The mind is something like a projector.

05:01.020 --> 05:06.260
And some information comes into the projector, a digital file, a film strip, something that

05:06.260 --> 05:09.620
gives it information about what it is to project.

05:09.620 --> 05:12.700
But then it projects something on the screen of experience.

05:12.700 --> 05:18.820
And we can know something a priori about the things that will be projected on that screen

05:18.820 --> 05:22.100
by knowing something about the projector.

05:22.100 --> 05:26.700
But given that we have knowledge of things on the screen, and we are able to have some

05:26.700 --> 05:31.860
reflective knowledge of the nature of the projector, what then do we infer about the

05:31.860 --> 05:33.660
thing in itself?

05:33.660 --> 05:38.300
Well, we have no guarantee that these things will obey the laws of the understanding, they're

05:38.300 --> 05:39.860
the inputs.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.460
So for example, it might be that everything that can appear on that screen, because we're

05:43.460 --> 05:46.660
using a black and white projector, is black and white.

05:46.660 --> 05:50.420
That doesn't mean that reality is just black and white, that what goes into it is black

05:50.420 --> 05:53.340
and white, that what goes into it has any color at all.

05:53.340 --> 05:58.060
For that matter, it could just be a digital file, it might be zeros and ones, or really

05:58.060 --> 06:01.940
just electrical impulses that are meant to represent zeros and ones.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.580
And so what's getting projected here is no similarity to this at all.

06:05.580 --> 06:09.220
So in short, we can infer nothing about the nature of the thing in itself.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.940
He refers to this as the unconditioned equal to x.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.860
That is to say, it is unknown.

06:14.860 --> 06:16.140
We don't know.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.700
Something he thinks must be affecting sensibility.

06:18.700 --> 06:23.540
It's not just doing this of its own accord, it's not just kind of off on a wild flight

06:23.540 --> 06:25.300
of fancy.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.700
And after all, different people seem to perceive the same thing at the same time.

06:28.700 --> 06:32.180
If you were to walk into this room, you would see chairs, you would see lights, you would

06:32.180 --> 06:33.460
see me.

06:33.460 --> 06:38.340
And so that, I mean, that needs to be explained, we'll talk about that problem much later.

06:38.340 --> 06:43.340
But Kant says all this is reason to think there is a thing in itself.

06:43.340 --> 06:48.700
First thing Hegel does is say, wait a minute, I don't think that's doing anything for you.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.820
Look, you're saying sensibility is receiving information from the thing in itself, the

06:52.820 --> 06:54.620
new and the world.

06:54.620 --> 06:57.700
And then this is all taking place, and we can know about this part.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.340
We can know about this part.

06:59.340 --> 07:04.780
We can deduce something about all of this, even our priori, good with you with all that.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.860
But now what role exactly is this playing?

07:06.860 --> 07:11.460
You can't officially even say this exists, or that it's causing us to perceive things

07:11.460 --> 07:15.800
in any way, because causation and existence are some of the categories.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.420
You know they apply the things out here, you have no reason for thinking they apply here.

07:19.420 --> 07:20.420
Maybe they do.

07:20.420 --> 07:23.220
I mean, you can't rule it out on the basis of what you've said.

07:23.220 --> 07:26.260
But in short, the thing in itself is playing no role in the theory.

07:26.260 --> 07:28.900
It is doing nothing for you, okay?

07:28.900 --> 07:33.780
It's sitting around like an independent wheel, or like an appendix, you might say, in a human

07:33.780 --> 07:38.300
body where maybe it's good for something, but it doesn't seem like it's good for anything.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.520
So Hegel says, first of all, get rid of that.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.140
It accomplishes nothing in this theory.

07:45.140 --> 07:48.420
We end up having some weird thing there, and we say, well, we can't say anything about it.

07:48.420 --> 07:49.620
We don't know what's going on.

07:49.620 --> 07:54.860
In short, it's just like substance in luck from Barclay's point of view, for example,

07:54.860 --> 07:56.220
or from Hume's point of view.

07:56.220 --> 07:59.780
You end up saying, well, there must be something I know not what in which these qualities in

07:59.780 --> 08:02.820
here that makes this all hang together as an object.

08:02.820 --> 08:05.060
Well, what is it, says Barclay.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.900
Something you know not what?

08:07.900 --> 08:09.940
That's no theory of anything.

08:09.940 --> 08:10.940
Just get rid of it.

08:10.940 --> 08:11.940
You don't need it.

08:11.940 --> 08:13.700
There's just a bunch of qualities here, right?

08:13.700 --> 08:15.060
You say, no, they're in something.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.060
They're in something.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.060
What?

08:17.060 --> 08:18.060
I don't know.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.020
I mean, Barclay's in effect saying, that's no theory.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.020
Get rid of it.

08:21.020 --> 08:22.900
It's doing no theoretical work for you at all.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.780
And Hegel says the same thing to Kant here.

08:24.780 --> 08:30.260
He says, OK, so all of this process rests ultimately on a thing in itself that is doing something

08:30.260 --> 08:36.020
I know not what, and has something I know not what character that enables it to do whatever

08:36.020 --> 08:37.540
I don't know what it's doing.

08:37.540 --> 08:41.980
And in short, he says, that just explains nothing.

08:41.980 --> 08:42.980
Get rid of it.

08:42.980 --> 08:43.980
It's not doing any work.

08:43.980 --> 08:46.060
It explains nothing, whatever.

08:46.060 --> 08:52.580
But the second thing he does is to say, OK, you're getting something a priori here, and

08:52.580 --> 08:56.260
you've got these laws of the understanding, the a priori concepts.

08:56.260 --> 09:01.140
Well, all right, there are empirical things like triangle, but then there's all this stuff

09:01.140 --> 09:03.940
here that you claim is a priori.

09:03.940 --> 09:08.460
And you say from that, you can get universal knowledge.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.860
You can get necessary knowledge.

09:11.860 --> 09:20.860
Well, Hegel says, that's going to be true, only if we all have exactly the same a priori

09:20.860 --> 09:22.340
concepts of the understanding.

09:22.900 --> 09:28.220
Only if the same laws of the understanding operate for everybody, every human being,

09:28.220 --> 09:33.780
and every culture, every time, every place, why should we think any of that is true?

09:33.780 --> 09:38.740
Why should we believe that all of us share the same a priori concepts?

09:38.740 --> 09:41.740
That all of us share the same laws of the understanding?

09:41.740 --> 09:46.380
All of us approach experience in the same way and have our minds function in the same

09:46.380 --> 09:47.380
way?

09:47.380 --> 09:51.260
Hegel says, I don't see why that should be true at all.

09:51.260 --> 09:56.140
So Hegel thinks about these categories, these concepts of the understanding and the laws

09:56.140 --> 10:01.540
of the understanding, and says, why should they be constant and invariable?

10:01.540 --> 10:06.060
Why do they have to be universal, all human beings, all times, all places?

10:06.060 --> 10:08.380
That doesn't seem right.

10:08.380 --> 10:13.420
We're going to get universal and necessary knowledge of the world only if all of that

10:13.420 --> 10:19.540
is constant, the same for all people, all times, all places, all circumstances, all

10:19.820 --> 10:23.500
societies, all cultures, all historical periods, etc.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.340
But there's no reason to expect that.

10:25.340 --> 10:30.780
Why should we expect human beings to construct the world in the same way at all times and

10:30.780 --> 10:36.180
places, all circumstances, all cultures?

10:36.180 --> 10:42.300
Think about somebody seeing the world as a resident of ancient Egypt.

10:42.300 --> 10:47.260
Apparently they saw the world as two-dimensional, that's a joke, or someone who is a resident

10:47.300 --> 10:53.820
of a medieval village, or someone living in the midst of the Kalahari Desert, or modern-day

10:53.820 --> 10:55.340
Manhattan.

10:55.340 --> 10:59.500
Why should all of these people construct the world in the same way?

10:59.500 --> 11:03.380
Why should they all approach it with the same set of concepts?

11:03.380 --> 11:06.300
Of course they're going to have different concepts coming in from experience, but Hegel

11:06.300 --> 11:07.780
doesn't just mean that.

11:07.780 --> 11:12.500
Why should we assume they have all the same starting points at the outset?

11:12.500 --> 11:15.020
So Hegel says, I'm a historicist.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.500
What does that mean?

11:16.500 --> 11:20.180
The way we construct the world develops over time.

11:20.180 --> 11:26.060
Philosophy, and these a priori concepts, these laws of the understanding, they vary with

11:26.060 --> 11:28.580
historical circumstances.

11:28.580 --> 11:35.820
The famous quotation here is, philosophy is its own time raised to the level of thought.

11:35.820 --> 11:42.420
Hegel says, tell me what an ancient Egyptian said in philosophy, or what an ancient Greek

11:42.420 --> 11:47.780
said, or a medieval villager said, or a resident of the modern-day United States says.

11:47.780 --> 11:50.500
I'll tell you, those are the cultural assumptions.

11:50.500 --> 11:54.540
Those are the assumptions, the concepts they're bringing to understand the world.

11:54.540 --> 11:55.940
Are they all identical?

11:55.940 --> 11:56.940
No.

11:56.940 --> 11:57.940
There are some overlap.

11:57.940 --> 12:03.260
I mean, it would be surprising, given that they're all human beings who face basic human

12:03.260 --> 12:05.100
problems if there were no overlap at all.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.060
Of course there's overlap.

12:08.060 --> 12:13.140
And you might try to find that overlap as, aha, that's the true universal necessary

12:13.140 --> 12:16.620
a priori thing, which I think is Kant's attitude.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.340
But Hegel says, I'm not so sure about that.

12:18.340 --> 12:23.180
It might be that just that set of people in that set of circumstances historically developing

12:23.180 --> 12:24.980
have that set of concepts.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.900
Now go study the people in the Kalahari Desert.

12:27.900 --> 12:32.900
Go study those who are indigenous peoples above the Arctic Circle.

12:32.900 --> 12:37.900
Go find some people living on remote Pacific islands or remote areas of the Amazon.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.980
Are they going to conceptualize things the same way?

12:40.980 --> 12:43.580
I mean, maybe they do get hungry.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.140
They do get thirsty.

12:45.140 --> 12:49.860
There may be some things that they all have in common as human beings.

12:49.860 --> 12:54.620
But we shouldn't assume that at the outset, that's a question for anthropologists.

12:54.620 --> 12:59.900
And so Hegel says, really, when I think about how people organize experience, I don't find

12:59.900 --> 13:03.180
them all saying, oh yes, every event must have a cause.

13:03.180 --> 13:06.620
In fact, in the contemporary world, now that we've been exposed to quantum mechanics and

13:06.620 --> 13:10.860
the real possibility that some things just happen without cause, that it bests their

13:10.860 --> 13:15.060
statistical regularities at some level of reality.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.060
Not clear, by the way, that that's in the end how to interpret those theories.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.180
But it's a very plausible way to interpret them.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.300
And by now, we're used to that thought.

13:22.300 --> 13:26.700
So we look at Kant, or earlier philosophers, saying every event must have a cause.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.580
This is built into the structure of the mind.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.580
And we're inclined to say, well, no, it's not.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.260
I can entertain the possibility that's not true.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.900
That some things are truly random.

13:36.900 --> 13:42.460
What about other ideas, like, gosh, the idea that the amount of matter in the world cannot

13:42.460 --> 13:45.620
be destroyed or expanded?

13:45.620 --> 13:52.460
Maybe, but maybe that's exactly what happens when we have an atomic explosion.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.940
We convert matter into energy.

13:54.940 --> 13:57.140
Maybe the amount of energy in the world remains constant.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.980
Our physical theory tells us that it is.

13:59.980 --> 14:03.420
On the other hand, I can imagine that it's not.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.020
So in short, we're now thinking, there are a lot of things that these philosophers thought

14:07.020 --> 14:11.700
was impossible for us to entertain that we think we can entertain.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.820
Those things seem to change over time.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.660
Well, they do change.

14:15.660 --> 14:21.260
But Hegel says, that doesn't mean that I want to end up as an absolute relativist who says,

14:21.260 --> 14:24.860
well, you know, if just the truth varies with time and place.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.700
Or to become a skeptic who says, who knows, who's right?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.220
We all approach the world differently, and blah, blah, blah.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.420
And instead, he says, no.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.740
There are ways in which thought progresses.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.820
There are ways in which cultures progress.

14:36.820 --> 14:40.060
There are ways in which thinking progresses.

14:40.060 --> 14:43.940
And he calls that, well, in German, the term is geist.

14:43.940 --> 14:48.140
In fact, his great work is the phenomenology of geist.

14:48.140 --> 14:55.060
That is to say, of spirit or of mind that progresses through stages toward absolute knowledge.

14:55.060 --> 14:59.460
Here in talking about geist, he doesn't mean just specifically your mind.

14:59.860 --> 15:00.580
Or my mind.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.980
He really means thinking itself.

15:02.980 --> 15:07.540
The ways in which human beings approach the world the way they think about the world

15:07.540 --> 15:11.420
progress as human beings live in this world over time.

15:11.420 --> 15:14.260
It progresses toward absolute knowledge.

15:14.260 --> 15:17.140
He has hopes that we will finally reach it.

15:17.140 --> 15:20.500
Maybe it'll be a limit we will never really achieve.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
But in any case, that's what's happening.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.660
So it's not a random process.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.940
We aren't sitting there thinking, well, who knows who's right?

15:27.940 --> 15:30.820
He says, no, thinking is getting better and better.

15:30.820 --> 15:34.100
We're approaching the ultimate truth.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.620
But we could still be far away from it.

15:36.620 --> 15:41.100
So what takes place as we progress through these stages?

15:41.100 --> 15:47.020
What really matters here is not how this set of people happens to see the world at this time.

15:47.020 --> 15:52.100
Instead, it's the dynamic principles that govern the development of thinking over time.

15:52.100 --> 15:57.100
If we have reason to think that we're going to eventually attain absolute knowledge of the world,

15:57.140 --> 16:01.140
well, it must be because we understand what's going on with these dynamic principles.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.540
So what can we say about that?

16:03.540 --> 16:09.940
Hegel says, philosophy can express universal and necessary truths, but not of the kind

16:09.940 --> 16:11.060
that Kant thought.

16:11.060 --> 16:16.940
Not necessary and universal truths about the world as he or earlier, Abbaseno or Descartes

16:16.940 --> 16:19.780
or Leibniz or other rationalists tried to sketch out.

16:19.780 --> 16:21.380
He says, not that kind of thing.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.100
You're looking for things that are constant across all times, places, cultures, historical

16:25.100 --> 16:26.100
periods and so on.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.700
That's not it.

16:27.700 --> 16:31.980
I'm talking about the laws that govern the development of thought itself.

16:31.980 --> 16:36.060
So what we're going to be able to find as universal and necessary isn't anything about

16:36.060 --> 16:37.260
the world.

16:37.260 --> 16:42.540
It's about the development of thinking, the dynamic principles that govern thought.

16:42.540 --> 16:46.100
There will not be a a priori propositions about the world.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.020
There will not be innate concepts about the world.

16:48.020 --> 16:54.420
There will be these innate higher order abilities and tendencies of thinking that are going to

16:54.460 --> 16:59.340
allow us to articulate universal and necessary dynamic principles.

16:59.340 --> 17:02.500
So these are high level dynamic principles.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.620
Not about the world, but about our thinking about the world.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.940
They govern the development of thought.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.940
Hegel is thinking about thinking.

17:09.940 --> 17:16.860
He is thinking about our processes of cognition over time and the way we develop our theories,

17:16.860 --> 17:21.860
the way we approach the world, the concepts we use and the ways in which they change in

17:21.900 --> 17:24.500
response to experience.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.940
He has a number of these dynamic principles.

17:26.940 --> 17:33.300
By far the most famous is what's become known as the thesis, antithesis, synthesis pattern.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.540
And it is a common pattern.

17:34.540 --> 17:39.980
He thinks he outlines this and the details of its development in a number of different

17:39.980 --> 17:40.980
ways.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.340
So he sees this happening again and again.

17:43.340 --> 17:44.340
Now what is it?

17:44.340 --> 17:47.100
Well, let me use an analogy.

17:47.100 --> 17:52.340
Physics tries to give us some constant universal necessary scientific laws.

17:52.340 --> 17:56.140
It looks at a world with things changing, but says nevertheless there's something that

17:56.140 --> 17:57.140
isn't changing.

17:57.140 --> 18:00.860
The laws according to which things are changing, they don't change.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.180
So the scientific laws are constant.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.180
The things in the world are changing.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.740
But we can say how.

18:06.740 --> 18:11.980
And that's what physics tries to do in laws of gravitation, laws of motion, laws governing

18:11.980 --> 18:15.580
electromagnetism, and in a variety of other ways.

18:15.580 --> 18:18.300
The theory of relativity does something similar.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.980
It looks at the qualities of things in the world.

18:20.980 --> 18:28.820
Things like velocity or motion or even, well, gosh, mass, a variety of things that would

18:28.820 --> 18:33.780
have been taken to be primary qualities in the things themselves by Descartes and Locke.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.180
And it says, well, actually those things change.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.460
They change across various reference frames.

18:38.460 --> 18:41.500
They're really relative to a reference frame.

18:41.500 --> 18:48.100
But the scientific laws, things like this is the speed of light, or like, well, momentum

18:48.100 --> 18:52.100
is inertial mass times velocity.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.800
Those are things that are invariant across reference frames.

18:55.800 --> 19:00.260
And so some scientific laws are invariant, no matter how we look at things, no matter

19:00.260 --> 19:03.660
whether we're moving or stationary and so on.

19:03.660 --> 19:08.260
But the qualities of things, including the primary qualities, as traditionally understood,

19:08.260 --> 19:11.700
they do change across frames.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.220
Hegel's historicism is doing something similar.

19:14.220 --> 19:18.860
It says, our theories about the world are basic concepts that we use about the world

19:18.860 --> 19:26.700
change, but there are dynamic principles about those concepts and theories that are constant.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.140
So he is looking at a changing set of things.

19:29.140 --> 19:36.140
In this case, not a changing world or a changing set of reference frames, but instead a changing

19:36.140 --> 19:37.580
set of theories about the world.

19:37.580 --> 19:42.500
And he's saying, I can formulate laws for how those theories change.

19:42.500 --> 19:47.780
And so if you look at a changing world here and then think of our theories as being one

19:47.780 --> 19:52.220
level up, trying to be constant, Hegel's looking and saying, yeah, but they're not very constant,

19:52.220 --> 19:53.220
are they?

19:53.220 --> 19:54.860
Look one level higher.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.060
That's where you get the constant.

19:57.060 --> 20:02.180
Theories about the way in which our thinking about the world changes.

20:02.180 --> 20:07.340
So if you might say an ordinary science of the world and traditional philosophies are

20:07.340 --> 20:11.700
looking at the world saying, we got a changing world, but maybe we can find some unchanging

20:11.700 --> 20:17.140
truths about it, Hegel says, I see a bunch of changing theories about those unchanging

20:17.140 --> 20:22.380
truths, but I can tell you how those theories are changing.

20:22.380 --> 20:27.900
And I'll come up with the only truly unchanging things one level higher at the level of thinking,

20:27.900 --> 20:31.700
not about the world, but thinking about thinking.

20:31.700 --> 20:35.900
So here's his idea, behind thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.700
We start with a thesis.

20:37.700 --> 20:43.420
It transforms itself into an antithesis, or you might say it comes into conflict with

20:43.420 --> 20:47.900
an antithesis, and then out of that arises a synthesis.

20:47.900 --> 20:52.060
All of this can be presented in a way that makes it sound utterly mysterious and mystical,

20:52.060 --> 20:54.620
and some philosophers have rejected it that way.

20:54.620 --> 20:58.300
The African philosopher Quasiruridu, for example, is looking at this saying, these are just

20:58.300 --> 21:03.620
seemingly mystical laws, and insofar as Marx takes them over and builds them into the foundations

21:03.620 --> 21:09.100
of Marxism, there's similarly this mystical thing going on at the basis of Marxism.

21:09.100 --> 21:15.380
Well, turning here just to the Hegel part, forget Marx for a moment, we can say, I think

21:15.380 --> 21:20.620
he has in mind something that isn't quite as mystical as all of that.

21:20.620 --> 21:22.860
Here's the underlying idea.

21:22.860 --> 21:27.380
Suppose we are interested in mapping out the course of, well in this case, the Colorado

21:27.380 --> 21:32.660
River as it's going through southern Utah and headed toward the Grand Canyon.

21:32.660 --> 21:38.540
We find formations like this, and you can see here the river has been cutting through

21:38.540 --> 21:45.620
this rock over eons to make shapes like this dramatic and beautiful scenery, but also has

21:45.620 --> 21:50.500
a bizarre and complex path as it goes through the rock.

21:50.500 --> 21:56.540
Well, suppose I'm trying to do this, and let's say there's a border between two counties

21:56.540 --> 22:01.700
that is supposed to follow the river, and I'm trying to chart where exactly this boundary

22:01.700 --> 22:02.700
is.

22:02.700 --> 22:09.100
Well, I am doing this using surveying tools that require me to use straight lines.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.380
In a certain sense, intuitively, we can say, look, it's in the center of that river, so

22:12.380 --> 22:14.820
it does go like this.

22:14.820 --> 22:19.180
But hey, come on, I'm supposed to be surveying this, right, and reporting coordinates, and

22:19.180 --> 22:21.140
I can't do curves like that.

22:21.140 --> 22:26.380
I have these things, and I look through them, and I do sight lines, and I need to reduce

22:26.380 --> 22:28.140
this to straight lines somehow.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.140
So how do I do it?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.780
Well, here's the idea.

22:32.780 --> 22:37.260
It's too complex, really, to be captured by any finite set of straight lines.

22:37.260 --> 22:42.540
So what I'm doing is approximating, and I approximate it first in this way.

22:42.540 --> 22:45.420
I try this line, this line, this line.

22:45.420 --> 22:48.740
But then you come back and you look and you say, well, that's not quite right, I mean,

22:48.740 --> 22:49.740
come on, look.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.660
Over here, it's going over there.

22:51.660 --> 22:54.860
You're not really capturing the curve correctly.

22:54.860 --> 22:58.700
So we say there are inadequacies to that thesis.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.660
Let's try solving the problem.

23:00.660 --> 23:01.780
You've got this mistake here.

23:01.780 --> 23:02.780
Let's fix that.

23:02.780 --> 23:06.940
In fact, if we draw the thing differently in this way, start over here instead, and try

23:06.940 --> 23:09.020
to map this, then we get something different.

23:09.020 --> 23:14.220
So here, in a grossly oversimplified form, over on the left there, I've got the thesis.

23:14.220 --> 23:17.860
Okay, we try drawing that line, and we say, well, wait a minute.

23:17.860 --> 23:21.780
That's not capturing this little oxbow thing going on here.

23:21.780 --> 23:25.180
And this little peninsula there, that's being left out, and so on and so forth.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.180
We say, this isn't quite right.

23:27.180 --> 23:32.860
So we draw a different line through this, and that I've got marked as the antithesis.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.140
But then the same thing happens there.

23:34.140 --> 23:38.660
We look and we say, well, yeah, you reported this, but now we've gone in in our more detailed

23:38.660 --> 23:40.300
survey, and that's not quite right.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.620
I mean, that's not the center of the river here.

23:42.620 --> 23:46.520
It's cutting off all sorts of rock formations and so forth.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.860
So we synthesize them.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.320
We come up with something else.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.480
Now here I've drawn it as something halfway in between, roughly.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.080
But of course, that's not always the case.

23:54.080 --> 23:57.800
In fact, we might reconceptualize and say, you know, we need a totally different technique.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.840
This isn't going to do it at all.

23:59.840 --> 24:05.760
So the synthesis tries to combine the strengths of the thesis and antithesis, but sometimes

24:05.760 --> 24:09.720
there's a compromise between them, often is a transcendence of them.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.440
And Hegel's term for this, they are alfgahoban.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.960
They are transformed.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.520
They are transcended by the synthesis.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.680
So it's not just a compromise, it's not just a blending or a combination.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.880
We somehow replace them with this new way of thinking about things.

24:24.880 --> 24:29.280
And ideally, it really is a transformation of the way we're thinking, not merely some

24:29.280 --> 24:31.780
compromise or combination.

24:31.780 --> 24:33.980
So here's the general pattern.

24:33.980 --> 24:37.040
People adopt a certain way of looking at and thinking about things.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.820
That's the thesis, but it's only partially correct.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.400
The world's a complicated place.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.320
It's not going to be totally right.

24:44.320 --> 24:49.880
So it faces contrary evidence, faces counter examples, anomalies, contradiction, problems

24:49.880 --> 24:50.960
emerge.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.840
And then we say, well, all right, we tried going with that hypothesis, and we encountered

24:55.840 --> 24:56.960
all sorts of problems.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.840
For a while, people tried to solve the problems.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.280
And then they say, you know what, maybe we should have a new way of looking at things.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.120
And indeed, in science, this often happens.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.200
People are getting a theory, they're trying to develop the theory, they say, well, that's

25:09.200 --> 25:12.280
a problem case, this is a problem case, but we can solve it, we can solve this.

25:13.280 --> 25:19.120
And the theory becomes more and more complicated until finally somebody says, that's the wrong

25:19.120 --> 25:20.620
way to approach it.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.520
Why don't we start from this side instead?

25:23.520 --> 25:27.400
And so they come up with the antithesis.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.600
They shift to this new and contrary way of looking at things.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.800
But it's also only a partial truth.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.120
I mean, it's a new way of thinking about things, in a sense.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.640
It denies the starting point of the other one, so let's approach it from a different

25:39.640 --> 25:40.640
direction.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.480
But it too ends up facing contrary evidence, counter-examples, anomalies, contradictions.

25:45.480 --> 25:49.680
Again, the world's a complicated place, it doesn't get everything right.

25:49.680 --> 25:54.080
So eventually we realize we have to, in some way, combine the strengths of both and avoid

25:54.080 --> 25:56.000
the weaknesses of both.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.120
So we resolve the conflict between the thesis and the antithesis and transcend them in a

26:02.120 --> 26:04.360
new synthesis.

26:04.360 --> 26:10.000
It draws elements from both, it transforms how people think, how people see things, and

26:10.000 --> 26:11.960
it becomes a new thesis.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.600
But then the problem starts again.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.840
The process starts again.

26:14.840 --> 26:19.280
We begin thinking, oh yes, but now it is the new exciting idea, we go with it, and then

26:19.280 --> 26:25.000
it starts encountering anomalies, contradictions, counter-evidence, counter-examples.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.720
And now we say, well, what do we do about it?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.840
And the same thing happens.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.920
So thought keeps doing this.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.240
Hegel traces it through a number of things.

26:34.240 --> 26:39.920
You can see it happening in pre-Socratic philosophy, where we've got some people saying,

26:40.160 --> 26:43.760
there is one kind of thing at the foundation of the world, atoms.

26:43.760 --> 26:48.160
Somebody else, or sorry, one thing, water, that says Thales.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.920
Someone else says, no, there are different kinds of things, air, water, fire.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.560
And then somebody else says, no, there are many, many different kinds of things, all

26:55.560 --> 26:58.160
these atoms, okay?

26:58.160 --> 27:04.000
And someone else, you know, Heraclitus says, changes, constant, everything is just constantly

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
changing.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.120
And this is nothing ever changes.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.680
Then Plato and Aristotle say, well, things change, but they remain the same thing across

27:12.680 --> 27:13.800
change.

27:13.800 --> 27:18.000
They change their accidental properties, but they retain their essential properties, and

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
so forth.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.600
So these kinds of syntheses between opposing ideas keep happening.

27:23.600 --> 27:28.040
Well, Hegel says that's the general pattern of human thought.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.200
That just keeps happening.

27:30.200 --> 27:36.200
But notice that as it happens, you are trying to eliminate contrary evidence, counter examples.

27:36.200 --> 27:42.720
You're getting your straight lines to approximate that curve more and more closely.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.800
So there's a sense in which you hope you're getting closer to the absolute truth.

27:46.800 --> 27:52.240
And he's confident that in the long run, we keep getting better and better at thinking

27:52.240 --> 27:53.360
about things as we do this.

27:53.360 --> 27:59.720
We do confront the counter examples, the contrary evidence, the anomalies, the contradictions.

27:59.720 --> 28:04.320
And we do try to improve our ways of thinking that retains the explanatory power and the

28:04.320 --> 28:06.240
strength of our earlier theories.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.560
So in that way, our theories keep getting better and better.

28:09.560 --> 28:15.120
Who understood the physical world better, Aristotle in his physics, or contemporary

28:15.120 --> 28:16.120
physicist?

28:16.120 --> 28:21.880
Surely, we hope the contemporary physicist, because all sorts of anomalies over centuries

28:21.880 --> 28:27.800
have been taken care of or incorporated into the strength and power of that modern theory.

28:28.280 --> 28:32.480
Well, as we do this, we have to recognize that we're not doing this in a vacuum and

28:32.480 --> 28:34.640
we're not driven just by the world.

28:34.640 --> 28:39.360
We do this in a social and historical context.

28:39.360 --> 28:44.680
We frame our thinking and our theories in terms of language.

28:44.680 --> 28:51.000
Those linguistic units that we use, the words, the phrases, the ways in which we describe

28:51.000 --> 28:56.480
the world, are shaped by basic categories of thought and they reveal the basic categories

28:56.480 --> 28:58.100
of our thinking.

28:58.100 --> 29:04.880
But other people at our time, or slightly earlier, other people in our context, in our

29:04.880 --> 29:08.480
circumstances, in our society, are teaching us language.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.760
So I think about the world in a certain way because I speak a certain language.

29:12.760 --> 29:17.680
I've learned that language from other people in a certain historical context.

29:17.680 --> 29:23.880
I think about the world, well, I know other languages, but I am a native speaker of English.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.440
That shapes how I see the world.

29:26.440 --> 29:32.520
And I learned that English within a particular social setting, given a certain interpretation

29:32.520 --> 29:33.520
of it.

29:33.520 --> 29:39.680
So, what humor attributed to custom or habit or feeling, what caught another rationalist

29:39.680 --> 29:46.080
attribute to our priori concepts and laws of reason, Hegel says, I see that as coming

29:46.080 --> 29:51.680
out of the social context, out of a particular place and time.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.840
Our thinking is shaped socially.

29:54.840 --> 30:00.440
It is really in society that we live and move and have our being to steal a phrase from

30:00.440 --> 30:05.480
an ancient philosopher quoted famously by Paul in Acts 17.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.680
And so Hegel says, really, it is society playing that role.

30:09.680 --> 30:17.000
We learn our language and our ways of thinking in a given social and historical context.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.600
That shapes how we think everything.

30:20.600 --> 30:24.600
In particular, Hegel attacks the idea of a given.

30:24.600 --> 30:29.320
He attacks Kant's distinction between understanding and sensibility.

30:29.320 --> 30:36.440
He attacks the empiricist's understanding of thinking as depending on sensation, impressions

30:36.440 --> 30:38.240
and then ideas and so on.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.760
He says, actually, no.

30:40.760 --> 30:45.640
Our perceptions of the world are shaped by our concepts from the very start.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.560
He is against what he calls immediacy.

30:48.560 --> 30:53.200
This idea that there is anything we contact in the world immediately.

30:53.200 --> 30:59.040
He says, even in a basic perception, I might think that this looking at my hands is just

30:59.040 --> 31:00.760
a basic perception.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.320
He says, but I'm already thinking of them as hands.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.880
I'm already conceptualizing them.

31:05.880 --> 31:11.600
How I perceive the world and the concepts I use to frame that perception are all part

31:11.600 --> 31:13.200
of one big process.

31:13.200 --> 31:19.040
It is not that sensibility does its thing, then the understanding does its as Kant thinks.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.720
It's not the case that I have these impressions and then I form ideas.

31:23.720 --> 31:29.360
The ideas, the impressions, the sensations, the understanding, the conceptual resources,

31:29.360 --> 31:31.480
all of that is going on at the same time.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.360
There is no way to divide.

31:33.360 --> 31:40.120
Concepts from percepts, sensation from thinking about sensation, the concepts we use to understand

31:40.120 --> 31:44.560
sensations, our concepts shape the way we perceive the world and our perceptions are

31:44.560 --> 31:46.600
already thoroughly conceptual.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.640
If you don't give me the concepts, then I'm not going to perceive the world in the same

31:50.640 --> 31:51.640
way.

31:51.640 --> 31:55.440
I won't see things that really you might say, oh look, the information is there.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.120
Why aren't you seeing it?

31:57.120 --> 31:59.600
Because I don't have the concepts to process it.

31:59.600 --> 32:05.480
And so he says there just is no given preconceptual portion of experience that we could isolate

32:05.480 --> 32:11.200
and call sensibility or sensation or impressions or anything else like that.

32:11.200 --> 32:16.920
The whole division on which rationalism and empiricism rest, that whole thing has to be

32:16.920 --> 32:18.480
rejected.

32:18.480 --> 32:23.760
Well, whatever I've said about concepts and perception in the world in general, thinking

32:23.760 --> 32:26.520
in general also applies to norms.

32:26.520 --> 32:30.040
Norms of ethics but norms governing our behavior in all sorts of ways.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.480
We construct them.

32:31.480 --> 32:36.160
We construct them relative to a certain historical period and social context.

32:36.160 --> 32:41.920
Now they do express the world spirit, geist, in its current state of development.

32:41.920 --> 32:47.080
And so they are to be sneezed at, but on the other hand they are relative to our time and

32:47.080 --> 32:50.400
place in formulating principles of ethics.

32:50.400 --> 32:56.120
We are not formulating universal and necessary laws that stem from the laws of nature as

32:56.120 --> 33:01.720
in natural law theory or that stem from human nature and our responses to pleasure and pain

33:01.720 --> 33:06.440
or happiness or flourishing or thriving, nor is there anything like a categorical imperative

33:06.440 --> 33:09.880
that applies to all rational beings.

33:09.880 --> 33:15.120
These are things that we formulate as useful guides for human life at a given time and

33:15.120 --> 33:16.120
place.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.920
Nevertheless, he says, we're not doing that arbitrarily.

33:19.920 --> 33:26.040
We are doing it because of the successes and failures of earlier systems of norms.

33:26.040 --> 33:30.200
And so these too are going to progress toward the absolute.

33:30.200 --> 33:36.680
And in fact, what we think about these things now, he says, is the best we can do now at

33:36.680 --> 33:39.080
understanding what that absolute is.

33:39.080 --> 33:44.760
So as a rather shocking conclusion, he says, whatever is, is right.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.080
Whatever is, is rational.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.760
This is as far as rationality has taken us at this point.

33:49.760 --> 33:55.160
And the best we can do is adopt the norms that are the most rational given our circumstances.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.800
So there's a sense in which whatever the ethical norms of our time and place are, they're

33:59.800 --> 34:03.200
the right norms for us to have at that time and place.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.720
That's not to say it's all purely relative.

34:06.720 --> 34:10.160
Tomorrow we may look at ourselves today and think we were barbarians.

34:10.160 --> 34:14.560
Nevertheless, he says, look, it was the best we could do at the time.

34:14.560 --> 34:20.680
And so in general, we think that norms too are relative to a time, relative to a place.

34:20.680 --> 34:27.040
But nevertheless, have a kind of standing because they are putting us on the path and

34:27.040 --> 34:32.120
in fact our expressions of how far along we are on the path toward absolute knowledge

34:32.120 --> 34:32.800
of how to live.
