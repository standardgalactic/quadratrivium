00:00.000 --> 00:10.680
I want to talk today about Kant's categories.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.920
The categories in Aristotle are categories of being.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.640
They're senses in which a thing may be said to be.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.920
The same thing is true in the Vaisesha Kassutra.

00:20.920 --> 00:25.200
Kant proposes a system of categories, but it's a rather different system as we'll see,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.880
and it's doing something different.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.080
These are not categories of being.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.480
And these come out of logical functions of judgment.

00:32.480 --> 00:38.240
He's looking at logic, and there's something that is fascinating in a biographical sense

00:38.240 --> 00:42.280
when we look at this, because Kant, in his lectures on logic and in his little book on

00:42.280 --> 00:45.840
logic, says, logic is a remarkable discipline.

00:45.840 --> 00:51.040
It really hasn't changed for the past 2,000 years, and it seems to be a complete subject.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.560
Nothing will ever be added to it.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.960
Well, modern logic has added a lot to it, so he was writing that just a few decades

00:57.960 --> 01:02.120
before there would be a major transformation in logic.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.760
But nevertheless, when you look at the logical functions of judgment, he outlines, and look

01:06.760 --> 01:11.920
at the categories, you realize, well, there's all sorts of stuff there that we can now explain

01:11.920 --> 01:15.800
something of in logic, but that he couldn't have at all.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.640
So even in his own terms, he should have realized, wait, there's a lot more to do in this subject.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.880
My own logical functions of judgment include many, many concepts that aren't included

01:24.880 --> 01:27.000
in my own logic book.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.040
But that's just sort of a comic aside.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.960
What is Kant doing with these categories?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.520
We've talked about Kant as a rationalist.

01:36.520 --> 01:41.360
He was a student of Wolf, who was a student of Leibniz, and he agrees that there are

01:41.360 --> 01:45.320
innate ideas and that there is synthetic a priori knowledge.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.360
The innate ideas he refers to is the pure concepts of the understanding.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.440
Those are the categories.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.720
But there are also synthetic a priori truths.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.480
He calls them laws of the understanding.

01:57.480 --> 02:04.440
And so what I want to talk about today is that duo, basically, the categories, the pure

02:04.440 --> 02:06.120
concepts of the understanding.

02:06.120 --> 02:11.080
So we'll see what Kant thinks are the innate ideas, and also what he takes these synthetic

02:11.080 --> 02:14.520
a priori truths to be, the laws of the understanding.

02:14.520 --> 02:19.960
It is important to recognize that unlike other rationalists, Kant thinks these apply only

02:20.000 --> 02:22.360
within the realm of experience.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.680
Descartes and Leibniz thought they were true about the world, and so we're happy to apply

02:26.680 --> 02:31.520
them within experience and outside of experience, even to things we cannot experience.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.600
But Kant says, no, they're really part of the way in which our mind constructs experience.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.960
And so they apply only to the output of that process, not to whatever input might be present

02:43.960 --> 02:49.800
or to whatever might be in the world beyond the realm of our experience.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.240
He gives us, as we've seen, a transcendental argument.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.960
He says the a priori concepts and the laws of the understanding are necessary conditions

02:57.960 --> 03:00.560
for the possibility of experience.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.840
But we do have experience, so of course it's possible.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.320
So there must be a priori concepts.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.800
There must be laws of the understanding.

03:08.800 --> 03:14.720
So in short, for us to experience the world at all, we have to have some innate ideas,

03:14.720 --> 03:17.960
these a priori concepts of the understanding or the categories.

03:17.960 --> 03:24.080
We also have to have synthetic a priori knowledge through the laws of the understanding.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.600
But that raises the question.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.480
What are the necessary conditions for the possibility of experience?

03:29.480 --> 03:31.400
What in particular do I need?

03:31.400 --> 03:34.320
What are these pure concepts of the understanding?

03:34.320 --> 03:36.200
What concepts do I need, Kant?

03:36.200 --> 03:41.120
What principles must I assume as synthetic a priori principles in order to have experience

03:41.120 --> 03:43.080
be possible?

03:43.080 --> 03:46.840
Good questions, and he does answer them.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.840
Let's think about some experiences.

03:48.840 --> 03:54.680
I have visual experiences like this of the University of Texas Tower, or this of the

03:54.680 --> 04:09.480
White House, or a field of flowers, or a sunset, or my cat Belle, or a pizza, or another pizza.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.080
I'm fond of pizza.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.280
Well what makes all of these things possible?

04:14.280 --> 04:17.920
Yes, some of these are visual experiences, that's how you've seen them, but I can tell

04:17.920 --> 04:21.440
you with the pizzas, it wasn't just visual.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.120
There was a wonderful smell, a wonderful taste, and so forth.

04:24.120 --> 04:28.520
So we experience the world through our five senses in all sorts of ways.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.640
What makes that kind of experience possible?

04:31.640 --> 04:36.240
Well the first thing Kant says, turning to sensibility now, he draws a sharp line between

04:36.240 --> 04:38.680
sensibility and understanding.

04:38.680 --> 04:44.240
In short between perception and reason, whatever our minds do on the basis of our experience

04:45.040 --> 04:48.800
how we process and then draw inferences from our perceptions.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.920
But let's turn first to sensibility.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.960
Just for us to have those sensations, to be able to experience the White House, or sunsets,

04:55.960 --> 05:02.200
or pizza, well those things have to be represented in space and time.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.680
So space and time, he says, are a priori forms of sensibility.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.480
Vision obviously represents things as being in space.

05:11.520 --> 05:18.080
Vision does too, maybe less obviously, nevertheless, if you close your eyes and somebody around

05:18.080 --> 05:21.240
you is making noise, you can tell where the noise is coming from.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.320
Your auditory system does represent things as being in space and time.

05:26.320 --> 05:30.480
Now smell, taste, well not so much.

05:30.480 --> 05:35.440
But on the other hand, they still occur in time, you anticipate the taste of the pizza,

05:35.440 --> 05:39.160
you actually enjoy the taste, afterwards you remember the taste.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.720
And so that occurs in time.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.080
We perceive things as being in space and time.

05:45.080 --> 05:50.200
So here's something we can say, and we can say it a priori independently of experience.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.880
Perceptible objects exist in space and time.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.040
That is a synthetic a priori truth.

05:55.040 --> 06:00.840
It is based on the general form of sensibility, the form of sensibility as representing things

06:00.840 --> 06:03.920
in space and time.

06:03.920 --> 06:08.440
I've referred to the metaphor in another video of a projector.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.680
One sees the mind as something like a projector projecting an image on a screen.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.440
We can know something about what's going to be on the screen and what couldn't be on

06:16.440 --> 06:19.960
the screen on the basis of understanding the projector.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.920
So he thinks, here's one thing I can tell you about the projector, just due to the nature

06:23.920 --> 06:29.480
of our own faculty of sensibility and the way our mind processes whatever it receives,

06:29.480 --> 06:32.320
things are perceived in space and time.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.680
Things on that screen will have a spatial arrangement and they will occur in a temporal

06:36.680 --> 06:37.680
series.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.800
I can tell you that before anything appears on that screen.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.040
So that's something I can know that's synthetic.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.400
It's really about the things on the screen.

06:45.400 --> 06:50.720
It's not just something purely logical or verbal, like a screen is a screen, what appears

06:50.720 --> 06:51.720
will appear.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.840
I mean, it's not like that, right?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.600
It's something that gives you real information.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.840
It will be in space.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.320
It will be in time.

06:58.320 --> 07:02.200
And I can know that not because I actually perceive them in space and time, and I say,

07:02.200 --> 07:06.880
I'm figuring out, you know, I perceive things, I guess these things I perceive are in space

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
and time.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.880
Who knew?

07:08.880 --> 07:11.600
He'll say, no, I could really know that a priori.

07:11.600 --> 07:17.360
I know that just by knowing something about the way my mind processes information.

07:17.360 --> 07:21.320
Now the categories are the part that pertains to the understanding.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.640
Space and time are forms of sensibility.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.840
But there are also forms of understanding.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.680
Things my mind does with the information it receives from sensation.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.440
So sensibility gives the mind information.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.360
And then he says a complex synthesis takes place.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.800
A synthesis of the manifold of intuition is how he puts it.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.640
And we construct objects out of that in, broadly speaking, a three-stage process.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.640
I won't go through all the stages here.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.880
What I'm interested in today is this question of the categories.

07:49.880 --> 07:55.240
What pure concepts of the understanding are required in order for those stages of synthesis

07:55.240 --> 07:57.160
to take place?

07:57.160 --> 08:02.000
He says, well, we can find out by looking at the logical functions of judgment.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.480
The traditional rationalists had thought about universality and necessity.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.880
And indeed Kant says universality and necessity are absolutely fundamental for understanding

08:11.880 --> 08:17.720
why we need synthetic a priori truths and why we need pure concepts of the understanding.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.880
But if we want to know what those pure concepts are, they aren't just to universality and

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
necessity.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.480
It's more complicated than that.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.320
We look to the functions of judgment in logic.

08:28.320 --> 08:32.520
And we say what is going on in a logical judgment?

08:32.520 --> 08:35.360
Kant says there are basically four things going on.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.880
And so there are four families of categories.

08:38.880 --> 08:43.920
The first thing that goes on in a judgment is quantity.

08:43.920 --> 08:48.920
We talk about things like Socrates was a philosopher.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.040
We talk about sometimes groups of things.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.280
Some ancient Greeks were prominent philosophers.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.520
We talk sometimes about a totality.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.160
Those were the universality comes in.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.560
All forces applied to a mass accelerate that mass.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.160
And so those are basic categories.

09:08.160 --> 09:12.280
Things that today in logic would refer to as quantifiers or as determiners.

09:12.280 --> 09:21.640
So things like sum, all, several, every, any, these things function as indicators of quantity.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.160
They are part of the logical functions of judgment.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.600
And the same thing is true about objects.

09:26.600 --> 09:31.580
One, unity, plurality, telling the difference between one and more than one.

09:31.580 --> 09:40.720
As well as demonstrative things like this, that, in effect, this one, that one, the.

09:40.720 --> 09:45.360
All of those are things that fall under this general category of quality.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.680
So those are words that indicate these general categories.

09:48.680 --> 09:53.080
We have ways of talking about objects, of telling one from more than one, of talking

09:53.080 --> 09:58.040
about some things, several things, all, every, each thing, anything.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.800
All of those are categories.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.460
Those have to be built into the mind.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.600
Those aren't things we get from experience.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.120
You can say, well, I've learned about pigs by having encounters with pigs and, you know,

10:08.120 --> 10:10.080
working on a pig farm and so forth.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
How did you learn about this?

10:12.640 --> 10:13.640
Well, this what?

10:13.640 --> 10:15.960
No, I just mean the word this.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.760
How did you learn what each meant?

10:18.760 --> 10:21.280
How did you learn several?

10:21.280 --> 10:24.000
How did you learn to distinguish one thing from more than one thing?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.960
The person's going to be like, well, do you mean how I learned the meaning of the word?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.560
No, no, no, I don't mean that.

10:29.560 --> 10:34.400
I mean, how you ever got the concept of one as opposed to more than one.

10:34.400 --> 10:42.520
Well, can't point to an experience of that and constantly, yes, the mind came with that.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.960
Okay, that was part of the building structure of the mind.

10:44.960 --> 10:50.240
The mind is capable of combining things into objects, distinguishing one object from multiple

10:50.240 --> 10:56.640
objects is capable of actually then explaining something about these pluralities of objects

10:56.640 --> 11:00.920
and talking about one, some, several, and so forth.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.900
And so all of those come as built-in structures.

11:03.900 --> 11:08.240
We aren't gaining those logical meanings from experience.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.600
We aren't understanding those logical concepts from experience.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.960
The logical concepts are part of the structure of the mind.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.240
Here's a second thing that goes on in judgments.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.280
We judge quality.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.280
So we affirm things, we deny things, and we express some limitations.

11:24.280 --> 11:30.920
So Kant says, yes, we say Socrates is a philosopher or somebody can say, was Socrates the teacher

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
of Plato?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.240
Yes, that's true.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.740
Those things are actually affirming something.

11:36.740 --> 11:43.780
We can also say Socrates was not a plumber and that Socrates was not the teacher of Aristotle.

11:43.780 --> 11:48.900
We can say then the claim that Socrates lived after Aristotle is false.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.100
So we can also deny things.

11:51.100 --> 11:57.020
So our ideas of is and is not, true and false, yes and no.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.980
These are things that are, again, built into the mind.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.220
This, that.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.120
We don't learn those things through experience.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.220
We may learn the gesture.

12:04.220 --> 12:08.060
We may learn the words, but we don't learn the concepts from experience.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.340
The mind comes with those built in.

12:10.340 --> 12:13.980
And the same thing he says is true with limitation.

12:13.980 --> 12:19.860
Something like unhappy or ahistorical or inauthentic.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.140
You might think, well, those are just denials.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.740
But Kant thinks not really, okay?

12:24.740 --> 12:29.580
Say I talk to somebody, I say, well, how are you feeling today?

12:29.580 --> 12:30.580
You feeling happy?

12:30.580 --> 12:33.860
They say, well, I don't know.

12:33.860 --> 12:34.860
You're unhappy?

12:34.860 --> 12:36.980
Well, I don't know.

12:36.980 --> 12:37.980
Okay?

12:37.980 --> 12:42.060
There's sort of a, sometimes we'll say, well, I'm not unhappy, right?

12:42.060 --> 12:44.740
Is not unhappy the same as happy?

12:44.740 --> 12:45.740
Not really, okay?

12:45.740 --> 12:48.020
And that's what Kant's picking up on here.

12:48.020 --> 12:50.380
He's saying, yeah, is that authentic?

12:50.380 --> 12:54.220
Well, it's not inauthentic.

12:54.220 --> 12:57.700
That's not simply an affirmation that it is authentic.

12:57.700 --> 13:02.620
Or if I refer to that as ahistorical, does that just mean it is not historical?

13:02.620 --> 13:03.940
Well, maybe.

13:03.940 --> 13:08.260
But sometimes it really means, no, it goes contrary to the history.

13:08.260 --> 13:13.420
And so anyway, I can easily, in fact, you might say most of us spend many hours of our

13:13.420 --> 13:17.780
lives in states that are neither happy nor unhappy.

13:17.780 --> 13:22.180
And so all of those things are built into the mind at the outset.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.340
Well, another category is the category of relation.

13:26.340 --> 13:29.620
And there are all sorts of interesting and important relations, Kant says.

13:29.620 --> 13:32.620
Some of them involve inheritance and subsistence.

13:32.620 --> 13:37.380
You might remember this from the categories of the Vaisesika tradition as they developed

13:37.380 --> 13:41.180
beyond the original three in the Vaisesika Sutra.

13:41.180 --> 13:47.660
So we've got is, the is of predication, like this is a hand.

13:47.660 --> 13:55.700
We've got substance, quality, property, exemplifies, participates in, has, instantiates, for example,

13:55.700 --> 14:01.900
for instance, such as, all of those refer to concepts that we're not gaining from experience.

14:01.900 --> 14:06.820
The relation of this triangle to triangularity, we don't get that from experience.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.700
That's something the mind is built understanding.

14:09.700 --> 14:14.380
That is built into the structure of the mind, identifying things as objects, having the concept

14:14.380 --> 14:18.540
of substance, of those qualities hanging together in something.

14:18.540 --> 14:23.180
Notice these are just the things that empiricists, like Barkley and Hume said, I don't see how

14:23.180 --> 14:26.940
you can get any of this from experience.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.060
Kant says, of course you can't.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.020
They come built into the mind.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.680
They don't come from experience.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.140
But of course we have these concepts.

14:34.140 --> 14:38.140
Don't tell me we don't have the concept is that we don't have the concept of a substance

14:38.140 --> 14:45.140
or quality or a property or of this participating in triangularity or exhibiting triangularity

14:45.140 --> 14:50.140
or this being an example of this more general phenomenon, of course we have those concepts.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.380
So and it's not just some internal custom of the mind.

14:53.380 --> 14:56.860
It's something that the mind has built into it as its structure.

14:56.860 --> 15:00.380
Now actually, there is a sense in which Kant's saying, well, it is a custom of the mind.

15:00.380 --> 15:05.780
You're right about that Hume, but it's the structure of logic that is built into the

15:05.780 --> 15:06.780
mind.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.380
That's not some feeling or sentiment.

15:08.380 --> 15:09.780
It's not outside of reason.

15:09.780 --> 15:12.220
It is the very foundation of reason.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.220
The same thing is true with causality and dependence.

15:15.220 --> 15:23.020
If then relations cause, affect, because, depends, determines, grounds, all of those involve

15:23.020 --> 15:27.420
various aspects of this relation of causality or dependence.

15:27.420 --> 15:32.580
And then there are relations of community, of things being interdependent, reciprocity,

15:32.580 --> 15:39.660
if and only if and or unless, part, whole, with, tons of these things happen in language

15:39.660 --> 15:42.980
and they all refer to these relations of community.

15:42.980 --> 15:47.980
The mind is built in such a way that it understands things as sometimes interrelated in various

15:47.980 --> 15:48.980
ways.

15:48.980 --> 15:49.980
It doesn't have to learn that.

15:49.980 --> 15:53.900
Now it might have to learn a particular way in which things are interrelated, but the

15:53.900 --> 15:58.660
idea that things can be related to one another in this way, the mind doesn't have to learn

15:58.660 --> 15:59.660
that.

15:59.660 --> 16:03.780
It comes built in recognizing that.

16:03.780 --> 16:07.420
Then finally there are modal aspects of a judgment.

16:07.420 --> 16:12.660
So we can talk about possibility, necessity, existence, non-existence.

16:12.660 --> 16:16.180
He says there are three basic dichotomies here.

16:16.180 --> 16:20.940
Possibility and impossibility, so words like possible can, may, might, could, and the concepts

16:20.940 --> 16:22.900
they stand for.

16:22.900 --> 16:28.780
Consistence and non-existence, so is, exists, will, and so forth.

16:28.780 --> 16:36.060
Necessity and contingency, necessary, must, needs to, has to, would, all of those involve

16:36.060 --> 16:38.020
some kind of modality.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.560
And he says those are important.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.860
Those are built into the structure of the mind.

16:42.860 --> 16:43.860
Hume's right.

16:43.860 --> 16:45.580
We don't get necessity from experience.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.660
We don't get causation from experience.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.940
We don't get possibility from experience.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.300
But they're crucial parts of logic.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.580
They are part of the foundations of reason.

16:55.580 --> 16:59.260
So don't tell me we have no such concepts, or that they're outside the realm of reason,

16:59.260 --> 17:02.900
or that they're just emotions and feelings of expectation.

17:02.900 --> 17:03.900
Nonsense.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.140
They are part of the logical functions of judgment.

17:06.140 --> 17:09.500
They're built into logic, the very foundation of reason.

17:09.500 --> 17:15.420
Well, when we think about advances in logic since Kant's day, we can say maybe modern

17:15.420 --> 17:19.580
logicians should recognize as a variety of other categories, still within his basic

17:19.580 --> 17:21.460
families of categories.

17:21.460 --> 17:25.420
Under the heading of quantity, there are lots of other words and concepts that go along.

17:25.420 --> 17:31.340
In addition to the ones he mentioned, so many, few, most, more, less, finitely many, infinitely

17:31.340 --> 17:35.060
many, countably many, uncountably many.

17:35.060 --> 17:38.100
And then what I've marked here is a little null symbol.

17:38.100 --> 17:42.100
In other words, I mean whatever we say, what we mean when we talk about things in terms

17:42.100 --> 17:49.420
of bear plurals, tigers are striped for example, lions are tawny, cats meow, birds fly.

17:49.420 --> 17:54.300
Tigers going on there, presumably that's a kind of quantity or kind of something that

17:54.300 --> 17:56.060
is built into the mind.

17:56.060 --> 18:00.900
They're qualities, and not only the things he mentions, but also things involving temporal

18:00.900 --> 18:01.900
relations.

18:01.900 --> 18:07.100
They arise through sensibility, but we also have built in concepts for understanding things

18:07.100 --> 18:09.060
as arranged in time.

18:09.060 --> 18:14.700
So verb tenses, for example, or various indicators of aspects, like the difference between runs

18:14.700 --> 18:16.980
and is running and used to run.

18:16.980 --> 18:23.980
And then prepositions like before, after, since, until, now, then, all of those are temporal

18:23.980 --> 18:26.540
things that seem to be built into the mind.

18:26.540 --> 18:33.140
Similarly, there are other relations, like equality or similarity, like, near, far, closer

18:33.140 --> 18:35.460
than, between, belongs to.

18:35.460 --> 18:40.300
And then maybe other modalities, ones he doesn't directly talk about, but like may, should,

18:40.300 --> 18:44.660
not, things that again, human worries can't be derived from experience, and Kant would

18:44.660 --> 18:47.660
say, yeah, they're built into the nature of the mind.

18:47.660 --> 18:52.540
But also things like generally, typically, normally, maybe other things like knowing,

18:52.540 --> 18:58.820
believing, seeing, fearing, wanting, maybe all of those are built into the mind as well.

18:58.820 --> 19:03.780
Whatever we want to say exactly about the boundaries there, we should be able to say,

19:03.780 --> 19:10.260
okay, things like that are presumably maybe part of this idea of the pure concepts of

19:10.260 --> 19:11.780
the understanding as well.

19:11.780 --> 19:18.380
They relate to the pure concepts in the sense that they relate to logical functions of judgment.

19:18.380 --> 19:22.660
Well what kinds of principles of the understanding do we build out of these pure concepts of

19:22.660 --> 19:23.940
the understanding?

19:23.940 --> 19:26.260
Here are some examples Kant gives.

19:26.260 --> 19:30.740
Every object stands under the necessary conditions of the synthetic unity of the manifold of

19:30.740 --> 19:33.300
intuition in a possible experience.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.700
Let me translate from the Kantian language.

19:35.700 --> 19:40.100
He says, every object of experience, is in effect something that would be displayed

19:40.100 --> 19:42.020
on that screen we've talked about.

19:42.020 --> 19:47.660
I can know that all the objects have to conform to the conditions of being on that screen,

19:47.660 --> 19:49.980
so they all have to conform to space and time.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.620
They all have to conform to the logical functions of judgment.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.020
And so they have to be one or many.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.380
They have to either be related to one another or not.

19:59.380 --> 20:02.360
They have to be in a relation of dependence or not.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.600
They have to have some modal character.

20:04.600 --> 20:08.920
Either they are there now or they could be there, they were there, they will be there.

20:08.920 --> 20:12.200
We can say something about all those structures before they even appear.

20:12.200 --> 20:17.400
They are subject to the conditions of the synthesis of the unity of the manifold.

20:17.400 --> 20:21.600
In other words, the way in which projector forms objects and projects them onto the screen

20:21.600 --> 20:23.280
of experience.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.560
Secondly, in all change of appearances, substance is permanent.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.680
Its quantum in nature is neither increased nor diminished.

20:30.680 --> 20:34.880
A kind of law of conservation of substance, conservation of matter.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.280
Well after Einstein, we're inclined to think, I don't know about that, that would cut.

20:39.280 --> 20:43.280
But of course physics still maintains a law of the conservation of energy.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.000
And when you think about this one, you can say, well, cut is onto something interesting

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
here.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.760
What he's saying is that substance is that in which quality is in here.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.040
And so whatever you want to say about that, whatever it is the quality is in here, and

20:56.040 --> 20:59.560
maybe in modern physics we want to say, well it's not exactly substance, it's energy,

20:59.560 --> 21:02.240
or it's waves, or something.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.000
I mean whatever physical theory ends up saying about that.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Maybe it'll be a string in hyperspace, who knows.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.440
But whatever it is, we could say that remains the same.

21:12.440 --> 21:17.800
It's quality's change, but in the end we postulate that something is enduring across

21:17.800 --> 21:20.000
these changes of quality.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.600
So that idea that something endures across change, whether we call it substance or something

21:24.600 --> 21:28.440
else, he says is a basic feature of the mind.

21:28.800 --> 21:33.720
Third, all alterations, all changes take place in conformity with the law of the connection

21:33.720 --> 21:34.720
of cause and effect.

21:34.720 --> 21:39.200
In other words, things just don't happen randomly and spontaneously.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.440
Things cause other things.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.680
Things that happen are effects of other things.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.320
So cause and effect applies to the world.

21:46.320 --> 21:50.680
We can know that because we can know something about the projector, and knows that it projects

21:50.680 --> 21:53.680
things as causally related to one another.

21:53.680 --> 21:58.880
And finally, we know that it also projects them as interrelated with one another.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.840
All substances insofar as they can be perceived to coexist in space are in thorough-growing

22:03.840 --> 22:05.520
reciprocity.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.760
So we know that the projector is such that the objects of experience are represented

22:09.760 --> 22:14.520
as together there in space and time, as in some sense together there under the logical

22:14.520 --> 22:16.680
functions of judgment.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.920
So in effect he's saying, look, it's built into the mind that we're seeing things on

22:20.920 --> 22:26.400
one screen, that we're building one universe, one universal experience.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.840
It's not as if we're experiencing some multiverse.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.440
And different things are going on, and there are these different realms of objects that

22:33.440 --> 22:35.400
are simply completely unrelated.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.840
The mind is projecting things on all sorts of different screens at once.

22:38.840 --> 22:43.960
No, there is one screen of experience, he's saying, and everything is in some way on that

22:43.960 --> 22:50.480
screen related to the same logical functions, related to one another, on the same screen

22:50.480 --> 22:54.120
in the same spatiotemporal manifold.

22:54.120 --> 22:58.480
So out of that he says we do get some synthetic a priori judgments.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.120
Things like physical objects are in space and time.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.680
Mathematics, he thinks, follows from this.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.280
The world consists of objects having properties, standing in relation to one another.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.240
Substances persist through change.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.960
Every event has a cause.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.600
Everything relates in some way to everything else.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.440
Those he thinks we can know independently of experience.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.320
But they apply only to the phenomena.

23:20.320 --> 23:25.360
Only to the things as we perceive them, only to the objects of experience.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.320
The categories apply to those.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.440
The a priori principles apply to those.

23:29.440 --> 23:34.920
We can know them with universality and necessity because they fall under the pure concepts

23:34.920 --> 23:36.520
of the understanding.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.480
But the numinal, the things in themselves, the categories don't apply to them.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.040
The a priori principles don't apply to them.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.640
We don't know about them at all.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.800
So Kant says, think about our diagram over here.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.980
Think about this picture of the mind projecting the objects of experience.

23:54.980 --> 24:00.720
We can know things about those because in the projection the mind is representing them

24:00.720 --> 24:02.760
as being in space and time.

24:02.760 --> 24:08.040
The mind is representing them as being susceptible to the logical forms of judgment.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.960
And so the categories apply to them.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.240
We can say this is one triangle.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.860
We can talk about it as an object.

24:14.860 --> 24:20.060
We can do a variety of other things indicating what must be true of it.

24:20.060 --> 24:25.540
And all of that indicates that those principles, those a priori principles, the laws of the

24:25.540 --> 24:27.940
understanding apply here.

24:27.940 --> 24:34.260
But now if we move down to the realm of things in themselves, the realm he refers to as the

24:34.260 --> 24:44.460
numinal, the numinal realm, then we say, we can't say anything about those at all.

24:44.460 --> 24:49.100
They are outside of what is on that screen of experience.

24:49.100 --> 24:54.660
And so our concepts aren't applying to them, those pure concepts of the understanding.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.940
Those laws of the understanding don't apply to them.

24:56.940 --> 25:00.820
I can't say they have a certain character because the things projected on the screen

25:00.820 --> 25:01.820
do.

25:01.820 --> 25:03.620
I don't know what they're like.

25:03.620 --> 25:06.940
And so in the end he says, I can know things a priori.

25:06.940 --> 25:13.420
I can know things a priori about the objects of experience precisely because my mind is

25:13.420 --> 25:19.740
taking information, synthesizing it in a multi-stage process and producing these objects

25:19.740 --> 25:21.660
of experience.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.940
And so I can know something about what they're going to be like.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.460
I have no idea what the world beyond them is like.
