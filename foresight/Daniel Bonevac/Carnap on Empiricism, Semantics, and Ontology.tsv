0	3600	Well, today we're going to be talking about Karnab's paper,
3600	5700	empiricism, semantics, and ontology.
5700	10920	Some people consider this the last gasp of logical empiricism.
10920	15300	Even its opponents tend to treat it as an extremely important paper,
15300	20160	and there is a fundamental distinction that it introduces that has become part of,
20160	23600	you might say, common currency philosophically.
23600	29480	And so it's a useful thing to be exposed to and to think through,
29480	32480	even if in the end you think Karnab is wrong.
32480	34080	Now, there are a lot of people, on the other hand,
34080	37880	who think Karnab is actually getting at something deep and important here.
37880	41380	And there is a philosophical strategy that emerges in this paper
41380	47180	that I think is really important independently of the way that he in particular replies it.
47180	49080	One way of putting it is this.
49080	52980	Suppose we're interested in a certain concept or set of concepts,
52980	57380	and we're trying to analyze what that's all about philosophically.
57380	63280	Karnab's point, in a way, is just that we should approach it in the following fashion.
63280	67280	Think about language, which did not have that set of terms
67280	70380	or the ability to express those concepts.
70380	74980	And think what would have to be added to give that language the ability
74980	78580	to include those terms or express those concepts.
78580	82680	And so the way of thinking about it isn't exactly analysis
82680	86780	in the more traditional sense in which the early writers in this tradition,
86880	91980	like Bertrand Russell or G. E. Moore or even Wittgenstein,
91980	94380	were thinking instead it's something like,
94380	97980	think about what would be like not to speak a language,
97980	100480	in which we could talk about propositions, for example,
100480	102580	or in which we could talk about mental entities,
102580	105680	or in which we could discuss abstract entities
105680	110280	and think what resources would we have to add to that language to be able to do that.
110280	113980	So he's not approaching this from the point of view of X is a number,
113980	116880	if and only if we translate that into something else.
116880	121280	He's instead saying, imagine a language where we have no way of expressing numbers.
121280	126080	What would we have to add to the language in order to be able to express numbers?
126080	128780	Now you might say, well, numbers, okay?
128780	133780	And so you might think this has a very dumb sort of answer to it.
133780	137980	And so to make it interesting, you could say, well, what's the smallest set
137980	141180	or what are the smallest sets of resources we could add
141180	143580	that would actually allow us to accomplish this?
143580	148880	Also, another way of thinking about this is to say, well, yes, in some sense,
148880	151780	obviously, we could just add and talk about numbers.
151780	158080	But what we're interested in, in a sense, is what kind of move is made
158080	159680	when we make that transition?
159680	162580	If you make the jump to number, what exactly are you doing?
162580	166380	And sometimes it surprises how little has to be added.
166380	171980	So we've been discussing this idea of frameworks.
171980	177880	And this is the paper which really starts thinking about things in terms of frameworks,
177880	182580	a framework in which we can discuss propositions, for example, or mental states,
182580	187980	or numbers, or other abstract objects such as properties and relations.
187980	192080	And we think, what does it take to add such a framework?
192080	195280	Cardapp starts out with a pretty bold claim.
195280	197080	He says, here's what it takes.
197180	202680	It takes something that is a term that talks about the things of this general category.
202680	210880	So if we say, you know, yeah, actually, let me write down what I was saying just a moment ago.
210880	219880	Think about a language or a framework if you want to keep it more general,
219880	231580	in which we can't discuss x, whatever that is, and then ask the question,
231580	249780	what would we have to add to have that capacity to obtain the ability to discuss things of this kind?
250180	252080	And his answer is twofold.
252080	259980	He basically says, first of all, we would have to add some term that covers things of the relevant kind.
259980	268580	So a term like, for example, proposition, or property, or number, or whatever.
268580	271280	So just a term covering the general category.
271280	274480	Because after all, if we can't do this, presumably we can't actually.
274480	277780	We don't already have such a term and we're going to need one.
277780	279180	But then what else?
279180	281280	Well, this is the surprising part.
281280	290180	We just have to add variables for such things.
290180	296380	Or propositions for properties, for relations, for numbers, for mental states, or something like that.
296380	298680	And that's really all we have to do.
298680	302780	So it turns out that introducing a framework for discussing a kind of entity, he says,
302780	304580	is actually a pretty simple thing.
304580	308780	Okay, just introduce a term and some variables for that kind of thing.
308780	310880	Now let's start with something dumb.
310880	314480	We don't tend to talk about witches anymore.
314480	317680	But suppose we were to start doing that again.
317680	325380	And said, okay, what would it take to introduce into our current framework a framework where there are witches?
325380	331880	Or maybe if that's, since that used to be, maybe a better example would be something from the Harry Potter world.
331880	337280	Okay, where it's really just, what's something that's distinctive to Harry Potter?
338280	338780	Muggles?
338780	340280	Well, yeah, but you and I are muggles.
340280	342780	I mean, muggles is just sort of an ordinary person, right?
342780	344680	So that's easy to translate.
344680	348080	But, de-mentors, right?
348080	350480	Okay, there isn't just sort of this old view about de-mentors.
350480	353780	It's like that's specifically introduced by J.K. Rowling.
353780	362080	So, okay, we might be puzzled about how to actually do an analysis of de-mentor.
362080	367280	If we're thinking in terms of reducing that to something else, X is a de-mentor if and only if, what?
367280	369380	You might say, yeah, I don't know how to do it that way.
369380	375480	But what is it to introduce into a conceptual framework this concept, this ability to talk about de-mentors?
375480	381080	Well, you need the term de-mentor and variables that will include de-mentors.
381080	382980	The end, okay?
382980	384580	They might be, oh, wait a minute, that's all?
384580	385780	I mean, that's kind of trivial.
385780	392280	That's sort of, gosh, what do I need to talk about?
392280	395580	X, oh, the term X, right?
395580	398880	And some things that it could apply to, some variables that it could apply to.
398880	401380	But actually, the analysis is more interesting than that.
401380	408780	So let's see how it goes with respect to propositions, for example.
408780	412480	What does it take to introduce the framework of propositions?
412480	418180	Now, we get back up, and before we really get to this, think, what is a proposition supposed to be?
418180	423880	Philosophers have talked about propositions or something like that, ever since ancient times.
423880	426580	But now, what is a proposition exactly?
426580	431280	So suppose we started, we'll start in a traditional form.
431280	437080	We'll think, let's do an analysis of the kind of Russell, or Moore might have had in mind.
437080	444580	What is a proposition?
444580	449680	What's the relationship between a sentence and a proposition?
449680	452180	Something a sentence signifies.
452180	455280	Good, it's something a sentence signifies or expresses, right?
455280	464380	So one thing we can say is, okay, sentences express or signify propositions.
465380	474380	Okay, what else is true propositions as traditionally conceived?
474380	475380	They have a truth value.
475380	476880	They have a truth value, yeah.
476880	488880	So they bear truth values, and what else?
488880	500480	It's really a third thing that I think is part of the traditional conception.
500480	502680	Well, you can have attitudes with respect to them, right?
502680	505780	You can believe them, you can know them, you can doubt them.
505780	508180	You can wonder whether they're true.
508180	512080	You can, gosh, maybe you can fear them.
512080	517080	I fear that it will continue raining, and I didn't bring my umbrella.
517080	520580	Or you can have other kinds of attitudes, presumably, totally.
520580	527080	So they are objects of attitudes.
527080	532580	Now, you might think, look, there is nothing that actually has all three of those properties.
532580	535880	And so some people doubt that there are propositions.
535880	538780	Just because they think actually those are three different functions,
538780	544380	why should I be sure that any one person fulfills all those functions?
544380	548080	You might think, gosh, I would like to have somebody landscape my yard,
548080	553080	and fix my plumbing, and install some lights.
553080	557780	Okay, so I need a landscaper, plumber, or electrician, right?
557780	559980	I'm looking for somebody who fulfills all three of those.
559980	561780	And it might be that nobody does that.
561780	564880	You've got to have three different people doing those three different tasks.
564880	568480	So it's a nontrivial philosophical assumption underlying this,
568480	572180	that there is one kind of entity that does those three things.
572180	574080	But let's put that aside for a moment.
574080	578180	That's sort of how to think about this from a traditional point of view.
578180	581480	Now, from Karnab's point of view, how do we think about it?
581480	587280	Well, we think what is actually required to introduce this framework of propositions?
587280	590380	Imagine that we have a language where we don't discuss them at all.
590380	594080	Maybe we talk about sentences, maybe we just say things about the world.
594080	598480	And then we introduce this idea of propositions.
598480	602480	And so here's one way to introduce it, say, here's what a proposition is.
602480	607280	But another way would simply be to introduce this linguistic frame.
607280	611080	And so, what does he say about this?
611080	617680	Well, if we want to talk about propositions,
617680	625980	what we do is, let's see, where does it start?
625980	629880	Okay, we introduce the general term proposition.
629880	634280	So we need a term.
634280	641980	In this case, it is indeed just proposition.
641980	643480	And then what?
643480	647180	Well, we have to have a style of variables.
647180	657380	And so, we'll introduce something like, he is a proposition.
657380	664780	So we have a certain style of variable here, makes that possible.
664780	669380	But now, actually, there's one more thing.
669380	674780	He says, the general term proposition is introduced.
674780	676880	P is a proposition maybe defined.
676880	682080	So the third thing that we actually add is something like a definition.
682080	684680	But it's a definition of a surprising con.
684680	688880	It doesn't look very much like that sort of definition.
688880	692880	Instead, he says, we do it in the following way.
692880	697280	We say P is a proposition, maybe defined by P or not P.
697280	700380	And so here's how that ends up going.
700380	708280	P is a proposition, it's just defined as P or not P.
708280	714480	And that enables us to introduce the framework of propositions.
714480	716080	Now, there's something important about this.
716080	722480	Because what happens here is we get something, he says, that notice is analytic.
722480	726180	It's analytic whether P or not P.
726180	729480	Chicago is large or Chicago is not large?
729480	732680	Yeah, that seems like a logical truth.
732680	735480	So that Chicago is large is a proposition.
735480	736780	We have to cheat there a little bit.
736780	742880	Notice I have to introduce the word that and say that Chicago is large is a proposition.
742880	746380	But I substitute other things for P that are inappropriate for the variable and
746380	749780	hope we're count like Fred or not Fred.
749780	752480	That doesn't make any sense.
752480	757280	Molecule or not molecule, that doesn't make any sense.
757280	760280	Between or not between, that doesn't make any sense.
760280	762180	So I have to have the right kind of thing going in here.
762180	764780	It has to be a sentence, for example.
764780	768880	But his point is this, if I've got sentences in my language,
768880	772480	then it actually doesn't take much to introduce talk of propositions.
772480	778580	All I have to do is have a term proposition, some variables that can range over propositions
778580	783080	and then introduce a way of making sense of that.
783080	787480	So with the dementor example, I would introduce the term dementor,
787480	790980	have a variable for that, let's say D is a dementor.
790980	794780	But then I do have to actually give some kind of characterization of it.
794780	798580	But notice in this case, it's not this kind of definition.
798580	802180	It's something that has a sort of surprising feature.
802180	807580	What happens is that I take something that wasn't functioning as a singular term,
807580	809180	I turn it into one.
809180	814580	So here, the thought is supposed to be a little bit different.
814580	818380	I am actually taking predicates that I can make sense of,
818380	823180	and then using those to characterize what a proposition is.
823180	827680	Here, I'm actually just taking something of a different grammatical category
827680	830980	and allowing it to play a new role.
830980	834880	So Chicago is large, or Chicago is not large.
834880	838980	But then, well, in English, we signify that by putting it over that.
838980	841380	That Chicago is large is a proposition.
841380	844880	I've taken something that was functioning just as a sentence,
844880	848580	and I've turned it into something that can function as a singular term,
848580	853680	referring to an object, in this case a proposition.
853680	859680	Okay, so if that's the general strategy, then what kind of thing can we do with other sorts of terms?
859680	866680	So let's think about properties.
866680	869280	Are there such things as properties in the world?
869280	871080	Think about this in a big platonic sense.
871080	873180	Are there such things as forms?
873180	880180	Plato says, you and I are really just shadows of the form of personhood.
880180	890180	And these desks are really just shadows of the form of deskhood.
890180	891880	Well, that feels really dense.
891880	897680	But some of these things, you sort of think, okay, that's sort of the overall picture.
897680	901180	Now, whether you think that shadow business works or not, you could think,
901180	909480	well, look, we do talk about properties such as, well, being a desk or being a personhood.
909480	915180	There's a big debate about personhood and what that is and what it covers in ethics, for example.
915180	917880	But we can talk about properties in all sorts of other ways.
917880	921880	We can worry about triangularity or justice.
921880	928780	And so those are things that seem to be, well, talk about properties of various kinds.
928780	932780	Now, what does it take to introduce talk of properties?
932780	935780	Well, from this point of view, it's not so surprising.
935780	939180	First of all, we introduce the general term property.
939180	943180	So we have a way of talking about these things.
943180	945680	Secondly, we introduce a new style of variable.
945680	953380	So let's let that be, I don't know, maybe capital P to be a style of variable that we'll use for properties.
953380	957680	And then we have to say something about what a property is.
957680	966580	So we define P is a property to be the same as, now what?
966580	972580	The whole point of this strategy is not then to give a sort of definition in the standard way,
972580	979580	but instead to take P and use it in a different grammatical role where it's not a singular term.
979580	982080	So how could we do that?
993080	995580	P is a set.
995580	997080	Well, we could do it that way.
997080	1002080	We could think, ah, let's represent P as a set of objects that have the property, for example.
1002080	1006080	And that's a very Vercelian or even Freyian way of thinking about this.
1006080	1009080	But actually, Carnap has in mind something different,
1009080	1013580	because that's a way of taking an object that we've already constructed and identifying with this.
1013580	1015580	And notice what Carnap did here.
1015580	1019580	He didn't construct an object and say that object is a proposition.
1019580	1023080	He just said P is a proposition if and only if P or not P.
1023080	1025080	He didn't build up an object.
1025080	1030080	Instead, now, later, by the way, people think of propositions in different ways,
1030080	1032080	for example, as sets of possible worlds.
1032080	1036580	So they're using your strategy of building up an object and saying let's call that a proposition.
1036580	1038080	That's not what he's doing.
1038080	1045080	He's really just taking something and allowing you to use things as singular terms without building an object.
1045080	1049080	And so you might say there's this traditional strategy of construction
1049080	1053080	that he was concerned with early in the logical structure of the world
1053080	1055080	that Russell was pursuing a logical atomism.
1055080	1057580	Notice this is not constructed.
1057580	1060080	He's not actually constructing an object and saying,
1060080	1065080	aha, now we have something that can play the role of a proposition or a property or something like that.
1065080	1072080	Instead, he's just sort of, well, pulling what feels like a logical trick.
1072080	1077080	Allowing you to use something as a singular term but wasn't used as a singular term.
1078080	1082080	So one way to do this would be to construct a set, something of that sort,
1082080	1085080	but his strategy in this paper is different.
1085080	1088080	The earlier Carnap would have done just what you're saying.
1088080	1092080	But Carnap at this stage says, actually, there's a different way of doing it.
1092080	1096080	Now, think about a property like justice.
1096080	1097080	Okay?
1097080	1100080	Justice is a property if and only if.
1100080	1104080	And now, what do we want to, what do we have in our language already
1104080	1106080	that isn't an abstract term like justice?
1106080	1112080	But nevertheless, it might apply to individual objects or individual events, influences or actions.
1115080	1120080	You could say, he's a property if an object has or doesn't have it.
1120080	1122080	Yeah, it has or doesn't have it.
1122080	1124080	But that's already to use it as a singular term.
1124080	1129080	So to say that an action has justice, for example.
1129080	1131080	What's a simpler way of saying that?
1131080	1132080	An act is just.
1132080	1134080	It's just, exactly.
1134080	1138080	So, if px or not px.
1142080	1143080	Okay?
1143080	1145080	So justice is a property if and only if.
1145080	1149080	Well, for any x, x is just or x is not just.
1149080	1152080	Triadularity is a property if and only if.
1152080	1156080	Well, x is triadular or x is not triadular.
1156080	1157080	Notice what happens here.
1157080	1162080	There we had that sort of acting as the thing in English
1162080	1164080	that signals a singular term.
1164080	1166080	Here what happens?
1166080	1168080	Well, we have something that signals this.
1168080	1178080	It's like turning triangle into triadularity or just into justice or kind into kindness, et cetera, et cetera.
1178080	1183080	There are all these ways of putting on a suffix that turns something into an abstract term.
1183080	1188080	And that's an indication that we've done this and we're now using this as a singular term.
1188080	1192080	But he says, don't think that singular term has to refer to something.
1192080	1197080	Instead, just think, well, we're building it up from a predicate.
1197080	1201080	And we're doing it by adding this and allowing it to play the role of a singular term.
1201080	1207080	But nothing philosophically huge is going on there.
1207080	1209080	Now, there are two ways of taking this.
1209080	1217080	One way of taking Carnap's general strategy here is to say he's a nominalist and he's giving you the key to nominalism.
1217080	1225080	He's saying you can talk about justice or triangularity or propositions without committing yourself to abstract objects.
1225080	1228080	You can think everything in the world is just a particular thing.
1228080	1230080	That is triangular is not triangular.
1230080	1232080	That is just or is not just.
1232080	1236080	That is true or not true or something like that.
1236080	1241080	And then add this abstract language without really any ontological commitments.
1241080	1244080	And a lot of people have interpreted Carnap that way.
1244080	1253080	But actually, Carnap himself seems to say, what I'm doing is showing that this question of nominalism is actually not a very interesting question.
1253080	1259080	So he doesn't see himself, I think, as pursuing a strategy of nominalism here.
1259080	1266080	But instead of saying the whole traditional debate about realism, conceptualism, nominalism, and so on,
1266080	1269080	is based on the idea that there's a real metaphysical question here.
1269080	1271080	And there isn't.
1271080	1272080	Why?
1272080	1273080	What are we doing?
1273080	1275080	We're introducing a framework like this.
1275080	1279080	And now we can distinguish two kinds of questions.
1279080	1286080	There are internal questions, questions that are internal to a framework.
1286080	1297080	Like, let's say within the framework of propositions, we ask, are there propositions?
1297080	1303080	Well, within this framework, what's the answer to that question?
1303080	1304080	Sure.
1304080	1305080	Right?
1305080	1306080	Are there propositions?
1306080	1311080	Well, all that means is, yeah, is there a P such that P is a proposition?
1311080	1314080	So is there a P such that P are not P?
1314080	1319080	Is there a sentence such that it's true or not true?
1319080	1321080	Yeah, sure.
1321080	1329080	And so the answer is always a sort of trivial yes or no.
1329080	1333080	I mean, if the framework is not one that includes that.
1333080	1334080	Maybe.
1334080	1337080	But normally it's just a trivial yes.
1337080	1338080	Of course.
1338080	1342080	If you ask the person teaching you, let's say you're in first grade,
1342080	1345080	the teacher is teaching you some basic arithmetic.
1345080	1347080	You're counting, right?
1347080	1351080	One, two, three, four.
1351080	1356080	And then you can complicate things like one plus one is two.
1356080	1360080	And you say, I have a question, Ms. Walters.
1360080	1363080	Are there really numbers?
1363080	1368080	What's Ms. Walters going to say?
1368080	1369080	Sure.
1369080	1370080	Sure.
1370080	1372080	Yeah, like one is a number, right?
1372080	1373080	Two is a number.
1373080	1376080	So sure there are numbers like one, two, three.
1376080	1380080	And it's a kind of trivial question, right?
1380080	1384080	If you say, are there even numbers that are greater than 100?
1384080	1388080	She's going to say sure, like 102, 104, et cetera, right?
1388080	1390080	If you say, are there any numbers at all?
1390080	1391080	Sure.
1391080	1392080	One, two, three.
1392080	1393080	It's a trivial question.
1393080	1394080	Are there any propositions?
1394080	1395080	Sure.
1395080	1396080	The one plus one is two.
1396080	1398080	The Chicago is large, right?
1398080	1401080	I'm now speaking to you.
1401080	1403080	And so within the framework, this is very simple.
1403080	1404080	Are there propositions?
1404080	1405080	Well, sure.
1405080	1409080	Similarly, are there properties within the framework of properties?
1409080	1413080	Sure.
1413080	1414080	Yes.
1414080	1419080	And notice that in this case, it's just the analytic pieces that that's true.
1419080	1421080	It's just the analytic that there are properties.
1421080	1423080	It is analytic that there are propositions.
1423080	1424080	Why?
1424080	1425080	Because it's analytic that p or not p.
1425080	1428080	It's analytic that px or not px.
1428080	1433080	And so within the framework, these are utterly trivial questions.
1433080	1436080	But now suppose we're not in the framework.
1436080	1440080	Suppose we say, yeah, but look, I'm not asking that kind of question.
1440080	1441080	Right?
1441080	1442080	Ms. Walters says, of course there are numbers.
1442080	1443080	One, two, three.
1443080	1445080	And you say, no, no, no.
1445080	1448080	I'm asking a deeper question.
1448080	1450080	Numbers are abstract objects.
1450080	1452080	I want to know if there are abstract objects.
1452080	1459080	Ms. Walters, what's your position on the realist, conceptualist, novelist debate?
1459080	1464080	And then I think Ms. Walters sends you to the principal.
1464080	1471080	But it could be that she said, well, you're, oh, you want to ask a deeper question.
1471080	1473080	Well, there is a deeper question here.
1473080	1474080	Right?
1474080	1476080	And that is the external question.
1476080	1479080	But it's not really the metaphysical question either.
1479080	1485080	The external question is just should be.
1485080	1488080	Adopt that framework.
1488080	1494080	The framework of propositions, the framework of properties, the framework of work of numbers.
1494080	1498080	And so from that point of view, the right way to answer this deeper question the first
1498080	1505080	framework has is to say, well, sure, there's numbers like one, two, three, and four.
1505080	1510080	And if you're asking why we should do arithmetic at all, why we should accept any of that,
1510080	1514080	the question is because arithmetic is really useful.
1514080	1523080	It's important that we actually be able to count things, that we be able to add numbers together
1523080	1525080	and do other kinds of things.
1525080	1530080	And in short, what Ms. Walters has to do is defend the utility of arithmetic.
1530080	1533080	But notice that when she's doing that, she's not giving some metaphysical argument.
1533080	1538080	She's just saying, look, pragmatically, it's really useful to introduce this framework of numbers
1538080	1540080	and talk about numbers.
1540080	1544080	So this sort of question ends up being analytic and trivial.
1544080	1548080	This sort of question is just pragmatic.
1548080	1552080	It's just a matter of thinking, well, is it worth adopting that framework?
1552080	1554080	It has advantages.
1554080	1556080	It has some disadvantages.
1556080	1557080	Right?
1557080	1561080	As the first grader is learning arithmetic, you may be painfully aware of the disadvantages
1561080	1563080	of introducing this framework.
1563080	1568080	You have to learn all this stuff and count stuff and learn the rules of addition and multiplication
1568080	1570080	and back, back, back, back, back.
1570080	1571080	Right?
1571080	1576080	And so there can be all sorts of pragmatic arguments forward against us to reframe them.
1576080	1579080	For example, introducing this framework of propositions.
1579080	1584080	What are some advantages of introducing this framework of propositions?
1584080	1586080	The external question here isn't the simple one.
1586080	1587080	Are there propositions?
1587080	1588080	Oh, of course.
1588080	1589080	Chicago is large or not large.
1589080	1591080	So Chicago is large is the proposition.
1591080	1596080	It's instead to say, what's the value of introducing that talk of propositions?
1596080	1600080	And now we can think about positive and negative consequences.
1600080	1605080	So what are some positive things that happen if we introduce this framework of propositions?
1605080	1609080	Why do people talk about propositions and not just talk about sentences?
1609080	1611080	After all, that's Chicago is large.
1611080	1614080	It's different from just, quote, Chicago is large.
1614080	1621080	What's the advantage of moving from that to talk of propositions?
1621080	1623080	Convenience in language.
1623080	1625080	It's just easier.
1625080	1626080	Okay, it is easier.
1626080	1627080	Now, why is it easier?
1627080	1632080	Why does it let us do easily that otherwise would become hard to do?
1632080	1635080	Evaluate the truth of something.
1635080	1636080	Evaluate the truth.
1636080	1637080	Well, let's see.
1637080	1639080	I say Chicago is large.
1639080	1641080	And you think, I don't know how to think about that.
1641080	1644080	But if I think, is it true that Chicago is large?
1644080	1645080	Oh, no, I see.
1645080	1650080	And how do you know you're actually talking about what we connotate Chicago as currently?
1650080	1654080	Or you know it's not really meant to denote something else?
1654080	1657080	Well, there, yeah.
1657080	1658080	Okay, good.
1658080	1659080	That's an interesting point.
1659080	1664080	Because when I talk about the sentence Chicago is large, I'm just talking about a set of
1664080	1665080	marks, right?
1665080	1671080	Or maybe a type of mark or a type of, I mean, it's actually kind of complicated to figure
1671080	1674080	it out because it can be written down, it can be spoken, et cetera.
1674080	1678080	But it's a syntactic object of some kind, or maybe a phonological object of some kind
1678080	1680080	or some combination of those.
1680080	1684080	But as soon as I say that Chicago is large, you do get the sense that now I'm talking
1684080	1687080	about this as interpreted, right?
1687080	1692080	And now the referent of Chicago seems relevant and the referent of large.
1692080	1693080	So you're right.
1693080	1694080	Both of those are actually vague.
1694080	1696080	Chicago, do you mean the city boundaries?
1696080	1699080	Or do you mean the metropolitan area?
1699080	1700080	Do you mean in population?
1700080	1703080	Do you mean in geographical area?
1703080	1706080	What Chicago denotes there may seem vague.
1706080	1709080	But also large, they can seem vague.
1709080	1714080	It's actually not only between geographically large and large in population, but there's
1714080	1716080	a lot of vagueness to large, right?
1716080	1718080	Is Austin a large city?
1718080	1719080	I don't know.
1719080	1721080	It's kind of large.
1721080	1723080	Actually, this was a better example 20 years ago.
1723080	1724080	Then it was kind of large.
1724080	1726080	Now it sort of just is large.
1726080	1727080	It's used in a large city.
1727080	1728080	It's used well.
1728080	1729080	It's used in a large city.
1729080	1732080	There I think you can just say, yeah, sure.
1732080	1737080	But what are some cities that might be on the borderline of this?
1737080	1742080	Where you say it's that large and you say, oh, I don't know.
1742080	1747080	Kind of sort of Perth.
1747080	1749080	Perth Australian?
1749080	1751080	Perth, maybe.
1751080	1752080	I don't.
1752080	1753080	Good.
1753080	1756080	Take a obscure city that I don't know about.
1756080	1758080	Sorry for those Australian viewers.
1758080	1760080	But yeah, I don't know much about Perth Australia.
1760080	1761080	You might be right.
1761080	1762080	It's a small city.
1762080	1763080	Yeah.
1763080	1766080	I mean, there are some cities where very clearly we say no.
1766080	1768080	It's not large, right?
1768080	1770080	I say, oh gosh, what's?
1770080	1772080	Salt Flat, Texas.
1772080	1774080	Population 10 is a large city.
1774080	1776080	No, it is really not.
1776080	1777080	It's not a city then.
1777080	1779080	It's not really a city at all.
1779080	1780080	That's true.
1780080	1782080	City is vague in addition to this vagueness of large.
1782080	1784080	So what counts as a city?
1784080	1791080	You might think, yeah, in fact, in that sense, what is a city but a large population center?
1791080	1795080	And so you might, somebody might say it's just analytic that cities are large.
1795080	1797080	Because otherwise, we wouldn't call them cities.
1797080	1803080	But presumably, there can be small cities like Akron, Ohio, maybe, or maybe like Perth,
1803080	1809080	Australia, or gosh, Sioux City, Iowa, or something like that.
1809080	1811080	Where you say, look, it's a city.
1811080	1812080	It's called Sioux City.
1812080	1814080	So it's got to be a city.
1814080	1816080	But it's a small city.
1816080	1817080	Yeah.
1817080	1820080	Large probably means like large if it's tight, right?
1820080	1821080	And you say, good.
1821080	1823080	It does mean large for a city, right?
1823080	1827080	So yeah, city is sort of already large for a population center.
1827080	1829080	But then a large city is large for a city.
1829080	1832080	So it's large for a large population center.
1832080	1833080	Yeah, exactly.
1833080	1835080	So there are really two senses of large there.
1835080	1839080	Now, notice that if we're just talking about the sentence, Chicago is large.
1839080	1841080	We don't necessarily have to get into this.
1841080	1844080	But the moment we talk about propositions, you might think all of this becomes relevant.
1844080	1846080	What proposition are you expressing?
1846080	1848080	You say Chicago is large.
1848080	1851080	And now we can say, what do you mean?
1851080	1855080	If I just say, ah, consider the sentence, single quote, Chicago is large.
1855080	1857080	You could think, OK, that's clear.
1857080	1858080	I know what you're saying.
1858080	1859080	Right?
1859080	1863080	To say what that expresses, that's where all this vagueness and ambiguity, et cetera, come in.
1863080	1870080	So one thing we could think happens here is we've now got something that has real semantic input.
1870080	1873080	Now, the sentence has a semantics, too.
1873080	1874080	We could interpret it.
1874080	1880080	You might think an act of interpretation has already gone on when we moved to the proposition.
1880080	1886080	Now, something like Chicago is large shows us this because there are these levels of ambiguity introduced.
1886080	1893080	Another classic case of this, which shows utility, is something that involves a pronoun.
1893080	1897080	I say, I wonder whether it's raining.
1897080	1900080	And you think, Dan wonders whether it's raining.
1900080	1904080	And there's a sense in which we're both expressing the same proposition.
1904080	1906080	Those are two different sentences.
1906080	1908080	I've said, I wonder whether it's raining.
1908080	1913080	You've said, he wonders whether it's raining, or Dan wonders whether it's raining.
1913080	1918080	And yet we want to say all of those express the same proposition.
1918080	1925080	Now, what are some other advantages besides getting away from the difficulty of the I, in that sense?
1925080	1930080	By the way, some people have argued that the traditional concept of omniscience attributed to God is incoherent,
1930080	1937080	because I can know that I am wondering whether it's raining, but God can't know that I am wondering.
1937080	1942080	God knows that Pan-Bonevac is wondering, let's say, if God knows everything.
1942080	1947080	But God can't know it in this day-say, personal way that I do.
1947080	1950080	Now, yeah, I think this is a laughable objection.
1950080	1956080	But one way of arguing that it's a laughable objection is to say, well, to say that God is omniscient
1956080	1958080	means God knows all the propositions.
1958080	1963080	It doesn't mean God knows I am hungry when I am hungry, I consider.
1963080	1965080	So, yeah, it seems so.
1965080	1971080	But introducing the term proposition can be a way of seeing why that's a silly objection.
1971080	1975080	By the way, people have actually talked about this at the American Philosophical Association meetings,
1975080	1981080	which is why, if you ever think, whoa, I bet that is a forum for deep and wise thinking.
1981080	1984080	It's not always true.
1984080	1987080	In fact, most of the time not true.
1987080	1991080	Now, so it gives us that advantage.
1991080	1993080	What are some other advantages?
1993080	1998080	It allows us to abstract away, in other words, from indexicals and illustratives like this and that
1998080	2001080	and other things that introduce a kind of context dependence.
2001080	2005080	And so it allows us to talk about what's being said or what's being thought
2005080	2011080	without being tied to a specific context, and that can be really useful.
2011080	2016080	Are there other things that are like that, taking it out of a context?
2016080	2019080	Suppose we speak different languages.
2019080	2024080	And so I say, that is red.
2024080	2028080	And a German speaker says, das ist gut.
2028080	2030080	We're expressing the same proposition, right?
2030080	2035080	And yet using two very different sentences in different languages to express the same proposition.
2035080	2038080	You might say, gosh, we're thinking the same thing, we're saying the same thing,
2038080	2041080	even though we're speaking different languages.
2041080	2047080	Can you see other advantages of talking about propositions?
2047080	2051080	Actually, that's a big one when you think about objects of attitudes.
2051080	2057080	Because suppose the German speaker has that belief that would be expressed by that sentence.
2057080	2059080	And I have the belief expressed by the sentence in English.
2059080	2062080	Are we believing the same thing or different things?
2062080	2067080	If we're talking about propositions as objects of belief, we can say we're believing the same thing.
2067080	2070080	And we can easily express that using this language of propositions.
2070080	2072080	In sentences, what would we have to do?
2072080	2077080	We'd have to say, well, the German speaker has a relation to that sentence.
2077080	2080080	And I have a relation to this sentence.
2080080	2085080	And then those sentences are inter-translatable or mean the same thing or something.
2085080	2091080	So maybe we could say that, but it's a lot more complicated to say.
2091080	2101080	Are there other advantages to introducing an abstract term like proposition?
2101080	2104080	Well, let's turn it around and ask the other question.
2104080	2106080	Are there disadvantages?
2106080	2111080	What would be an argument pragmatic against introducing talk of propositions
2111080	2115080	or properties or other abstractions like this?
2115080	2120080	I mean, it kind of just sets sentences into either being true or false.
2120080	2125080	So I feel like that kind of takes away from what a sentence could actually mean.
2125080	2133080	Oh, well, all right, yes, it does abstract away from the details of the individual sentence.
2133080	2139080	And at times that can be an advantage, but at times you might be losing information that matters.
2139080	2145080	For example, I ask whether John believes that the morning star is the evening star.
2145080	2150080	And you happen to know that those actually refer to the same object.
2150080	2155080	Now, is that proposition the same as the morning star is the morning star?
2155080	2158080	Ask John, is the morning star the morning star?
2158080	2160080	Sure.
2160080	2162080	Is the morning star the evening star?
2162080	2164080	Ooh, I don't know.
2164080	2170080	And so now we might say, in this case, it matters what sentence is being used.
2170080	2174080	But depending on our view of propositions, we couldn't upsay it,
2174080	2177080	but those things express the same proposition.
2177080	2181080	So it would be a mistake to move away from the sentences in that case
2181080	2183080	and move to talk about propositions.
2183080	2188080	Now here, are we committed about the identity conditions of propositions?
2188080	2191080	When is P the same proposition as Q?
2191080	2194080	Notice this doesn't really say anything about that.
2194080	2197080	We don't really have identity conditions here.
2197080	2201080	After all, P or not P is equivalent to Q or not Q
2201080	2204080	in the sense that they're both just logical truths.
2204080	2207080	So we can't very easily introduce identity conditions here
2207080	2210080	and get a good answer to the question of whether the morning star is the morning star
2210080	2215080	and the morning star is the evening star expressed the same proposition as propositions.
2215080	2217080	Now, in a way, that's good.
2217080	2219080	We are committed to a bad consequence here.
2219080	2223080	But from another point of view, you might say there's something that's really ill-defined here.
2223080	2226080	And the same truth of this is triangularity.
2226080	2231080	The same property is tri-laterality, having three angles, having three sides.
2231080	2234080	Are they the same property or different properties?
2234080	2237080	Well, things have three angles or not.
2237080	2239080	Things have three sides or not.
2239080	2243080	We don't really get an answer to that question, right?
2243080	2246080	There are different P's that go in there.
2246080	2250080	So I suppose you could say that's an argument that there are different properties.
2250080	2254080	Just as here, the morning star is the morning star and the morning star is the evening star
2254080	2257080	are different sentences, so maybe that's an argument that there are different properties.
2257080	2261080	But we've got to be careful because we want, I'm hungry and Dan is hungry,
2261080	2267080	or I'm wondering whether it's raining and Dan's wondering whether it's actually expressed the same proposition.
2267080	2272080	So this, in a sense, doesn't commit us with respect to identity conditions.
2272080	2276080	And that can be dissatisfied.
2276080	2282080	I mean, quite at one point, introduces the slogan, no entity without identity.
2282080	2284080	And we don't have identity conditions here.
2284080	2286080	So Kwan will be unhappy.
2286080	2290080	He'll say, I don't know whether that's the same proposition as that,
2290080	2292080	whether this is the same property as that,
2292080	2298080	whether there are one or infinitely many possible fat men in the doorway, et cetera, et cetera,
2298080	2303080	because possibilities might be something introduced along similar lines.
2303080	2308080	And so in short, there might be that kind of disadvantage,
2308080	2310080	or there are other disadvantages we might have to worry about.
2310080	2313080	Losing information is one, in other words.
2313080	2319080	And this lack of identity conditions is another closely related one.
2319080	2327080	Are there other disadvantages?
2327080	2328080	Yeah?
2328080	2331080	So kind of quite along with the losing information one,
2331080	2333080	I'm in another linguistic anthropology class,
2333080	2335080	and we're just talking about linguistic relativity,
2335080	2338080	where it's like, because people aren't speaking the same language,
2338080	2340080	like even though you're saying the same thing,
2340080	2343080	we still have a different kind of meaning associated with it,
2343080	2347080	even though it's relating to referencing the same thing.
2347080	2351080	So kind of, we're losing that level of information also.
2351080	2352080	That's a good point.
2352080	2356080	You might think that the kind of information being conveyed
2356080	2359080	really does depend on the rest of the linguistic framework.
2359080	2363080	And it's not clear, especially in so far as we're now able to identify things
2363080	2365080	across linguistic frameworks,
2365080	2368080	you might worry that we're losing a certain kind of context.
2368080	2372080	So if this could happen in a kind of anthropological setting,
2372080	2376080	where, for example, we have a very rich set of color words,
2376080	2378080	we go to study a tribe's language,
2378080	2382080	and we realize they only have, let's say, three color terms.
2382080	2385080	They divide the whole spectrum up into just these three things.
2385080	2389080	And the question is, well, how do we translate those words they use?
2389080	2391080	Here's one proposal.
2391080	2393080	They are white, black and red.
2393080	2394080	Okay?
2394080	2395080	Here's another proposal.
2395080	2398080	Well, they're really red, yeah,
2398080	2400080	but the others are more like light and dark.
2400080	2404080	Because after all, what we would describe as brown, for example,
2404080	2406080	they're going to call black.
2406080	2412080	And so you might worry about how we sort of capture the content of this proposition.
2412080	2415080	And that's, so there's that worry.
2415080	2419080	There's also this kind of worry in a scientific context with theory change.
2419080	2424080	We move from traditional Newtonian mechanics to relativistic mechanics,
2424080	2428080	and all of a sudden, do we have the same concept of kinetic energy
2428080	2430080	or a different concept of kinetic energy?
2430080	2433080	Does kinetic energy really function as the same term there,
2433080	2435080	or should be viewed differently?
2435080	2439080	Is it, if we think of it as an abstract property that something has,
2439080	2441080	is it the same property or a different property?
2441080	2444080	And so I think you're right that, in a sense,
2444080	2447080	it may be good that this doesn't commit us to a specific view of that,
2447080	2450080	but you might think, look, there's a tension here,
2450080	2454080	because insofar as we gain the advantage of pulling things out of their context,
2454080	2458080	we get the disadvantage that we're losing information provided by that context.
2458080	2459080	Right?
2459080	2464080	And we've got to, in some cases, it's super easy to put in that information.
2464080	2467080	I pull, I am hungry away from the speaker.
2467080	2469080	I don't know who it is anymore,
2469080	2471080	but I can fill that in with a proper name,
2471080	2474080	designating the person who's hungry and problem solved.
2474080	2477080	But in a case like the one you're describing, right?
2477080	2480080	The whole question is, in a sense, what term would I substitute?
2480080	2483080	And it might be really hard to do that.
2483080	2487080	This is the kind of worry, actually, that's going to lead Quine
2487080	2491080	to one of his most dramatic theses that we'll study later in the course,
2491080	2494080	which is the thesis of the indeterminacy of translation,
2494080	2497080	where even in pretty simple cases, he's going to ask you,
2497080	2501080	it's not all clear how we should translate native utterances,
2501080	2507080	partly because of this question of conceptual schemes that don't match up precisely,
2507080	2510080	but partly because when it comes to basic metaphysical questions,
2510080	2515080	he's going to say there's no real content to the idea of, let's say,
2515080	2518080	running into a tribe, all of them turn out to be plainness,
2518080	2521080	or another tribe that are thorough and go anomalous,
2521080	2525080	and he'll say, you know, look, I can't tell the difference between these tribes.
2525080	2529080	And so there's something unintelligible about that.
2529080	2534080	In a way, that finding a tribe with a different set of color concepts isn't absurd.
2534080	2536080	That really could happen.
2536080	2542080	But to say, oh, we've discovered this tribe of plainness that he thinks is absurd,
2542080	2544080	even though intuitively you might think,
2544080	2547080	but go back to Plato's Academy in the old days,
2547080	2550080	and isn't that a tribe of plainness right there?
2550080	2554080	Well, never mind. We'll get to that soon enough.
2554080	2557080	But yes, there's one last.
2557080	2559080	Anyway, I think that's a critical point.
2559080	2563080	Insofar as we gained flexibility to use this independently of context,
2563080	2569080	linguistic context, cultural context, context of the speaker at the time, et cetera, et cetera,
2569080	2572080	all of those things are going to be, in a sense,
2572080	2575080	abstracting away from certain information we might care about.
2575080	2578080	The last one is we have to learn this, right?
2578080	2581080	And not only is there that kind of burden,
2581080	2584080	we have to learn to speak proposition and ease or properties and so on,
2584080	2586080	but it can mislead us.
2586080	2589080	Now, what's potentially misleading about it?
2592080	2597080	We've got all of these things functioning, the singular terms,
2597080	2599080	and it looks like they're referring to objects.
2599080	2602080	But are they really referring to objects?
2602080	2604080	Not really.
2604080	2605080	Right?
2605080	2607080	I mean, this just transits as P or not.
2607080	2609080	That's not referring to an object.
2609080	2611080	Justus is a property.
2611080	2615080	That just translates into X is just or X is not just.
2615080	2620080	So, actually, these are kind of pseudo singular terms.
2620080	2622080	They're not really referring to an object.
2622080	2624080	They're doing something else.
2624080	2628080	Now, notice this has an implication, which is part of the reason why he hates it.
2628080	2630080	Because one question to ask here is,
2630080	2632080	why does one find it so objectionable?
2632080	2635080	Why do he and Karnab get into a big debate about all of this?
2636080	2639080	Part of it is because this really undermines
2639080	2641080	Quine's Criterion of Ontological Commitment.
2641080	2645080	Remember, he said to be is to be a value of a variable.
2645080	2651080	And so, once I've got this, notice I can existentially quantify with respect to this.
2651080	2653080	I can now say there are propositions.
2653080	2655080	In fact, there's a proposition that both you and I believe.
2655080	2658080	We can say all sorts of things like this.
2659080	2665080	And similarly here, we can say, sure, there is a P, such that P is a property.
2665080	2670080	Namely, for example, justice or triangularity or redness, blah, blah, blah.
2670080	2672080	Of course, those things are analytic.
2672080	2675080	And so, there is a P such that this is the case.
2675080	2677080	That's going to be a trivial truth.
2677080	2682080	And yet, Karnab's point is that doesn't actually commit me to an object like justice
2682080	2684080	or triangularity or redness.
2684080	2689080	Why? Because all I'm really doing is abstracting away from usages like this.
2689080	2692080	And so, the big conclusion of...
2692080	2695080	Well, I think there are a number of big conclusions of this.
2697080	2699080	Let's spell them out explicitly.
2701080	2710080	One is to be is not to be a value of a variable.
2710080	2717080	In fact, we might say variables are cheap.
2717080	2721080	Can I ask the reason for that?
2721080	2727080	It's because there are things that are values of variables that don't really exist.
2727080	2729080	Is that the argument?
2729080	2732080	Well, yeah, that...
2732080	2735080	Well, actually, yeah, you're right.
2735080	2739080	I mean, maybe the value here is that...
2739080	2742080	Because in a sense, we can talk about there being properties
2742080	2745080	without actually having any properties as values of variables.
2745080	2749080	So maybe, actually, I'm putting it in a misleading way.
2749080	2753080	A better way of putting it would really be that existential and universal quantifications
2753080	2756080	are not good guides to ontology.
2756080	2759080	So, let me put that more precisely.
2759080	2762080	And now I'm running out of room or time.
2762080	2766080	I'll get rid of properties here like a good novelist.
2766080	2771080	And so we can say a better way of putting that really is quantification.
2774080	2781080	Is must the guide to ontology.
2785080	2788080	And the second big implication is really just that
2788080	2791080	if we ask these basic ontological questions, or their properties,
2791080	2794080	or their propositions, or their numbers, et cetera,
2794080	2800080	really they're either trivial if they're internal questions or they're pragmatic.
2800080	2812080	So, so-called metaphysical questions
2812080	2820080	are either trivial if they're internal or practical questions.
2820080	2822080	If they're external questions.
2822080	2824080	There is no deep metaphysical question.
2824080	2826080	Are there numbers?
2826080	2827080	Are there propositions?
2827080	2828080	Are there properties?
2828080	2829080	Are there relations?
2829080	2831080	Are there mental states?
2831080	2833080	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
2833080	2834080	All right.
2834080	2836080	All of those end up current up things.
2836080	2839080	Being either trivial questions as asked within the framework.
2839080	2841080	We've introduced the framework.
2841080	2842080	Numbers.
2842080	2843080	Are there numbers?
2843080	2844080	Sure.
2844080	2845080	One, two, three, four.
2845080	2846080	Right?
2846080	2848080	Oh, you mean external question?
2848080	2849080	Then it's a practical question.
2849080	2851080	Is it worth doing arithmetic?
2851080	2853080	Is it worth talking about propositions?
2853080	2855080	Is it worth talking about properties?
2855080	2860080	In that way could Pegasus become a pragmatic object?
2860080	2863080	Oh, suppose we talk.
2863080	2867080	Well, for one thing, Pegasus doesn't give us something of a new kind really
2867080	2869080	in the sense that we have to now introduce a new kind
2869080	2872080	that forces us to change grammatical categories.
2872080	2875080	But if we introduce a category of dementors or of Pegasus,
2875080	2877080	the question is in a sense,
2877080	2879080	well, I'm telling you the story about Pegasus, right?
2879080	2881080	I'm, well, Irofon wrote to me.
2881080	2882080	He was white.
2882080	2883080	He was winged.
2883080	2884080	He did this and that.
2884080	2890080	Within the myth, of course, Pegasus exists, right?
2890080	2893080	If I ask a journal question, it's really to say,
2893080	2896080	so is this myth something we should accept?
2896080	2898080	The same thing would be true of the dementors.
2898080	2900080	Within the story of the Harry Potter world,
2900080	2901080	of course there are dementors,
2901080	2903080	but you say, oh, they really exist.
