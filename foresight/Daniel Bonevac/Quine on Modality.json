{"text": " Today we return to the wonderful desert landscape of Kwa. And we're gonna be talking about an issue that is, well, in a way dominates the next several decades in philosophy. Now at first glance you might think it's a very surprising thing. What is this issue? It's often referred to as the problem of quantifying it and dealing with the issues that arise from a quantified load a lot from combining ideas about possibility and necessity or for that matter various attitudes on belief and knowledge with quantifiable apparatus that allows you to use terms like some and all. Now at first glance you might think why is this significant? Why does this pose serious philosophical problems? The answer is roughly this. There is a traditional way of looking at metaphysics where you think about objects. As in Aristotle, for example, there are substances, they have properties, they stand in relation, and some of the properties of these substances are essential to them. They couldn't lose them without altering what they are. Okay? Other properties are accidental. They can change without affecting the identity of the object at all. So for example, what are some accidental properties of me? They could change, I would still be me. Yeah. Where you're standing? Where I'm standing, exactly. I'm standing here right now, but I can move around, I'm still me. Okay? If I do this, you can't suddenly say, well, we just keep getting a new professor in this class. Right? I'm still me. Other properties that are accidental. What are you wearing? What I'm wearing, exactly. I could wear different things, I'm still me. That I'm wearing this kind of sort of cream colored shirt. That is an accidental property of mine. What are some other accidental properties of mine? The color of your hair. Color of my hair? Yeah. I guess I could do something about that. It used to be different, but I was the same person. In fact, somebody recently saw me. I guess they hadn't seen me in a while. They said, when did your hair turn like this? I don't know. Actually, I sort of do know. It all happened rather suddenly. But anyway, that's something that is an accidental property of mine. What about essential properties? These are properties that are necessary to a thing. And in fact, Aristotle gives us three ways of thinking about these properties that are necessary to a thing. One is just that. The thing cannot lose them without stopping to be what it is. A second is that they are the things by virtue of which the thing is what it is. We might say that they are the nature of the thing. That's the way he sometimes refers to it. And Aquinas later calls it the nature of the thing. It's what makes it what it is. And then finally, we could think of it as something like the definition of the thing or what corresponds in the thing to what would be a definition of it. Now, could there be a definition of me? Aristotle talks about the question of whether there could be a definition of Socrates, for example. But there could certainly be a definition of a general kind. So we might think we could have a definition of bachelor or a definition of human being even. And that these things would express what is necessary to being a bachelor or a human being, what makes somebody a bachelor or a human being, what would correspond in the thing, the properties in the thing that would match the definition of those terms bachelor and human being. So are there such essential properties? Well, from one point of view, yes, in the Aristotelian tradition, in fact, not only are there such properties, but they're crucial to understanding the nature of the world. After all, the accidental properties aren't really very important in detailing what a thing is, but the essential properties are. And so Aristotelian essentialism is this doctrine that some of the properties of a thing are really substantively identical to it, right? Not identical to it, essential to it. And constitutive of its identity in some way. Now, there has been throughout the history of philosophy some resistance to this idea. And so there are people, I think John Walk would be a good example, at least in, well, in a certain respect, in another respect, not at all. Maybe Hume is a good example of someone who is doubtful about this idea of essentialism. Why do I say, well, Locke distinguishes the real from the nominal essence of the thing. He does think things have a real essence connected to the real internal constitution of the thing. But most of the essences he thinks that are talked about in the Aristotelian tradition are actually just nominal essences. They do correspond to something like the definition. But the definition, you might say, is something that depends on our categories, our way of understanding the thing. So understand me as a human being and certain things will look essential to me. But we could also ask, well, am I essentially a human being? Maybe, maybe not. And if I'm not essentially a human being, then those properties that are essential to me qua human being might not be essential to me, qua soul, let's say, or qua something else. And so it depends how a thing is described, what is essential to me. From this perspective, you might say, essence depends on the description of the thing. It's something that we use to understand the thing, but it's not in the thing itself. And so one way of framing this issue is, if we grant that some properties have this status of being essential, either to a thing or to a kind of thing, then is that something that really is about that object? Is it really about that kind? Or is it something that we are supplying as part of our conceptual framework for understanding that thing, that kind? It's really a question of realism versus a kind of anti-realism about those essences. So almost nobody is going to say, oh, just nothing's essential to anything, in the sense that we never can talk about something being necessarily this or that, or we can't really talk about definitions. It's a question of whether that distinction is something that we find in the world among the properties of the thing or the kind, or whether it's something that really is just our creation. Now suppose you're a logical empiricist and you think, well, first of all, you're going to be uncomfortable with this talk of necessity in the first place, right? And we'll get some more of that in a moment. But whether or not you're willing to talk about necessity at all, you're going to think, well, what is necessity from a logical empiricist point of view? It's basically analytic truth. It is coming from our verbal conventions. And so you're going to think that, of course, to the extent that we can talk about essences at all, they're things that are coming from our conceptual capacities. They're coming from our linguistic framework. And so sure, we can have definitions of terms, but that's not expressing some fundamental distinction between properties in the thing. It's simply a function of the definitions of the terms we're using. So it's all coming from us. From a more traditional perspective, though, you might think, no, there really are things that are essential to me and I couldn't lose without ceasing to be me. There are other things that may be, well, certainly I can lose and still be me, like the color of my hair or the color of my shirt or where I'm standing. Now, if we start asking, well, what are the kinds of things that are essential to me? It's much harder, right? Easy to list accidental properties. But if I say suddenly, well, one is essential to me, then that's a really hard question to answer. Yeah. Do these essential properties actually need to you? Well, not all of them certainly, right? There could be some things that are essential to me. For example, you might say, I've got an idea. Self-identity is essential. You are necessarily you. Okay? So Dan Bonovac is necessarily Dan Bonovac. Now, that seems pretty safe. And also a good example of something that seems analytic, right? It's not something that really expresses something you might think about the nature of me, but about the way we use identity. And certainly, it's not unique. Every object would have that property and have that property essentially. So not all of these are going to really be unique to me. On the other hand, you might have the idea that what makes me differ from anyone else is that if you take the collection of these essential properties, there's something that's unique to me about that collection. So individually, they might not be unique, but that combination might be. On the other hand, maybe not. So have you ever seen a movie multiplicity? The guy gets cloned and then the clones start cloning themselves and it all gets sort of outrageously outhand. But anyway, suppose we did have a cloning mechanism so that there were just a bunch of duplicates of me. Would those be me? Would we not say, oh, Dan Bonovac used to be a particular, but now he's a general kind and there are a bunch of them. He's multiply instantiated. Or would there be something that distinguishes me from them? Something about my origin, maybe, the way in which I came to be. They came to be in a very different way by means of the cloning machine. Or maybe it's a transporter malfunction in Star Trek. You know, you get in the transporter and actually we don't send your particles down. We just rebuild you on the other side and kill you here. It's a really disturbing view of the transporter system, but suppose you have that view. And then suppose it malfunctions so that we don't kill you here. So you're still on the ship. But also now there's a clone of you running around on the planet. And then the clone comes back and what that means is now there's a second one of you on the ship and that guy's still stuck down there and they all claim to be you. Well, I don't know what to say about such cases. So it's not clear to me now whether we have three of you or whether, no, you're still you. There's something essential to you about the way in which you were created. These are copies of you, but they're not you. Just as if you produce a copy of a file on a computer. You've got a copy of the file. You don't have that same file. In any event, however that may be, does this whole idea of an essence of the thing make any sense? Well, I've already mentioned one reason why is a logical empiricist. You might think it doesn't. But there are other reasons you might think it doesn't. And they are more general. After all, Klein is not a logical empiricist. He's attacked the analytic synthetic distinction. He's attacked the identity of truth by convention. So you might think he's the kind of guy that's actually going to be very friendly toward this idea of essential problems, really beating the world. But not true. And why not? Well, really, let's go back and think about the essential major of empiricism. What is an empiricist? An empiricist thinks that, oh, knowledge comes from what? Well, well, analytic and synthetic truth, but fundamentally experience, right? And then, yeah, there are these things that are really, well, knowledge of a sort, but really, in the end, knowledge of linguistic conventions or something like that, you might think. But all of our knowledge of the world comes from experience. Now, if you're quite, you're not actually going to single out some of these analytic judgments or conventional judgments or something like that as an exception. In the end, it's all really about the world. And so it's all coming from experience. It's all judged by the tribunal of experience. So in the end, it all comes down to experience. But now, there are going to be things that are hard to explain in connection with experience. So think about the kinds of things that you as trouble accounting for, for example. Okay, we can talk about the color of my shirt. But now, there are going to be other properties of me, dispositional properties of me that you might think are not so evident. What do we say about dispositional properties? What are some examples of dispositional properties? You can't directly observe them. They have to do with the way I would behave in certain circumstances. But those circumstances might actually never come about. Like the match, let's say. We say it's not soluble, even though it's never placed in water. It's a we never really have the experience of finding out. Similarly, the salt in my salt shake. I say it is soluble, but actually, it might never encounter water. And so we might never find out. Look at your temper. Sorry. Would your temper be one? Okay, good. My temper. Am I somebody who is a rassable, easy to anger? Or am I somebody who's gentle, mellow, difficult to anger? Well, I think I don't know. Not much happens in the average analytic tradition course to really upset me. And so you might think this is like the match that's never been placed in water, right? I mean, nothing's ever happened in your in your experience to really test whether I'm easy to anger or not. And the same thing is true with respect to you given my experience, right? Are you easy to anger or not? I don't have any experience that's relevant to that. I mean, you might be the sort of person who flies off the handle. What, analytic judgments? No. And you know, analytic philosophy does that to some people. There's the famous story about Wittgenstein threatening copper with the poker. But wordarily, you might think, yeah, it doesn't really come up in the context of this sort of course. So we don't find out. And maybe I never find out that about them. Yeah. We're saying that these dispositional probabilities are like essential things. Oh, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything about them being essential. I'm just thinking, yeah, well, I should make it clear what I'm saying here. What are potential trouble for an empiricist? Things where we say, gosh, what experience could that be based on? Right? Now, maybe I do have experience. There might be some people who see you get angry and they have a sense you're either easy to anger or hard to anger. But maybe we never encounter that, right? You just go through life and it's all pretty good. Go through life. It's like, you know, all right, there's this story about a kid who, you know, never spoke. Parents took him to all sorts of specialists, had him examined. He seemed normal in all other ways, but just never said a word. Well, finally they gave up, right? They take him to this specialist, that specialist, do all sorts of brain scans and so on. He seems absolutely normal, seems to be intelligent. Nobody can figure out why this child does not speak. So eventually they just kind of give up. And then one morning, the kid's sitting down before going to school for breakfast. Mom gives him this piece of toast. Kid suddenly looks at it and says, this toast is burnt. Well, suddenly she and her husband, they're all like, you spoke, you spoke, they're so happy, right? And the kid said, well, of course I can speak. Why haven't you said anything up to now? It's been 12 years. Kid said, well, it's all been okay up to now. Okay, so it might be that the kid goes through life the whole way, right? I mean, we never find out whether this person is easy to anger because just nothing ever happens to upset them. Yeah, why would that really be a problem? Because we don't have the knowledge then. So, I mean, you don't have to justify it with empiricism if you don't know it. Okay, good. You might just say, well, then we don't know, right? Whether this person is erasable or gentle or what have you. And so that's fine. It's fine to have things we do not know. But now you might think, well, here's the problem. Remember, we were talking about this in Karnap, where Karnap was trying to define terms like soluble in terms that were strictly observational. And he probably couldn't do it with a regular conditional. He needed something like a counterfactual conditional. So it had to be something like if blah, blah, blah were to happen, right? Then blah, blah, blah would happen. And now the problem is that were to and that would. It seems to refer to things that actually, well, aren't part of this world. The way philosophers now, following Leibniz, said to think about this, it's talking about other possible worlds. If you were to be placed in this kind of situation, right, but maybe you never are, then this would happen. And so it's not just that we don't happen to know. It feels like the kind of thing that actually it would be hard to explain our possession of such a property. What could it even mean to attribute such a property on empiricist grounds? Because you might think, gosh, it's not just that to notice I'd have to somehow have contact with these other possible worlds. The very definition of what it is that such a property seems to refer to these other worlds. And so there's something strange about that. Yeah. I mean, you could just arrive at that knowledge inductively and say salt dissolves when placed in water, right? I don't really, I remember talking about this before, but not that we'll be visiting it like this. I don't really see why you need counterfactuals. Good, good. Well, you might think, look, I don't really need any mysterious knowledge here. Here's how I do it. I have inductive evidence about this rule, right? And on the basis of that inductive evidence, I conclude certain generalizations. And some of those I actually consider laws. Now, some of these generalizations I consider accidental. It just so happens that this takes place. I can't infer it to have any really lawline character. It's just been a matter of chance that it's worked out that way. However, some of these other things might seem to me to reflect some deeper pattern. And so I think that's a law. Now, what's involved in my going from the generalization that G puts salt in water and it dissolves to the law, put it in water, it must dissolve? Where does the must come from? Where does the necessity come from? And you might say, look, it's just if we have enough inductive evidence, right? We do this in the United States. We do it in Europe. We do it in Africa. We do it in India. We do it in China. We do it in Russia. And gee, no matter where we go, no matter when it is, it seems to all be the same. And we start thinking, this isn't just an accident. This is really lawlike. And so one way of looking at this is to say, we start attributing something like necessity, like the must, like calling that a law, when the inductive evidence is just very broad, very powerful, seems very, what, have a huge scope in space and time and so on. Which is, by the way, why it would be so hard to come up with equivalent laws in the social sciences, because you might think it's very hard to have that kind of fraud, inductive evidence. Maybe in psychology, you can do it because you can observe lots of people in lots of cultures and so forth. But if you're thinking about political science, you might think, gosh, where's the science? Because here we call that a department of government, right? We don't claim it to be a science. But you might think, the problem is really, we can't get enough inductive evidence. I mean, how many countries are there in the world now? That's quite few, but not in comparison to grains of salt, for example. And what kinds of experience have we had, let's say, with revolutions? Well, some, but not equivalent to putting salt in water and finding out what happens. And so, you might think there, the inductive evidence is just sparse enough, very hard to make that move. Anyway, I don't have any real objection to that. In fact, I think that's the way Locke thinks all of this goes. It's Hume, who after all says, wait a minute, look at what's happening in these cases. We observe this happening, we observe that happening, we never see the causal connection. We never actually observe the link. Yeah. I don't really see how this inductive evidence would work. Like, if someone were to tell me that salt doesn't dissolve in oil, I wouldn't necessarily have to do the experiment over and over again to understand that for certain, but I could still believe it conceptually. So, I feel like inductive evidence isn't necessarily the only way to get some kind of dispositional property or something. Right. Well, here's the problem. Sometimes you're right. We do take one counter instances enough to establish either a connection or the lack of a connection. But I'm thinking of cases like the cold fusion experiments. People claim to have discovered cold fusion. And then, for at least a decade, there was a huge attempt to try to replicate those experiments to figure out whether there really was a principle underlying this and there was really a technology that would enable cold fusion or whether this was due to some, the results they got were due to some kind of weird phenomenon in their lab. And for a long time, it was unsettled what it was. I think now most people dismiss the possibility, though I think there are still some authors who think that there may still be something there that one could do. But many of them, from one experiment, people thought, oh, that's intriguing. It made them want to do more experiments. But people didn't immediately say, we've got the technology in the future. Let's start building cold fusion, power plants, and so forth. They felt the need to do more experimentation. So, I think in some contexts, especially when something refutes along, then it's very powerful. We say, wait a minute, this is going to happen. We put the salt in the oil and then what happens when we put the salt in the oil? We've never done it before. We're doing it for the first time. And we might say, aha, this is what happened. It did dissolve, so salt does dissolve oil or it didn't dissolve. But the evidence for that is rather thin until we repeat it. And if it's the kind of thing that we can't repeat, then it's hard to know what to do, which is, again, part of the reason why it's a political science. It would be so difficult to come up with something law-like. You can't start saying, whoa, what if that would happen again? Let's hold the last presidential race over again and see if Trump still wins under these conditions or something. Yeah, can't do that. And so, in short, it's the kind of thing that, well, yeah, it's going to depend a lot on how this fits in with the rest of our knowledge. And so, quiet at least will say, yeah, you're right, this is how it goes. But a lot of that is driven by where this is in the web, how close we are to experience, how much other theoretical support there is and so forth. Anyway, we're getting sort of off track because I don't want to spend a huge amount of time thinking about how we can account for dispositional properties, except to say that there's a sense in which essential properties raise the same kinds of questions. I was hoping here to be referring to something we all agree about, but oh well. Anyway, essential properties are kind of the same. Why? Because we think, well, yeah, I'm saying here, gosh, if the object were right to lack the property, it wouldn't be what it is. And that's similarly modal, right? It's similarly talking about what would be the case. And maybe I never, in fact, lack the property. And so, you know, for example, would I still be me if I were bald? Well, let's suppose I just never go bald. And then you might say, well, gosh, we never find out. Now, in fact, we think, oh, come on, it's still me himself to be bald. And so, we think we know something about that. And yet, it looks like, in a sense, what we're knowing here goes similarly beyond experience directly. So, if you're in the school of lock as an empiricist, you're going to say, well, we reach inductive conclusions about this, just as we do about these scientific laws, just as we do dispositional properties. If you're more humian, you're going to see a deeper problem here. And think that the very idea takes you beyond the bounds of experience in a way that makes you uncomfortable. So, why did I stand on that? I don't know. It was really just to make the point that there is kind of this distinction between the lockians and the humians here, and that there's a sort of parallel problem here. So, just as Karnab worried a lot about this, and a lot of people start writing about counterfactual conditionals, and how to understand them, and what the nature of laws is, and so forth. So, similarly, we have an analogous problem with essential properties. Now, we can characterize certain contexts in language and in thought as referentially transparent, and others as referentially opaque. And that's an important distinction for Karnab. So, here's the general idea. We've got this notion of identity. Okay? And there, or just expressed by is in English. And ordinarily, it allows us to substitute. So, typically, we can substitute identicals for identities. So, here's an example. Two plus two is four. Four plus four is eight. Well, I should be able to substitute two plus two for four in that equation to get two plus two plus two plus two is eight. And that, that seems right, right? That works out just fine. And so ordinarily, this is a legitimate rule. Leibniz's law in general says that things are identical. If they have exactly the same properties, and if they have exactly the same properties, you should be able to substitute one for the other. And typically, we can do that. If Dan Bonobak is talking, and Dan Bonobak is the professor, then the professor is talking, etc. But now, there are some contexts where that prevails. So, we'll say that a context is transparent. If that works, that is to say, if substituting identicals for identicals always preserves truth value. So, it turns true sentences into true sentences, and false sentences and false sentences. And opaque, if it sometimes fails, which means it doesn't always preserve truth value. So, Quine is worried about these opaque contexts, where we've got some situations where substitution doesn't always work. Here's one of his examples. Basically, well, yeah, we can say things that involve quotation, either directly or indirectly. So, yeah, here's one of these examples. Cicero, a name, right, contains six letters. This fall, by the way, there's going to be a course on Cicero and Catullus in the classics. So, you should all take it. It would help with your new lab. Yeah, well, I'm very fond of both of them. So, now, Cicero, what is his actual name? Well, it's Marcus Tullius Cicero. And so, he's sometimes called Tully as a nickname. So, Cicero is Tully. But then we might think, ah, so we can substitute. Tully contains six letters. Well, that obviously fails, right? We don't preserve truth by that kind of substitution. We can substitute in direct notation. And that's sort of a surprise, really, because after all, this is about the name, Cicero, and not about the person. And so, the identity of the person here doesn't mean that the names are going to share the properties. So, it's easy to explain why that fails. Now, this can also be indirect. So, for example, he gives us this case. Georgione is called Barbarelli. Sorry, Georgione is Barbarelli. Georgione Barbarelli was the first of the great painters of the Italian Renaissance. And in particular, he's thought to have painted a painting called The Three Philosophers, which is perhaps why Klein knows about it. Sort of a mysterious character. He died when he was around 30 of the play, and only painted a few paintings. So, little is known about him. But anyway, here's a quite example. Georgione was so-called because of his size. Big guy. Okay? Barbarelli was so-called because of his size. Well, that's not right. Okay? So, so-called here is something that sort of sneaks in a reference to the name. And so, it's kind of an indirect, well, not literally, an indirect quotation. But nevertheless, it's something like a quotation context. It sneaks it in. So, there are those kinds of cases. But there are much more interesting kinds of cases. So, in particular, necessity is one of these. One way of thinking about an essential property is that it's necessary to the thing, or to the kind of thing. But now we can think, well, wait a minute, necessity is weird because it's opaque in this way. So, here's an example that might show that. The number of planets is 9. Necessarily, 9 is greater than 7. Therefore, necessarily, the number of planets is greater than 7. Now, does that work? No. What's gone wrong? There's no necessity that there'd be more than 7 planets. Exactly. There's no necessity that there'd be more than 7 planets. I think there could have been 6 planets. I mean, a little while ago, they demoted Pluto for being a planet. Now, again, they promoted Pluto back up again. So, there are 9 planets again. Yay! Go ahead, because it makes it easier to teach quine here. But, actually, somebody said, well, wait a minute, I'm not sure. The Earth is a planet. And you might think, oh, wait, we're going to change the definition of planets. So, even the Earth isn't a planet. Maybe it will turn out that only, I don't know, would satisfy their new definition of planets. Those people got their way. But there might be way fewer than 7 planets by that criterion. In any case, you might think, yeah, look, it's highly contingent whether or not there are more than 7 planets. That's not a necessary truth. But this surely is a necessary truth. 9 is greater than 7. That seems necessary. Something that follows from the laws of arithmetic. And the number of planets is 9. So, why can't we do this substitution? Well, here's what quine ends up concluding. Is this property, so you can frame it this way, is the property of being necessarily greater than 7? Well, maybe I don't want to. We could just say, is that true? Let's say, is the property of being greater than 7 necessary to 9, the object 9? Now, one way of looking at it, if you're a realist, you think you can answer the question. If you're a realist, the amount is essences, right? Because then you think, yes, the essence is in the object. And so, what is the realist going to say about this question? Is the property of being greater than 7 necessary to 9? Yeah, sure it is. Because 9 is necessarily greater than 7. You couldn't make it less than 7, for example, or equal to 7 without changing what 9 is. But suppose we're one of these anti-realists. Then how are you going to answer that question? It depends how you designate it, right? If you call it, if you're thinking of 9 as 9, then yes, it's necessarily greater than 7. It has that property unnecessarily. But suppose you're thinking of it as the number of planets, then it doesn't. 9 quad, 9, you might think, necessarily has that property. But the number of planets, 9 quad, the number of planets does not. And so, it sort of depends on how it's described. And that's in the end client's position. It depends how it's described. So we can talk about things having essences, but only as, when described as such and such. 9 described as that number. We're already sort of describing it in terms of its position in the number sequence. And so, yes, it's necessarily greater than 7, but 9 described as the number of planets. No, that's not necessarily greater than 7. 9, just without any description, he says, I don't think I could make any sense of the idea. Yeah. Well, why is 9 described as the number of planets not necessarily greater than 7? Because there could have been fewer than 7 planets. But there aren't. There aren't. Yeah, there aren't. That's why I'm confused. Like, there could have been, but if there would have been, then it just wouldn't have been 9 in the first place. It would be different. So it wouldn't necessarily, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. You might think the number of planets, wait a minute, I'm not sure what to do with that when I start thinking about other possible circumstances. After all, you say that could have been fewer than 9 planets. Well, we're now talking about some other possible world, right? And so, what about one of these worlds where there are now fewer than, here's the sun, and here's Mercury, let's say, and here's Venus, and the big bang worked out a little differently in this world. So all the other planets flew off in this space, and there are only those two remaining. Okay. So in this world, there are two planets. Now, what does the number of planets refer to in that world? Two. Okay. One wavelength. Yeah, look, the number of planets here is just two. But then it looks like the number of planets is 9 in this world, 2 in that world, so it's not necessarily greater than 7. On the other hand, you might think, wait a minute, no, when I said the number of planets is 9, I mean the number of planets in this world. And so I don't mean the number of planets, let's call the actual world here w, in this world, w prime, let's say, then really I have to distinguish the number of planets in w prime from the number of planets in w. And the number of planets in w is still 9, right? Because it is what it is. It doesn't matter what world you're viewing it from, in that world, in our world, the number of planets is 9. And so you might think, wait a minute, when I say the number of planets, do I mean that to vary with world? So, ooh, now the number of planets is this. Or do I mean the number of planets there actually are? And that actually would be something that ties this to this world. The actual number of planets? That sort of means that's not going to vary from world to world. But if I don't sort of pin it down with actually, then it looks like it could vary. On the other hand, people don't ordinarily go around, unless they're teaching seminars on motor logic, they don't go around using the term actually much in that way. And so often, if we just say the number of planets, the number of students in the class, etc., etc., we mean the actual number. We're not talking about something that might vary. You know, I say the number of students in the class is, what is it in this class? Like 25. And somebody says, well, what if a bunch of people dropped? Well, yeah, then the number of planets would change. The number of students that are in the class then would be different. On the other hand, the number of students who were in the class now would remain the same. And so you might think that actually there's a sort of hidden ambiguity here, which I think is part of this. You might think, look, it depends on how it's described. And here's an additional way in which it depends. Do I mean the number of planets that happen to be in a given world? Or do I mean the number of planets that actually are in this world? And those would be, as it were, two different descriptions. And that too would affect what we end up saying about this question. Okay, well, that's one sort of problem. It's connected to a problem about quantification. Because now if I say, so there is something that is necessarily greater than seven. How do I evaluate that? Now, Quine doesn't have any problem with necessity applied to a sentence. He doesn't have any problem with necessity on the outside of this, you might say. It's a necessary truth that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He worries about the necessity being inside. Okay, there is something that is necessarily greater than seven, that has been greater than seven as an essential property of it. And why does he worry about that? Because this something isn't described as being of any particular kind. And if it really does depend on how it's described, then it doesn't make any sense to talk about whether the object itself is necessarily greater than seven or not. What makes sense is to say the number of planets is not necessarily greater than seven, but nine is necessarily greater than seven. And yet we're talking about the same object, so it depends on the description. And so he's worried that things like this don't fully make sense. Now, the same sort of thing can happen with respect to attitudes. And that's what the paper quantifiers in propositional attitudes is about. This begins, by the way, with one of my favorite passages of analytic philosophy. The incorrectness of rendering Tessius is hunting unicorns. In the fashion that there is an X, such that X is a unicorn and Tessius is hunting X, is conveniently attested by the non-existence of unicorns. But it's not due simply to that zoological Kunah. It would be equally incorrect to render Ernest's hunting lions as there is an X such that X is a lion. And Ernest is hunting X, where Ernest is a sportsman in Africa. The force of one is rather that there is some individual lion or several, which Ernest is hunting, stray circus property, for example. The contrast recurs in I want a sloop. The version, there is an X such that X is a sloop, and I want X. It's suitable insofar only as there may be said to be a certain sloop that I want. If what I seek is mere relief from slooplessness, then do guess the wrong idea. Okay, now this is something that actually linguists have worried a lot about. What do you do about cases like hunting a unicorn or hunting a lion or wanting a sloop and so forth? And then he kind of leaves that problem behind, but it's an interesting problem. Anyway, that's one difficulty where we want to say, wait, hunting, actually, yeah, I should sort of put in here. We've got this additional thing now of attitudes. Hunting is something that does involve some kind of attitude. Hunting, searching for wanting. But there are others. So here is a wonderful story. Consider the difference between there is an X such that Ralph believes that X is a spy and Ralph believes that there is an X such that X is a spy. They're two very different states, right? They may be ambiguously phrased as Ralph believes that someone's a spy, but they may be unambiguously phrased respectively as there's someone who Ralph believes to be a spy, and Ralph believes there are spies. The difference is vast. If Ralph is like most of us, aid is true, that is to say, he does believe there are spies, but there's no particular person of whom he believes that that person is a spy. Well, here is the marvelous story. There's a certain man in a brown hat whom Ralph has glimpsed several times under questionable circumstances on which we need not enter here. Suffice it to say that Ralph suspects he's a spy. Also, there's a gray-haired man vaguely known as Ralph as rather a pillar of the community whom Ralph is not aware of having seen except once at the beach. Now, Ralph does not know it, but the men are one and the same. Can we say of this man, Bernard J. Orcutt, to give him a name, that Ralph believes him to be a spy? If so, we find ourselves accepting a conjunction of this type. W sincerely denies blah-blah-blah and yet believes that blah-blah-blah. With one and the same sentence in both of these planks, for Ralph is ready enough to say in all sincerity Bernard J. Orcutt is no spy. He's that upstanding member of the community, right? If on the other hand, with a view to disallowing these situations, we say Ralph believes the man in the brown hat is a spy, Ralph doesn't believe the man seen at the beach is a spy. But wait a minute, the man in the brown hat is the man at the beach. Now, what do we say about Ralph's beliefs? So here the problem is, well, in general about belief, but also specifically about this. Does Ralph have a belief for Ralph Bernard J? Well, here's Ralph. He believes the man in the brown hat is a spy, but Ralph doesn't believe that the man at the beach is a spy. In fact, he would outright deny it, but those two are identical, right? They're both Bernard J. Orcutt. So does Ralph believe that Orcutt is a spy or not? Well, under one description, the man in the brown hat, yes. Under the other description, the man at the beach, no. And so it's very tempting here to say that actually belief is not something you have about an object, it's something you have about an object under a certain description.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.74, "text": " Today we return to the wonderful desert landscape of Kwa.
