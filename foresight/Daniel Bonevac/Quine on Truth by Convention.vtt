00:00.000 --> 00:06.120
Well, today I want to return to our discussion of the debate between Karnap and why.

00:06.120 --> 00:11.400
Two people whose views are closely aligned, but who nevertheless disagree about some fundamental

00:11.400 --> 00:17.720
questions about logical truth, about conventionalism, about ontology, and about the nature of philosophy

00:17.720 --> 00:18.720
in general.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.000
So let's begin by going back to what we introduced right at the end of last time.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.640
We were talking about the idea of a framework, and indeed that's something fundamental to

00:27.640 --> 00:28.640
Karnap.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.760
The thought that we introduced frameworks, linguistic frameworks ultimately, but I think

00:33.760 --> 00:38.760
we could also refer to them as conceptual frameworks if that didn't in some sense make

00:38.760 --> 00:42.960
a question that Karnap is interested in avoiding.

00:42.960 --> 00:47.480
But in that case, we talked about some of these last time, and we focused on the distinction

00:47.480 --> 00:54.960
between logic, mathematics, and then natural science, state physics.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.920
We're going to talk about other frameworks today too.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.920
But let's start with that distinction.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.880
Quoting thinks it's tempting with respect to the first two.

01:05.880 --> 01:10.080
When he sees the logical empiricism by Karnap as in general saying about the first two,

01:10.080 --> 01:12.240
these things are true by conventional.

01:12.240 --> 01:17.440
We adopt certain linguistic conventions, and things in logic and mathematics are true.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.920
By virtue of the meanings of the terms, those meanings are determined by those conventions.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.960
Physics is something that isn't a question of convention, that's something that's actually

01:25.960 --> 01:28.360
talking about the real world.

01:28.360 --> 01:36.840
Well, as I see it, Quine is basically saying, with respect to this idea of truth by convention,

01:36.840 --> 01:41.200
that it makes sense only for one of these three.

01:41.200 --> 01:50.200
Which one could we legitimately argue about, whether or not that thing is true by convention?

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
Logic?

01:51.480 --> 01:54.280
Well, you'd think logic.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.280
That is what, in a sense, quite a card game, Karnap, we're arguing about, except that

01:58.280 --> 02:02.400
actually there, Quine disagrees with Karnap and thinks that the question is ultimately

02:02.400 --> 02:03.400
unintelligible.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.000
It's not so much that he thinks, oh, Karnap thinks it is true by convention.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I think it's not.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.360
And there's a well-defined question we can debate.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.400
He thinks, he says, look, my objection here isn't so much to question the truth of this

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
point as it's set.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.400
Yeah.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.400
I would say physics.

02:18.600 --> 02:25.600
Physics, there, we might argue, somebody might say there's certain conventions that are established

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
in physics.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.880
Others might say, oh, it's purely an empirical question.

02:30.880 --> 02:35.280
Actually as we'll see there, too, Quine thinks there's a huge amount of arbitrarians.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.240
And so that it's not clear that there's any real sense to the question of whether anything

02:39.240 --> 02:40.880
in physics is true by convention.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.000
Well, that leaves only one more possibility, right?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Math.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.080
And there he thinks it is actually a legitimate question whether this is true by convention.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.520
Now why is there that difference?

02:52.520 --> 02:55.040
We need to think about this sort of question.

02:55.040 --> 03:00.440
So let's raise this issue of truth by convention.

03:00.440 --> 03:06.080
And here I mean, I'm going to put question mark to indicate, I mean the question of whether

03:06.080 --> 03:07.680
this is true by convention.

03:07.680 --> 03:13.120
I don't really mean to say what I'm about to do is, with respect to the truth, is it

03:13.240 --> 03:14.240
true by convention?

03:14.240 --> 03:16.720
But rather, does the question even make sense?

03:16.720 --> 03:18.720
This answer is with respect to logic.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.720
No.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
And with respect to physics?

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
No.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.720
But with respect to mathematics?

03:23.720 --> 03:24.720
Yes.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.520
Now, why is it different?

03:26.520 --> 03:29.480
What are his arguments in each case?

03:29.480 --> 03:35.640
He thinks with respect to logic, for example, that we can't say anything meaningful in saying

03:35.640 --> 03:43.040
that logic is true by convention or true by the meanings of the terms not or if some

03:43.040 --> 03:46.320
all and other logical symbols or other logical words.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.920
Now why is that true?

03:47.920 --> 03:51.440
What's wrong with this idea of truth by convention there?

03:51.440 --> 03:56.000
Not in the sense that it's false, but in the sense that it's just meanings.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.640
What kind of argument is he given?

03:57.640 --> 04:03.080
I've got to say that when I started out reading Quine as an undergraduate, I thought he was

04:03.080 --> 04:04.600
a breath of fresh air.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.080
He was so clear compared to other philosophers.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.320
But then again, I had studied mostly continental philosophy, so in a certain sense compared

04:11.320 --> 04:17.240
to Hegel and Sartre and Heidegger, he's a breath of fresh air.

04:17.240 --> 04:21.920
On the other hand, I've got to say the older I get, the less I understand Quine.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.920
And so I don't think it's an easy question to say what are his arguments against this

04:25.920 --> 04:30.640
position here and here and what's his argument in favor of its intelligibility with respect

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
to math.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.280
I used to think I got it, and it was sort of there on the surface.

04:34.280 --> 04:38.600
Now I think it's very hard to tease out what's really going on.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.600
Yeah?

04:39.880 --> 04:45.320
I guess I'm kind of confused because I thought in the two dogmas, or his paper, whatever,

04:45.320 --> 04:48.680
I think it's called just the two dogmas.

04:48.680 --> 04:55.640
He talks about physical objects being the only, I can't remember if it's physical objects

04:55.640 --> 05:02.840
or physics being the only thing so we can, you know, no study, whatever.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.840
Right, right.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.280
Well, we're going to end up thinking about a variety of other frameworks, as you point

05:09.280 --> 05:14.200
out, and one of them is going to be just the framework of things.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.160
We've talked about this issue in relation to Russell and a few other people, whether

05:18.160 --> 05:22.640
we should really think of the ultimate constituents of the world, something like sense data or

05:22.640 --> 05:28.200
sensations or other perceptions, this type of thing, or whether we can really legitimately

05:28.200 --> 05:34.480
talk about objects, like people in tables and chairs or clocks, as the objects that

05:34.480 --> 05:35.680
are in the world.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.160
So there's that question, and we're similarly going to begin with other frameworks like

05:40.160 --> 05:49.240
the framework of propositions and a framework of properties, but you're right that certain

05:49.240 --> 05:55.920
of these client things are matters of, well, there's a sense in which you might say all

05:56.040 --> 05:59.960
of these are really questions of empirical investigation, right?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.920
In the end, his model is that web.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.480
It's not that there's some sort of foundation of given things, either given by virtue of

06:06.480 --> 06:11.400
the means of terms or given directly in experience, and then we construct all these other things

06:11.400 --> 06:13.400
on the basis of it.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.040
Instead, there are certain things we're trying to explain about the appearances of the world

06:18.040 --> 06:23.120
and we're just building these frameworks in an attempt to understand the world, period.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.880
And so it's all sort of mixed together there, whereas in a sense for the earlier logical

06:28.880 --> 06:30.840
empiricists, there's a clear divide.

06:30.840 --> 06:35.920
Certain things go into the foundation, things like logic and mathematics, and maybe some

06:35.920 --> 06:40.920
things directly perceived, and then everything else gets built on top of that.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.680
So if you want to think of it this way, here's the older logical empiricist view, it's this

06:44.760 --> 06:51.760
layer cake view, where down here is sort of logic, math, sensation, and then everything

06:55.640 --> 06:57.640
else gets constructed on top of it.

06:57.640 --> 07:02.640
Whereas in Quine, so that's the logical empiricist picture, then in Quine, we get this picture

07:02.640 --> 07:05.640
of, well, gosh, what?

07:05.640 --> 07:10.640
The web, I'm not too good at drawing webs.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.600
It's like a seal.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
It does look like a seal.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.600
Like a tiger striped seal.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.600
By the way, what's going on on campus today?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.600
I walked past camels to get here.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.600
Why are there camels?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.600
Yeah, they're camels.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.600
It's the Israel block party.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
Oh, okay.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
Right out there in front of the Martin Luther King Center.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.600
I had no idea what was going on.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.600
There's all this stuff near the main building, too.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
People handing out t-shirts.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.600
I don't know.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.560
Well, never mind.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.560
Talking about a framework of editing.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.560
There's this framework going on campus today.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.560
But anyway.

07:48.560 --> 07:52.560
Yeah, there's this sort of web of belief that it all hangs together in a certain sense

07:52.560 --> 07:56.560
in trying to explain experience.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.560
There's no one part we can isolate exactly the contribution it's making to the whole.

08:00.560 --> 08:06.560
Now, if we go back to this question about conventionalism,

08:06.560 --> 08:08.560
and we look for Quine's arguments about this,

08:09.520 --> 08:11.520
in a sense, as I said, it's a little hard to uncover

08:11.520 --> 08:13.520
because it goes into so much detail

08:13.520 --> 08:15.520
and there's so much being presupposed.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.520
But I think the core of it is something like this.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.520
What's wrong with the idea in logic

08:21.520 --> 08:23.520
that it is true by convention?

08:23.520 --> 08:25.520
Or for that matter, not.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.520
In the end, he says, look, we could say

08:27.520 --> 08:29.520
we established these conventions about me.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.520
And then logic follows from those conventions.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.520
Or we could say

08:35.520 --> 08:37.520
that, really,

08:38.480 --> 08:40.480
they're just general features of the world.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.480
Like things are self-identical.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.480
Or, you know, gosh.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.480
I'm trying to correspond to the law of non-contradiction.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.480
Reality is not contradictory.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.480
Something like that.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.480
Reality is consistent.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.480
And in the end, he says, there's no real difference

09:00.480 --> 09:02.480
between those two pseudo-doctrines.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
Now, why not?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.480
Well, really, to understand this,

09:06.480 --> 09:08.480
I think we have to go back to his paper Truth by Convention.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.480
And there,

09:10.480 --> 09:12.480
there's a lot of complicated stuff going on.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.480
But in the end, it comes down,

09:14.480 --> 09:16.480
I think, to a key move.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.480
How would we establish

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
conventions in logic?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.480
Here's a really simple convention.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.480
Universal claims

09:28.480 --> 09:30.480
imply their instances.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.480
Right?

09:32.480 --> 09:34.480
So we might say, here's a rule

09:34.480 --> 09:36.480
that the universe will quantify.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.480
In logical notation, we could put it this way.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.480
If for all x,

09:40.480 --> 09:42.480
a holds of x,

09:42.480 --> 09:44.480
then a holds of c.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
Let's say, for any constant c,

09:46.480 --> 09:48.480
we substitute for x.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
Okay?

09:50.480 --> 09:52.480
Or, to put it in English,

09:52.480 --> 09:54.480
we could just say, okay, everything

09:56.480 --> 09:58.480
is a.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.480
Therefore,

10:00.480 --> 10:02.480
that is a.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.480
And, that would be true for any

10:04.480 --> 10:06.480
that.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.480
Right?

10:08.480 --> 10:10.480
Okay, so now,

10:10.480 --> 10:12.480
there, I've tried to establish a certain convention

10:12.480 --> 10:14.480
that partially establishes

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
the meaning of all, or everything,

10:16.480 --> 10:18.480
or the universe will quantify.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.480
But now, Klein says,

10:20.480 --> 10:22.480
wait, I can't do that.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.480
What's wrong

10:24.480 --> 10:26.480
with saying, hey, I've just

10:26.480 --> 10:28.480
established a convention, that's part of the meaning

10:28.480 --> 10:30.480
of the universal quantifier

10:30.480 --> 10:32.480
of all, or every, in English.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
What's the problem

10:34.480 --> 10:36.480
with that?

10:40.480 --> 10:42.480
Can you rephrase that?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.480
Yeah, sure.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.480
He says, look, here's some card

10:46.480 --> 10:48.480
and other logical empiricists were thinking

10:48.480 --> 10:50.480
about this, and thinking of logic is true by convention.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.480
I established certain conventions,

10:52.480 --> 10:54.480
certain rules for my language,

10:54.480 --> 10:56.480
and maybe I do that by having a

10:56.480 --> 10:58.480
semantics for all,

10:58.480 --> 11:00.480
or for the universal quantifier,

11:00.480 --> 11:02.480
in a kind of formal sense.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.480
Maybe, I don't. Maybe I just

11:04.480 --> 11:06.480
introduce some rules like this. I say, that

11:06.480 --> 11:08.480
establishes the meaning. Or I could do it with

11:08.480 --> 11:10.480
am. I could say, here's what

11:10.480 --> 11:12.480
am means. We have ways of introducing

11:12.480 --> 11:14.480
am, so if I have the truth of a and b,

11:14.480 --> 11:16.480
I can then say a and b.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.480
And if I have the truth of a and

11:18.480 --> 11:20.480
b, then I can deduce

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
a, or for that matter, b,

11:22.480 --> 11:24.480
whichever I want.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.480
And I might say those introduction

11:26.480 --> 11:28.480
rules establish the meaning of a and.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.480
And I could introduce

11:30.480 --> 11:32.480
an introduction rule for the universal

11:32.480 --> 11:34.480
quantifier and say, there,

11:34.480 --> 11:36.480
I've given you the meaning of the universal

11:36.480 --> 11:38.480
quantifier. I've told you under what

11:38.480 --> 11:40.480
circumstances we can infer from something

11:40.480 --> 11:42.480
else. I've told you under what circumstances

11:42.480 --> 11:44.480
we can infer something else from it.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.480
And that's all there is to establishing the

11:46.480 --> 11:48.480
meaning. Now, Coins' way of saying,

11:48.480 --> 11:50.480
I can't really do it.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.480
There's something wrong with saying,

11:52.480 --> 11:54.480
in doing this, I've just established

11:54.480 --> 11:56.480
a logical

11:56.480 --> 11:58.480
truth.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.480
And why?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.480
Let's take

12:02.480 --> 12:04.480
a very simple example of one of these.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.480
Like,

12:06.480 --> 12:08.480
what's a good universal

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
claim? True of everything.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.480
Gravity

12:12.480 --> 12:13.480
is

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
universal.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.480
Yeah, everything

12:16.480 --> 12:18.480
exerts

12:18.480 --> 12:20.480
gravitational force.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.480
Therefore,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.480
you

12:28.480 --> 12:30.480
exert

12:30.480 --> 12:32.480
gravitational force.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.480
I want to say that's true just by

12:36.480 --> 12:38.480
virtue of logic. Okay, and why?

12:38.480 --> 12:40.480
Because of conventions.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.480
Specifically, this convention

12:42.480 --> 12:44.480
is what makes that true.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.480
Now,

12:46.480 --> 12:48.480
that seems plausible enough, right?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.480
But what have I done in going from

12:50.480 --> 12:52.480
this to that?

12:54.480 --> 12:56.480
Here,

12:56.480 --> 12:58.480
I have

12:58.480 --> 13:00.480
a of x.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.480
Here, I have

13:02.480 --> 13:04.480
exerts gravitational force, right?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.480
I

13:06.480 --> 13:08.480
substituted

13:08.480 --> 13:10.480
that to be a

13:10.480 --> 13:12.480
in both cases.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.480
Well,

13:14.480 --> 13:16.480
how, what enabled me to do that?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.480
What justified that?

13:18.480 --> 13:20.480
Yeah.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.480
The word everything?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.480
The word everything, yeah.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.480
And so, you might say,

13:26.480 --> 13:28.480
well, it's just a matter of everything, right?

13:28.480 --> 13:30.480
It appeals to some, well, and the mind says,

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
ah, yes, right, but wait a minute.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.480
Notice what else I did.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.480
I actually said, aha,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.480
this is saying this is true for every a, right?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.480
And so, I substituted

13:40.480 --> 13:42.480
exerts

13:42.480 --> 13:44.480
gravitational force in for the a,

13:44.480 --> 13:46.480
in both cases.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.480
But now, that was just

13:48.480 --> 13:50.480
a bit of, well,

13:50.480 --> 13:52.480
the very same,

13:52.480 --> 13:54.480
actually, in this case, yeah, the very same

13:54.480 --> 13:56.480
sort of

13:56.480 --> 13:58.480
logical, in other words,

13:58.480 --> 14:00.480
to get from my logical convention

14:00.480 --> 14:02.480
to any actual

14:02.480 --> 14:04.480
logical truth, I have to be willing

14:04.480 --> 14:06.480
to engage in a bit of logical reason.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.480
So, in other words, he says,

14:08.480 --> 14:10.480
I can't actually establish a convention

14:10.480 --> 14:12.480
without presupposing

14:12.480 --> 14:14.480
logic.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.480
In order to establish convention by doing

14:16.480 --> 14:18.480
this, or by doing this for

14:18.480 --> 14:20.480
conjunction, for example,

14:20.480 --> 14:22.480
I have to already presuppose

14:22.480 --> 14:24.480
some logic. I have to presuppose

14:24.480 --> 14:26.480
logic that says, oh, you mean I can

14:26.480 --> 14:28.480
substitute any sentence for a, and any

14:28.480 --> 14:30.480
sentence for b, and have this make sense,

14:30.480 --> 14:32.480
right? In other words, this is true

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
for all a and b.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.480
And so, I'm presupposing something about

14:36.480 --> 14:38.480
logic. And I'm saying moreover,

14:38.480 --> 14:40.480
think about what I'm saying in the rule. Ah,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
if you have both a and

14:42.480 --> 14:44.480
b, you can conclude a and b.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.480
I say, wait a minute.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.480
I already have to understand

14:48.480 --> 14:50.480
and to understand what it means to have both a

14:50.480 --> 14:52.480
and b, right? Similarly

14:52.480 --> 14:54.480
here, I said, if you've got a and b,

14:54.480 --> 14:56.480
then you can conclude a

14:56.480 --> 14:58.480
or b, whichever you choose,

14:58.480 --> 15:00.480
right? And I could also frame it by saying

15:00.480 --> 15:02.480
if you've got a and b, you can conclude a.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.480
If you've got a and b, you can conclude

15:04.480 --> 15:06.480
b. Both of those things are true.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.480
He said, wait, both of those things are true.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.480
To understand your convention, I already have to

15:10.480 --> 15:12.480
understand the meaning of both, and

15:12.480 --> 15:14.480
and all.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.480
And so, you can't give me those things by convention.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.480
I don't understand the conventions

15:18.480 --> 15:20.480
and how to apply them unless I already know

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
logic.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.480
So the central argument, as I see it,

15:24.480 --> 15:26.480
of his paper truth about convention,

15:26.480 --> 15:28.480
with respect to logic,

15:28.480 --> 15:30.480
is that the conventions

15:30.480 --> 15:32.480
or maybe, well, stating the conventions

15:32.480 --> 15:34.480
I think, but also applying the conventions

15:34.480 --> 15:36.480
presuppose

15:36.480 --> 15:38.480
logic.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.480
And so, they can't give you logic.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.480
They can't give you the logical truth.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.480
They can't specify the meanings

15:44.480 --> 15:46.480
of logical particles.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.480
You don't understand them unless you already

15:48.480 --> 15:50.480
understand the conventions.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.480
And here, I've done it in terms of

15:52.480 --> 15:54.480
syntax.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.480
In terms of, you know, actually

15:56.480 --> 15:58.480
saying what the rules are,

15:58.480 --> 16:00.480
but it wouldn't be any better

16:00.480 --> 16:02.480
if I did it in terms of meanings.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.480
In fact, how do we usually do that?

16:04.480 --> 16:06.480
People will say something like this.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.480
The truth value

16:08.480 --> 16:10.480
of A

16:10.480 --> 16:12.480
and B

16:12.480 --> 16:14.480
is truth

16:14.480 --> 16:16.480
if and only if

16:16.480 --> 16:18.480
the value of A

16:18.480 --> 16:20.480
well, actually, in this case

16:20.480 --> 16:22.480
it's often done

16:22.480 --> 16:24.480
to equal size, but I won't do it that way.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.480
The value of A is true

16:26.480 --> 16:28.480
and the value of B

16:28.480 --> 16:30.480
is truth.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.480
And notice what I've done.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.480
I've given you

16:34.480 --> 16:36.480
by convention the meaning of A.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.480
I'm assuming, of course, you already understand.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.480
And

16:40.480 --> 16:42.480
right?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.480
And it often goes this way.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.480
The truth value of not A

16:46.480 --> 16:48.480
is equal to truth if and only if

16:48.480 --> 16:50.480
well, here's one way to do it.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.480
The truth value of A

16:52.480 --> 16:54.480
is not equal to truth.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.480
You say, hey, I already have to understand not

16:58.480 --> 17:00.480
in order for that to make sense.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.480
Now, this is not a criticism

17:02.480 --> 17:04.480
of these symmetrical rules

17:04.480 --> 17:06.480
or a piece in tactical rules.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.480
It's not any objection to logic.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.480
It's just saying I can't understand

17:10.480 --> 17:12.480
these conventions about meaning or about

17:12.480 --> 17:14.480
use without already knowing

17:14.480 --> 17:16.480
some logic.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.480
You're defining the meaning of A

17:18.480 --> 17:20.480
in a background language that includes A

17:20.480 --> 17:22.480
or not, and well, that includes not.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.480
Or here, the defining universal

17:24.480 --> 17:26.480
quantifier

17:26.480 --> 17:28.480
in a background language where I already have to understand

17:28.480 --> 17:30.480
how to use the universal quantifier.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.480
Now, I can't be getting logical truth

17:32.480 --> 17:34.480
out of these conventions.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.480
I only can state the conventions that apply to them

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
by already understanding logic.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.480
Do these conventions always follow

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
things that seem to be logically true?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.480
It's never like a convention's established,

17:44.480 --> 17:46.480
then something follows

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
from that. It's the other way around, right?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.480
Like, that's what this is saying.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
That's what's quite the same. Right, exactly.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
It's not like we established the convention

17:54.480 --> 17:56.480
and then these things follow in logic.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
It's rather that we have to already

17:58.480 --> 18:00.480
know the logic to even state the convention.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
So what does that mean?

18:02.480 --> 18:04.480
Well, what he thinks what it means is that

18:04.480 --> 18:06.480
here would be a simple way of concluding.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.480
Ah, so logic isn't true by convention.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.480
Somehow

18:10.480 --> 18:12.480
stating conventions or applying conventions

18:12.480 --> 18:14.480
and so on would already

18:14.480 --> 18:16.480
presuppose logic. So conclusion,

18:16.480 --> 18:18.480
logic is not true by convention.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.480
Interestingly, he doesn't really say that.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
He says, I don't think

18:22.480 --> 18:24.480
it makes any sense to talk about logic

18:24.480 --> 18:26.480
as true by convention. So

18:26.480 --> 18:28.480
it's not so much he thinks the claim is false.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.480
He thinks it's unintelligible and we still

18:30.480 --> 18:32.480
have to ask why that would be true. Yeah.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.480
Can't you define them other ways

18:34.480 --> 18:36.480
like the truth tables that

18:36.480 --> 18:38.480
don't seem to

18:38.480 --> 18:40.480
imply or, you know,

18:40.480 --> 18:42.480
don't seem to presuppose anything

18:42.480 --> 18:44.480
or like that? Let's try that.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.480
Okay, so

18:46.480 --> 18:48.480
we have A, B,

18:48.480 --> 18:50.480
and then A and B

18:50.480 --> 18:52.480
and we're going to set up truth

18:52.480 --> 18:54.480
tables so I say, well, there are four possibilities

18:54.480 --> 18:56.480
here. These might both be true.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.480
A true, B false.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.480
A false, B true, both false.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.480
And now I'm going to say that

19:02.480 --> 19:04.480
A and B is true if and only if

19:04.480 --> 19:06.480
well both are true otherwise false.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.480
So I write a table like that

19:10.480 --> 19:12.480
and that seems to establish a convention

19:12.480 --> 19:14.480
that specifies the meaning of AND.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.480
Now have I in any sense

19:16.480 --> 19:18.480
presupposed the meaning of AND

19:18.480 --> 19:20.480
or other logical

19:20.480 --> 19:22.480
particles? I mean one thing I've

19:22.480 --> 19:24.480
posed right is

19:24.480 --> 19:26.480
universal character. You might say

19:26.480 --> 19:28.480
the schematic letters A and B

19:28.480 --> 19:30.480
already assume that I understand

19:30.480 --> 19:32.480
something about universal quantification.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.480
But have I in any sense

19:34.480 --> 19:36.480
assumed something of the meaning of AND here?

19:36.480 --> 19:38.480
Well, you wouldn't be able to write

19:38.480 --> 19:40.480
the truth values on the right side

19:40.480 --> 19:42.480
if you didn't know AND already meant...

19:42.480 --> 19:44.480
Well, that's true.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.480
Although

19:46.480 --> 19:48.480
yeah, one way of looking at it

19:48.480 --> 19:50.480
is to say, where am I coming up

19:50.480 --> 19:52.480
with these? I must not really understand

19:52.480 --> 19:54.480
if I'm going to do that. Now, of course

19:54.480 --> 19:56.480
I could say, no, no, no, I'm not doing that.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.480
I'm doing that in a purely formal way.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.480
In fact, I could say, given that

20:00.480 --> 20:02.480
there are two terms here

20:02.480 --> 20:04.480
I'm just interested in defining

20:04.480 --> 20:06.480
certain connectives with two

20:06.480 --> 20:08.480
truth values. There are 16

20:08.480 --> 20:10.480
different truth functions. And so

20:10.480 --> 20:12.480
I could really just be specifying all of

20:12.480 --> 20:14.480
those. And then once I've specified

20:14.480 --> 20:16.480
them all, I say, oh look at this one. I'm going to call that

20:16.480 --> 20:18.480
AND. And that's my convention.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.480
That's the convention about AND.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.480
And, you know,

20:22.480 --> 20:24.480
that might be fine. So others

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
we might have to think a while to realize

20:26.480 --> 20:28.480
what on earth is, if anything,

20:28.480 --> 20:30.480
that corresponds to a natural language.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.480
Yeah. Yeah, I think, but

20:32.480 --> 20:34.480
in this case, it's tempting to say

20:34.480 --> 20:36.480
what Quine does, because AND is part of

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
our language, and you kind of have

20:38.480 --> 20:40.480
to, you know,

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
understand what, it seems like

20:42.480 --> 20:44.480
you have to understand what AND is to fill out the table,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.480
but you can do something purely arbitrary

20:46.480 --> 20:48.480
with like a three,

20:48.480 --> 20:50.480
you know, something that takes in three inputs

20:50.480 --> 20:52.480
that has no analogy

20:52.480 --> 20:54.480
in our language, you know,

20:54.480 --> 20:56.480
it's just some arbitrary

20:56.480 --> 20:58.480
truth table that you can define by convention.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.480
Yeah, right.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.480
This is really off topic,

21:04.480 --> 21:06.480
but I can't resist

21:06.480 --> 21:08.480
telling you about one of my favorite connectives.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.480
This is post negation.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.480
Okay. Suppose we have

21:12.480 --> 21:14.480
three truth values, truth,

21:14.480 --> 21:16.480
indeterminacy, and falsehood.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.480
Well, a post negation,

21:18.480 --> 21:20.480
and I don't know

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
exactly how to write a post negation,

21:22.480 --> 21:24.480
so

21:24.480 --> 21:26.480
I'll just say post A.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.480
Is this? It's true

21:30.480 --> 21:32.480
if this is false.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.480
It's indeterminate if it's true, and it's false

21:34.480 --> 21:36.480
if it's indeterminate.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.480
So what it does is mathematically

21:38.480 --> 21:40.480
very interesting. It just rotates

21:40.480 --> 21:42.480
all the truth values one place, right?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.480
So it rotates it back

21:44.480 --> 21:46.480
like this one place, and so it's super useful.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.480
It turns out that

21:48.480 --> 21:50.480
in a many valued logic, this is

21:50.480 --> 21:52.480
a wonderful way of getting a functionally

21:52.480 --> 21:54.480
and complete set of connectives.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.480
But now,

21:56.480 --> 21:58.480
what does that mean?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.480
I mean, ordinary negation would be

22:02.480 --> 22:04.480
true if this is false, and false

22:04.480 --> 22:06.480
if that's true. Here it's indeterminate if that's true.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
And if A

22:08.480 --> 22:10.480
is indeterminate, it's let's say

22:10.480 --> 22:12.480
a borderline case of vagueness, for example,

22:12.480 --> 22:14.480
but this is just false.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.480
I can't think of what that means

22:16.480 --> 22:18.480
in English. I can't come up with any

22:18.480 --> 22:20.480
English equivalent. And as soon as

22:20.480 --> 22:22.480
you get to either three truth values

22:22.480 --> 22:24.480
or more than two

22:24.480 --> 22:26.480
positions here, it's very easy

22:26.480 --> 22:28.480
to come up with connectives where you say,

22:28.480 --> 22:30.480
well, I don't know how to say that in English.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.480
It doesn't seem to correspond to anything.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.480
With one or with two, it's not too hard.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.480
Usually it comes up with some

22:36.480 --> 22:38.480
English expression that captures the meaning.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.480
But a third truth

22:40.480 --> 22:42.480
value or a third term

22:42.480 --> 22:44.480
in the collection

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
here in that compound

22:46.480 --> 22:48.480
sentence becomes very easy

22:48.480 --> 22:50.480
to generate. So you could say,

22:50.480 --> 22:52.480
look, that's just arbitrary. Don't worry

22:52.480 --> 22:54.480
in other words about this part. That's

22:54.480 --> 22:56.480
something maybe we could just say, we

22:56.480 --> 22:58.480
arbitrarily filled out. Then we arbitrarily

22:58.480 --> 23:00.480
assign the word and to that meaning

23:00.480 --> 23:02.480
and thereby establish a convention.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.480
So I don't think this

23:04.480 --> 23:06.480
is going to be the source

23:06.480 --> 23:08.480
of the objection that the client would have.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.480
But is there another one?

23:10.480 --> 23:12.480
Yeah? So that post-negation

23:12.480 --> 23:14.480
thing, I know it's about topic, but like

23:14.480 --> 23:16.480
so what

23:16.480 --> 23:18.480
are there any institutions in the

23:18.480 --> 23:20.480
world that would apply?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.480
I don't know what use is it.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.480
What use is it? Well,

23:26.480 --> 23:28.480
because in a many-valued logic

23:28.480 --> 23:30.480
the way it's usually done,

23:30.480 --> 23:32.480
we introduce connectives in

23:32.480 --> 23:34.480
a kind of intuitive way and negation would be

23:34.480 --> 23:36.480
just true if this is false, false

23:36.480 --> 23:38.480
if that's true and then indeterminate like that.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.480
So that's a typical negation

23:40.480 --> 23:42.480
in a many-valued logic.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.480
But it turns out that

23:44.480 --> 23:46.480
when you do this in the kind of natural way

23:46.480 --> 23:48.480
introducing this third

23:48.480 --> 23:50.480
truth value of indeterminacy

23:50.480 --> 23:52.480
there are all sorts

23:52.480 --> 23:54.480
of truth functions you cannot express

23:54.480 --> 23:56.480
in that basic language. Because what happens

23:56.480 --> 23:58.480
is you get a fixed point at

23:58.480 --> 24:00.480
indeterminacy, for example.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.480
If all the inputs are indeterminate, the

24:02.480 --> 24:04.480
output is always indeterminate.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.480
And so in standard

24:06.480 --> 24:08.480
many-valued logics

24:08.480 --> 24:10.480
once you sort of hit indeterminacy

24:10.480 --> 24:12.480
you can't get out. And the same thing is

24:12.480 --> 24:14.480
true of determinacy. If all the inputs are

24:14.480 --> 24:16.480
indeterminate, the output is always

24:16.480 --> 24:18.480
indeterminate. So you can't actually

24:18.480 --> 24:20.480
define a truth function that takes

24:20.480 --> 24:22.480
determinacy into indeterminacy or vice-versa.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.480
And that's a real

24:24.480 --> 24:26.480
mathematical limitation of the system.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.480
You might think it's also a real

24:28.480 --> 24:30.480
meaning limitation since it seems

24:30.480 --> 24:32.480
as if we ought to be able to

24:32.480 --> 24:34.480
take indeterminate inputs

24:34.480 --> 24:36.480
and get a determinate output. For example

24:36.480 --> 24:38.480
if somebody says, oh, it's indeterminate that

24:38.480 --> 24:40.480
we ought to be able to actually

24:40.480 --> 24:42.480
then say, oh, that's true because

24:42.480 --> 24:44.480
all the inputs are indeterminate.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.480
And so it means

24:46.480 --> 24:48.480
that illogic has it standardly done. You

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
can't express things like

24:50.480 --> 24:52.480
it is determinate whether or it is

24:52.480 --> 24:54.480
indeterminate that and so forth.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.480
And so this

24:56.480 --> 24:58.480
is a way of letting you define all of those

24:58.480 --> 25:00.480
things. It's a very mathematically

25:00.480 --> 25:02.480
elegant way of letting you define them.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.480
It's also just a mysterious way

25:04.480 --> 25:06.480
of letting you define them from an English

25:06.480 --> 25:08.480
sort of human point of view. But that's

25:08.480 --> 25:10.480
why it's useful. How do you get to that,

25:10.480 --> 25:12.480
though? How do you just change it?

25:12.480 --> 25:14.480
How does that work?

25:14.480 --> 25:16.480
Well, in math you can do anything you want

25:16.480 --> 25:18.480
to. Just, you know,

25:18.480 --> 25:20.480
instead of saying, you know, you can just say,

25:20.480 --> 25:22.480
well, take a logic with or and

25:22.480 --> 25:24.480
and not define the usual way and then

25:24.480 --> 25:26.480
oh, add the post-connective

25:26.480 --> 25:28.480
and boom, you can now define anything.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.480
You can define, it is determinate whether

25:30.480 --> 25:32.480
or it is indeterminate that.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.480
Or it's definitely true, and I mean true

25:34.480 --> 25:36.480
and not false and not indeterminate that

25:36.480 --> 25:38.480
and so on.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.480
And so it's really useful.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.480
It just requires something that we can't

25:42.480 --> 25:44.480
assign a real meaning to in English.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.480
Yeah.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.480
So just going back to the original question.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.480
Yeah.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.480
We have several different systems of logic

25:52.480 --> 25:54.480
and you've just shown another one and

25:54.480 --> 25:56.480
you can define some logics in terms of

25:56.480 --> 25:58.480
other logics.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.480
So why doesn't that show that

26:00.480 --> 26:02.480
logics can be defined conventionally

26:02.480 --> 26:04.480
so long as the conventions are based on other

26:04.480 --> 26:06.480
logics? Like why can't you just kind of do a

26:06.480 --> 26:08.480
circle? Well, good question.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.480
There are a lot of contemporary logicians

26:10.480 --> 26:12.480
who think, yeah, logic is true by convention

26:12.480 --> 26:14.480
and indeed, you can see it

26:14.480 --> 26:16.480
as soon as you move to some of these other

26:16.480 --> 26:18.480
logics and you think what convention should

26:18.480 --> 26:20.480
we establish? In fact, just the idea

26:20.480 --> 26:22.480
that we could have more than two truth

26:22.480 --> 26:24.480
logics who think, ooh, what should we say

26:24.480 --> 26:26.480
that about and, about or, about not

26:26.480 --> 26:28.480
in such a logic?

26:28.480 --> 26:30.480
And it feels in many cases as if you're being

26:30.480 --> 26:32.480
asked to define certain conventions,

26:32.480 --> 26:34.480
not as if you're being asked to

26:34.480 --> 26:36.480
presuppose what you already

26:36.480 --> 26:38.480
mean or already do.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.480
And it certainly has that feeling

26:40.480 --> 26:42.480
when you are characterizing something like

26:42.480 --> 26:44.480
quantum logic or certain other logics

26:44.480 --> 26:46.480
for highly specific purposes.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.480
So it is a defensible position.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.480
But now, let's get back

26:50.480 --> 26:52.480
to the client's objection. How would he object to it

26:52.480 --> 26:54.480
there or here?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.480
It's not going to be on the basis of this,

26:56.480 --> 26:58.480
although that's very tempting to say

26:58.480 --> 27:00.480
yeah, look,

27:00.480 --> 27:02.480
it's in somehow filling that in

27:02.480 --> 27:04.480
that we're establishing a convention. Here it has

27:04.480 --> 27:06.480
that feeling strongly because this isn't capturing

27:06.480 --> 27:08.480
the meaning of anything we're presupposing. It's not like

27:08.480 --> 27:10.480
oh, come on, we were all using the post-negation

27:10.480 --> 27:12.480
all the way along, right? No, we weren't.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.480
But in this case, let's go back to this

27:16.480 --> 27:18.480
because it's a much simpler case and then we'll

27:18.480 --> 27:20.480
go back. Here,

27:20.480 --> 27:22.480
what is this first row of the table?

27:22.480 --> 27:24.480
How do I explain what's going on in the first row?

27:26.480 --> 27:28.480
I said,

27:28.480 --> 27:30.480
suppose A

27:30.480 --> 27:32.480
is true and B is true.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.480
A is true

27:34.480 --> 27:36.480
and B is true.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.480
A is true and B is false.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.480
A is false and

27:40.480 --> 27:42.480
B is true.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.480
Just in explaining what the table was,

27:44.480 --> 27:46.480
I used and, right?

27:46.480 --> 27:48.480
And I don't know how to avoid that.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.480
So I've already got

27:50.480 --> 27:52.480
and sort of built in here.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.480
That seems very odd because

27:54.480 --> 27:56.480
you could do all of those, do all the tables

27:56.480 --> 27:58.480
just as I said with just and,

27:58.480 --> 28:00.480
but and is not logically complete.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.480
Right.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.480
Which seems very strange, right? You can base it all

28:04.480 --> 28:06.480
on something not logically complete.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.480
All right, good, good, good, good.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.480
Yeah, notice what I, in this example

28:10.480 --> 28:12.480
and really with any of these where I use the schematic

28:12.480 --> 28:14.480
letters, it looks like, what am I presupposing?

28:14.480 --> 28:16.480
I'm presupposing something about universal

28:16.480 --> 28:18.480
quantification.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.480
Whether I stated explicitly

28:20.480 --> 28:22.480
or whether it's really just in the background

28:22.480 --> 28:24.480
by me using letters like A and B.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.480
And then here, do you even explain

28:26.480 --> 28:28.480
the row of the truth table? Before I get to this,

28:28.480 --> 28:30.480
I've got to be using

28:30.480 --> 28:32.480
and.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.480
And we've seen that here.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.480
I've got both A and B so I can do

28:36.480 --> 28:38.480
A and B, etc.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.480
I suppose

28:40.480 --> 28:42.480
you could argue, I've presupposed it then

28:42.480 --> 28:44.480
if both of these are true then

28:44.480 --> 28:46.480
that's true.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.480
So maybe I've presupposed

28:48.480 --> 28:50.480
if in that way. In fact, once I get

28:50.480 --> 28:52.480
to this, here I've

28:52.480 --> 28:54.480
just got A, right? So I'm not presupposing

28:54.480 --> 28:56.480
and, but I am saying if A is

28:56.480 --> 28:58.480
true then this post-connective

28:58.480 --> 29:00.480
applied to A is indeterminate.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.480
And so I seem to be

29:02.480 --> 29:04.480
presupposing if then.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.480
What about not?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.480
When we got to negation

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
it looked like I had to say something

29:10.480 --> 29:12.480
about not. I had to say

29:12.480 --> 29:14.480
not A is true if and only if

29:14.480 --> 29:16.480
A is not true.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
And so maybe I've presupposed not.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.480
But now if I've got all of that

29:20.480 --> 29:22.480
I do have a functionally

29:22.480 --> 29:24.480
complete set. So you're absolutely right

29:24.480 --> 29:26.480
that if I look at individual ones

29:26.480 --> 29:28.480
I'm not using all of those. I might

29:28.480 --> 29:30.480
depending upon the way I'm doing it

29:30.480 --> 29:32.480
be committed to let's say here

29:32.480 --> 29:34.480
all and and maybe if then.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.480
But that's not functionally

29:36.480 --> 29:38.480
complete. Only certain things are going

29:38.480 --> 29:40.480
to actually require negation.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.480
And then

29:42.480 --> 29:44.480
I'm going to end up presupposing the whole thing.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.480
If you did the entire

29:46.480 --> 29:48.480
if you did the truth table for the

29:48.480 --> 29:50.480
Shephard stroke to build an entire logic

29:50.480 --> 29:52.480
counter. Would you need

29:52.480 --> 29:54.480
all a logically complete thing to

29:54.480 --> 29:56.480
define it? That's a good question.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.480
Would you need the not? Let's do it.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.480
Let's do Shephard stroke.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.480
Which is the not A.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.480
Okay. So it means basically

30:08.480 --> 30:10.480
not both A and B.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.480
Well, if you've got both A

30:12.480 --> 30:14.480
and B it's false.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.480
Here

30:16.480 --> 30:18.480
you don't have both A and B. So it's true.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.480
And true and true.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.480
Okay.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.480
Now what did I presuppose in doing that?

30:24.480 --> 30:26.480
Well, I said

30:26.480 --> 30:28.480
if this and that then this.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.480
So I've got and and if

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
I've got the schematic letter.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.480
So I've got the universal.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.480
I never need the negation.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.480
I ever have to presuppose negation.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.480
Since this means not A

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
you'd think surely I did.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.480
But how?

30:50.480 --> 30:52.480
You might think it's already implied in the false

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
but

30:54.480 --> 30:56.480
not necessarily right.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.480
Because we don't have to think of false

30:58.480 --> 31:00.480
as just not true. And the possibility

31:00.480 --> 31:02.480
of many value logics indicates

31:02.480 --> 31:04.480
why we might think that's not right.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.480
But for example here I said

31:06.480 --> 31:08.480
if this is true and that's false

31:08.480 --> 31:10.480
then this is true.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.480
Didn't seem like

31:12.480 --> 31:14.480
I had to use negation there.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.480
Now in thinking about

31:16.480 --> 31:18.480
I did I had to think oh it means

31:18.480 --> 31:20.480
not both A and B. So

31:20.480 --> 31:22.480
here they are both true so

31:22.480 --> 31:24.480
if this is not true it's false.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.480
That went on in my head

31:26.480 --> 31:28.480
but in terms of actually just stating

31:28.480 --> 31:30.480
what the convention is I didn't have to do.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.480
So I think it's kind of interesting

31:32.480 --> 31:34.480
that I don't at least see why this presupposes

31:34.480 --> 31:36.480
not.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.480
Does it also presuppose truth values

31:38.480 --> 31:40.480
or would that not fit under there?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.480
Well yeah it does

31:42.480 --> 31:44.480
presuppose truth and false.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.480
So true and false

31:48.480 --> 31:50.480
get in here too.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.480
And I suppose you might say

31:54.480 --> 31:56.480
there's got to be someone there.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.480
Moreover if I've got false

31:58.480 --> 32:00.480
then actually can't I define not?

32:00.480 --> 32:02.480
Some people have tried

32:02.480 --> 32:04.480
to do that and said yeah

32:04.480 --> 32:06.480
not A for example

32:06.480 --> 32:08.480
is just if

32:08.480 --> 32:10.480
A then

32:10.480 --> 32:12.480
false.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.480
And so if that

32:18.480 --> 32:20.480
would work as a definition of negation then

32:20.480 --> 32:22.480
by having false in there I can actually already

32:22.480 --> 32:24.480
get negation out.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.480
But anyway I think it's a good question

32:26.480 --> 32:28.480
you're raising and something to climb

32:28.480 --> 32:30.480
in both of these papers just glides over quickly.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.480
Just like oh well

32:32.480 --> 32:34.480
the presupposes logic I can't get

32:34.480 --> 32:36.480
I can't state the convention, I can't apply the convention

32:36.480 --> 32:38.480
unless I've already got logic.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.480
But that's really sloppy.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.480
What I need depends on the nature of the convention

32:42.480 --> 32:44.480
right?

32:44.480 --> 32:46.480
And maybe in the end

32:46.480 --> 32:48.480
I need all the first order logic

32:48.480 --> 32:50.480
but maybe I don't.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.480
That's something that really has to be argued for.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.480
It's not just something to vaguely allege.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.480
So thank you for raising these questions

32:56.480 --> 32:58.480
and if it seems like I've gone off on a long logical

32:58.480 --> 33:00.480
regression here. Not really

33:00.480 --> 33:02.480
because the whole idea here is that

33:02.480 --> 33:04.480
in stating these conventions we're presupposing

33:04.480 --> 33:06.480
not just a little tiny fragment

33:06.480 --> 33:08.480
of logic but logic

33:08.480 --> 33:10.480
period and

33:10.480 --> 33:12.480
so it matters what we're actually presupposing

33:12.480 --> 33:14.480
to evaluate quite

33:14.480 --> 33:16.480
the time.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.480
Now

33:20.480 --> 33:22.480
let's move on to math.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.480
It's supposed to be okay

33:26.480 --> 33:28.480
to worry about the conventionalism

33:28.480 --> 33:30.480
of mathematics. Again he's not

33:30.480 --> 33:32.480
committed to claiming that math is true by convention

33:32.480 --> 33:34.480
but just that the question makes sense

33:34.480 --> 33:36.480
with mathematics.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.480
So

33:38.480 --> 33:40.480
before we guess that, maybe we should do physics.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.480
What's wrong with saying that certain

33:42.480 --> 33:44.480
things in law in physics are true by convention?

33:44.480 --> 33:46.480
Now nobody's going to want to say all of physics

33:46.480 --> 33:48.480
is true by convention.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.480
It's obviously an empirical science and there's a lot of

33:50.480 --> 33:52.480
experimental stuff and observation

33:52.480 --> 33:54.480
required but

33:54.480 --> 33:56.480
could there be certain things that are established just by

33:56.480 --> 33:58.480
convention? You might say

33:58.480 --> 34:00.480
for example in classical mechanics

34:00.480 --> 34:02.480
well let's say Newton's laws

34:02.480 --> 34:04.480
of motion. One of them

34:04.480 --> 34:06.480
is force

34:06.480 --> 34:08.480
is, I keep writing things low

34:08.480 --> 34:10.480
in the blank, force is

34:10.480 --> 34:12.480
mass times acceleration.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.480
Now is that

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
an empirical claim

34:16.480 --> 34:18.480
that requires observational backing

34:18.480 --> 34:20.480
or is it a definition of force?

34:22.480 --> 34:24.480
Is that something that we could say is true by definition?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.480
The definition.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.480
All right,

34:28.480 --> 34:30.480
suppose we say it's true by definition.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.480
Now what does that imply about certain other things?

34:40.480 --> 34:42.480
What's another physical

34:42.480 --> 34:44.480
law that involves force?

34:46.480 --> 34:48.480
Well for example, work is

34:48.480 --> 34:50.480
force times distance.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.480
Is that a definition?

34:58.480 --> 35:00.480
All right, so suppose we say it's

35:00.480 --> 35:02.480
true by definition. Then we've got

35:02.480 --> 35:04.480
work is equal to

35:04.480 --> 35:06.480
well gosh,

35:06.480 --> 35:08.480
distance times mass times acceleration.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.480
And presumably that now follows for our definition.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.480
That's just an analytic truth.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.480
Well what about this relationship?

35:18.480 --> 35:20.480
Kinetic energy

35:20.480 --> 35:22.480
is equal to one half m v square.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.480
Is that a definition of kinetic energy

35:26.480 --> 35:28.480
or is it an empirical claim?

35:34.480 --> 35:36.480
I don't know.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.480
Moreover,

35:38.480 --> 35:40.480
how about this?

35:40.480 --> 35:42.480
Momentum

35:42.480 --> 35:44.480
is mass times velocity.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.480
It's not very clear

35:46.480 --> 35:48.480
what I should take as definition.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.480
I might axiomatize physics

35:50.480 --> 35:52.480
in the way that I might axiomatize geometry.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.480
But the point is that

35:54.480 --> 35:56.480
it's sort of arbitrary which of these

35:56.480 --> 35:58.480
I take as definitions and which I take

35:58.480 --> 36:00.480
as actual

36:00.480 --> 36:02.480
empirical claims.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.480
And his point is, in a certain sense, physics

36:04.480 --> 36:06.480
stands or falls with all of these.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.480
It's not as if,

36:08.480 --> 36:10.480
well for example, I've chosen

36:10.480 --> 36:12.480
this example. Neutronian mechanics.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.480
In part because we now think this theory is wrong.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.480
Okay, we teach it to all our

36:16.480 --> 36:18.480
high school students. We teach it to people in

36:18.480 --> 36:20.480
intro physics classes in college.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.480
But it's false.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.480
Now why is it false? Well because

36:24.480 --> 36:26.480
the speed of light should really be in here.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.480
We need to distinguish between inertial mass

36:28.480 --> 36:30.480
and rest mass.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.480
And so forth.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.480
Now where's the falsehood?

36:34.480 --> 36:36.480
You might think, ah, certain of these things are just

36:36.480 --> 36:38.480
analytic. So the falsehood all has to be in the

36:38.480 --> 36:40.480
empirical claim.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.480
But that seems a screwy way of doing it.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.480
The fact is we have to just figure out

36:44.480 --> 36:46.480
and for example, this is one of the places we

36:46.480 --> 36:48.480
make some adjustments typically.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.480
And so if we

36:50.480 --> 36:52.480
start adjusting that in relativistic mechanics,

36:52.480 --> 36:54.480
you might say, well maybe that

36:54.480 --> 36:56.480
really wasn't a definition.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.480
Or you might say maybe our concept of energy

36:58.480 --> 37:00.480
has changed. Certainly our concept of

37:00.480 --> 37:02.480
mass has changed when we distinguish rest mass

37:02.480 --> 37:04.480
from inertial mass.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.480
So in a way here, Klein's point is just,

37:06.480 --> 37:08.480
it's not that it's unintelligible.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.480
It's just arbitrary.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.480
It's this

37:12.480 --> 37:14.480
great line that says asking

37:14.480 --> 37:16.480
which of these physical claims are really

37:16.480 --> 37:18.480
axioms and are really

37:18.480 --> 37:20.480
definitions is really

37:20.480 --> 37:22.480
kind of like asking which points in Ohio

37:22.480 --> 37:24.480
are starting points.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.480
And presenting the theory, I can introduce

37:26.480 --> 37:28.480
anything as a definition I want

37:28.480 --> 37:30.480
as long as it has the right logical form.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.480
And then other

37:32.480 --> 37:34.480
things will emerge as empirical claims.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.480
But it's really kind of arbitrary how you would do

37:36.480 --> 37:38.480
that. It's not like

37:38.480 --> 37:40.480
some of these are just obviously

37:40.480 --> 37:42.480
definitions and others are obviously empirical

37:42.480 --> 37:44.480
claims. So we adjust that with our

37:44.480 --> 37:46.480
presentation of the theory. Just as we do

37:46.480 --> 37:48.480
in geometry, what should we take as the

37:48.480 --> 37:50.480
axioms of geometry? Well,

37:50.480 --> 37:52.480
you could take all sorts of things as

37:52.480 --> 37:54.480
axioms of geometry and

37:54.480 --> 37:56.480
then derive other things as theorems.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.480
There's nothing about a certain kind of claim that

37:58.480 --> 38:00.480
just says, oh, that's going to be a fundamental

38:00.480 --> 38:02.480
axiom. What we take as basic

38:02.480 --> 38:04.480
is just a matter of how we present

38:04.480 --> 38:06.480
the theory.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.480
But Klein's point on the other hand

38:08.480 --> 38:10.480
is just that, look,

38:10.480 --> 38:12.480
in the end, when we change a physical theory

38:12.480 --> 38:14.480
it's not like certain things are analytically true

38:14.480 --> 38:16.480
and are off the table. We have to figure out

38:16.480 --> 38:18.480
how to adjust things in the theory. And some of the

38:18.480 --> 38:20.480
things in the theory we keep, other things

38:20.480 --> 38:22.480
we throw out, sometimes we take

38:22.480 --> 38:24.480
one notion and replace it with two notions

38:24.480 --> 38:26.480
and in short, draw a distinction we hadn't

38:26.480 --> 38:28.480
drawn before. And there's no way

38:28.480 --> 38:30.480
to predict which of these things are

38:30.480 --> 38:32.480
libel and empirical challenge

38:32.480 --> 38:34.480
and which ones are immune from that because they're

38:34.480 --> 38:36.480
analytic. Yeah.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.480
Do any of them have to be definitions or

38:38.480 --> 38:40.480
can they all be empirical?

38:40.480 --> 38:42.480
Yeah, they can all be empirical. We don't

38:42.480 --> 38:44.480
have to make any of them definitions, right?

38:44.480 --> 38:46.480
And in a sense, Klein's point is that in

38:46.480 --> 38:48.480
the end, yeah, that's really the right way to say it.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.480
I mean, if I'm writing

38:50.480 --> 38:52.480
a physics textbook and I want to present

38:52.480 --> 38:54.480
some as really just defining

38:54.480 --> 38:56.480
the term momentum, let's say, or defining this or

38:56.480 --> 38:58.480
that, then okay, I can do that.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.480
I can do that as a matter of my presentation.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.480
But that's a question of how

39:02.480 --> 39:04.480
I'm presenting the theory. It's not like

39:04.480 --> 39:06.480
something that is fundamentally true

39:06.480 --> 39:08.480
within each of the subjects. So

39:08.480 --> 39:10.480
for example, in thinking

39:10.480 --> 39:12.480
about actually every day in class

39:12.480 --> 39:14.480
how to come in and talk about what I'm going to talk about,

39:14.480 --> 39:16.480
I think, well, where do I start?

39:16.480 --> 39:18.480
But it's not as if

39:18.480 --> 39:20.480
I look at the subject matter.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.480
In this case, the Klein-Karab debate

39:22.480 --> 39:24.480
and just see, aha,

39:24.480 --> 39:26.480
there is the foundational question.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.480
I try to identify what I think

39:28.480 --> 39:30.480
the foundational questions are, but in terms of

39:30.480 --> 39:32.480
my presentation, where do I start?

39:32.480 --> 39:34.480
It's not like I look in and just find starting

39:34.480 --> 39:36.480
points in these debates.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.480
I have to think how am I going to structure

39:38.480 --> 39:40.480
this, how am I going to discuss it

39:40.480 --> 39:42.480
and explain it, and I pick a place to start.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.480
And in short, it would be like that.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.480
So it's not as if

39:46.480 --> 39:48.480
in the physics book we couldn't introduce any definitions.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.480
It's just that

39:50.480 --> 39:52.480
we're doing that as a matter of presentation,

39:52.480 --> 39:54.480
as convenience, not as a way

39:54.480 --> 39:56.480
of reflecting that there really is a distinction

39:56.480 --> 39:58.480
in the underlying physical claims.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.480
So I suppose in that sense

40:00.480 --> 40:02.480
it could be easily misconstrued.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.480
It would be in a way a bad idea

40:04.480 --> 40:06.480
in a physics book to say, ah,

40:06.480 --> 40:08.480
just true by definition of that.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.480
Because that sort of implies that it's

40:10.480 --> 40:12.480
really true about the claim

40:12.480 --> 40:14.480
rather than just by way of talking about it.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.480
And indeed, physics books generally

40:16.480 --> 40:18.480
don't. They're wise enough

40:18.480 --> 40:20.480
not to think, oh, this is a definition

40:20.480 --> 40:22.480
of force or a definition of kinetic energy

40:22.480 --> 40:24.480
or something.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.480
Now, we should

40:26.480 --> 40:28.480
end with mathematics.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.480
What makes this question

40:30.480 --> 40:32.480
intelligible for that?

40:36.480 --> 40:38.480
Well, all math adds to luck,

40:38.480 --> 40:40.480
as we saw last time, was that

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
and then other things that can be defined

40:42.480 --> 40:44.480
in terms of membership. All we need

40:44.480 --> 40:46.480
really is certainty.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.480
So,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.480
how can we

40:50.480 --> 40:52.480
introduce that? Now, here, Klein says,

40:52.480 --> 40:54.480
actually at this point we are

40:54.480 --> 40:56.480
doing something like

40:56.480 --> 40:58.480
leading by convention.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.480
Does my introduction of that

41:00.480 --> 41:02.480
actually presuppose sense?

41:02.480 --> 41:04.480
He thinks it doesn't.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.480
And so, I don't fall into the trap

41:06.480 --> 41:08.480
of logic falsification.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
On the other hand, neither is it purely

41:10.480 --> 41:12.480
arbitrary

41:12.480 --> 41:14.480
because after all, I'm not just

41:14.480 --> 41:16.480
dealing with a bunch of empirical claims

41:16.480 --> 41:18.480
in characterizing the world of sense.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.480
I'm not investigating the sense. It's like,

41:20.480 --> 41:22.480
ooh, there's a set of students in the room

41:22.480 --> 41:24.480
that study the scent.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.480
I don't do set experiments

41:26.480 --> 41:28.480
like that.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.480
Instead, what do I do? Well,

41:30.480 --> 41:32.480
I'm characterizing an idea that I'm

41:32.480 --> 41:34.480
in effect making up.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.480
So, what would I

41:36.480 --> 41:38.480
actually do?

41:38.480 --> 41:40.480
When I characterized that theory, we talked about this

41:40.480 --> 41:42.480
some last time,

41:42.480 --> 41:44.480
but today maybe we should do it a little more

41:44.480 --> 41:46.480
officially.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.480
Here is a principle

41:48.480 --> 41:50.480
that we tend to adopt.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.480
Extensionality

41:52.480 --> 41:54.480
and what it says in logical terms

41:54.480 --> 41:56.480
is that

41:56.480 --> 41:58.480
well, it establishes an identity

41:58.480 --> 42:00.480
criterion for sense.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.480
It says for any sense x and y

42:02.480 --> 42:04.480
x equals y

42:04.480 --> 42:06.480
if and only if for all z

42:06.480 --> 42:08.480
z belongs to x

42:08.480 --> 42:10.480
if and only if

42:10.480 --> 42:12.480
z belongs to y

42:12.480 --> 42:14.480
and so

42:14.480 --> 42:16.480
to put it in English

42:16.480 --> 42:18.480
sets are identical

42:18.480 --> 42:20.480
if and only if

42:20.480 --> 42:22.480
if and only if

42:24.480 --> 42:26.480
they have the same members.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.480
Now notice

42:34.480 --> 42:36.480
that in doing that

42:36.480 --> 42:38.480
I am certainly presupposing

42:38.480 --> 42:40.480
logic, right? I'm assuming

42:40.480 --> 42:42.480
you understand universal quantification

42:42.480 --> 42:44.480
and if and only if and something about

42:44.480 --> 42:46.480
well, actually identity is being defined here

42:46.480 --> 42:48.480
that's not being presupposed

42:48.480 --> 42:50.480
even though when I say it this way

42:50.480 --> 42:52.480
the same members might think

42:52.480 --> 42:54.480
it sounds like I am, but really

42:54.480 --> 42:56.480
I can characterize that just in terms

42:56.480 --> 42:58.480
of the if and only if and the all.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.480
So this is presupposing

43:00.480 --> 43:02.480
logic.

43:06.480 --> 43:08.480
Is it arbitrary?

43:08.480 --> 43:10.480
Well

43:10.480 --> 43:12.480
no, not really

43:12.480 --> 43:14.480
I mean I can treat it

43:14.480 --> 43:16.480
as a definition of identity with respect to

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
sets or I can treat it as a claim

43:18.480 --> 43:20.480
a substantive claim about the nature

43:20.480 --> 43:22.480
of sets, but

43:22.480 --> 43:24.480
the fact is it does feel like

43:24.480 --> 43:26.480
I'm establishing a convention that lays down what a

43:26.480 --> 43:28.480
set is. How is a set different

43:28.480 --> 43:30.480
from a property for example where this is not

43:30.480 --> 43:32.480
true? So it does have the

43:32.480 --> 43:34.480
feel of a convention. Now

43:34.480 --> 43:36.480
is it exactly a convention

43:36.480 --> 43:38.480
do I have to be a convention when I'm talking

43:38.480 --> 43:40.480
about it? Well no, I can argue

43:40.480 --> 43:42.480
that there is an underlying truth about sets

43:42.480 --> 43:44.480
and so forth, so he doesn't want to say

43:44.480 --> 43:46.480
this question is decided, but it's not

43:46.480 --> 43:48.480
absurd to say I'm establishing this by convention

43:48.480 --> 43:50.480
it's not really arbitrary

43:50.480 --> 43:52.480
because I

43:52.480 --> 43:54.480
do need

43:54.480 --> 43:56.480
I do need

43:56.480 --> 43:58.480
I do need identity conditions

43:58.480 --> 44:00.480
for sets and moreover

44:00.480 --> 44:02.480
it has the feel

44:02.480 --> 44:04.480
it's a stipulative definition

44:04.480 --> 44:06.480
remember

44:06.480 --> 44:08.480
stipulative definitions

44:08.480 --> 44:10.480
were ones that he thought actually

44:10.480 --> 44:12.480
do a set or something like an analytic

44:12.480 --> 44:14.480
plane. Why? Because

44:14.480 --> 44:16.480
I'm just saying let blah blah blah

44:16.480 --> 44:18.480
I introduce

44:18.480 --> 44:20.480
a term and I just define it in a certain

44:20.480 --> 44:22.480
way and I'm not trying to capture previous

44:22.480 --> 44:24.480
use it, I'm not

44:24.480 --> 44:26.480
introducing this in the context of a broad

44:26.480 --> 44:28.480
theoretical understanding, I'm just saying

44:28.480 --> 44:30.480
let this be that

44:30.480 --> 44:32.480
you know, let a metric space be

44:32.480 --> 44:34.480
blah blah blah blah

44:34.480 --> 44:36.480
and that defines a metric space

44:36.480 --> 44:38.480
I'm just introducing the term in that way, it's not like

44:38.480 --> 44:40.480
I have some previous concept on that, yeah

44:40.480 --> 44:42.480
but isn't the

44:42.480 --> 44:44.480
set

44:44.480 --> 44:46.480
symbol in the definition?

44:46.480 --> 44:48.480
the set symbol is in the definition

44:48.480 --> 44:50.480
oh, I see what you're saying, so wait a minute

44:50.480 --> 44:52.480
why don't I presuppose

44:52.480 --> 44:54.480
sets? This seems like twice as clear

44:54.480 --> 44:56.480
as the logic of why it would presuppose

44:56.480 --> 44:58.480
yeah, right

44:58.480 --> 45:00.480
what I end up doing

45:00.480 --> 45:02.480
is introducing a bunch of different

45:02.480 --> 45:04.480
axioms

45:04.480 --> 45:06.480
all of which are going to involve this symbol

45:06.480 --> 45:08.480
and so

45:08.480 --> 45:10.480
now I end up saying, yeah, really

45:10.480 --> 45:12.480
I can treat it as a definition of this

45:12.480 --> 45:14.480
but what about that?

45:14.480 --> 45:16.480
am I presupposing the sets in all of this

45:16.480 --> 45:18.480
by putting in that symbol?

45:18.480 --> 45:20.480
I think the

45:20.480 --> 45:22.480
claim is meant to be, no, I'm giving

45:22.480 --> 45:24.480
you a bunch of statements about

45:24.480 --> 45:26.480
that symbol and then that symbol

45:26.480 --> 45:28.480
is supposed to be defined as whatever those claims

45:28.480 --> 45:30.480
are true of

45:30.480 --> 45:32.480
but yeah, that's

45:32.480 --> 45:34.480
that's a doctrine

45:34.480 --> 45:36.480
called implicit definition, Russell's

45:36.480 --> 45:38.480
well, other people were fond of it actually

45:38.480 --> 45:40.480
at one point, Russell said it had

45:40.480 --> 45:42.480
all the advantage of theft over honest

45:42.480 --> 45:44.480
toy

45:44.480 --> 45:46.480
and so

45:46.480 --> 45:48.480
in a way, that's why Gwynne thinks

45:48.480 --> 45:50.480
look, it's a meaningful question but

45:50.480 --> 45:52.480
it would be possible to say

45:52.480 --> 45:54.480
can I treat it that way?

45:54.480 --> 45:56.480
his claim is that that isn't presupposed

45:56.480 --> 45:58.480
it's in part characterized by this

45:58.480 --> 46:00.480
you could do the same thing for logic though

46:00.480 --> 46:02.480
right, couldn't you do implicit

46:02.480 --> 46:04.480
definition and just call it

46:04.480 --> 46:06.480
implicit and say it's not presupposed

46:06.480 --> 46:08.480
it's whatever, yeah, yeah, well

46:08.480 --> 46:10.480
that's a good question

46:10.480 --> 46:12.480
unfortunately, we're past

46:12.480 --> 46:14.480
of time

46:14.480 --> 46:16.480
so, next time we'll think about that

46:16.480 --> 46:18.480
question and we'll look at Carnap's

46:18.480 --> 46:20.480
paper, empiricism, mathematics and

46:20.480 --> 46:22.480
ontology and see how he tries

46:22.480 --> 46:24.480
to avoid these problems
