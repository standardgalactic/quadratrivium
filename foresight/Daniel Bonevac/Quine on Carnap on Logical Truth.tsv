0	4000	Well, how was your spring break?
4000	6000	Too short.
6000	10000	Too short? Yeah, I know, I sympathize with that.
10000	13000	It's especially cool to come in here and find Spanish written up there.
13000	18000	It says, how long was your vacation? Did you have a good time? I was like, eh, too short.
18000	24000	But now, the reason I raised the question is not just to be friendly,
24000	28000	but also to make the point that there are a number of ways in which you might answer.
28000	31000	So, yeah, did you have a good spring break?
31000	34000	I said, yeah, you know.
34000	37000	Or you could say, no, bad things happened, right?
37000	44000	Went to Port Aransas, got hopelessly drunk up by mosquitoes and what do they call those things?
44000	46000	Portuguese men of war.
46000	48000	So, anyway, whatever.
48000	55000	The point is, could you ever say, oh, yes and no?
55000	57000	Alright, yeah, you could, right?
57000	61000	Aren't there times where you could answer a question?
61000	64000	Somebody raises a question like, how was your spring break?
64000	69000	And your answer is something like, well, yeah, yes and no.
69000	71000	Now, what are some examples of that?
71000	75000	Other than, how was your spring break?
75000	77000	Did you sleep well last night?
77000	79000	Good, did you sleep well last night?
79000	80000	Yeah, yes and no.
80000	83000	Now, what would that mean if you said yes and no?
83000	86000	Yeah, yes in one way, no in another way.
86000	88000	Ah, yes in one way and no in another way.
88000	90000	So, that's one way we can interpret this.
90000	93000	Yes in one way, right?
93000	95000	No in another way.
95000	104000	So, with the sleeping business, for example, what would it mean to say, yeah, did you sleep well last night?
104000	106000	Yes and no, yes in one way.
106000	107000	What's that way?
107000	112000	Suppose I follow up and I say, well, in what way did you sleep well?
112000	113000	Didn't wake up all night.
113000	114000	Didn't wake up, okay.
114000	116000	But is that in what way?
116000	117000	Not.
117000	118000	Bad dreams.
118000	120000	Bad dreams, okay, good.
120000	124000	So, there would say, well, you're not denying the law of non-contradiction, right?
124000	126000	There is a logical truth.
126000	134000	In fact, in some ways you might say it seems like the most basic logical truth, non-contradiction.
134000	144000	And so, we could formalize that as, you know, not, both P and not P.
144000	149000	And at first glance, answering a question with yes and no sounds like a violation of non-contradiction.
149000	156000	It sounds as if you're saying, oh, you know, the proposition I slept well last night is both true and false.
156000	159000	And yet you might say, no, that's not really what you're saying.
159000	163000	You're saying in one way it's true and in another way it's false.
163000	167000	So, I slept well in the sense that I didn't wake up.
167000	170000	I slept poorly in the sense that I had a lot of bad dreams.
170000	178000	Are there other sentences you might respond to with a yes and no part answer?
178000	180000	Are you married?
180000	181000	Are you married?
181000	183000	Ooh, yes and no.
183000	185000	Now, that sounds like a logical contradiction.
185000	195000	So, what might you mean if you say yes and no to, are you married?
195000	200000	If you're a sailor and you're married to the sea.
200000	207000	Okay, if you're a sailor and married to the sea, maybe if you're a nun and married to God,
207000	212000	where there's some special sense in which you're married but not the most obvious sense,
212000	218000	why don't you think of some other way in which somebody might respond that way?
218000	220000	An open marriage.
220000	221000	Oh, maybe an open marriage.
221000	222000	So, are you married?
222000	225000	Well, yes and no.
225000	229000	Yeah, that could be the sleazy yes or no.
229000	233000	Oh, I suppose somebody who's separated might respond that way to say, you know,
233000	238000	where it really means yes technically but not for very much longer.
238000	243000	Could there be another kind of response or another way in which you'd respond that way
243000	246000	and that means something?
246000	248000	Let's see.
252000	255000	I can hear a terrible spouse that cheats a lot.
255000	257000	Oh, yeah, are you married?
257000	259000	Yes and no.
259000	263000	Well, yes, but I act as a woman.
263000	270000	Yeah, actually yesterday, the revised common lectionary reading was this passage from the New Testament
270000	274000	in which Jesus talks to a woman at the well and shake this well.
274000	278000	And he says, well, go get your husband.
278000	279000	And she says, I have no husband.
279000	282000	And he says, oh, you speak truly when you say you have no husband.
282000	286000	You've had five husbands and a current guy is not your husband.
286000	292000	And so you could imagine him asking this question, so he married.
292000	299000	And the answer is sort of, well, yes and no, kind of common law marriage but non-physically married, that type of thing.
299000	306000	So anyway, part of the reason I mentioned these is some of these fit in one way in another way category, right?
306000	311000	But others refer to maybe different senses of the question.
311000	315000	Are you married, let's say, is the question.
315000	322000	And it seems like there, it's like, ah, married, what do you mean married?
322000	326000	Are you including things as broad as being married to the sea or being married to God?
326000	329000	Are you including common law marriage or just official marriage?
329000	336000	Are you referring to somebody who actually accepts the normal behavioral norms of marriage or not?
336000	337000	And so on and so forth.
337000	340000	So there might be all sorts of ambiguities around the word.
340000	345000	And so in that case, you'd say, well, it's not so much that proposition being true in one way and false in another way.
345000	350000	It might be just their different propositions being expressed there and you're sort of noting the ambiguity.
350000	358000	And the yes and no is to say, well, you know, if you mean this by your words, then the answer is yes.
358000	360000	If you mean that, it's no.
360000	362000	So we've now seen two ways.
362000	369000	There can be this sort of variance in ways or respects or something like that.
369000	378000	And then there can be this question of an ambiguity where we end up saying, well, really there are different senses, maybe, of the terms being used.
378000	382000	Different senses of what you've asked or of a proposition.
382000	391000	Are there any other occasions where we might be tempted to say that the law of non-contradiction fails?
391000	394000	That is to say, somebody seems to assert both P and not P.
394000	396000	Yeah, like time.
396000	399000	Like if we go back to the question, did you sleep well last night?
399000	404000	You could say, yeah, up till 2 a.m. and then no afterwards.
404000	405000	So you can say yes or no.
405000	406000	Oh, very good.
406000	407000	So it could be yes and no.
407000	410000	Yes, for a while, but then I woke up really early.
410000	416000	And so there could be a variation, not only in these ways, but in time.
416000	418000	So was it warm winter?
418000	423000	Well, yes, for much of the time, but not so much in the third week of March.
424000	429000	Friends in New England and Canada who have been sending me these photographs of three-foot snowdrifts
429000	434000	have been complaining about waking up at minus 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
434000	438000	Meanwhile, here it's 80 degrees and I send them pictures of a sunny field.
438000	441000	This is for the time of Texas.
441000	445000	But in any case, yeah, it could be differences in time.
445000	446000	Right?
446000	450000	Are there other sorts of ways in which you might be willing to say P and not P?
453000	462000	Well, let's frame it slightly different.
462000	467000	Because the law of non-contradiction says, well, this is a logical truth.
467000	470000	It is not the case that P and not P for any P, really.
470000	474000	So, you know, it's just not the case that it's both raining and not raining.
474000	477000	Incidentally, that might be a good example.
477000	481000	Could you ever answer, is it raining outside with yes and no?
484000	486000	Or a similar case.
486000	488000	Are these walls green?
491000	492000	Right?
492000	494000	So, that identifies another of these.
494000	500000	There are cases of just rains where we end up saying, look, when would I say yes and no to?
500000	501000	Is it raining?
501000	507000	And I don't mean time differences or I'm not claiming that this question about rain is ambiguous.
507000	510000	I'm not saying, well, one way it's raining and another respect it's not raining.
510000	512000	I really mean it's sort of rain.
512000	513000	Right?
513000	514000	Yes and no.
514000	515000	It's kind of raining.
515000	520000	It's like misting something like that where, yeah, drive around and your windshield will
520000	524000	get wet, but you don't really have the sense that it's raining and that kind of thing.
524000	525000	So, they're going to be faintness.
525000	527000	We're like, are these walls gray?
527000	528000	Are these walls green?
528000	530000	You might say, oh, yes and no.
530000	535000	Where you really need to sort of kind of, kind of on the borderline of that.
535000	540000	So, all of those are ways of saying something that looks like this but isn't really denying
540000	542000	a truth of logic, right?
542000	547000	Isn't really, because we'd right away say, well, what I mean to say is it's sort of raining
547000	553000	or here, yeah, I slept well in one way but not in another way or here, well, married
553000	560000	in the technical legal sense, no, but common law married, yes, or here, you know, slept
560000	563000	well up to 2 a.m. and then after that, not.
563000	567000	And so, there's no real contradiction being asserted.
567000	568000	Yeah.
568000	572000	What about in a question like, is light continuous?
572000	574000	Oh, is light continuous?
574000	575000	Good.
575000	578000	So, that seems to actually be yes and no.
578000	579000	Yeah, right.
579000	580000	Say a little more about that.
580000	584000	Can we assimilate it to one of these cases or is that a separate case?
584000	590000	It's, I'm not an expert in thinking, but from what I know, it seems to be a separate
590000	595000	case that light is both a particle in a way, so continuous and not continuous.
595000	596000	Oh, okay, good.
596000	601000	This is a case where you look at some things that are characteristics of this one class
601000	603000	and it has those characteristics.
603000	607000	You look at this, the characteristics of this other contrary class or you would have felt
607000	611000	contrary class and it has those characteristics too and you end up saying, wait a minute,
611000	613000	there's something very weird going on there.
613000	618000	So, there's one case and I'll just sort of refer to it as the case of quantum mechanics
618000	624000	because it's hard to characterize exactly what's happening with light or with various
624000	630000	other kinds of phenomena that occur in quantum mechanics, but those are cases where you might
630000	633000	say, actually, I don't know how to describe this, right?
633000	636000	I don't know if this violates the laws of logic or not.
636000	641000	Some people would propose a separate quantum logic that handles these kinds of cases.
641000	647000	And so, one thing we should note in thinking about what Kwan is arguing with Karnab about
647000	652000	really is to think about some of these alternative logics and think, where do people actually
652000	654000	disagree about the logic?
654000	659000	You might think that all these kinds of things aren't really reflecting logical differences.
659000	664000	Maybe this one does because if you think, wait, light is continuous and it's not continuous,
664000	670000	that seems to be a real direct denial of this in the sense that all these aren't.
670000	674000	Or at least it has that appearance of first glance and then you really have to get into the details
674000	678000	of the theory to understand what's being claimed and whether it's a real violation.
678000	683000	Well, there might be others.
683000	686000	What about paradoxical sentences like this sentence is false?
686000	691000	You might think, well, suppose it's true.
691000	693000	It says it's false, so it's false.
693000	694000	Suppose it's false.
694000	696000	It says it's false, so it's true.
696000	698000	So it's both true and false.
698000	701000	But if it's both true and false, it says it's false.
701000	702000	That's true.
702000	703000	But that's okay.
703000	705000	As I said, it was both true and false.
706000	713000	So maybe paradoxes are a case where you've got a real instance.
713000	715000	Now, most people have said, no, wait a minute.
715000	717000	A paradoxical sentence like this sentence is false.
717000	718000	There's something deviant about it.
718000	720000	There's something wrong with it.
720000	723000	I want to exclude it from consideration.
723000	729000	But notice we can't really say, well, what I meant to say was false yesterday, but it's true today.
729000	735000	Or what I really mean is, well, it's false, where that has several different senses.
735000	739000	Or it's true in one way and false in another.
739000	741000	I mean, it doesn't fit any of those cases, right?
741000	745000	So that too might be something that is a deeper challenge to this.
745000	746000	All right.
746000	749000	Well, quite in this paper.
749000	751000	And by the way, it's a difficult paper.
751000	755000	I had forgotten how difficult it was until I started reading it.
755000	760000	So I don't know if you actually made your way through it or if you did how much you were able to follow.
760000	768000	And it's no, don't feel bad if you either didn't read it at all or didn't get very far.
768000	774000	Or went through it and didn't feel like you understood much because he's assuming a lot of background in this paper.
774000	780000	But let's start with what Carnap is actually claiming that Quine is objected to.
780000	786000	I want to have this in the background because I wanted us to think about what a logical disagreement would actually be
786000	788000	and how we might begin to think about.
788000	790000	So I wanted some cases on that tape.
790000	794000	Well, let's think about Carnap's basic scheme.
794000	800000	He develops this initially in the logical structure of the world, then in the logical syntax of language,
800000	805000	then in a series of papers and books in the 40s.
805000	809000	And by the time Carnap is right, sorry, by the time Quine is criticized,
809000	815000	Carnap has a view that is still a version, although it's not exactly the same as the early version, of logical empiricism.
815000	817000	So what does that really mean?
817000	823000	It means there is a sharp distinction between the analytic and the syntax.
823000	828000	And we might phrase the question that he's dealing with you as,
828000	830000	what is the ground?
830000	832000	What is the source?
832000	833000	What is the nature of truth?
833000	834000	Where does truth come from?
834000	837000	What makes sentences true?
837000	843000	Now, depending on which of those you focus on, you're going to be led to maybe a different kind of theory.
843000	845000	But for the moment, let's don't worry about that.
845000	847000	What makes things true?
847000	853000	The answer is roughly, well, there's this distinction between the analytic and the synthetic.
853000	861000	And the analytic includes both logic and then truths by definition.
861000	863000	And what makes them true?
863000	871000	Well, the idea is, in the end, the synthetic truths, they're made true by the word.
871000	875000	And in particular, we come to know them by our experience of the world.
875000	879000	So here we can say, look, the ultimate ground of this is the world.
879000	885000	And moreover, we know it by virtue of our experience of the world.
885000	889000	So there's both the metaphysical question of what makes it so,
889000	892000	and then the epistemological question of how we know that.
892000	894000	But what about these cases?
894000	896000	What makes a truth of logic true?
896000	904000	What makes it true that it's never the case that both be anonymous?
904000	906000	Well, here's Karnab's answer.
906000	908000	It's, in the end, convention.
908000	910000	It's linguistic convention.
910000	917000	So what makes it true here is really language, in the sense that all bachelors are bachelors.
917000	920000	It's just true by virtue of the meanings of the term all and are.
920000	924000	We don't even need the meaning of bachelors there.
924000	927000	And we come to know that by knowing how to use our language.
927000	931000	But what's the ultimate source, you might say, of those linguistic truths?
931000	935000	Well, we operate with a certain set of conventions.
935000	941000	And so we've got a set of conventions about how we're going to use certain terms.
941000	943000	And the same is really true of definition.
943000	948000	It's a question of language.
948000	955000	And that's a matter of adapting to certain linguistic conventions.
955000	959000	So, Karnab's idea is some truths are made true of the world.
959000	961000	And we find out about them through experience.
961000	965000	Others are made true by our own linguistic conventions.
965000	968000	And we find out about them by learning our language.
968000	969000	Okay, that's all.
969000	971000	So something like this.
971000	973000	Well, we don't actually have to know what p is here.
973000	978000	All we have to know is the meaning of not and the meaning of a hand.
978000	982000	And we're good, okay?
982000	986000	That would require some empirical experience in a way.
986000	988000	Ah, here's the objection.
988000	991000	That would require some empirical experience.
991000	993000	Now, what kind of empirical experience?
993000	997000	Karnab's response is, well, yes, in the sense that you have to learn the language.
997000	1000000	You have to learn what linguistic conventions we adopt.
1000000	1002000	And that is a matter of experience.
1002000	1004000	We have to learn languages somehow.
1004000	1007000	We're not just born learning and knowing these languages.
1007000	1010000	And we have to learn all sorts of conventions about the use of language.
1010000	1016000	So some of them are things that might be involved in the meaning of logical terms like not and and.
1016000	1020000	Others might be involved in learning the meanings of terms like bachelor.
1020000	1025000	Some are matters of linguistic convention or social convention that go beyond this.
1025000	1031000	Like, I don't know, bumping into someone and saying, oh, excuse me, or I'm sorry.
1031000	1033000	And that type of thing.
1033000	1037000	And indeed, that's the kind of thing that can vary a lot culturally, right?
1037000	1041000	I mean, you meet somebody for the first time, what do you do?
1041000	1047000	Like, oh, you know, we're just meeting, so what do I say?
1047000	1049000	Hello, or how do you do?
1049000	1053000	Or, you know, nice to meet you or something like that, right?
1053000	1057000	It would be weird if somebody said something else, right?
1057000	1060000	You know, have you read Karnab?
1061000	1065000	Now, it could be that that works, right?
1065000	1069000	A bunch of philosophers are standing around a meeting in the American Philosophical Association,
1069000	1075000	and they're all talking about Karnab, and then some new person comes over and say, hey, have you read Karnab?
1075000	1079000	And so, you know, it's not necessarily weird, though.
1079000	1081000	It requires a special social setting.
1081000	1089000	If somebody just shows up at a party and is introducing their spouse and just says, you know, you say, oh, have you read Karnab?
1089000	1091000	That would be a reason out of the blue.
1091000	1095000	Anyway, we learn these kinds of conventions through experience,
1095000	1102000	but Karnab's idea is that once we've learned those, once we've learned to speak the language and learned those linguistic conventions,
1102000	1105000	then we know that a bunch of things are true or false.
1105000	1110000	So, all I need is to have learned these conventions, the conventions governing God,
1110000	1114000	and then I can say, okay, good.
1114000	1123000	Now I know that if somebody says P and not P, or answers a question with yes and no, I have to reinterpret, okay,
1123000	1126000	because it sounds like they're denying truths of logic.
1126000	1134000	And indeed, this goes along with his question about the issue anthropologically of whether there could be pre-logical people.
1134000	1139000	Levy Brewell and some others have claimed that certain tribes are pre-logical.
1139000	1147000	They go and translate the language and they're constantly saying things like yes and no, or like P and not P.
1147000	1153000	And so Levy Brewell said yes, logic is a sort of cultural achievement and there are pre-logical peoples.
1153000	1157000	And Kwan is making fun of the idea, saying, in the end that doesn't.
1157000	1159000	Well, actually, I shouldn't say that.
1159000	1164000	Really, Karnab, in a sense, makes fun of that idea because he says, well, they're there to translate the native speech
1164000	1174000	and they're going around saying P, I think in his example, it's P, Ka, Bu, P, and you translate that as and not.
1174000	1179000	If they go around saying that, how could you possibly be translating that as and not?
1179000	1189000	It's bad translation, okay, because it's great evidence that this word doesn't mean not or doesn't mean and if people go around saying P and not P.
1189000	1203000	Now, that said, the idea here, the background plot is where does truth come from and where does our knowledge of the truth come from?
1203000	1209000	Entirely from the world and from our experience of the world or from our linguistic conventions.
1209000	1215000	So all truth is either empirical truth about the world or it's merely verbal truth.
1215000	1218000	It's something that we, as a word, make up.
1218000	1224000	So, you could think, the realist says, you know, the world is independent of our thoughts.
1224000	1226000	The anti-realist says, no, it's not.
1226000	1232000	And Karnab's saying, well, this part really sort of is, but this part is not.
1232000	1238000	This part is something that is really governed by our own convention, our own ways of conceptualizing.
1239000	1243000	How much of language would Karnab say you have to learn empirically?
1243000	1254000	Because it seems like if you've learned A language, you could learn another language without any empirical basis purely from the first language, like translation.
1254000	1256000	Alright, that's a great question.
1256000	1260000	How much of a language do you actually have to have learned in order for this sort of thing to kick in?
1260000	1267000	We're going to see later some people who think that in order to really understand a concept, you have to understand all concepts.
1267000	1271000	And that implies you don't know the language until you know it completely.
1271000	1273000	But that seems absurd.
1273000	1275000	Like, nobody knows English completely.
1275000	1278000	There are 500,000 words of English.
1278000	1280000	Nobody knows all of them.
1282000	1287000	You might think, I'll read the Oxford English Dictionary in all, you know, in volumes and I'll know them all.
1287000	1290000	Well, no, you won't remember that many.
1290000	1293000	Your vocabulary can't possibly be that big.
1293000	1302000	And so you might think, well, look, if the answer is we have to learn the entire language, that seems unreasonable, how much do we have to learn?
1302000	1308000	And in particular, how much would we have to learn to actually understand the truth, like the law of non-construction?
1310000	1314000	Here is part of the challenge that Kwan has raised.
1314000	1319000	He's saying, well, look, in order to make sense of this notion, we have to be able to distinguish these truths.
1319000	1324000	And two dogmas is a paper about how it's impossible to draw that distinction.
1324000	1329000	But suppose we neglect that and just focus on the logical part.
1329000	1339000	The idea is supposed to be that we can draw this distinction and that the definitional truths ultimately reduce to these logical truths once we replace definitions with the terms being defined.
1339000	1342000	And so in the end, it comes back to this.
1342000	1347000	But really, now, what part of the language would we have to understand from that?
1347000	1352000	Well, I suppose I say it's not true that it's both raining and not raining.
1352000	1355000	I don't really have to know what it means to say it is raining.
1355000	1357000	I have to understand and not.
1357000	1360000	So the thought is there's a certain logical vocabulary.
1360000	1365000	And all that I really need for logical truth is that logical vocabulary.
1365000	1372000	Now then, later, to learn that bachelors are unmarried, for example, I actually have to learn the term bachelor.
1373000	1378000	But for the logical part, all I would really have to master is this logical vocabulary.
1378000	1383000	Now, in a sense, quite and quite I have to agree about what that is.
1383000	1385000	Well, more or less anyway.
1385000	1392000	You know, it's things like not and or if, what else?
1392000	1398000	Some, all, is.
1398000	1402000	But now we can ask what distinguishes those things?
1402000	1412000	What makes those different from terms like bachelors or light or married or raining or sleep, et cetera, et cetera?
1412000	1414000	We think we have lots, right?
1414000	1417000	Or we teach a theory of these words.
1417000	1421000	You might think, well, I want to take a class in the logic of sleep.
1421000	1423000	I want to know the logic of sleeping.
1423000	1425000	We don't do that, right?
1425000	1427000	We don't think of that as part of logic.
1427000	1432000	But how do we distinguish the logical vocabulary from the last one?
1432000	1434000	Well, there's going to be affirmations.
1434000	1441000	Some of them seem to be affirmations of what is denoted or what is stated.
1441000	1456000	For example, it's really, it seems to be more like declarations or, I don't know, it's like linking various singles together
1456000	1462000	or confirming it and declaring it or disaffirming it.
1462000	1464000	Ah, okay, yes.
1464000	1468000	Affirming or disaffirming, denying something?
1468000	1472000	Yeah, maybe it's not too far from what you're saying to think.
1472000	1474000	These are structural.
1474000	1477000	They're laying out a certain form if you think about the form of a statement.
1477000	1482000	So one way of thinking about this is, aha, these are formal in the sense they have to do with form.
1482000	1485000	They have to do with the form of what you're saying as opposed to the content.
1485000	1491000	So if you say all bachelors are bachelors, you have to know bachelor in order to understand the real content of that.
1491000	1495000	But the form is revealed just by the R, right?
1495000	1497000	Bachelors are bachelors.
1497000	1499000	You know the form is just A's or A's.
1499000	1503000	And that's something that you might think relates to form.
1503000	1507000	And what you mean by that could be spelled out in all sorts of ways.
1507000	1511000	But the thought is it has something to do with the structure of thought as opposed to its content.
1511000	1513000	So that might be one way of thinking about this.
1513000	1516000	As you put it, linking various things with content together,
1516000	1524000	it's the sort of links among content terms that are really revealed by the logical vocabulary.
1524000	1529000	Can you think of any other ways of trying to characterize what's different about those words?
1529000	1535000	And what makes us do logic of war for some in a way that we don't do logic of rain or sleep?
1535000	1538000	Yeah, seems harder to reduce those.
1538000	1542000	Like, I know there's a logic where you do it all with like two connectives,
1542000	1546000	but at a certain point it gets harder to reduce them as opposed to married.
1546000	1549000	You can kind of spell out what that means with other words.
1549000	1553000	Ah, well, okay, yes.
1553000	1560000	You might think that, look, in the end definitions, things like married, bachelor, rain, etc.
1560000	1562000	All of that you could ultimately explain.
1562000	1565000	But finally, you've got to get back to starting points, right?
1565000	1569000	And you might think that logic represents the ultimate starting points in some sense.
1569000	1571000	That everything else comes down to love.
1571000	1573000	They're not empirical claims of the world.
1573000	1577000	Like, life consists of particles that preserve the claim of the world.
1577000	1585000	But you might think that in the end, take out the world, knowledge, take out all this many definitions as you can.
1585000	1587000	You get led back to certain axioms.
1587000	1591000	And so that would be another way of thinking about this.
1591000	1597000	The question of sort of the ultimate axioms, the ultimate starting points.
1597000	1605000	Once we've abstracted away from world knowledge, once we've abstracted away from the meanings of specific terms that we can define,
1605000	1608000	we ultimately get back to these basics we just can't define.
1608000	1613000	And maybe you think logic is that theory of those basics, indivisible things.
1613000	1620000	So it might be a question of ultimate axioms, or it might be a question of ultimate indivisibles, something like that.
1621000	1629000	And when you see Bertrand Russell getting so excited with Scheffer's discovery that NAND, or NOR,
1629000	1633000	are themselves connectives that would allow you to define all the other sentential connectives,
1633000	1636000	you could think, yeah, why would this be exciting?
1636000	1640000	From this point of view, not really about exciting at all, but from this point of view, very exciting.
1640000	1643000	That you think, ah, got an ultimate symbol now.
1645000	1648000	Are there other ways of thinking about this book?
1651000	1657000	Oh, yeah, I'm getting to the bottom of the board, so some of you can't see it.
1657000	1663000	I've only been teaching for 37 years to realize nobody can see anything below about here on the blackboard.
1663000	1669000	Which is especially strange, because as a student, I always sat in the back.
1669000	1674000	I was just the kind of person who always gravitated to the far corner of the room.
1674000	1675000	I don't know why.
1676000	1680000	See, in this class, there's no point to me, because there's like no reason.
1683000	1685000	Well, here's the way some people have tried to do it.
1685000	1687000	They've said logic is topic neutral.
1690000	1695000	So let's say, I ask you, is it raining, and you say yes and no.
1695000	1697000	What are we talking about?
1701000	1703000	The weather. This isn't supposed to be our question.
1703000	1704000	Hard question.
1705000	1708000	Suppose I ask, so did you sleep well last night?
1708000	1710000	We're asking about your sleeping, right?
1710000	1711000	And so on and so forth.
1711000	1714000	The walls, green, we're asking about the color of the walls.
1714000	1719000	However, and indeed, green, gray, married, unmarried, raining, sleep,
1719000	1722000	all of those things have to do with certain topics.
1722000	1726000	But if I say, ah, I couldn't catch much of their conversation, they were too far away,
1726000	1731000	but I heard and used the term, and, what were they talking about?
1732000	1733000	Right? I can't say.
1733000	1735000	I can use these things all over the place.
1735000	1737000	They are topic neutral.
1737000	1739000	They're sort of universal things.
1739000	1744000	Think about playing cards that you might have, and, you know, in some sort of role-playing game,
1744000	1746000	this card is only useful in this very rare situation.
1746000	1748000	Hey, this one's useful all the time.
1748000	1749000	Okay?
1749000	1750000	Money is sort of like this.
1750000	1752000	The economy, money's useful all the time.
1752000	1755000	So it's topic neutral, you might say.
1755000	1759000	And a lot of people have tried to define the logical vocabulary that way.
1760000	1765000	Now, here is why Quine thinks all of this becomes really critical,
1765000	1768000	and why it's important to distinguish logic from other things,
1768000	1773000	partly to just make sense of this claim that logic is true by convention,
1773000	1780000	but partly also, well, to distinguish logic from mathematics.
1780000	1784000	What's the difference between logic and math?
1784000	1787000	In the end, Quine says, it's one thing.
1787000	1791000	It's the vocabulary of membership.
1791000	1794000	That's all you have to add to logic to get set theory.
1794000	1795000	Okay?
1795000	1798000	Or to get the vocabulary of set theory, I should say.
1798000	1806000	So, in a sense, he's concerned with this distinction between logic and set theory,
1808000	1813000	which introduces that, and set theory gives you the entire rest of mathematics.
1813000	1817000	He thinks that's what Russell and Whitehead and Fraga show.
1817000	1822000	And so, in the end, it's really just logic plus this that gives you math,
1822000	1827000	but logic seems to be what you get if you don't have the membership relation.
1827000	1829000	But now, how can we say that?
1829000	1833000	Because, after all, isn't this topic neutral?
1833000	1836000	Doesn't it reflect some sort of ultimate axiom?
1836000	1840000	In a way, that's what you do when you axiomize all of math in terms of set theory.
1840000	1844000	And then he takes card after we've shown in the logical structure of the world
1844000	1848000	that actually, with logic and set theory, I can now reproduce all of our language about the world,
1848000	1853000	not in the sense of getting the troops out, but being able to say what we want to say.
1853000	1860000	So, in the end, why do we say set theory, or why does Quine say set theory is not logic?
1860000	1863000	What's the difference between logic and set theory?
1870000	1874000	Well, this is a place where I think this paper gets hard to understand.
1874000	1878000	So, let's take a look at how he actually tries to structure this argument,
1878000	1884000	because the way the paper proceeds is sometimes confusing.
1884000	1890000	He grants, for example, that sheer verbal usage is, in general, a major determinant of truth.
1890000	1894000	And so, for example, Brutus killed Caesar.
1894000	1896000	Well, the Ides of March have just passed.
1896000	1897000	Too bad I am.
1897000	1901000	Too bad we were up for spring break and couldn't do this on the 15th.
1901000	1907000	But you might say, look, yeah, you have to know what Brutus and Caesar refer to,
1907000	1910000	and you have to know what killed means in order to assess the truth of that.
1910000	1913000	But you also have to know something about the world.
1913000	1916000	So, it's not as if here it's just the world, just experience.
1916000	1919000	It's really all of that, plus the conventions.
1919000	1925000	You need to know the conventions to know what's even being asserted before you can claim to know anything.
1925000	1930000	And the truth of a proposition like Brutus killed Caesar depends on the linguistic conventions
1930000	1936000	about meaning and reference, as well as on the truth of the world.
1936000	1938000	So, that's an important point.
1938000	1949000	But now, when we get to the key bit of the argument, we could say, well, yeah,
1949000	1954000	I thought it would be easy to appeal to my underlinings to make the structure of the argument clear.
1954000	1958000	Now that I look at them, it seems more difficult.
1958000	1963000	But, okay, here's one way we might try to characterize the distinction.
1963000	1969000	Every truth of elementary logic is obvious, or can be made so by some series of individually obvious steps.
1969000	1973000	Set theory in its present state anyway as other theories.
1973000	1982000	So, here we can say, yeah, in the end this gives amounts to a series of obvious steps.
1982000	1985000	Here, not so, okay?
1985000	1993000	Not obvious, not reducible to obvious steps.
1993000	1996000	Now, why does he say this, by the way?
1996000	2006000	What in set theory is not obvious?
2006000	2010000	Actually, who studied set theory here?
2010000	2013000	Some of you.
2013000	2017000	There are several things that are bothering you, I think.
2017000	2020000	Frege's way of approaching all of this.
2020000	2025000	In a certain sense, tried to reduce everything to the obvious axiom of abstraction, comprehension,
2025000	2031000	that just said, look, give me a predicate, and I can create the set of things that that predicate is true of.
2031000	2032000	Okay?
2032000	2034000	And then you get things like, is not an element of itself.
2034000	2037000	It all blows up in Russell's paradox.
2037000	2039000	So, you can't do the simple thing.
2039000	2043000	At that point, people attempt various non-simple things in set theory.
2043000	2046000	And we've talked a little bit about the most common way of doing this.
2046000	2049000	You end up with a bunch of different axioms.
2049000	2057000	One of which actually is an axiom of extensionality that says two sets are identical if and only if they have the same members.
2057000	2058000	Is that obvious?
2058000	2064000	Well, in a certain sense, you could say that does seem characteristic of a convention about what we mean by set.
2064000	2067000	That's what makes a set different from a property.
2067000	2071000	Two properties can be different, even though they apply to exactly the same things,
2071000	2073000	by creature with a heart and creature with a kidney.
2073000	2078000	But two sets are identical if and only if they have the same members.
2078000	2081000	So that, when you might argue, is a question of convention.
2081000	2085000	It seems obvious once you understand what we mean by set.
2085000	2090000	But now, what about, well, I've used this example before, the axiom of infinity.
2090000	2092000	There is an infinite set.
2092000	2095000	That doesn't seem obvious.
2095000	2097000	Hey, there is this infinite object.
2097000	2098000	There is this infinite set.
2098000	2099000	Why?
2099000	2103000	That doesn't seem obvious in the way that other things in logic seem obvious.
2103000	2104000	Or what about this one?
2104000	2111000	A restricted axiom of comprehension that says, essentially, well given a predicate and a previously existing set,
2111000	2117000	that I can talk about all the members of that previously existing set that satisfy the predicate.
2117000	2122000	So I'm always doing that sort of defining of the set within a background set.
2122000	2127000	You might think that's even more obvious than the original axiom of abstraction since it follows from it.
2127000	2129000	But actually, it feels like that's weird, right?
2129000	2131000	All of a sudden, it's now complicated.
2131000	2132000	And you might think, wait, why that?
2132000	2133000	But it's worse.
2133000	2137000	I now have to have axioms that say there are such things as pair sets.
2137000	2141000	So given an x and a y, I can form the set that contains just x and y.
2141000	2147000	And I have to have a power set axiom that says I can take the set of all subsets, begin the set.
2147000	2149000	And why do I have to do that?
2149000	2153000	Because those are things that aren't contained within some previously existing set.
2153000	2156000	So all of those have to be introduced as separate axioms.
2156000	2158000	Are they obvious?
2158000	2166000	And then eventually, people introduce an axiom of foundations that says, essentially, that there are no infinite descending epsilon chains.
2166000	2170000	That if I have a set, I can ultimately trace it back to atoms.
2170000	2177000	It's never like, oh, well, the set contains the subset, which contains the subset, which contains the subset, and so on, now, infinitely.
2177000	2181000	That is also going to imply that I don't have any loops.
2181000	2185000	So it's never the case that A belongs to B and B belongs to A.
2185000	2188000	That doesn't seem obvious, right?
2188000	2193000	And so a lot of these things end up seeming not obvious at all.
2193000	2196000	Now, for those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about,
2197000	2203000	I hope I've said at least enough obscure stuff to convince you that these things aren't obvious.
2203000	2210000	For those of you who know enough set theory, you can sort of say, OK, yeah, it does feel like there's a difference among the axioms of set theory.
2210000	2213000	Some feel pretty obvious, and some don't feel very obvious.
2213000	2221000	Some, I would have thought were obvious until you told me that, I mean, great danger of running into paradoxes, and now I'm afraid of everything.
2221000	2225000	So in short, there's that kind of difference between logic and set theory.
2225000	2228000	Is there any other kind of difference?
2239000	2244000	Well, here is a key part to Klein's argument.
2244000	2248000	He says, let's consider a logical truth, like everything is self-identical.
2248000	2252000	Everything is what it is, and not another thing, as Richard Butler once said.
2252000	2256000	We can say that it depends on the truth, fourth truth, on traits of a language,
2256000	2261000	specifically on the identity statement, is, and not on traits of its subject matter.
2261000	2268000	But we can also say alternatively that it depends on an obvious trait, namely self-identity in its subject matter, namely everything.
2268000	2272000	The tendency of our present reflections is there is no difference.
2272000	2278000	In the end, he says there is no difference between the two pseudo-nauthorians of saying these things are truths about the world
2278000	2282000	and the claim that these are truths by linguistic convention.
2282000	2289000	So in a certain sense, he's willing to say, look, there is a distinction here, but it's not the right distinction.
2289000	2295000	It's not the distinction between things that are true by convention and things that are true in some other way.
2295000	2302000	And if we get the line between that and that physics, that too is not a line.
2302000	2305000	We can distinguish it in the same sort of way.
2305000	2307000	Now, why not?
2307000	2310000	Well, here's part of the reasoning.
2310000	2315000	We want to say in the end, look, it's us that are responsible for these truths.
2315000	2317000	They come from our linguistic conventions.
2317000	2320000	These things, it's a question of the world.
2320000	2322000	But Kauai says, now, wait a minute.
2322000	2323000	Take a look at this.
2323000	2326000	Is it really just a question of the meanings of not an ant?
2326000	2331000	Or is it a matter that the world doesn't contain contradictions?
2331000	2333000	Similarly, with the law of self-identity.
2333000	2338000	Let's take that as an example, a second example of a logical law.
2338000	2341000	Self-identity.
2341000	2345000	So basically, for all x, x equals x.
2345000	2348000	Is that something that is giving us a truth about the world?
2348000	2354000	Or is that something that's just true by virtue of the meaning of identity?
2354000	2357000	He says, I don't know how to tell the difference between those two claims.
2357000	2358000	There's no real difference.
2358000	2360000	How would you decide?
2360000	2364000	Here is some of Kauai's underlying logical empiricism coming out.
2364000	2370000	He's rejecting a huge amount of a logical empiricist tradition.
2370000	2373000	But in this respect, he's still in the spirit of it.
2373000	2375000	He's still saying, what's the difference between the doctrine
2375000	2378000	that these things are true by virtue of the way the world is
2378000	2382000	and the view that they're true by virtue of the meanings of the terms?
2382000	2386000	Is there any way we can tell which of those it is?
2391000	2394000	Define a world.
2394000	2396000	My world.
2396000	2397000	Well, good.
2397000	2400000	If I include my linguistic conventions in the world,
2400000	2405000	then it looks as if, that's a really good point, right?
2405000	2409000	Linguists, amazingly enough, think that they're empirical scientists, right?
2409000	2412000	Because they're looking at the world, namely the linguistic conventions.
2412000	2414000	And that's part of the world.
2414000	2417000	And it would be very strange to say to the linguist,
2417000	2419000	oh, everything you're doing is a priori.
2419000	2421000	Although, actually, it often has that favor.
2421000	2426000	I mean, increasingly linguists do actually study corpus' bodies of text.
2426000	2428000	But for many, many years, linguists didn't do that.
2428000	2433000	They just sat around and thought about what was grammatical and what followed from London.
2433000	2437000	Empirical research consisted of Nick Asher running down the hallway in Wagner Hall,
2437000	2439000	saying, Daniel, what do you think of this argument?
2439000	2441000	I said, oh, it sounds good to me.
2441000	2443000	That was empirical research.
2443000	2450000	Now, people really do more of an empirical investigation of the way people use language.
2450000	2456000	But still, you might say, in the end, what's true or false in linguistics is a matter of convention.
2456000	2458000	So anyway, it's a good question.
2458000	2462000	What do we mean by the world and how do we distinguish the conventions from it?
2462000	2468000	The picture in Cardab is, aha, there's me, really, but all of us together.
2469000	2473000	We have these conventions we agree upon about the meanings of terms.
2473000	2475000	That sets a certain framework.
2475000	2480000	And then we go investigate the world, and we find out certain things,
2480000	2483000	and we find out what's true and false in this language we've created
2483000	2487000	beyond the merely logical truths that were sort of established by the framework itself.
2487000	2492000	So one way of thinking about the distinction in Cardab is that there are certain things.
2492000	2494000	And this will help lead us into next time.
2494000	2498000	We're establishing a certain framework for understanding the world.
2498000	2501000	It is, in part, a linguistic framework.
2501000	2504000	We can think of it more broadly as a conceptual framework.
2504000	2506000	We're crafting this framework to understand the world.
2506000	2512000	And part of it is a matter of sort of defining the framework, understanding what this framework is,
2512000	2516000	and then investigating the world using the framework.
2519000	2523000	Quine is basically saying, look, that's the wrong picture.
2523000	2526000	We come up with a framework as we investigate the world.
2526000	2532000	It's not as if we agree upon a language or agree upon this logical structure or these meanings,
2532000	2535000	and then we go find out what's true in the world.
2535000	2540000	It's rather that we're crafting our language, changing our language, expanding our concepts,
2540000	2544000	redefining our logic, maybe coming up with new things in mathematics and so forth,
2544000	2550000	all in an attempt to understand the world broadly speaking, including our linguistic behavior.
2550000	2554000	And as we do that, we come up with certain things.
2554000	2557000	We adapt by adding certain claims.
2557000	2562000	But now, if you say, well, wait a minute, what are the basic things?
2562000	2565000	What are the ultimate axioms or indefinables?
2565000	2571000	He'll say, well, it's a good question, and you can identify axioms in geometry and other views.
2571000	2573000	But it's sort of arbitrary.
2573000	2576000	It's not like there are certain things that are just intrinsically axioms.
2576000	2578000	You can axiomatize things in all sorts of ways.
2578000	2583000	Formal structure, how do I decide what's the form and what's the content?
2583000	2587000	It's an old distinction going back at least to Aristotle.
2587000	2593000	But I think quiet is challenging in a way, and saying, look, in the end, what I say has a certain content.
2593000	2596000	What is its form as opposed to the content?
2596000	2603000	It's a theoretical question, and I can get far in logic or in mathematics by thinking about form in this way.
2603000	2607000	But in doing that, I'm giving you a theory about my linguistic behavior.
2607000	2611000	And it's not separate from my theories about the world.
2611000	2614000	The same thing is true if I think about topic neutrality.
2614000	2619000	In talking about the world, I'm going to use certain terms much more often than other terms.
2619000	2624000	And so it is going to include things like not and or if some all is.
2624000	2628000	Well, what are some other really common things that would come up in language?
2628000	2633000	Let's say we're doing a word count frequency on a big database.
2633000	2636000	Okay, good. There are going to be lots of things that are really common.
2636000	2638000	What else?
2638000	2641000	And indeed, those do feel logical, right?
2641000	2644000	Hence the theory of indefinite descriptions.
2644000	2647000	Ah, good.
2647000	2650000	That's going to be really common.
2650000	2652000	We have is.
2652000	2656000	Another variance of the verb to be will be there.
2656000	2659000	But what are some other really common words?
2659000	2662000	You can often tell in a language because they're really short words.
2662000	2664000	But.
2664000	2668000	Oh, possessive. Yeah, possessive like so and so's, right?
2668000	2674000	The apostrophe s, let's say, or but or on.
2674000	2676000	What are some others?
2676000	2678000	Does, does, doesn't.
2678000	2680000	Does. Oh, yeah, does.
2680000	2682000	Right, right.
2682000	2684000	No.
2684000	2687000	No. Good.
2687000	2692000	Now, notice some of those feel logical, like no, but, ah, da,
2692000	2696000	but others too on other simple prepositions.
2696000	2698000	We don't have a logical on, right?
2698000	2701000	We don't have a logical to at least the way we ordinarily think of it.
2701000	2706000	And yet I can use those prepositions in a way that seems pretty topic neutral.
2706000	2710000	I can say, oh, he was talking about, about would be another good book, right?
2710000	2714000	We were talking about this or that was about this or, you know, this,
2714000	2717000	the book was on the table.
2717000	2721000	The top was on quantum mechanics, et cetera, et cetera.
2721000	2724000	So a lot of these feel pretty topic neutral too.
2724000	2728000	So in short, Quine is saying, actually, when we think about this framework,
2728000	2731000	it's not going to be that obvious how we distinguish logic.
2731000	2733000	Now, it's not as if we can't.
2733000	2737000	He, he's not somebody who says, so there's no such thing as logic or something like that.
2737000	2741000	But in a sense, it's part of our overall theory of the world to do that.
2741000	2746000	One way of looking at it is we draw these distinctions between analytic and synthetic,
2746000	2751000	between logic and definition, between all of that, and then things that require
2751000	2754000	experience of the world, between logic and mathematics.
2754000	2758000	But the ways in which we do it are driven by our overall theories.
2758000	2761000	It's not as if things come up philosophically pre-divided,
2761000	2764000	and then we fill in these categories in the way Carnot thinks.
2764000	2769000	It's rather we draw these distinctions as part of our overall theory of the world.
2769000	2772000	So at least the way I like to read Quine here isn't saying there's no difference
2772000	2774000	between logic and set theory.
2774000	2775000	He thinks there are differences.
2775000	2777000	No differences between those in physics.
2777000	2778000	There are.
2778000	2782000	It's just that all of that is defined within a certain theory.
2782000	2785000	It's not something that comes to us in advance of theory.
2785000	2789000	Well, next time we'll look at Carnot in empiricism, semantics, and ontology.
2789000	2792000	We'll take a look at some further details of Quine's arguments
2792000	2795000	as we look at Carnot's way of thinking about this and responding.
