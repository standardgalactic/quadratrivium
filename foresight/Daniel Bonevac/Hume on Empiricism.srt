00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Hi, I'm going to talk to you today about Hume's method.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,840
Hume is an empiricist par excellence.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,320
Locke, you might say, is one of those philosophers who has an idea, in theory of knowledge, empiricism,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,440
but he's trying to combine that with all sorts of other insights, and so he, for example,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,600
tries to prove the existence of God.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,560
He talks unapologetically about powers, about capacities, about causation.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,720
He does a variety of other things that later empiricists have thought are dubious things

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,220
to do.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,960
He develops an extensive political philosophy and other works where he talks about obligations

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,720
and rights, and a variety of other things that it's rather hard to reconcile with his

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,520
empiricist foundations.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,600
Hume is not like that.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,680
If Locke is somebody who is combining a bunch of different insights about a bunch of different

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,240
areas and trying to make them fit together in a complex philosophical framework, Hume

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,120
is somebody who has one idea.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,000
He takes over that idea from Locke of empiricism, and he says, I'm going to pursue that to

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,520
a bitter end, and that's what he does.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,340
So he finds out that all sorts of things have to be rethought.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,900
He doesn't take anything like our common sense conception of causation or obligation

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,080
or rights or anything else, really, and say, somehow we have to build that into the empiricist

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
framework.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Locke's mission.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,180
Hume instead develops a method and says it either fits or it doesn't, and if it doesn't

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,880
fit, out with it.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,640
So Hume is going to interpret empiricism rather differently, even though you might say, look,

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,560
his method is basically just Locke's, yes, but used in a rather different way.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,520
So his classic work is a treatise of human nature, and there is my well-loved copy of

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
it.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,400
Hume wrote that when he was only 23 years old.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,040
That's a remarkable masterpiece for someone who was so young.

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,640
Later he wrote a small book, The Inquiry, which was meant to summarize and publicize

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
this.

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,720
He wrote it with great expectations of having produced a great philosophical work, but then,

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,240
as he put it later, it fell stillborn from the press.

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,120
It didn't attract much attention.

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,080
Nobody paid any real attention to it at all, even to refute it, and it took a long time

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,880
for Hume to be recognized as a great philosopher.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,640
Even throughout the 19th century, he would have been viewed as somebody notable, but

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,240
not one of the true philosophical greats.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,120
Whereas on the contemporary scene in England and the United States, Australia, New Zealand,

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,760
in short, in the English-speaking world, he's viewed as one of the most important philosophers

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,360
in history, and a treatise of human nature is now viewed as one of the greatest philosophical

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,880
classics.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,920
With Hume outlines his method there, and we've talked about some of the basic elements, so

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm going to review them here just to remind you, because they're crucial to understanding

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,800
where that method is coming from and how it's being used.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
They're simple and complex ideas.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,320
The complex ideas are built out of the simple ideas, and they come from simple impressions.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,200
Moreover, they represent them exactly.

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,700
We build more complex ideas, often we stray very far from experience, and maybe from any

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,020
content at all, but at the level of the simple ideas, we've got a direct and exact match

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,780
to simple impressions.

53
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,660
So Hume says all our simple ideas in their first appearance have derived from simple

54
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,140
impressions, which are corresponded to them and which they exactly represent.

55
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:36,580
Those simple impressions are things that Locke would have referred to as sensations, or reflections,

56
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,860
that is to say, awarenesses of our own mental states.

57
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,140
This method, as we've seen, is to take things we think we know, but might just turn out

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,660
to be faith, or opinion, or even superstition, and try to figure out whether those beliefs

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,100
count as knowledge by tracing them back to their origins.

60
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,060
We trace the ideas that are part of that knowledge, or belief, and go back to where

61
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,460
we got those ideas.

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,780
We trace them to the origins and experience to find out whether this really counts as

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,340
knowledge, whether we have good evidence for our beliefs, whether any of those would

64
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,220
count as certain, and so on.

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,380
We want to understand which ones are really just opinion and which ones are knowledge.

66
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,420
Well, the empiricist method in general is inspired by that.

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,900
We take complex ideas, we examine the simple ideas they're made of, we find the origins

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,540
of those simple ideas and the simple impressions and experience that they come from, and here's

69
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:40,580
the idea, the content of the idea lies in those simple impressions from which it comes.

70
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,820
So we trace things back to what it, well, what gave rise to it, what it popped out of

71
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,060
in experience.

72
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,180
But there is a complication, even at that basic level.

73
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,820
It's partly because we abstract, combine, negate, disjoin, and do all sorts of other

74
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,300
things with our ideas that we can diverge far from reality.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,620
But it's not only that.

76
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,620
There are other problems as well, because our ideas are weak in comparison with impressions.

77
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,420
Even the simple ideas are weak in comparison with the impression itself, even though there's

78
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,420
the same content.

79
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,380
The content matches exactly, but the force and the vacity, as Hume puts it, are very

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,380
different.

81
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,380
He says all ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure.

82
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,460
The mind has but a slender hold of them.

83
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,260
There have to be confounded with other resembling ideas.

84
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,740
And when we have often employed any term, though without a distinct meaning, we're

85
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,460
up to imagine it has a determinate idea next to it.

86
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,020
So ideas are relatively faint, obscure, or weak.

87
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,780
And that's true even at the relatively simple level.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,060
If we think about ideas of colors, those ideas are fairly weak.

89
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,940
If I show you the impressions, it's easy to tell them apart.

90
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,460
I might show you two different shades of paint I'm considering.

91
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,100
And when I hold the paint patches up, you can very clearly discern the difference between

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,940
them.

93
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,540
And the impression, the sensation is very strong, it's very vivid.

94
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,060
You see that they're different.

95
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,060
But now, you forget their names, you go back to the paint store and you say, well, I know

96
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,220
I like that one better than the other.

97
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,900
But which one was it?

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,900
And you go and you look at the chart now and you say, maybe you have luckily the same thought,

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,660
but maybe there's no chart.

100
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,820
Maybe the guy at the paint store says, well, I'm sorry, we're all out of charts, but what

101
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,100
was the name of the paint?

102
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,580
And you suddenly go, I don't remember.

103
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,060
And you try to call it up your mind.

104
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,180
He says, well, was it this one?

105
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,660
I don't know.

106
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,180
I have the idea of that color.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,900
Maybe I can do remember the name or something like it, but the problem is I can't now distinguish

108
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
it.

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,420
If somebody says, yeah, all these things got mixed up and they're all mislabeled.

110
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,220
So is it this or is it that?

111
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,300
You may not know.

112
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,380
And maybe you've seen it, but maybe you no longer remember it.

113
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,860
The idea is weak in comparison with the impression.

114
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,580
The content's the same, but it lacks the same force.

115
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,260
It lacks the same velocity.

116
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,060
Well, impressions in contrast are strong.

117
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,660
When you're right there looking at the chip of paint, it's very prominent to you, right?

118
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
It's very strong.

119
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,340
It hits you hard as a word mentally, whereas the idea, the memory of it and so on, that's

120
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,140
much weaker.

121
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,980
So Hume says all impressions, all sensations, either outward or inward are strong and vivid.

122
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,060
The limits between there are more exactly determined.

123
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Or is it easy to fall into any error or mistake in regard to them?

124
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,620
I can tell the difference between the paint chips when I'm looking at them directly, but

125
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,660
trying to remember them later or just saying, okay, I remember one was called Belgian chocolate

126
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,180
and the other was called German chocolate and which was which and which one did I like

127
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,060
better and what exactly did that German chocolate thing look like?

128
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,660
I may not be able to remember that.

129
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,740
Well Hume's method then is to say, if I want to understand the content of my ideas, I have

130
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,140
to go back to the impressions.

131
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,300
I have to go back to what they come from in experience.

132
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,460
Now in the case of a paint color, all right, that's not too hard.

133
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,580
I know what impression that came from.

134
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,860
And so I can go back to that.

135
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,700
I know the idea was a content and not where, yeah, you're just making up that German chocolate

136
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
thing.

137
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
No, no, no, I saw the chip.

138
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,940
I know, I saw it.

139
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,940
I may not remember now exactly what it looks like, but I know I saw it.

140
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,140
But a lot of more abstract ideas are not like that.

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,060
A few years ago, somebody came and gave a talk in the English department.

142
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,540
And the main concept of their talk was the concept of hegemony.

143
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,700
There was an older professor in the audience who heard the talk and stood up at the end

144
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,460
to ask a question and said, I have a very simple basic question.

145
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,380
What is hegemony?

146
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,300
And the speaker didn't know how to answer that, didn't know how to give a definition.

147
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,180
And that's one of those things where you might say, well, okay, a lot of academic discourse

148
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
is like that.

149
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,020
A lot of things that go on in the university involve terms that are very abstract, very

150
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,980
far removed from experience.

151
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,820
It's not at all like, oh, that German chocolate color I saw at the Sherwin-Williams store.

152
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,100
No, it's like something else.

153
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
It is much more abstract.

154
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,540
And you might think, wait, what is the content?

155
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,540
I don't know.

156
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,100
Here's somebody who had written a doctoral dissertation on it and couldn't give a definition.

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,540
And so you might think, well, wait a minute.

158
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,820
I mean, if that person doesn't know what the content is, how am I supposed to know what

159
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,820
the content is?

160
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,860
Now, that's not to say that particular concept or any other particular concept is meaningless

161
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,460
or contradictory or absurd or anything.

162
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,060
But humans say, look, it's super easy in that kind of abstract discourse to start talking

163
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,300
about things without really having a clear idea of what you're talking about, to use

164
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,500
terms without any ideas that are so vague, we have no idea what their content is.

165
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,420
So to understand this kind of thing, we have to trace it back.

166
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,780
Now, a lot of early analytic philosophers inspired by Hume thought that philosophers

167
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,700
of their era, and often they were idealists, personalists, for example, around the turn

168
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,940
of the century.

169
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Or people like Heidegger, they attacked us using all sorts of meaningless concepts.

170
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,380
And indeed, a lot of those philosophers say things that are rather bizarre, absolute idealists

171
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,220
around the turn of the century were fond of talking about a world's soul, a soul of

172
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,260
a person that's already hard enough, but a soul of the world?

173
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,900
What does that mean?

174
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,340
What content could that possibly have?

175
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,540
Or Heidegger talks about nothingness, the nothing, as if that's an object.

176
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,100
I mean, what do you mean the nothing?

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,620
That's very strange.

178
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,660
Heidegger talks about the horizon.

179
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,860
Well, I think that actually does have a precise meaning, but it's not obvious what it is.

180
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,340
And so the analytic philosophers, look, I have a shirt.

181
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,300
I might have a personality, but do I have a horizon?

182
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,900
I don't know.

183
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,020
And he didn't mean, by the way, the physical horizon of where the earth meets the sky.

184
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,860
He meant something much more abstract.

185
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,220
So in short, you might say, I don't know what content these things have.

186
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,940
If they do have a content, I want to trace that back to experience.

187
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,780
So Hume often entertains a suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about.

188
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,860
And he says, when that happens, when we entertain any suspicion that a philosophical term is

189
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,780
employed without any meaning or idea, as is but too frequent, we need but inquire from

190
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,860
what impression is that supposed idea derived?

191
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,260
And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion.

192
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,980
By bringing ideas into so clear a light, we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute,

193
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,940
which may arise concerning their nature and reality.

194
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,100
So if somebody starts talking about some abstract idea, whether it's the nothing or

195
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,700
the horizon or hegemony or the world soul, Hume says, all right, look, from what impression

196
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
is this derived?

197
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,340
Okay, tell me what an experience generates this.

198
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,260
You've got an idea of a world soul?

199
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,620
Well, what do you mean?

200
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Where'd you get that idea?

201
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,820
So maybe, well, I studied Neoplatonism, well, where'd the Neoplatonists get that idea?

202
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,980
Come on, I mean, what do you mean?

203
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,380
It's hard enough to figure out what a soul of a human being would be.

204
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,100
I don't know what this even means.

205
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,460
So where's the impression?

206
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,700
What are you talking about in the end?

207
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,020
And later, pragmatists will adapt this to their own purposes, as we'll see, and start

208
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,860
talking about the cash value of an idea.

209
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,060
What difference does it make to practice?

210
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,940
Say there is a world soul, or say there isn't, who cares?

211
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,540
What difference does it make?

212
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,500
And you might say something similar here, but Hume means something more specific, not

213
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,120
just what difference does it make in practical terms.

214
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,740
He means trace it back.

215
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,220
Where inexperience did this come from?

216
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,260
And if you just made it up out of thin air without an experience to back it up to give

217
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,580
it content, I'm going to say it has no content.

218
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,500
Maybe of course it will turn out it has a content that's very different from what you

219
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
think it is.

220
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
You've lost the thread.

221
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,740
And so, yeah, it did mean something, but you know what?

222
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,380
That makes everything you're saying absurd, if that's the meaning of it.

223
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
So we've got to watch out for both things.

224
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,020
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

225
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,580
Maybe it means something really different, and you're misusing it.

226
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,500
Well Hume's method then is this.

227
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,340
We take our ideas and we're trying to figure out which ones are adequate, which ones actually

228
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,180
match experience.

229
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,340
So we trace them back to their simple impressions from which they're derived.

230
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,780
That's their real content.

231
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,860
Sometimes it will turn out we can't do it.

232
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,380
There is no real impression underlying this.

233
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,260
And so we end up saying this is just, you know, and maybe with world soul that's what's

234
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
going on.

235
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,300
There just is no content to that.

236
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,060
There is no impression underlying it.

237
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
We said, meaningless.

238
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,660
It doesn't mean anything at all.

239
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,420
Sometimes maybe it's contradictory.

240
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,660
We take apart the idea and we find out in the end it's not that it doesn't have any

241
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,340
corresponding impression.

242
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,220
It's that it has corresponding impressions that clash.

243
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,820
So in the end it looks like, gosh, it has a content.

244
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,540
But the content is sort of like round square.

245
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,500
It's something that is itself contradictory.

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,660
It makes no sense.

247
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,700
Sometimes it will turn out it does have a content, but it's not what we thought.

248
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,180
And so much of what we're saying about it turns out to be false.

249
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,380
So Hume will say, look at things like this, especially when you start entertaining this

250
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,100
suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about.

251
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
Say, look, what are you talking about?

252
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,300
Sometimes it's going to turn out to be nothing.

253
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,900
Sometimes it will be, well, something, but completely incoherent and contradictory.

254
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,220
Sometimes it just will be something surprising that isn't what they seem to be talking about

255
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,900
at all.

256
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,060
I want to go back to remind us quickly of what an empiricist thinks, because it brings out

257
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,900
another aspect of the method.

258
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,860
The question between judgment empiricists and judgment rationalists is the question of synthetic

259
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,620
a priori judgment.

260
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,420
Those other three categories everybody agrees about.

261
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,620
There are things that are analytic and a priori, synthetic and a posteriori.

262
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,460
Nobody thinks there's anything that's analytic and a posteriori.

263
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,220
The question is whether there can be anything that is synthetic a priori.

264
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,140
Something that's synthetic truly about the world and not just about language, but on

265
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,460
the other hand a priori, knowable independently of experience of the world.

266
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,500
The empiricist says, well, obviously not.

267
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,700
How could you know what the world without having experience of the world?

268
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,540
But the rationalist says, you can.

269
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,460
You can through reason alone, through reflection, through thought experiments, through things

270
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,100
like that.

271
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,500
The judgment empiricist says, yeah, I'm not going to believe that I can get anywhere purely

272
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,940
by examining my own mind purely through this idea of thought experiments and so on.

273
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,500
All that does is tell me about the relations of ideas inside my mind.

274
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,740
It doesn't take me outside my mind to the world.

275
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,420
That implies that from an empiricist point of view, there are only two kinds of knowledge.

276
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,700
All knowledge, assuming that there is any content at all to what somebody claims to know, it's

277
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,260
got to go back to one of those two categories.

278
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,820
It's got to be either analytic and a priori or synthetic and a posteriori.

279
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,340
Either it's an empirical truth about the world as natural sciences, that's the synthetic

280
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:12,940
a posteriori part, or it's analytic a priori in the sense that it is purely verbal, purely

281
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,100
a matter of logic, but in that way doesn't tell us anything directly about the world,

282
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,660
but still it's something knowable independently of experience.

283
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,700
Lots of things are like that from an empiricist point of view, at least from the point of

284
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:31,220
view of Hume and many other empiricists, logic is like that, knowledge on the basis of definitions

285
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,860
is like that, mathematics is like that.

286
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,780
So I can know that a bachelor is a bachelor, or that a bachelor is unmarried, or that one

287
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,980
plus one is two, purely on the basis of definitions.

288
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,980
I don't need experience of the world because they're not really about the world.

289
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,220
But anything that really is about the world, like there are more than a dozen chairs in

290
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,780
this room, that requires experience.

291
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:58,540
I can't know that just by reflecting on chairs and rooms, I have to actually have experience

292
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,060
of the room.

293
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,060
And that means that's synthetic and a posteriori.

294
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,180
I need experience to gain that knowledge of the world.

295
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,420
So there are two kinds of knowledge.

296
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,540
Basically there's a kind of knowledge you find in logic, in definitions, in mathematics,

297
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,740
in dictionaries, there's the kind of knowledge you find in natural science, history and other

298
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,180
things that are really describing the world on the basis of experience.

299
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,220
That's it, there's nothing else.

300
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,100
So what does that exclude?

301
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,780
Well we might take a look at various things that rationalists have called synthetic a priori

302
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
truths.

303
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,740
We've looked at this list before, so I'll just remind you a little bit of the kind

304
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
of thing here.

305
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,620
Avicenna talks about the whole being greater than the parts, or things equal to the same

306
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,220
thing being equal to each other.

307
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,860
For Descartes, I think, I am.

308
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,260
Nothing's made from nothing.

309
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,860
What's been done can't be undone.

310
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,460
Nothing could be and not be at the same time.

311
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,780
Could exist and not exist at the same time, but also, for example, could not be red and

312
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,180
green all over at the same time.

313
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,860
Leibniz, no fact without a sufficient reason why it should be so and not otherwise.

314
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,180
Kant, every event has a cause.

315
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,300
Seven plus five is twelve and every other mathematical truth, including the truths of

316
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,780
geometry, like between any two points lies one and only one line.

317
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,740
All of those are examples of synthetic a priori truths, and of course philosophers have

318
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,620
had their candidates, too.

319
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,500
Things like God exists, the soul is immortal, the world consists of substances and attributes,

320
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,700
the will is free, every substance has an essence, you ought to seek the good, happiness is intrinsically

321
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,860
good, courage is a virtue, and so on.

322
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,900
Well, if we take a look at all of these, you've says, and examine them and try to understand

323
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,900
where they're coming from and whether they're legitimate, we only have a few choices.

324
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,820
So he gives us a test for nonsense.

325
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,260
Hume says, when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make?

326
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,820
If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us

327
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,660
ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?

328
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
No.

329
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,060
Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?

330
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
No.

331
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,580
Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

332
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,500
So Hume is saying something rather remarkable here.

333
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,020
Commit it to the flames.

334
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,020
Either it's got abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number, in other words, it's got

335
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,540
logic and mathematics in it, in which case it's knowledge, it's analytic, it's not really

336
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,940
knowledge of the world, but it may be highly useful anyway, or what about experimental reasoning

337
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,500
concerning matter of fact and existence?

338
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
That's highly useful.

339
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,940
That's what natural science is in a different way.

340
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,300
It's what history is, political sciences, economics is, and so on.

341
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,940
All of those are really expressing truths about the world.

342
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,580
Don't think of experimental here as just within a laboratory.

343
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,740
Really it's a question of matters of fact about the world.

344
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,340
That's fine too.

345
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,220
But there are all sorts of other things that aren't like that.

346
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,300
So let's run down that list and find out what we do with them.

347
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Nothing has to be classified as either analytic or synthetic, or as utterly meaningless.

348
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
So we look through.

349
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,780
As empiricists, the whole is greater than its parts, almost certainly Hume would say,

350
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,780
that's analytic.

351
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,700
It's just a question of the meaning of whole in part.

352
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,740
Things equal to the same thing or equal to each other.

353
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,740
He said that's part of the meaning of equality, analytic.

354
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,380
Nothing's made from nothing.

355
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,700
Now that seems to be a claim about the world.

356
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,820
Nothing just pops into existence.

357
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,460
Nothing is made out of nothing.

358
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,500
Things have to be made out of other things.

359
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,980
If I'm going to have a factory that is going to produce some object, I've got to have inputs

360
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
to my factory.

361
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,140
I can't just say, Alakazam, and poof, it goes out of nothing.

362
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,020
But that seems like a claim about the world.

363
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:53,500
There's no conceptual absurdity about a magician or a wizard suddenly creating something out

364
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,860
of thin air.

365
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Could happen.

366
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,060
It's not incoherent in the sense of being logically contradictory.

367
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,540
So it's not an analytic truth that nothing is made from nothing.

368
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,300
It's a claim about the world.

369
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,660
So humans say, well, but look, it's pretty darn well established, right?

370
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,780
It's on the basis of experience.

371
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,500
We say that things don't just pop out of thin air.

372
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Things are made out of other things.

373
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,660
It's impossible for anything to be and not be at the same time.

374
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,940
Well, be and not be, it's part of the meaning of negation, that that's true, he would say.

375
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,120
What's been done can't be undone.

376
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,300
That seems to be a claim about the world.

377
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,260
After all, I can erase what I've written on a page.

378
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,180
Here we mean really go back into the past.

379
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,500
It's something like saying time travel is impossible.

380
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,860
Well, that's a claim about the world.

381
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,420
That's not just an analytic truth, and it can't be anything else.

382
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,540
It's a factual claim about the world.

383
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,540
Might turn out to be true.

384
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,140
Might turn out to be false.

385
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,500
Kurt Girdle showed that there are actually circular time loops that are consistent with

386
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,780
the axioms of general relativity.

387
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,540
So who knows?

388
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,340
Every event has a cause.

389
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,780
Similarly, that's a claim about the world.

390
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
Might turn out to be true.

391
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,860
Might turn out to be false if there are truly random events in quantum mechanics, for example.

392
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,540
But then we turn to the philosophical ones, and now Hume says, look, a lot of these might

393
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,460
turn out to be meaningless.

394
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
God exists.

395
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
That's surely not analytic.

396
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,140
It's a claim about the world.

397
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,620
Might be true or false about the world.

398
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,460
And does it even have a meaning?

399
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,060
We have to inquire into the content of the concept God, and trace that back to its origin

400
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
and experience.

401
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,780
Maybe we can do that.

402
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
Maybe we can't.

403
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,660
And so some empiricists have said we can, some others have said we can't, controversial.

404
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,860
So it might be a synthetic claim.

405
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,900
It might, on the other hand, be meaningless if you think that your concept of God is one

406
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,980
that can't be tied back to any kind of impression.

407
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,860
What about the soul is immortal?

408
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,820
Well, depends on this question of the soul, right?

409
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,900
I mean, mortal, that we can find the origins for an experience.

410
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
People experience death.

411
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,580
They see things die.

412
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,180
So that's not a problem.

413
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,260
We can negate the concept of being mortal and get immortal.

414
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,660
But what about soul?

415
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,020
Here we have to say, well, I don't know.

416
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,420
So that's why that was also controversial.

417
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,180
Maybe it's a factual claim about the world that there are such things as souls in the

418
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,420
world and that those things can survive death.

419
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,620
But on the other hand, maybe it's really meaningless if it turns out that we can't make any sense

420
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,980
of the idea of soul.

421
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,260
So once again, there's a place where we may or may not be able to use the empiricist method

422
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,820
to trace back the content of our concept of a soul.

423
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,940
What about the freedom of the will?

424
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,820
Well, it's the same thing in a way.

425
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,700
It's similarly controversial.

426
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,980
What do we mean by the will?

427
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,660
What do we mean by freedom?

428
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,100
Maybe we can make good sense of that, but if we can, that seems to be a claim about the

429
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,500
world and about this thing called the will.

430
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,220
But maybe we can't, in which case that's really a meaningless claim.

431
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,620
Maybe substance has an essence.

432
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:04,420
Again, this idea of a substance, well, Locke thinks we can trace that back to experience.

433
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,620
Hume and Barclay think we can't.

434
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,460
What about an essence?

435
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,620
Actually all of these empiricists after Locke tend to be suspicious of that notion.

436
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,140
Locke thinks we can make good sense of the concept of an essence.

437
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,860
Barclay and Hume deny it.

438
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,580
So we're going to see a sharp divide among empiricists on that one.

439
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,020
You ought to seek the good.

440
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,820
Well, we might worry that obligation or the good actually turns out to be meaningless

441
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,140
and we can't trace it back to experience in the right way.

442
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,380
So maybe that turns out to be meaningless, or maybe it's simply analytic.

443
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,260
That's how the good is defined, that which is worth seeking.

444
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,580
And then finally courage is a virtue.

445
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,020
Maybe that's just part of the definition of courage, but maybe it's a synthetic claim

446
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:52,220
about the world that in general it's a good thing to be courageous, or maybe we end up

447
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,140
saying courage or more likely virtue.

448
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,100
We don't know how to make sense of that in purely experiential terms.

449
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,820
So with all of these we apply Hume's method.

450
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,260
And sometimes we say, that's not synthetic a priori.

451
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,060
That's not a real truth about the world that we can only discover through reason alone,

452
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,020
but that, well I shouldn't say only discover, that we can discover through reason only without

453
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,940
experience of the world.

454
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:23,980
Instead we have to say either it's analytic, like holes are greater than their parts, or

455
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,980
it's a synthetic claim about the world, like you can't go back and change the past, or

456
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,620
it's something that's utterly meaningless.

457
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,060
So what if it's utterly meaningless?

458
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:39,260
Well Hume says quite figuratively, I hope, commit it to the flames.

459
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,620
Or more rationally you might say, don't pay any attention to it.

460
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,060
You can gain nothing from it.

461
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
It's meaningless.

462
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,500
It has no content.

463
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,780
So you will learn nothing from it.

464
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,740
You can gain no knowledge from it.

465
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,620
And lots of people talk nonsense.

466
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,820
You would say, look, this isn't a problem if people didn't talk nonsense all the time,

467
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,260
but they do.

468
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,140
And so hang around the university for a while, you'll find all sorts of people talking nonsense.

469
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,780
And it's not just in universities, tune into the media.

470
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,600
A lot of people are talking nonsense.

471
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,300
It happens all around you.

472
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,860
And it happens day to day.

473
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,880
It happens in almost every setting.

474
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,540
You encounter people, they start talking about things.

475
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,420
Sometimes those things are really things about the world.

476
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,740
You understand their content.

477
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,740
Maybe they're true.

478
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,740
Maybe they're false.

479
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,980
But sometimes they don't mean anything at all.

480
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,580
So Hume says, be on your guard.

481
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,100
And even though I am not going to tell you, commit anything to the flames, I think it's

482
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,580
a really bad idea, I will tell you there are things that you really should ignore.

483
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,380
And you should simply say, yeah, I'm going to learn nothing out of this.

484
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,620
Nothing good can come from this.

485
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
Thank you.

486
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
Bye.

487
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Bye.

488
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Bye.

489
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Bye.

490
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
Bye.

491
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Bye.

492
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,540
Bye.

493
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
Bye.

494
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
Bye.

495
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
Bye.

496
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
