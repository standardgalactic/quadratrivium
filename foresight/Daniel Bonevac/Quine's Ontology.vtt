00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
In any case, let's back up a little bit and try to understand what's going on on what there is and in this last section of order of knowledge.

00:10.000 --> 00:23.000
We've looked at one criteria of ontological commitment and he puts it in a logistical approach to the ontological problem by saying that to be is to be a value of a variable.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
Well, he says it more explicitly or at least maybe less dramatically, but nevertheless more intelligently.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
But I think it's the same criteria in some of the way it works.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
And he then says, well, I'm not telling you what there is.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm not trying to give you a theory of beating of what there is directly.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm telling you what a theory says there is.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And so we might say, here's the idea.

00:48.000 --> 01:06.000
A theory says there are a's if and only if it asserts there are a's.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
Or in logical terms, there is an x subject able to prove x.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Now, when you put it that way, it's almost trivial, right?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
When does a theory tell you there are certain objects?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Well, when it says there are those objects.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
And so when he puts it that way, it should be clear.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
He's meaning to say something that's kind of obvious.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
Okay, when does my theory imply the existence of sense data when it says there are sense data?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
When does it imply the existence of unicorns when it says there are unicorns?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
When does it imply the existence of attributes when it says there are attributes?

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
And so we look to things that we are willing to, well, quantify over in this sense, say there are such things.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Now, put that way, it sounds like a very obvious point, right?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
But then the question is, well, okay, suppose that is the criterion.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Notice it splits the ontological question in two.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
And that's something that isn't very obvious in the earlier work.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
It's something brought out by this reformulation.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
Because if we just say to be is to be a value of a variable, we think we're getting a theory of what there is, a theory of being.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
But if we say it this way, we realize there are really two questions.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
The first question is, okay, what does?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, actually, this is telling you what a theory says there is.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
So why don't we start with a prior question?

02:38.000 --> 02:49.000
It's really, what theory about the world should we adopt?

02:49.000 --> 03:00.000
And then secondly, what does it say there is?

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
In other words, he's really telling us what a theory claims about reality.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
What does a theory say there is in the world?

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
And so if we're asking what is there in the world, really trying to address the fundamental question of ontology,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
we have to ask, well, first of all, what theory should we adopt?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
And then secondly, all right, what does it say there is?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Now, let's look at that first question.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
What theory should we adopt?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We're trying to describe the world, right?

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, a project of metaphysics is in a way to talk about the structure of the world.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
It's structure in the sense of what ultimately exists.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
How we talk about other things in terms of what ultimately exists.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
How the mind relates to all of that.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
All of that is broadly speaking metaphysics.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
At the bottom, we've got this ontological question of what there is.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, in thinking about the world in this way, what sort of theory should we adopt?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Where do we start in thinking about this?

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
There are really only two options in Klein's view.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Really maybe three, I guess I should say.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
But what are our options for this question of what theory we should adopt?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Nominalism and realism?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, we could adopt specific metaphysical theories like nominalism and realism.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
But in a sense, he's asking a question that's even prior to metaphysics.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Prior to this question of what is real, like our attributes, universal forms, real or not.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
He's saying, look, I'm just trying to get a metaphysical theory of the world.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And to do that, I just need to start with some theory of the world.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I need to start with something that talks about the way the world is.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And forget philosophy for a moment.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It's not a question of starting with a philosophical theory.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
It's a question of just what are we, when we describe the world, what are we doing?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
He says science.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, okay, one option here is science.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
And indeed, that's his preferred option.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
He says, yeah, we start with our best scientific theory.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
And then we ask what that scientific theory says there is.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Well, that's one option.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Say, yeah, look, when we're really about the project describing the world, we do science.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And so we think science describes the world.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
And in his way of thinking about it, science is really, it's an old Aristotelian idea in a way.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Science is like a layer page.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
So this picture of science he's working with, and it's a very common picture,

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
is to say the most fundamental science, the one on which all the others rest, is physics.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Physics, exactly.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
So physics is the thing that ultimately tells us what there is in the world.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And then on top of physics, we build chemistry.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And then on top of chemistry, we build biology.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
And on top of biology, we build psychology.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And then on top of psychology, we build all the rest of the social sciences,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
things like economics, sociology, and so forth.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
And so if you have that picture of science, you're going to say, well, all right, yes,

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
we talk about, for example, income trends and social groups and things like that.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
But in the end, those come down to questions of psychology.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Those reduce to questions of biology, which in turn reduce to questions of chemistry,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
which ultimately reduce to physics.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
And so in the end, the way he talks about science, really,

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
it becomes a question of what his physics state is.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
So as Quine's thinking about this question, we really start broadly speaking with the language of science

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
and pretty quickly the language of physics.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I have a question about scientific language philosophers in general.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
When you read someone like Stephen Hawking, he explicitly admits that all these things he's talking about

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
don't necessarily really exist.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
They're mathematical models.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
When you're talking about like Einstein radiation or something like that,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
it's not like there's some entity there.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
This ground state fluctuations are a model to describe a phenomenon.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
How do these scientific language philosophers square their theories with that?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Great question.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
When we look at science, notice it's doing something,

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
well, at the higher levels, it may just be much of the time anyway,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
we're just systematizing things that we already think are there.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
But when we get down to these levels, science is postulating a realm of hypothetical entities,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
theoretical entities, that we don't have any access to in observation.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Things like microparticles, things like fields of certain kinds,

07:44.000 --> 07:53.000
or in string theory, strings, maybe in theories of additional dimensions and things like that, hyperspace.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
In the end, we've got certain objects, and indeed physics is quantifying over certain objects.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, what sort of objects?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And what do we say about those?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
There are going to be entities here, but now there are two attitudes you might have about them.

08:07.000 --> 08:16.000
You might be a realist who says, look, science says there are quarks, for example,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and that's our best scientific theory of the world.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
It asserts that there are quarks, so I have reason to believe there are quarks.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
And so the realist says the real objects, especially if he goes the path of flying here,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
the real objects are just the objects postulated by science.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
So in the end, what is there in the world?

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, there are things like quarks and electromagnetic fields, and positrons, and neutrons, and so forth.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
On the other hand, there's another attitude you might have towards science, an instrumentalist attitude,

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
which says, wait a minute, I'm postulating entities like quarks and fields and so on.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
But to those things really exist, I'm saying they're useful calculating devices.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
So one way of looking at it is the realist says, look, these basic objects of science,

09:02.000 --> 09:10.000
let's call them theoretical objects, the theoretical objects exist,

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
and the scientific theory explains what it explains if those things exist.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
But if they don't exist, there's something weird going on.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
You've got something that's really just a calculating device.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
The instrumentalist says, well, yeah, that's all it is. It is a calculated device.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
And so the instrumentalist says, wait a minute, this whole idea of answering science is not going to give us the right answer.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
What science does is hypothesize various things that might be behind the curtain to explain the appearances we have in the world.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
But don't think those things being postulated as being behind the curtain are the real things.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
They're just ways of calculating about the things we actually experience.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
So the instrumentalist is going to say, look, don't take physics or science in general as the right way to do this.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It's not telling you what they're all about.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, it seems like the realist would run into immediate problems with no light.

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
Science says it's a particle and a wave, and those things are mutually exclusive if you take it in a realistic way.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
We have to kind of view it as a mathematical, as an instrumentalist view.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And I think most physicists I've read seem to be more instrumentalists.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Right, lots of physicists are instrumentalists, partly because it's a way of avoiding carbon problems.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Like, are you saying that light is really a particle or is it a wave?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Is it some kind of weird combination of the two?

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Some people have introduced this sort of a waveical for it, right?

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
And the realist has to grapple with those questions and says roughly after quantum mechanics,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
yeah, this is what really is in the world.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You know what, the world is weird, man.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
The world is unbelievably dear.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
And indeed, the realist often says, yes, physics is describing the way the world is.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Ultimately, quantum mechanics is describing what the possible is in the world.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
It turns out it's weird.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
It doesn't fit our ordinary chemical words at all.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So it's very easy to go from this claim, a theoretical object,

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
so that the ones that really exist to say, look, the world is weird.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
And a lot of physicists want to say, hmm, I don't know if the world is really that weird.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
We've got a theory here that works really well, but it might be.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And indeed, if we think it's just a calculating device,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
does it have to give us a picture of what light really is?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It doesn't have to answer that question.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You can say it in certain respects, it's like a particle.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
In certain other respects, it's like a wave.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
We've got the famous two-slit experiments,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
and it's very hard to make sense of the intuitive terms.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
But from this point of view, good, we don't have to make sense of the intuitive terms.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
It's a mathematical theory, and it explains the appearances.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
And the appearances are kind of strange and surprising.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
But nevertheless, we don't take the object seriously.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Now, if we have this attitude, we're not going to say science is the path to this,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
and that's the theory, not the theory we're going to be interested in.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
What will we be interested in?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I mean, if we're instrumentalists about the objects introduced by science,

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
hypothetically, and theoretically, then what are we taking as fundamental?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
What we see.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
What we see, yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
So science is one option.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But there are other options.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
One option would be, well, experience.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
The objects of immediate experience.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So we've seen some philosophers who do that.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
Okay, Russell, for example, talking about sense data,

12:33.000 --> 12:41.000
or actually Karnam in the logical structure of the world,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
and arguing that you can reduce all talk of physical objects

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
to objects of immediate sensation, something like sense data.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
What's right before your senses at any given moment?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
He also argues in that book, you can do it the other way around.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
You can reduce talk of sense data to talk of physical objects.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And then he says, which should we take as primary?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Should we really think what there is in the world are physical objects?

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Or should we think, no, it's a matter of the contents of immediate experience.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It's sensations.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
And he ends up saying, you can do it either way, which is a little surprising.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
But he says, what's directly before the mind,

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
and so what's epistemologically prior, are the sensations.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So he favors actually going in the direction of the sensations.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
But he admits it goes both ways.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
And part of what's in the background, in object decision,

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
that last section of word and object, is that Klein assumes you know Karnam.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And Klein is basically saying, yes, you can go in either direction.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
But I favor, he says, going in the direction of taking physical objects as primary.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
But not ordinary physical objects like tables and chairs,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
necessarily in the end, the objects are hypothesized by science.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
He's aware that Karnam and Russell and others would say, no, no, no,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
go in this more instrumentalist direction.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
And that's going to lead me to say it's experience that's the fundamental

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
theory I don't worry about.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And my reports of sensations.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And he says, we could do it that way.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
But he thinks that our theory of objects in the world is just so well confirmed

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
and so explanatory.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Then he says, look, I know how to get through a day without referring to my own sensations.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't know how to get through a day without referring to people and tables

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
and chairs and other ordinary objects of experience.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
And so he ends up saying, I'd much rather trust talk of objects than talk of sensations.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
But there's yet another option.

14:32.000 --> 14:42.000
What other option could there be?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
When you talk about the world, sometimes you do science.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Sometimes you might be talking about your own experiences.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
But what do we do most of the time?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I say, tell me about this room.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
Do you immediately start saying, well, all right, let's introduce the wave function.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Our observations?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, you could be talking about our observations.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I mean, you could say, ah, tell me about the room.

15:08.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, I'm sensing grayly and greenly and clockly and camera-ly and people-ly.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
But you probably don't, right?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
What do you do?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Perceptimals.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
In other words, the objects of ordinary perception, right?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I look around saying, oh, what's in the room?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Sure, I'll describe the room for you.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
It's got tile on the floor and a bunch of desks and there are people in the desks

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
and it's got clock at the back and blackboards all around and so forth and so on.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And I tell you about the ordinary objects of experience.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And so you might say, well, look, one place to look is science.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
One place to look is the contents of experience in the sense of these sensations themselves.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
But another place to look is just our everyday language, right?

15:54.000 --> 16:02.000
So we can say, just look at natural language and our everyday uses of it.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
After all, we ordinarily confront the world not just by talking about our own sensations,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
not by doing science, but just by talking about stuff.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Go to lunch with somebody after class.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
But what are you going to talk about?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean, maybe you're going to talk about physics.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Except you say, whoa, check out that electron.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Maybe you're going to talk about your own sensations.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
I mean, I suppose that's actually plausible in certain settings.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
People talk about their feelings and all that.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But often, you're not talking about your feelings or other sensations.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You're not talking about physics.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
You're talking about things and people around you.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
And so that might be a place to start.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Now, the reason I mentioned that is that a lot of clients' effort in word and object

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
is to actually say, yeah, but don't worry about that.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
We can explain the kinds of things we talk about there.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
And if pushed to the wall, he ends up saying, well, anyway, they're not part of science,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
so I don't have to worry about them.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
But he doesn't start there.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
If he really started there, he'd just say, here's the language in physics.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And here's what it's telling us.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
He doesn't do that.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
He talks about attributes and propositions and facts and models and glids and all these other things.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And why is he doing that?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Because we talk about the natural language.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And he feels compelled to say something about what we really have to be committed to.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
Because he doesn't want to say that much of what we say is just false.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I say, well, I didn't see the light.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
There was this glint of a mirror, a neighboring car.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
And we don't want to be lying.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
The officer might not believe you, but the officer isn't going to say,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
yeah, listen, I've written word and object.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
There are no such things as glints.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
No, he's saying it's false.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
We want to be able to make some sense of that kind of talk.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
OK, so those are the options that are in front of us.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And then why, now, he doesn't really, although that's his ultimate position,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
he doesn't just jump there.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
He tries to actually say, look, most of the time,

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
we don't have to worry about the things that natural language introduces

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
in addition to the language of science.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
So what does science really commit us to in his view?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Two things in that, right?

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Well, two very broad categories of things.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
What are they?

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
What does science talk about?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
See, be brave.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Good physical objects, exactly.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm not looking for something deep like, oh, man, I forgot my hyperspace theory.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Yes, physical objects.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
OK, good.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
So yes, it talks about physical objects.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And what else does it use in talking about physical objects?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Abstract objects.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Abstract objects, exactly.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
It introduces specifically mathematics.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
And in the end, what does mathematics commit us to?

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, you might say all sorts of things, right?

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
Mathematical facts, numbers, functions, relations, spaces, metric spaces,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
monarch spaces, et cetera.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Here, we could give all those sorts of answers.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Groups, rings, fields, matrices.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, he just says it all comes down to what?

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
One logical and set.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Exactly.

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
It comes down to a theory of classes to use Russell's language or in more modern language sense.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Actually, there are some set theories that distinguish sets from classes.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
But for the moment, let's not worry about that.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
So in the end, we can build all of mathematics from that.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Now, in his early work, he is a novelist.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
He thinks it loves to get rid of this, OK, and just have physical objects.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It's the things that are there in the world.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But he can't figure out how to do it.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
In 1948, he is a novelist.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And in fact, he publishes a paper with Nelson Goodman

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
called Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
And it starts with a ringing declaration of nominalism

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
that there are no abstract objects.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And indeed, throughout much of his work,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
he's trying to get rid of abstract objects like propositions

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
and attributes and various other things.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
But in the end, he says, look, I don't know how to do without mathematics in science.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
And mathematics seems to commit me to classes,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
and I don't know how to get rid of them.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Now, Russell, in 1908, was convinced that classes were just a logical fiction

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
that he could get rid of them.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
That's part of the project of Principia Mathemica.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
But in the end, he couldn't do it.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Why does it turn out to be hard?

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
Why can't you just say, ah, come on, classes of objects, sets of objects.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
We're just talking about the objects.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
I could say, yes, consider the set of people in this room.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
You might think, I'm just talking about the people in the room, right?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
It's not like how many things are in the room.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Oh, there are these people.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
And then, oh, I forgot the set of people in the room, too.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And so there's a powerful intuition that, look,

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
sets are just a ways of talking about the things in them.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
And Frege and Russell start with that idea.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
But it turns out to be harder to make sense of that than you might think.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Here's why.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
We could say, all right, suppose we're talking about the set of A's.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
We think there are such things, maybe.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
And so I want to talk about the set of all the X's, such that A is true of X.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
You might think, look, it's very easy to explain my talk that way.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
What does it mean to talk about the set of objects that are A's?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
This is just the set of A's, right?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Well, I've introduced that term.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
And it turns out to be a very useful thing to do in math and in various other contexts.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
What could I mean by that?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Well, you might think, oh, it's very easy.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I just have to worry about element to it.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
In fact, in the end, in mathematics, all I really need is this one symbol

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
in addition to logic, is a member of.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And so you might think, I can explain this very easily.

22:24.000 --> 22:37.000
Y is a member of this set of X's, such that A of X, if and only if A holds true of Y.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
So let's say I'm talking about the set of people in the room.

22:40.000 --> 22:46.000
Y belongs to the set of people in the room, if and only if Y is a person in the room.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
Y belongs to the set of green things, if and only if Y is green.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
Y belongs to the set of novelists, if and only if Y is a novelist, et cetera.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
And so you might think, great, here I'm talking about sets, right?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I seem to be committed to sets.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But over here, I'm not.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
I'm just talking about the Y's, whatever they are.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And I'm not talking about sets anymore.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
And so if I could make that work, I could just say, see,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
look, classes are just logical fictions.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
They're just constructions out of the objects they're classes of.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
And so actually, I could just get by with the physical objects.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
Well, this is, in fact, the way we explain that notation.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
And so can't we be happy and say, oh, there it is.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
We can get rid of this talk of classes.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Silly quine.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
We don't need.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
We don't need no stinking classes.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
No fans of the treasure of the Sierra Landry here.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Well, it was on TV the other night.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Forgive me.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Anyway, now I feel we need to explain this.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
These bandidos come up, and Humphrey Bogart and the others

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
are trying to fight them off.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
They claim to be federales, and they don't believe them.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
And Humphrey Bogart says, if you're federales, show me your badges.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
They say, badges?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
We don't need no stinking badges.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I think the Mel Brooks version better, Blazing Saddle.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Oh.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Yeah.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Sorry.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
It's quite not that good.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah, no.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
They're recruiting all the bandits to raid the town,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and the bandidos come up, and they're like, all right, you know,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
here are your badges, and they laugh at you.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
We don't need no stinking badges.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Very good.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
So yes, you have the normalist's sets, and the normalist's sets.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I don't need no stinking sets.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
All right.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
And now here's the way to get rid of them.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
But what's wrong with this?

24:38.000 --> 24:49.000
Oh, come on.

24:49.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah, this is called Russell's Paradox.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It devastated poor Frank.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Frank was all excited about his theory.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Here it is.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
And then Russell writes him like a two-page letter in which he says,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
oh, you know, wonderful work.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
There's one problem.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's all inconsistent.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
And here's the problem.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Consider the class of all classes that are not members themselves.

25:16.000 --> 25:25.000
So in other words, just take AX as X is not a member of X.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Then what happens?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh, breaks my heart.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Because we end up saying, great.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
Y belongs to the set of all X, such that X is not a member of X,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
if and only if.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Now what?

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
A is true of Y, so Y is not a member of Y.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Y belongs to the set of sets that are not members themselves,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
if and only if Y isn't a member of itself, right?

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
But now, wait a minute.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
We've said, what about that set itself?

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
Does that set belong to itself or not?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It's a paradox.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Because now we've plugged that set in.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
And so we can actually, let me give that set a name.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It'll make it easier to see what's going on.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
Let's call this set just, well, R for Russell's set.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
Then we can say, OK, Y belongs to R, if and only if Y doesn't belong to Y.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
But now plug in R for Y.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
Ask, does that set belong to itself or not?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
And then we say, well, R belongs to R, if and only if.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Oh, yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
R doesn't belong to R.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
And that's pretty bad.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
That's just not pretty bad.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
It's really bad.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
And so it turns out this simple way of doing things,

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
which now is called naive set theory, doesn't work out.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
So what do we do?

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Well, there are various ways of trying to respond to this paradox.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
And they were really the chief obsession of mathematical logicians

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
for the first several decades of the 20th century.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Russell discovered this and published it in 1902.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Well, I think the letter to Frager was 1902.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
He published the result in 1903.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
And right away people realized this is a fundamental problem

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
in the foundations of mathematics.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
To explain why, I have to go back a little bit.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I won't say much about this.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
But the calculus had been developed by Newton and by Leibniz

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
in the 17th century.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
It turned out to be immensely useful in science.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
We use the calculus in all sorts of ways.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
In many, many different branches of science,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
but definitely in physics.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
And it turned out that it talked about infinitesimal quantities.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
If you think about the definition of a derivative,

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
it's really, well, now we do it in terms of limits.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
But then it was just done as really something that came to 0 over 0.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
And 0 over 0 doesn't make any sense.

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
And so it was kind of like, ah, yes, f y minus f x over y minus x,

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
as we would now say, as y approaches x.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
But then we think, well, wait a minute.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
In the end, that is just 0 over 0.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
What do we do?

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Leibniz and Newton talked about infinitesimal quantities.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
We'll divide this one infinitesimal quantity by this other infinitesimal quantity.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
What do you mean infinitesimal quantity?

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
Now, Abraham Robinson did find a way in the later 20th century

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
to make sense of that talk.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
But throughout the 19th century, people realized we're using the calculus,

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
but it's all based on kind of something unintelligible

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
that we don't really understand.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And in fact, certain contradictions began emerging

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
in the foundations of the calculus.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
So people thought it was very important to try and construct it on a rigorous foundation.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
And Koshy, Dedekin, and a variety of other people throughout the 19th century did that.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
The great achievement, in a way, of 19th century mathematics

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
was the rigorization of mathematics

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
and setting it on a firm foundation developing theories of limits

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
of infinite sequences of convergence and so on.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
And so all of that was a great achievement.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And Frager was basically saying,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
and so you can do it all with classes,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
but oh, there's an inconsistency in the way you've been thinking about this.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
So it was as if people jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
They had solved the problems in the foundations of the calculus

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
by using set theory and then realized, oh, crap.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Set theory as we've been using it is inconsistent.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
What do we do?

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
Well, they addressed this in a variety of ways.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Russell developed the theory of types.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
He was talking about objects and then classes of objects

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and classes of classes of objects

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
and classes of classes of objects and so on.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
And that's one way of approaching it.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
Kline himself developed something called new foundations

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
that tried to prevent any circularities

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
and thought the problem was really the X belongings

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
who were not belonging to X,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
ruling such things out as illegitimate.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
The most standard way of doing this is Zermaylo-Frankl set theory.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
These days called ZFC.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Zermaylo-Frankl and then the axiom of choice.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
C isn't a person, but an additional axiom.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
And the reason I mention it is not only is it the way that mathematics

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
is now standardly done, but it replaces this one principle

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
with a bunch of other principles.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
It restricts this to say you can only do this within a certain background set.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
So you can define a new set inside another set,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
but not just out of thin air.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
It says pairs of things.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
You can basically, if you have two objects, X and Y,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
you can have the pair set X, Y.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
You can take the power set of a set, the set of all the subsets and so on.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
All of these are ways of building sets out of other sets.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
But there's one axiom that's different.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
There is an axiom called the axiom of infinity.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
And what it essentially says is there is

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
an infinite set.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Now, why is that scary?

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
Well, because it just makes that ball climb, right?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It just says there is such a thing.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
And there's no way to get rid of that.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It's foundational in the theory.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
And what is a set?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
What is this infinite set?

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Well, the way it's usually done, it turns out it's an all set

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
together with the set containing an all set and the set containing that

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
It's the set containing all those things.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
And it's like, wait, I'm just coming out and saying that.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That's a pretty frightening thing to say.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
But however you do it, what you're really claiming is that.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
And now you can see, wait a minute, okay, the math part.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
That just commits me to the claim there is an infinite set,

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
the way that's now done.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And there's no way to get rid of that.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
There's no way to, in fact, if I try to replace that with some physical object,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
what could it possibly be, right?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
It would have to be an infinite object.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
And it would have to contain infinitely many other objects.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
You could maybe guess at what Freda thought near the end of his life about this.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
And actually, what I tried to do in my dissertation,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
which was to say, what could a physical object that's infinite

32:28.000 --> 32:36.000
and contains infinitely many others as objects be?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Be a region of space time.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And so in the end, maybe,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Freda thought we could reduce set theory to geometry

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
and think of it as a theory of spatiotemporal regions.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
But that seems like the only hope.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
In any event, it looks like math really does commit us to abstract objects.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
It commits us to at least one infinite set.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
There's no obvious way of getting rid of that

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
in favor of just talking about physical objects.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
So anyway, this whole story has been,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
why Klein transformed from a novelist to a flatness.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Because, as Klein said in the end,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
yes, physics commits me to all this,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and I don't see how to get rid of it.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
How could a region be infinite?

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Well, think of all the points inside that region.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Well, it's not a closed curve, if I close it.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Think of the points inside that region.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
There would be incredibly many points.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
But is that infinite?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Oh, yeah.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
But that assumes the continuity of space-time for one thing.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
And one of the big reasons I sort of gave up on this

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
is not so much technically that I couldn't do it.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
It's that, first of all, the structure of space-time

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
didn't seem to be necessary

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
in the way that mathematical truths are necessary.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
It feels as if the actual structure of space-time

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
is something that's contingent.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Right?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Is it Euclidean?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Is it non-Euclidean?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
What's the curvature of space?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Is it discrete ultimately or continuous?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
It feels like those questions could go either way.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Right?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, I don't want to say, all right, kids,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
one plus one is two.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Provided that space-time is continuous.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
You know, the curvature of space is blah, blah, blah.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So it's like, no, that's crazy.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So it introduces a contingency,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
which is part of what bothered me about it.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
But the other thing that bothered me about it

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
is that I see how to actually make sense of the idea

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
of an uncountable infinity.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
But actually, so I've got something the size

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
of the real numbers there.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
But wait a minute.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
What I need are higher levels of infinity.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
How do I get the idea of, like, now, the cardinality

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
of all of the power set of that,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
of all the subsets of this?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It looks like, wait a minute,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
the power set of all the subsets of that region

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
is just the region, right?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
So it's not clear how you ever get above

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
the cardinality of the real numbers.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
And I didn't know how to solve that problem either.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
And I want more than the real numbers.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I want to be able to talk about functions on the real numbers,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
which requires me to talk about sets of real numbers.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
And so it requires something fancier

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
than regions of space-time.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And so then I had various tricks, technically.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
But in the end, I thought philosophically,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
it made no sense.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
So in any event, that's why I, too,

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
stopped being an analyst at a little confession time.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
But anyway, Kwan didn't really take that detour.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
He just said, yeah, it seems to me

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
what we've learned from the paradoxes.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And the way of reformulating mathematics

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
in the life of the paradoxes is you can't get rid of

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
a commitment to abstract objects.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
You end up having to commit yourself to sets.

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
Now, I see that excited a few of you

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and bored to tears the rest of you.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
So let's go back to the objects that might be introduced,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
not by science, but by, for example, natural language.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
So he's worried about these things.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And in the end, he says, yes, these things

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
we have to be committed to before to do science.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
So he thinks those really do answer the question,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
what is there?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
What is there?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
In the end, the physical objects, as described by physics,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
and sets.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
But now, what else might we worry about?

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Well, one thing that he's concerned about is actual use.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Right?

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
In other words, proverbs.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
Or more broadly, relations, et cetera.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
Do we have to think that those things exist?

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Well, last time, we looked at some examples,

36:35.000 --> 36:45.000
like the clock has rattles.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
We could existentially quantify it,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
so the clock has something.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Remember that inference?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Actually, I think we talked about pebbles,

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
which is an example of what there is.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
What should we do about that?

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
Doesn't it follow that, therefore, the clock has something?

37:07.000 --> 37:17.000
In which case, we're committed to attributes.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
If you're already committed to abstract objects,

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
why is committing to attributes as abstract objects

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
extend your anthropology?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
That's a great question.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
You might think, look, there are places to man the barricades

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
philosophically, and places not.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
You might think, indeed, the nominalists think,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
typically, abstract objects are the place to do it.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Universals.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
By the way, Quine conflates those two issues.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
There really are separate issues.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
The abstract concrete distinction and the universal

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
particular distinction are not the same distinction.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
He recognizes that in word and object.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
He says, oh yeah, there are these kind of abstract

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
particulars like the equator.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Whatever.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Let's go on to typical cases.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
But anyway, that aside, you might think,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
yeah, look, abstract and concrete,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
that's a big place to draw the fighting line.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
After all, concrete objects are ones

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I can come into contact with.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Maybe I can experience them.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
At any rate, I can come into some kind of causal

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
contact with them, even some micro-particle

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
that I could never directly experience,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
causally interact with me.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
And I can have a theory of that causal interaction.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
So concrete objects, I'm happy to admit into my

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
ontology because I'm interacting with them all the time.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And I explain how, therefore, I can know about them.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
But an abstract object isn't the kind of thing

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I can causally interact with.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's not just that I can't experience it.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
I don't see roundness in the way that I see

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
the clock, for example.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
But also, and I don't see the number three,

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
for example, I might see three birds on a wire.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And so you might think, yeah, look,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I don't experience these.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I don't have causal contact with them.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And so this is a place to fight.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
But once I've lost that fight,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
once I have to recognize sense,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
you might say, now, why not just

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
in for a penny, in for a pound?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I've already got sense.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I've already made that purchase.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Why not go ahead and buy the full package

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
and get HBO and Cinemax 2 as a word?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Might as well get attributes.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
It might as well sign on for propositions

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
and facts and all the rest of it.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Because after all, they're a small additional cost.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Not true in the case of movie packages.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
But you might think it is true.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Here, Fimmelsoff, why not?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Now, I think that's a great question.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Why does Quine spend a lot of time

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
worrying about these?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Two parts to the question, really.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
If science is what tells us what there is,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
who cares what we say in natural language?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
And second part of the question is,

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
once you've, in effect, admitted these,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
now, why should it matter to you

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
whether there are additional kinds of abstract objects

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
like attributes and relations and propositions

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
and meanings and so on?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Because they're different, right?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
They are different.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Now, how are they different?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Why does he really resist them?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Because we love the dog.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Okay, good.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Like, doghood is completely different

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
from saying that this is a dog, an individual dog,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and then you have another individual dog, right?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Right.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Okay, good.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Now, Quine says that he's looking for something

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
that's explanatory.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And he says, are physical explanations

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
involve physical objects?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
They involve mathematics.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
But I don't think this explains anything, okay?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
In other words, he said,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and in part is a willingness to say,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
I'm happy to recognize

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
ontological commitments where something is introduced

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
to explain the experiences I have,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
to explain the appearances, to explain the world.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
But I don't think introducing a form like roundness

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
does any explaining at all.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
You say, aha, the clock is round.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Why is the clock round?

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
The answer is, well, it has roundness.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Do I learn anything from that?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Does it explain anything?

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I think his answer is no.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
And so the way he sees it, it's like this.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I've got two ways of putting things.

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
I can say the clock is round.

41:17.000 --> 41:24.000
Or I can say the clock has roundness.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And now he's saying,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
which one of those is explanatory prime?

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Does the clock have roundness because it's round?

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Or is the clock round because it has roundness?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
What should I say?

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
Which of those is more fundamental?

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
Which gives me an explanation.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
The clock is round.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Yeah, exactly.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
He says, look, the clock is round.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
That's the thing that explains this other thing, right?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Why do I say it has roundness?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Because it's round.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That's the fundamental thing.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
And saying it has roundness doesn't explain anything at all.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
In fact, there's a sort of paradox you can keep going.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Why does it have roundness?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Because it has the property of having roundness.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
Or it and roundness are in the participation margin.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
And so if you start making this move,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
this is something called the Bradley Regress.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
You might worry it keeps going.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
And a lot of nominalists have been motivated

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
by that Bradley Regress thinking,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I don't know where it stops.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
If the clock is round, something like RC

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
is explained by C having R-ness,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
that it seems like now I've got the relation of having

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
linking C and roundness.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And then you might say, oh, now I've got

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
some other special relation linking having

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
and C and roundness.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
And well, you can see I can just keep doing this forever.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
But even if you say, well, maybe I can stop this regress here,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
it's not clear what that's accomplishing.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
So I think that's part of his reason.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
He thinks this isn't doing any explaining.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
It's really derivative.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
And there are other reasons too.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
How do I know how to talk about roundness?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
It's epistemologically by virtue of interacting with round things.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
So the explanatory priority of this

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
is mirrored by its epistemic priority.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
I encounter the clock and I see that it's round.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
I don't encounter roundness in the same way.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
It seems indirect by virtue of encountering round things.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
And so you might say, I say this after learning

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
the talk of properties and attributes and so on,

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
because I think that's not the other way around.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
The little baby doesn't start speaking as a Platonist.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Oh, Mama exemplified here.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
But instead talks about Mama, OK?

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
And we'll learn to say, you know, green or something.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
And so anyway, he's motivated in part by that.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Well, he thinks we can get rid of talk of meanings

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
of propositions of attributes.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And here's one way to do it, right?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
The clock has roundness.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Oh, very easy.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Just translate that into the clock is round.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Now what about this?

44:19.000 --> 44:26.000
Roundness is an attribute.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.000
How do we get rid of that?

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
After all, roundness in that sort of having round this position,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
that's easy to replace with a predicate.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But here we've got a subject position.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
If Quine's right, we can rephrase all of these things.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And notice in the logic decision chapter,

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
he really, for that matter, on what there is,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
he gives you a few examples, but he doesn't give you

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
any programmatic way of doing this.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
So we've got to be creative here.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
It's not like he tells us how to do most of this stuff.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
He just gives us a couple of examples and says, see?

44:59.000 --> 45:08.000
But now here, what could we do?

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Yeah.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Is this maybe a good example of you turning roundness into a verb?

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
Like roundness is kind of doing a certain work,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
like theoretically and trying to explain it.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Yes.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
That's true.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
And so one way to do it would be to say,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
well, here our strategy was to replace

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
talk of roundness with talk of round things.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
So maybe we could say round things.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Oh, we don't want to say have an attribute.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
We could say round things are blank for some blank.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Or another way to do it, the way Carnap does it actually

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
in the logical syntax of language,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
is to go into what he calls the formal mode

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
by what Quine later calls semantic ascent.

45:44.000 --> 45:53.000
So this is just saying round is imaginative.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Which is a little weird because there we replace it

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
with round things, and here we replace it with round.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
But that might be less strange if we think here

46:00.000 --> 46:08.000
we're really saying, well, the word round is true of the clock.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Well, in the closing moment here,

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
let me just say something about how he gets rid of meanings.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
Because this ends up being a major strategy for Quine.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
How do we get rid of meanings?

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Instead of talking about the meaning of a sentence,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
he says we can just replace that with, first of all,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
the talk of the sentence being meaningful.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
So first of all, you draw a distinction between the meaningful

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
and the insignificant, the meaningless, I suppose.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
That's one way.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
But the other thing we need talk of meanings for

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
is to say when things have the same meaning.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
And so it's that, and then we have identity, basically,

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
which is a matter here of saying when things have the same meaning,

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
we can talk about synonymy.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
And so in general, this becomes his strategy.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
We say, first there's the existence question,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
whether something has a meaning or not.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
And secondly, the identity question,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
when does this have the same meaning as that?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And he's going to do that with all sorts of things.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Propositions.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
It'll just be when does something express a proposition,

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
and then when does it express the same proposition.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
So it will not be essentially equivalent to talking about meanings.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
And in the end, all we have to do is talk about

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
significant or insignificant sentences,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
and then sentences meaning the same as other sentences.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
So that's the general recipe he's going to use

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
for a lot of these abstract objects.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
Just introduce a way of talking about the existence of such a thing,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
and then what is that, the same one of those,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
and there's no need any longer to talk about the propositions

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
or the facts or the attributes of the meanings.
