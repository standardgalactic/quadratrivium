00:00.000 --> 00:13.040
Hi, I want to talk about Aristotle on substance. Aristotle's categories give us ten modes

00:13.040 --> 00:18.240
of being, the most fundamental, the primary one, of which is substance. Everything else

00:18.240 --> 00:22.600
is really a quality of a substance, a quantity of a substance, a relation between substances

00:22.600 --> 00:28.440
and so on. So substance is fundamental. But what is substance? We've talked some about

00:28.440 --> 00:34.000
criteria for identifying substances. Substances can admit contrary qualities. They don't

00:34.000 --> 00:40.400
themselves have contraries. A substance is this such. It's this particular example of

00:40.400 --> 00:45.840
a certain more general kind. And there are a variety of others. But what does that really

00:45.840 --> 00:51.040
mean for what substance is and what kinds of things are substances? You might think,

00:51.040 --> 00:55.400
look, I know already everything I need to know about this. Substances are in the primary

00:55.400 --> 01:01.000
sense particular things. And then in the secondary sense kinds of things. End of story.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.560
Well, not quite. And Aristotle goes into, in great detail in one of the books of the

01:06.560 --> 01:12.060
metaphysics known as metaphysics zeta, about what it really means for something to be a

01:12.060 --> 01:18.320
substance and what substance really is. It turns out the picture is complicated. My only

01:18.320 --> 01:24.800
incomplete that I received during my graduate education was in a course on Aristotle. I

01:24.800 --> 01:30.160
took on the problem of explaining Aristotle's analysis of substance in metaphysics zeta

01:30.160 --> 01:35.640
as the topic for my term paper. I couldn't finish it within the semester. And I figured,

01:35.640 --> 01:39.960
well, I'll write it over the summer. Over the summer I studied the question. I read more

01:39.960 --> 01:46.140
and more about it. Finally, I became convinced I couldn't solve the problem. And so quickly

01:46.140 --> 01:51.160
shifted my topic to Aristotle on infinity and wrote a paper about that, which was not

01:51.160 --> 01:58.600
exactly my greatest work. But that problem about substance, I in the end considered insoluble.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.960
And as you'll see today, I have more ideas about it. But actually, I think still Aristotle's

02:02.960 --> 02:09.080
point in a way is nothing really fulfills all of the considerations, all of the criteria

02:09.080 --> 02:15.360
intuitively that we have for being a substance. Why is it complicated? Well, let's start

02:15.360 --> 02:21.040
our discussion by reminding ourselves about the role that substance plays in the categories.

02:21.040 --> 02:27.320
Substances that are in no way composite signify substance, quantity, quality, relation, place,

02:27.320 --> 02:33.800
time, position, state, action, or affection. Those are the basic categories. Substance,

02:33.800 --> 02:36.920
in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the word, is that which is neither

02:36.920 --> 02:42.840
predictable of a subject nor present in a subject. And so all of those other things are predicated

02:42.840 --> 02:48.280
of substance. He refers to these, in fact, as figures of predication. And so we talk

02:48.360 --> 02:53.720
about quantities of substance or qualities of substance, relations between substances.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.200
Substances being in a certain position or in a certain state as doing things, having

02:57.200 --> 03:03.040
things done to them. In short, we predicate other things of substances. But substances

03:03.040 --> 03:07.440
are the things that aren't predictable of something else. They aren't present in something

03:07.440 --> 03:14.040
else. They are the ultimate subjects of predication. So Aristotle says everything except primary

03:14.040 --> 03:19.080
substances is either predicated of primary substances or is present in them. And if these

03:19.080 --> 03:23.280
didn't exist, it'd be possible for anything else to exist. If there were no substances,

03:23.280 --> 03:27.040
there would be no quantities or qualities or relations or places or times or anything

03:27.040 --> 03:33.240
else as well. So they are most properly called substances because they underlie everything

03:33.240 --> 03:40.640
else. As the name suggests, they stand, stand, under, sub, everything else. They are the

03:40.680 --> 03:47.680
basic foundation, the basic things the universe consists of. So he says the science of substance,

03:48.400 --> 03:52.920
understanding substance, must be of the nature of wisdom. If you really want to understand

03:52.920 --> 03:57.840
the world at the deepest level, you've got to understand substance. That turns out, however,

03:57.840 --> 04:03.480
to be rather difficult. The overall question here is the deepest question, I think, of

04:03.480 --> 04:09.760
metaphysics, which is the question of ontology. And Willard Van Orman Quine, a 20th century

04:09.800 --> 04:14.120
philosopher, has put this question beautifully at the beginning of one of his papers called

04:14.120 --> 04:19.520
On What There Is. A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity. It

04:19.520 --> 04:24.840
can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables. What is there? It can be answered moreover

04:24.840 --> 04:30.240
in a word, everything. And everyone will accept this answer is true. However, this is merely

04:30.240 --> 04:34.760
to say there is what there is. There remains room for disagreement over cases. And so the

04:34.800 --> 04:40.800
issue is stayed alive down through the centuries. Well, that's precisely right. What is there?

04:40.800 --> 04:46.200
Everything. Well, Aristotle's a little more specific than that. What is there? Substance.

04:46.200 --> 04:53.200
But what's substance? Well, substance is that which is primarily, not in any qualified sense,

04:53.480 --> 05:00.480
but without qualification. It's what exists. That is substance. But we need criteria for

05:01.000 --> 05:05.720
figuring out what substance is and for identifying then the particular things that we take to

05:05.720 --> 05:11.040
be the fundamental constituents of the world. Well, all substance, he says, appears to signify

05:11.040 --> 05:17.800
that which is individual. It is this as well as such. It's an individual thing as well

05:17.800 --> 05:23.200
as a thing of a certain kind. Another mark of substance is that it has no contrary. There's

05:23.200 --> 05:28.560
no opposite in the way that hot is the opposite of cold or right is the opposite of left or

05:28.640 --> 05:34.560
being on top of something is the opposite of being under something or there isn't anything

05:34.560 --> 05:40.800
like that with substance. Substance doesn't admit a varying degrees. We don't have something

05:40.800 --> 05:45.640
that is more a cat than other things. If you're either a cat or you're not a cat, one cat

05:45.640 --> 05:50.680
can't be more cat than another cat. The most distinctive mark of substance, he says, is

05:50.680 --> 05:55.680
that it admits contrary qualities. The cat can be awake or asleep. It can be running

05:55.680 --> 06:02.680
or it can be staying still. It can be meowing or it can be silent. So here are some criteria.

06:03.120 --> 06:08.680
Putting these down on a list of substance isn't predictable of or present in anything else.

06:08.680 --> 06:13.800
It underlies everything else. It's individual. It's of this. It has no contrary. There are

06:13.800 --> 06:20.080
no degrees of it and it admits contrary qualities. It can be changed and undergo a change of

06:20.080 --> 06:27.080
quality while remaining the same. Now, what do we mean when we say substance is primary?

06:28.840 --> 06:32.600
That's not that easy a question to answer. Aristotle says there are actually several

06:32.600 --> 06:38.000
senses in which a thing may be said to be primary or first. Substance, however, is first

06:38.000 --> 06:42.840
in every sense. It's first in definition. It's first in order of knowledge and it's

06:42.840 --> 06:49.840
first in time. So let's think first about time. Other categories can't exist independently,

06:49.840 --> 06:54.600
only substance. You can't just have the color red floating around independently. It's

06:54.600 --> 06:59.920
got to be a red something. You can't just have an action of throwing, for example, without

06:59.920 --> 07:04.640
anyone doing the throwing or anything being thrown. And so substance has to be there in

07:04.640 --> 07:09.080
order for anything else to exist. If there were no substance, nothing could be thrown,

07:09.080 --> 07:14.040
nothing could throw. Nothing could be red or could be tall or could be lying over on

07:14.040 --> 07:21.040
its side and so on. And what about first in definition? Well, everything else is a quality

07:22.000 --> 07:27.480
of a substance, a relation among substances, a quantity of a substance, an action or a state

07:27.480 --> 07:34.480
or affection of a substance. So in short, all of those have substance in their very definitions.

07:34.920 --> 07:41.920
And what about in the order of knowledge? We know substances most fully and most particularly.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.560
It says, here's the way to do it. Think about knowing something. Before you really can know

07:46.560 --> 07:51.000
anything else about it, the most important thing to know is what is it? What kind of

07:51.000 --> 07:58.120
thing is it? Is it a man? Is it fire? Is it a horse? Is it an action? You need to know

07:58.120 --> 08:01.800
what kind of thing it is. You need to know what a thing is before you can even start

08:01.800 --> 08:07.200
describing it. Surely first in the order of knowledge is knowing that it's a person or

08:07.200 --> 08:10.880
knowing that it's a book, knowing that it's a table, knowing that it's a vegetable and

08:10.880 --> 08:17.880
so forth. Now, Aristotle says the question raised of old and raised now and always, what

08:20.880 --> 08:26.400
is substance? Well, he gives us four candidates. And this is interesting because you might

08:26.400 --> 08:30.480
have thought, well, wait, we've known this already, right? We mean particular things

08:30.480 --> 08:36.320
like this book and then the general kind book or this particular human being and then the

08:36.360 --> 08:43.360
general kind humanity or human being. But not so fast. In metaphysics Zeta he says there

08:43.800 --> 08:48.320
are actually four candidates. Well, four and question mark, there's really an obvious

08:48.320 --> 08:53.400
fifth which he somehow seems to neglect in the discussion. The word substance is applied,

08:53.400 --> 08:58.040
if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects, for both the essence and the

08:58.040 --> 09:03.760
universal and the genus are thought to be the substance of each thing and fourthly the

09:03.760 --> 09:08.280
substratum. Now, this is quite startling when you see it. Wait a minute. I thought we had

09:08.280 --> 09:12.440
particular things and then kinds of thing. That's it. But now we're talking, well, I

09:12.440 --> 09:17.000
mean, what happened to the things? What happened to the kinds? We've got, well, we've got genus

09:17.000 --> 09:21.480
as a kind type term. Those are the secondary substances of the categories. But we've got

09:21.480 --> 09:28.480
essences and universals and the substratum. What's going on here? Well, I thought we were

09:28.720 --> 09:34.760
talking about primary substances, individual things, things like this book or this human

09:34.760 --> 09:41.760
being. Ah, well, let's go through our criteria. Not predictable of or present to anything else.

09:41.760 --> 09:47.160
True. I am not predictable of anything else. Neither is that book. Underlying everything

09:47.160 --> 09:51.680
else. Yes, individual things seem to underlie everything else. If there were no individual

09:51.680 --> 09:55.880
things there would be nothing at all. So nothing would have any qualities or relations

09:55.880 --> 10:02.880
and so on. Individual. Yes, it's this book, this human being. And so individuality. Check.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.800
No contrary. Right. There's no contrary. Nothing that's the opposite of being Dan Bonnevac.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.280
No degrees can't be more Dan Bonnevac than somebody else. So either you are or you aren't.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.880
And the same thing with just being human. You either are or you aren't. Admitting contrary

10:18.880 --> 10:25.160
qualities. Yes, I can speak. I can be silent. So I can exhibit contrary qualities. The book

10:25.160 --> 10:33.440
might be closed. The book might be open. Contrary qualities. But ah, primary. Here Aristotle

10:33.440 --> 10:38.160
says, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm looking for the ultimate constituents of the world.

10:38.160 --> 10:44.720
The things that are primary in the sense that they are the most basic things. And actually

10:44.720 --> 10:51.720
this book or this human being, they seem composite. There is both the this and the such aspect.

10:51.720 --> 10:58.720
They seem to have matter and form. I am this person in this body, in this flesh and blood.

11:00.920 --> 11:05.960
I have a certain form. I have an essence. And we'll talk more about what essences are.

11:05.960 --> 11:10.000
But certain things are accidental to me. They can change and I remain the same. Other things

11:10.000 --> 11:16.360
might be essential to me in that if they change, I am no longer who I am. And so we can talk

11:16.360 --> 11:24.040
about my essence, my form, my matter. Ooh, I seem to be composite. But Aristotle says,

11:24.040 --> 11:27.720
I'm not talking about composite things now. I want to know what the ultimate constituents

11:27.720 --> 11:31.760
of the world are. And these particular things that I took to be primary substances in the

11:31.760 --> 11:38.040
categories, they look composite. What are they made up of? What are their ultimate constituents?

11:38.040 --> 11:44.080
Hmm, maybe they're physical parts. Maybe they're form. Maybe something else. Now we have to

11:44.120 --> 11:50.880
investigate. Well, one possibility is the substratum. Okay, so Aristotle says the substratum

11:50.880 --> 11:56.840
is that of which everything else is predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything

11:56.840 --> 12:04.000
else. So I think about myself as a human being. And I think, okay, good, humanity is being

12:04.000 --> 12:09.200
predicated of me. Human being, that's something like a species. So that's a more general kind

12:09.240 --> 12:16.040
of thing. It's a secondary substance, but it's found here in me a primary substance. But admittedly,

12:16.040 --> 12:21.240
I'm not predicated of anything else. I satisfy that criterion. But am I basic? I do seem to have

12:21.240 --> 12:30.120
matter, this flesh and blood. And then I have a form in this general shape of a body. But also,

12:30.120 --> 12:35.000
we can talk about my form in a sort of mental state, talk about my personality or my consciousness

12:35.080 --> 12:40.120
or something of that sort. And then I have an essence, things that could not change while I

12:40.120 --> 12:48.760
remain the same person. And then you could say, well, let me ask a different question. What or

12:48.760 --> 12:55.120
who is it that is Dan Bonobak? After all, we've said, aha, humanity, that gets attributed to Dan

12:55.120 --> 13:01.440
Bonobak. Dan Bonobak, well, something here is being Dan Bonobak. What is that thing? Suppose I

13:01.480 --> 13:06.120
say, well, it's that flesh and blood. You could say, well, what is it that is that flesh and blood?

13:06.120 --> 13:13.440
I don't know what to say about this. And we're going to see this in a number of different

13:13.440 --> 13:19.880
philosophers throughout the term. But you might think, okay, look, maybe I mean, whatever that

13:19.880 --> 13:24.760
ultimate thing is, that is Dan Bonobak. So I look at the book and I say, yeah, I'm not talking about

13:24.760 --> 13:29.360
the book as the fundamental thing. After all, books are obviously not basic constituents of the

13:29.360 --> 13:35.120
universe. They're made up of pages and those pages contain words. And, and so it looks as if this

13:35.120 --> 13:39.920
book is something that I can't identify as a basic constituent of the universe. There is something

13:39.920 --> 13:45.320
that is this book. Let's say it's these pages. Well, there's something that constitutes these pages.

13:45.320 --> 13:52.440
What's that? And I can keep pushing down. And so Aristotle thinks maybe there is a substratum here,

13:52.440 --> 13:58.240
maybe here in the end, it's the paper, let's say, or in my case, maybe it really just is the flesh

13:58.400 --> 14:03.800
and blood, or it is the ultimate constituents of my biochemistry, whatever we end up saying about

14:03.800 --> 14:09.880
that. We end up with a substratum that isn't predictable of or present in anything else that

14:09.880 --> 14:18.680
does seem to underlie everything else. But is it individual? Hmm, it's primary in a way, but the

14:18.680 --> 14:23.120
individuality seems disturbing. Let's think about a statute. It's a little easier than thinking

14:23.120 --> 14:29.480
about a human being or a book. In one sense, matter is said to be the nature of the nature of a

14:29.480 --> 14:34.640
substratum in another shape and in a third the compound of these. By the matter, I mean, for

14:34.640 --> 14:40.520
instance, the bronze. By the shape, the pattern of its form, in this case, the cap. And by the

14:40.520 --> 14:46.440
compound of these, the statute, the concrete hole. So if I'm looking for ultimate constituents of the

14:46.440 --> 14:53.760
universe, well, primary substance in the terms of the book, the categories, is that sculpture. But

14:53.760 --> 14:59.760
now I say, well, that sculpture doesn't really seem primary. So what is it that is that sculpture?

14:59.760 --> 15:07.640
It's a certain shape, but what is in that shape? Well, the bronze. Now, later philosophers will

15:07.640 --> 15:13.560
say, so what is that bronze? And push it even further. But Aristotle is willing to stop with the

15:13.560 --> 15:19.440
bronze or the paper or the flesh and blood, etc. In any case, we've got to consider those

15:19.440 --> 15:24.120
possibilities. Maybe the ultimate constituent is simply the statue, the hole, the matter and form

15:24.120 --> 15:29.320
together, that individual object. That's what he assumes throughout the book, the categories. But

15:29.320 --> 15:35.440
it could also be just the matter, just the bronze, it could be just the form, just the shape. So,

15:35.440 --> 15:43.160
let's take those in turn. The compound, could it be the compound of matter and form? That is to

15:43.160 --> 15:50.320
say, that matter in that particular shape, that bronze shaped that way. Well, Aristotle says,

15:50.320 --> 15:56.560
look, we can easily dismiss that. It's obviously posterior. It's nature is obvious. It is not

15:56.560 --> 16:01.960
the basic thing. It's not like you say, what's the basic constituent? Oh, it's this bronze statue

16:01.960 --> 16:10.360
of a cat. No, right? Surely that is a compound of the bronze put in that shape. So it's not primary,

16:10.520 --> 16:16.560
it's not going to count. What about the matter, the bronze, there in the shape of the cat, here in

16:16.560 --> 16:24.680
the shape of the man? Well, is it the bronze that is primary? Aristotle is tempted to go in that

16:24.680 --> 16:30.440
direction, but then he says, well, that statement is obscure. On this view, matter becomes substance.

16:30.440 --> 16:35.760
If this isn't substance, it battles us to say what else he is. When all else is stripped off,

16:35.800 --> 16:42.120
evidently nothing but matter remains. So I look at the sculpture and I say, take away the shape,

16:42.120 --> 16:47.440
abstract away from the shape, take away that olive branch behind his ear, take away the nose,

16:47.440 --> 16:53.360
take away all of that. What's left? Well, just the bronze. But really, in the end, it's just well,

16:53.360 --> 16:58.080
stuff like bronze. I mean, it might be, right? If we're thinking in terms of chemistry, we might

16:58.080 --> 17:04.160
say the ultimate elements, the iron. Actually, bronze is something of a compound, there are a

17:04.160 --> 17:10.840
mixture. So really, it should be things like, okay, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, etc. The basic

17:10.840 --> 17:15.720
chemical elements, maybe that is what counts as the ultimate constituents of the universe. Or

17:15.720 --> 17:22.000
maybe it's the atoms of those or the micro particles making up those atoms. But in any case,

17:22.000 --> 17:28.960
well, nothing but matter is really going to remain. So what's wrong with that? Well, Aristotle says,

17:29.120 --> 17:34.080
look, take away length and breadth and depth. There's nothing left unless there's something

17:34.080 --> 17:40.480
bounded by these. So if you consider the matter this way, matter alone must seem to be substance.

17:41.040 --> 17:45.680
Well, that would be neither a particular thing nor a certain quantity nor assigned to any of the

17:45.680 --> 17:50.880
other categories by which it's determined. All those determinations are gone. We can no longer

17:50.880 --> 17:56.400
say, oh, it's a statue or it's a man or it's a book or it's anything of any particular kind. It's

17:56.400 --> 18:01.600
just the matter in the end. So he says, look, we lose something really important. Maybe we gain

18:01.600 --> 18:07.040
some degree of primacy, but we lose other things we cared about. The ultimate substratum would

18:07.040 --> 18:10.720
itself be neither a particular thing or a particular quantity or otherwise positively

18:10.720 --> 18:16.320
characterized. Nor would it be the negations of these. They would belong to it only by accident.

18:17.040 --> 18:23.600
So it would turn out that matter is substance, but hold on a second. We said that being of this

18:23.680 --> 18:30.720
such was crucial to substance. Being separable, having its own independent individual existence,

18:30.720 --> 18:37.840
being of this, those are among our criteria too and matter surely fails that. So that won't work.

18:37.840 --> 18:44.240
Matter can't be right. Well, the substratum then satisfies us with respect to being not

18:44.240 --> 18:49.600
present in anything else, not being predictable of something else, underlying everything else,

18:49.600 --> 18:53.840
good, but individual. No, it's not individual. It fails that test.

18:55.200 --> 19:01.600
What about essence? I do have an essence as a human being. Well, how about that? Is that

19:01.600 --> 19:09.120
something that can count? He groups those together under shape, form, the universal.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.240
The question of essence is complicated. We'll talk about that separately. But for now, let's

19:14.240 --> 19:18.400
just go with this idea that by essence, I mean something like the shape or the form or the

19:18.400 --> 19:24.320
universal I exemplify. I mean something like being a human being in my case, or being a book,

19:24.880 --> 19:30.960
or maybe being a statue of a cat in that particular shape, or of a Greek goddess,

19:30.960 --> 19:38.560
or of an Olympic winner, etc. Shape, you might think, is a universal. So those are coins,

19:38.560 --> 19:43.760
all of which are bronze coins, but all of which are in basically the same shape, the same form.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.400
Well, can we count the universal or the shape or the form as itself substance?

19:51.600 --> 19:57.600
Plato, Aristotle thinks, wants to do that. But he says, no, that can't be right. It seems impossible

19:57.600 --> 20:03.040
that any universal term should be the name of a substance. Why? Well, the substance of a thing

20:03.040 --> 20:08.240
is what is peculiar to it that doesn't belong to anything else. But the universal is common.

20:08.320 --> 20:15.200
Universal is, by definition, something that is multiply instantiated. So look, it, by its very

20:15.200 --> 20:19.280
nature, belongs to more than one thing. There can be more than one human being, more than one triangle,

20:19.280 --> 20:25.840
more than one statue, more than one cat. So where's the individuality? It looks like universal can't

20:25.840 --> 20:30.720
be it. And it can't be shape or form or anything like that. We can have lots and lots of different

20:30.720 --> 20:36.400
statues produced in a factory with exactly the same shape, multiply instantiable,

20:36.400 --> 20:43.200
so we don't get what's unique. So Aristotle says, well, look, no universal attribute can be a

20:43.200 --> 20:49.520
substance. And not only for that reason, because also it is predictable of things. I can say that

20:49.520 --> 20:55.520
has the shape of a cat. And that's something that I can predicate of that statue. So it's

20:55.520 --> 21:00.080
predictable of other things. It is something that can be in something else. It's multiply

21:00.080 --> 21:05.600
instantiable. It flunks a bunch of different tests of substance. It fails our test of not

21:05.600 --> 21:12.240
being predictable, but it fails others as well. And so we want to say, look, everything that's common

21:12.240 --> 21:18.800
indicates not of this, but a such. But a substance is of this. We agreed that substance was of this

21:18.800 --> 21:25.920
such, particular of a certain kind. And a universal isn't like that. It is purely the universal part.

21:25.920 --> 21:32.320
Maybe it's an answer to the such part. It is not an answer to this part. So it fails individuality.

21:32.320 --> 21:42.400
Well, what about a kind? We've talked about that as a secondary substance in the categories. And so

21:42.400 --> 21:47.200
we might look at it and say, well, maybe Aristotle's changed his mind by the time he gets to metaphysics.

21:47.200 --> 21:52.000
Maybe he's decided the secondary is really primary. And we should be talking about kinds,

21:52.000 --> 21:58.240
about general sorts or types of things. But look, that doesn't work either. It's

21:58.240 --> 22:04.800
predictable of something else. I am a human being, for example. That animal is a cat. That is a book.

22:05.760 --> 22:11.920
It also fails individuality. Because after all, it's of this such, this human being.

22:13.120 --> 22:19.200
The kind is giving you the such, not this. So we summarize and we say, well, we've looked at now

22:19.200 --> 22:25.280
five possibilities. Is it an individual thing? It looks like that's compound. It's not primary.

22:25.280 --> 22:31.360
Matter? It's not individual. What about shape or form or universal? It's predictable and it's not

22:31.360 --> 22:36.160
individual. What about a kind? It's predictable. It's not individual. What about the combination

22:36.160 --> 22:40.960
of matter and form? Well, now we're back to the individual thing. It's compound is not primary.

22:40.960 --> 22:46.880
So in the end, I think Aristotle thinks nothing on that list really satisfies everything we wanted

22:46.880 --> 22:54.080
about the nature of substance. We went thinking, look, I've got a very intuitive idea. What is the

22:54.080 --> 22:57.680
basic structure of the world? Let's look at the structure of language and the structure of thought.

22:58.480 --> 23:03.760
Everything is really about in the end. Well, in language, nouns. It's about persons,

23:03.760 --> 23:08.480
places, things. It's about individual objects, individual people, individual things. But then

23:08.480 --> 23:15.120
we look and we say, wait a minute. I wanted it to be, yes, individual, but also primary and not

23:15.120 --> 23:19.440
compound. Something that underlies everything else I wanted it to be having. The ability to

23:19.440 --> 23:24.320
admit contrary qualities, but to have no contrary itself and so on and so forth. I didn't want it

23:24.320 --> 23:29.520
to become positive. I wanted it to be simple and basic. And it turns out I can't have it all.

23:29.520 --> 23:36.080
I can either go with the compound, but hey, in other respects, satisfying things, that is to say,

23:36.080 --> 23:41.280
the matter plus form, the individual thing, or I can go with some element like the essence or the

23:41.280 --> 23:46.880
shape, form, universal, matter, kind. And then I'm going to have to give up the idea that this is not

23:46.880 --> 23:51.760
practicable. I'll have to give up the idea of individuality. I will have to surrender my

23:51.760 --> 23:57.600
conception that substance is not this such. I have a big price to pay no matter what. So in short,

23:57.600 --> 24:05.120
the moral seems to be this. Nothing satisfies all the criteria for being a substance. Well,

24:06.800 --> 24:12.960
that's disappointing. And so Aristotle in a kind of summary says, well, look, what are we really

24:13.040 --> 24:18.720
in the undo then? If we can't have everything, what do we settle for? Here's what we settle for.

24:18.720 --> 24:24.080
We call substance, first of all, the simple bodies, like the elements, in other words, earth, air,

24:24.080 --> 24:31.040
fire, water, everything of that sort. But also the individual things composed of them, bodies, books,

24:31.040 --> 24:35.760
human beings, and so forth. All those are called substance because they're not predicated of a

24:35.760 --> 24:41.520
subject. Everything else is predicated to them. So in short, we refer to both the basic elements

24:41.520 --> 24:45.760
and then the things made up out of those elements, the compounds, the individual objects,

24:45.760 --> 24:50.720
the individual people, those are substances. They satisfy at least some of the criteria

24:50.720 --> 24:57.280
for being a substance. We sometimes refer to substances as a principle or even a cause and

24:57.280 --> 25:03.840
pursue it from that starting point, he says. So sometimes we focus on the cause. And here we're

25:03.840 --> 25:08.720
looking towards something like an essence, like the soul of an animal or a human being.

25:09.360 --> 25:14.640
And we think about a person's mind, let's say, and we think of that as something like a substance.

25:14.640 --> 25:19.520
It's not a material substance, but nevertheless, it's something like the cause of the motion

25:19.520 --> 25:25.680
of the material substance. And so sometimes we extend it in that direction too. Then we talk

25:25.680 --> 25:31.280
about the parts of things. Okay, so there's me, this human being, but then there's also this hand,

25:31.280 --> 25:37.040
and that hand, and this hair, and those eyes, and so forth, the various parts of me. And then

25:37.040 --> 25:42.080
ultimately, of course, the individual atoms, the individual microparticles that make me up.

25:42.080 --> 25:48.000
So those are in a different sense, substance. And then finally, he says, the essence.

25:49.360 --> 25:55.040
Who am I really? You might think, what is my essence? What is really the essence of being Dan

25:55.040 --> 26:01.200
Bonobak? Or, you know, what is this? It's a book. Well, what is it to be a book? I'm looking for the

26:01.200 --> 26:06.640
essence of books. So maybe the best answer to what it is, is ultimately an explanation of the essence

26:06.640 --> 26:12.320
of the thing. We call that substance too. So in short, we have a variety of criteria. Does

26:12.320 --> 26:19.120
anything meet all those criteria? No. But we settle. And we settle in various ways. Sometimes we refer

26:19.120 --> 26:23.440
to substances as the individual things. Sometimes to the elements out of which they're composed.

26:23.440 --> 26:27.920
Sometimes to the parts out of which they're composed. Sometimes to something like the cause,

26:27.920 --> 26:36.400
the mind, the soul. Sometimes we actually refer to, well, gosh, the kind. After all,

26:36.400 --> 26:41.120
there are secondary substances. We refer to a bunch of different things. So in the end, he says,

26:41.120 --> 26:44.720
and you might think here, he's going to say, so substance has four senses or something.

26:45.440 --> 26:51.120
He gives us two, really. Because of those criteria, he tells us, look, we either choose

26:51.120 --> 26:56.800
the substratum, the thing that is basic, but forces us to lose the individuality part.

26:56.800 --> 27:02.400
So we think about the basic elements, for example, or the bronze. We think about that type of thing

27:02.400 --> 27:07.600
where we basically preserve the underlying everything else, but we lose the individuality

27:07.600 --> 27:12.880
part. Or we think about the individual things, that this is, whether it's the whole thing or

27:12.880 --> 27:20.240
the parts of the thing, this part, this hand, that hand, and so on. Those things we can also take.

27:20.240 --> 27:25.920
But then we lose some sense of primacy because they're compounds. So we can't have it all.

27:26.480 --> 27:31.440
We settle. We either say, well, this satisfies most of the criteria. I have to give up the

27:31.440 --> 27:35.920
individuality part. Or we say, well, it satisfies most of the criteria, but I have to give up

27:35.920 --> 27:43.200
the primacy part. In the end, we settle because we can't have everything. So we look at the sculpture,

27:43.200 --> 27:49.040
and sometimes we say, what is that? It's bronze. Sometimes what is that? A child reading a book.

27:49.040 --> 27:56.080
Sometimes we say, what is that? Well, it consists of several parts. There is the child,

27:56.080 --> 28:00.640
there is the base of it, there is the book, and the individual things that are marked so

28:00.720 --> 28:06.000
they look like pages. In short, we do lots of different things to answer questions like,

28:06.000 --> 28:19.120
what is that? Because, well, there is no one simple way to understand what substance really is.
