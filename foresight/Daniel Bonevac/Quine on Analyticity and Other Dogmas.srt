00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Last time we were talking about Klein's attack on analyticity and I want to

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
return to that there's one last argument we have to consider before we move on

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,080
to the second dogma of empiricism. However before even doing that I think I

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,960
should say a little bit about what motivates Klein's attack. Why does he

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
care about this anyway? We began last time by thinking about empiricism and

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,680
thinking it was pretty important to be empiricist to screen off a certain set

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,680
of sentences as things that were well verbally true that didn't concern

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,120
experience. Otherwise you have to fake the claim that our knowledge even that

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,600
one plus one is two or that every duck is a duck and so on is actually something

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,480
we have to learn from experience. However the reason goes deeper than that

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,280
in a sense why someone would care. After all Kant is the one who actually

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,440
framed the analytic synthetic distinction in the form we have it today

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,320
more or less. You introduce those terms and why did he do it? Not because he was

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,240
an empiricist but because he was able to identify a mission for philosophy.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,120
Philosophy was the thing that would discover the grounds and the extent of

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,440
synthetic apriori truth. So from that point of view, Kant has a way of

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,320
distinguishing philosophy from empirical science from other sorts of things.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,520
Philosophy is the thing that uncovers the synthetic apriori truths. Hume and other

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,480
empiricists have tended to find a role for philosophy in doing an analysis of

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,720
concepts and so I'm covering certain analytic truths especially those that

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,960
aren't just lookable up in the dictionary but ones that are more

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,800
theoretical, ones that are more illuminating, one that explicated

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,880
concept as opposed to just giving you a definition of courage as being courageous.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,160
I can only imagine what Socrates would have said. He said, what is courage? It's

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,440
being courageous. It's like, yeah, that's not going to satisfy him, right? He wants

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,640
something more and so there's a task there too. When Quine is challenging this

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,000
distinction then what is he doing? He's challenging the claim that philosophy

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,920
actually has any distinctive task of its own and so in the end Quine's

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,880
motivation for challenging the analytic synthetic distinction is not to attack

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,640
empiricism, it's to defend naturalism. The idea that there is no way to

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,720
distinguish philosophy or some other discipline from natural science. In a

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,840
sense, it all becomes one big project of understanding the world and any

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,560
distinction we draw between philosophical analysis and actual

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
investigation of the world between an attempt to discover the transcendental

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,240
grounds of synthetic apriori truths or any other type of thing as opposed to

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,560
disciplines of psychology or physics or anything like that. All of that is bound

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,160
to fail, he thinks. In the end, it's all the same thing. Philosophy is just part

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,160
of natural science. Or to put it another way, you might say all branches of

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,600
knowledge are really just part of the same thing. Our distinction between

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,200
philosophy and anything else is really arbitrary. In the end, it doesn't

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,840
reflect a deep difference of discipline, it's just a matter of levels of

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,520
generality. And so what he's going to do by the end of this essay is draw us a

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,120
picture that's like this. He says in the end, think of our beliefs not as resting

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,560
on some foundation of observation and analytic truth, but instead as being

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,200
something like a spider web connected to experience at the ends, but then

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,480
containing lots of things in between. So here I will draw a spider web. That might

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,760
be a crappy spider. But this is something he ends up calling the web of

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,800
belief. And the point, in a sense, of the attack on analyticity is to say, look,

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,480
it's all in there together. Yes, some things are closer to experience and

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,040
some aren't. So some look kind of empirical. Some are very far here in the

51
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,920
center and might look either analytic or very abstractly theoretical. But all of

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,840
that is just a matter of degree. In the end, there's nothing that is sort of

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,200
directly tied to experience in the way that an observation sentence is supposed

54
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,280
to be a logical empiricism. There's nothing that is sort of off limits to

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,040
revision as part of natural science as an analytic truth might be. So it's all

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,520
sort of hanging in there together. What's physics and what's math? In the end,

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,480
they're going to be sort of mixed together and we draw certain pragmatic

58
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,480
distinctions between them. But there's no really principal distinction to be

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,280
drawn between. So that's what this attack on analyticity is really about. Now,

60
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,080
we identified a couple of attacks before. So let's return to this question of

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,800
analyticity. And remember, we had thought of a variety of ways of thinking about it.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,840
One was based on meanings and synonymy. But Kauai doesn't like thinking of

63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,280
meanings as entities, number one. And secondly, we could say, well, okay, a

64
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,400
bachelor is an unmarried man. That's an analytic truth if it's only a bachelor

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,480
and an unmarried man are synonymous. But how do we tell whether it's those

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,440
things are synonymous? In the end, well, that's just a question of whether that

67
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,320
sentence is an analytic truth. So synonomy and analyticity can be defined in terms

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,000
of each other, but neither really helps. It's as if we just have two synonymous

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,640
sentences. Or it's like pig and swine. Or brave and courageous. If I say, what is it

70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,560
to be courageous? To be brave, you might think that doesn't help me a lot. What is

71
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,960
it to be brave? To be courageous. And so in the end, that doesn't help. If we think

72
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,880
about definability, we've got all sorts of definitions. But the ones that are

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,560
interesting from our point of view, and aren't just stipulations, all involve

74
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,320
some prior sense of synonymy. We write in the dictionary that this is the

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,680
definition of that term because we're trying to capture something about usage

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,040
and something about identity of meaning or synonymy. So we just get thrown back

77
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,800
into the same problem. And then we talk about interchangeability and end up

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,600
finding that problematic and basically saying, look, in the end, that doesn't

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,320
seem either necessary or submission for understanding analyticity. Well, the last

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,640
thing he considers before moving on to the second topic is a different approach

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,880
to this. And it's an approach based on the idea of a sematical rule. So this is

82
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,280
what Karnat does. He gives us a language and he characterizes the language in

83
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,480
terms of its syntax. So he defines a vocabulary in that set of grammatical

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,040
rules. And then he said, here are the semantic rules for actually interpreting

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,840
my language. Okay. What is an analytic statement? It's something that is true on

86
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,480
the basis of the sematical rules. So it's something you can derive from the

87
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,200
sematical rules alone. So we've got a syntax that gives us a vocabulary and a

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,400
grammar that defines the well-formed expressions of our language. And then we've

89
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:11,720
got sematical rules. The semantics tells us how to interpret those expressions. And

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,480
it generally does that in a compositional way. We start out with the simple parts

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,080
and tells us how to interpret the simple parts and then how to combine those into

92
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,200
more complex parts. And so we've got a way of interpreting the well-formed

93
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:34,480
expressions. And in particular, that semantics consists of rules, rules for

94
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,320
the basic expressions and then the ways of combining them. And those rules are

95
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,600
going to imply certain things. And indeed, what Karnat lays out here is what

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,560
linguists do all the time. If you look up an average paper in linguistics and

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,880
philosophy, you will find a sort of toy language frequently with a simple

98
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,400
vocabulary, a simple set of grammatical rules, and then some sematical rules that

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
tell you how to interpret all of that. And so something is analytic, if it just

100
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,920
follows from the sematical rules. So I can show you a little example of that if

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,400
you're interested. Yeah, okay. This is something from a paper by Bar-Wise and

102
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,160
Harry in 1981. It's a very simple thing. Suppose we have a sentence like this.

103
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:28,480
John sees Mary run. How would we interpret that sentence? Well, they say the

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,080
basic idea here, you've got something strange going on in these

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,440
sentences. Look at Mary run. That's called a naked infinitive. That is to say an

106
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,160
infinitive, but without the two. And so it could be like an ordinary infinitive.

107
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,600
It would be something like John once Mary to run. This, however, leaves out the two.

108
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,040
And so there's something a little bit surprising about that. These constructions

109
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,200
are a little unusual. What do they mean? Well, the idea in Bar-Wise and Harry is

110
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,080
that this is really a situation. It's a scene. So John is seeing a scene here. And

111
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,720
so let's call that scene S. We want to say there is such a scene that John sees,

112
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,080
basically. So the truth conditions will be something like this. There is an S such

113
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:30,240
that, well, what? John sees S and now S supports the truth of Mary runs. So one way

114
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:40,240
to put that is like this. Where that thing just means, well, that's from a set of

115
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:54,640
situations now in which Mary runs. So in other words, John sees some situation in

116
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,520
which Mary runs. And that would be, well, actually this is a simplified version of

117
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,560
a semantic rule for that kind of construction involving these oddball

118
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:13,320
infinitives. So what does it mean to see Mary run, let's say, or to see, let's say,

119
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,800
Fred trip and fall? It's going to mean something like that. John would see a

120
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,560
scene and that scene would support the truth of, in that case, Fred trips and

121
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,280
falls. And then we could actually see that there are some things that follow

122
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,760
from that. For example, when would a situation support Fred tripping and

123
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,160
falling? When it supports Fred tripping and also his falling, right? And so we'd

124
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,680
be able to say, ah, John sees Fred trip and fall. So John sees Fred fall. That

125
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,440
should be a legitimate inference. And that's something that would follow from

126
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,880
the semantical rules. Well, all right, but that's just a simple example of the

127
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,440
kind of things that people do in semantics. And indeed, there are things

128
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,520
that count as semantical rules. Ones that you're much more likely to have seen

129
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:12,200
are ones in basic logic. So for example, we could say, what is the meaning of

130
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:21,600
something like A and B? Well, think of that as something like the set of

131
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,840
possible worlds supporting the truth of A and B. And what would that be? Well, it

132
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,200
would be the set of possible worlds in which A is true, intersected with the

133
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,240
set of possible worlds in which B is true. And so that would be another form

134
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:46,480
that a semantical rule could take. Some of you are nodding appreciatively,

135
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,720
others are hating my guts right now. Yes. This makes sense, but can you relate a

136
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,720
little bit to the analyticity? Oh, yeah. Okay, good. So, right, here's a

137
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,200
semantical rule, let's say in our plotter. And now I say, aha. Okay, here's an

138
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:25,280
analytic set instead. If Fred tripped and fell, Fred fell. Now, actually, I'd have

139
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,680
to tell you about if then in order to really make this work. This is going to

140
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,600
follow from this together with something about if then. But that's going to end up

141
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,800
analytic because after all, Fred tripped and fell, that means our situation is one

142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,440
in which, well, this happened. But what is that? It's the intersection of those two

143
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,880
things. That means this happened there and this happened. So, it's going to follow

144
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,800
that Fred tripped and fell, Fred fell. And that would be that analytic because

145
00:12:50,920 --> 00:13:00,240
it's derivable from our semantical rules just using logic. Well, what's wrong with

146
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,040
that? Why can't we do this and have a good account of analyticity? Gwein does

147
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,640
think Carnap's come closer than anyone else to capturing what analyticity really

148
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,600
is. And so, suppose we try this strategy and say that's what an analytic statement

149
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,320
is. It's something that follows from our semantical rules. After all, what Gwein

150
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,280
is worried about are the things, not really so much the logical things,

151
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,760
strictly speaking, as the other things. So, presumably we're going to have not only

152
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,240
these kind, well, yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves. But we're going to have

153
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,480
to have semantical rules of a variety of kinds, right, to get something like

154
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,040
Bachelors of Unmarried Men. Now, why does he object to this strategy?

155
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,120
Why isn't that perfectly good? Imagine somebody studying linguistics now who

156
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,240
says, what do you mean? I'm taking semantics. We write down semantical rules

157
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,360
all the time. And we think things follow from those and are true just by virtue

158
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,680
of meanings. And that means we think they're analytic. And so, gosh, linguists use

159
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,200
this sort of thing all the time. That's wrong.

160
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Well, problem A, which isn't actually stressed by Klein, if you think about all

161
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Bachelors of Unmarried, what kind of semantical rule is going to give you that?

162
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,040
That depends on the lexical meanings of terms like Bachelor, right? And so,

163
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,960
we're actually going to have to have that as part of the semantical rules here,

164
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,960
lexicon. So, one objection that he doesn't really stress, but he could, is to say,

165
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,720
wait a minute, a lot of this is going to require a lexicon that's going to

166
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,520
actually specify meanings. But now we're back into the same problem of definition.

167
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Now we're going to have some dictionary that's basically going to give us a

168
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,160
bunch of definitions. But why don't we give us those definitions? Because it's

169
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,400
trying to match identities of meaning already. And as we've seen, metros gets

170
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,640
tied up with analyticity. So, we're back to the same problem we had before.

171
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah.

172
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
So, just to confirm, vocabulary is different to lexicon. And vocabulary is just a list of words

173
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,920
and lexicon times the meanings of the words.

174
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,360
Yeah, exactly. So, here we might have, you know, in the syntax we have a vocabulary

175
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,600
and that might include Bachelor. So, that'll just tell us sentences involving

176
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,680
Bachelor in the noun position are well-formed. But then here, it'll be

177
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:38,200
something like, ah, Bachelor, you know, noun unmarried man. So, we're going to, in

178
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,040
a sense, be back to the same problem we had. But that's not actually his main

179
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:55,720
objection. The main objection is this. What's a semantical rule? Why don't we just

180
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,160
start writing down every true sentence and calling this semantical rule? Okay. So,

181
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,400
gosh, John C. is very wrong. We have this account. Why don't we just keep going?

182
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,360
After all, here we've got something that goes beyond the bounds of ordinary

183
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,240
logic we were talking about basically seeing with respect to this kind of

184
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,680
construction. What about running? Should we have a logic of runs and start

185
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,880
writing down semantical rules for this? We actually had a PhD in philosophy a

186
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,640
number of years ago. Actually, we've had several who have gotten jobs at a

187
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:33,320
software company here in Austin. And their job is to sort of write down

188
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:40,600
axioms in a database that will allow it to interpret things it reads, things

189
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,400
that people say, and so forth. It's this huge database, actually, that's sort of

190
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,840
an encyclopedia of all sorts of things. And at one point I asked this guy, so

191
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,040
what are you working on? Because you have a little business card and it said

192
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,680
ontological engineer. I thought, all right, that's sort of awesome. What is an

193
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,960
ontological engineer? And he said, well, you know, it's basically we try to

194
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,800
systematize everything that's in your head and put it into a computer so the

195
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,400
artificial intelligence system can actually converse with you as if it were

196
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,480
human. And I said, okay, well, like for example, what are you working on right

197
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:23,080
now? He said, right now I'm working on the ontology of beds. I said, wait, beds?

198
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,760
Yeah, beds. Okay, well, what do you mean? There are beds, right? I thought that was

199
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,520
the ontology of beds. He said, no, no, no, you know, for example, Joe walks into a room

200
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,840
and sees a bed. Now, what do you have to know about that bed to figure out what

201
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,720
might happen next or to understand the subsequent discourse? Well, there's a head

202
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,920
of a bed and a foot of a bed. There's usually space under a bed. You can either

203
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,400
sit or lie down on top of the bed. Beds have flat surfaces. And then, you know,

204
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,560
they often have headboards and things like this. They often have pillows. They have

205
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:12,200
blankets. Now, it was important to know this because suppose the story goes, you

206
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,320
know, John got to his hotel. He walked into the room. He saw the bed. He put his,

207
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,120
um, yeah. What could we have happened? Okay, he sat down on the foot.

208
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,600
He said, what, whose foot? Right? His own foot? Did he sit on his own foot? No,

209
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,360
the foot of the bed, you have to understand. Was there somebody else in the room?

210
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,760
Stacked down on the foot? No. And so, in short, you have to sort of have the computer already

211
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,600
have a huge amount of world knowledge that we have already. But now, here's the significance

212
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,840
of this. How do we decide what of the entry, entries into that huge database

213
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,400
counts as a semantic rule about beds and what is just a fact about beds? How do we divide the

214
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,800
semantics from the world knowledge? Beds are, I mean, suppose I ask you, what is the definition of a bed?

215
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,080
It's sort of hard to say, right? A surface to sleep on.

216
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:22,280
A surface to sleep on. Yeah, but now, what about, how is that different from a cot or a house? Or,

217
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,000
yeah, a couch, people can sleep on a couch. Gosh, I've slept on floors. Actually, it's really good

218
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,600
for my back to sleep on. Right, a sort of back. Could you possibly describe it as a complex

219
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,120
comprising of symbols like the mattress in that comprise it for the function? Oh, you could start

220
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,760
saying, all right, yeah, I mean, a bed consists of a mattress. Evidently, Austin is big into beds,

221
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,800
by the way. I mean, everywhere I go, there are these mattress firm stores. That, and very close to

222
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,600
where I live there too, right across the street from each other. It's like, what? How many mattresses

223
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,280
does Austin need? But anyway, yeah, okay, you could define it in terms of its parts. You could say,

224
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,040
no, it's just its function, something to sleep on. You could start describing it in terms of its

225
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,920
typical shape, maybe. You could, anyway, all the point is, I don't know how to give you a definition

226
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,160
and how to separate the definition of bed from all these other things that are true of beds.

227
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,280
And bed isn't pretty unusual here. We would do the same thing if we talked about chairs or tables or

228
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,360
all sorts of things, actually, that we began to think about that are in common usage. There are

229
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,960
all these things that we commonly assume about them, and which of those are actually part of the

230
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,360
meaning, which are just commonly known facts, if you would want to put it in a database so that

231
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,320
it can help the computer understand the story, for example. Gosh, I don't know. And in effect,

232
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,360
Quine's saying it's an arbitrary choice. Some of those things, we designate as semantical rules.

233
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,760
Some we treat as world knowledge. But what really ultimately is the difference between

234
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,200
things that are true by virtue of meaning and things that are just commonly known?

235
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,640
He thinks it's impossible to tell. In the end, in word and object, in some later words, he does

236
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,600
define a notion of stimulus analyticity. But that's just something someone will immediately

237
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,240
accept to if they know the language. And he says, yes, that will include things like bachelors

238
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,160
are unmarried, but it will also include things like there are dogs. So it's not going to give you

239
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,840
actually a very good approximation to what philosophers have wanted by this notion of

240
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,440
analyticity. And so the basic objection to this is something like our objection to certain kinds

241
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:49,240
of definitions, that in the end, it feels arbitrary or circular. Either we do have some sense of what

242
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,120
really meaning is, but then we're back into the problem of meaning and sonotomy and all of that.

243
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Or we're just arbitrarily designating some of these as part of the definition of say,

244
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,760
bed, as opposed to a commonly known fact about bed. But there's really no way to draw that

245
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:12,520
distinction that is not ultimately arbitrary. Yeah. What is where the line falls between

246
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,760
synthetic analytic statements actually tell us about the world? Why is it so important for

247
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,480
ontology? Oh, right. Why is it important? Well, one reason is that if we have a distinction between

248
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:33,880
the analytic and the synthetic, we can say there are certain disciplines that fall on one side

249
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,680
and certain disciplines that fall on the other. So for example, if we're logists, for example,

250
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,360
at Fraga and Russell, and we say mathematics ultimately reduces to logic, we can put logic

251
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:53,320
and math on this side, we can put semantics on this side. And then over here we get physics and

252
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:01,480
psychology and biology and other natural sciences and so forth. And then the question is, what do

253
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:08,520
we do with philosophy? Well, we could, if we have this sharp distinction, think, oh, you know,

254
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:15,240
philosophy is a form of analysis. In fact, why is analytic philosophy called analytic philosophy?

255
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,200
Because it arises in the context of a sort of empiricism that says we can draw that distinction.

256
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,760
And over here, we can put philosophy because philosophy really consists in analysis. It's a

257
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:33,960
matter of analyzing concepts, serving as something like the logic of science, understanding what we

258
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,840
mean when we debate about whether people have free will. In short, the kind of thing that Air does

259
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,120
in language truth and logic. Or we could be like Kant and say, no, no, no, philosophy concerns itself

260
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,800
with the synthetic. But it's not just one more science, alongside physics and biology and chemistry

261
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,320
and psychology and so on. No, instead, philosophy appears over here. But what is it doing that's

262
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:08,040
distinctive? Well, it's really engaged in this transcendental enterprise. And that transcendental

263
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:15,240
enterprise is actually capable of giving us synthetic a priori truths. So on both sides,

264
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,840
you end up saying there's something a priori about philosophy, something that philosophy is doing just

265
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,840
through reflection that isn't dependent on experience. But what kind of truth is it giving you?

266
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,600
Well, maybe it's this. And so here we get human air and Russell

267
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:42,520
and Karnapp. Or it's doing this kind of thing. And if we're over here, maybe we have Kant or

268
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,280
Heidegger, it's involved in this sort of transcendental enterprise. Actually,

269
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,360
I think it's not just these guys, but many rationalists would put it over here too.

270
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:07,880
So maybe Descartes, Leibniz, I think Plato. And so in a certain sense, part of the reason

271
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,120
client cares is that he sees philosophy's self concept is often tied up with this distinction,

272
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,720
the vital terms of it. And if that distinction goes away, not only then is there no really

273
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,400
principle distinction on this sort of discipline and that sort of discipline,

274
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,440
but also then this way of understanding philosophy goes away. So what is philosophy now?

275
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,040
That's why he says there's a shift toward pragmatism, this result. Because in the end,

276
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,160
there's no way to really distinguish in principle what is philosophical. And I think that's what

277
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,640
client thinks. What's the difference between philosophy and physics or philosophy and psychology

278
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,800
or philosophy and linguistics? It's more or less that just philosophy is somewhat more general.

279
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,400
But whenever physicists start reflecting generally on the nature of reality or the nature of physical

280
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,560
law, whenever a psychologist says, so what does this really tell us about the mind,

281
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,080
they're really engaging in philosophical reflection. And it's really just kind of degrees

282
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,760
of generality. So the difference between philosophy and everything else is just a matter of degree.

283
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,840
More or less philosophers are just constantly involved in these reflective, extremely abstract,

284
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,320
rather vague enterprises. And as soon as you get more specific about it, you turn to a scientist.

285
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:31,000
So why did he say that he preferred logical, positive, positivism over pragmatism in the

286
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,360
office if this is? That's a great question. So if that's really the story in the end,

287
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,880
why isn't Quine, somebody who really doesn't engage so much with Russell and Carnap and so on,

288
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,000
but is writing about Dewey and James and Perse and so on, why doesn't he see himself clearly in

289
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,360
that pragmatic tradition? I think that is a really good question. You might think in the end,

290
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,960
he forced to choose, he ups with these guys, right? So what's going on there? I think partly

291
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,840
it's that he looks at this older pragmatist tradition, and he thinks it's just not precise

292
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:13,800
enough to actually give you any real information. So there's a way of being, of denying this distinction

293
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,240
being a pragmatist, that in a sense he thinks is going in the right direction, but he doesn't really

294
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,760
have much sympathy with that way of doing philosophy. And he sees it in people like Perse, James and Dewey,

295
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:35,400
where it's sort of suggestive, but on the other hand, not worked out. There are places in Quine,

296
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,960
especially in his 1969 book, Ontological Relativity and Other Essays, where he talks directly about

297
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,120
Dewey, and he says, I'm trying to give you a theory of language that's very similar to Dewey's

298
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,480
in a certain way. Dewey was hostile to this sort of picture of language where, I think in a language

299
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,320
is a name of something, it's a sort of museum metaphor. We take a term and we go off looking

300
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,800
in the museum for the thing that we can attach that label to. And he says, yeah, that's not the

301
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,080
right way to see language, so Dewey was right about that. But then he sort of forgets about Dewey,

302
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,640
and why? I think because in the end he thinks, Dewey gives you a good sort of picture of the way

303
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,280
things go, but gives you no real argument in favor of that. And in fact, the picture is so

304
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,960
that there's not that much to be learned from it. So in the end, I think he thinks

305
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,400
analytic philosophy does a better job, and logical empiricism even does a better job,

306
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,040
because at least it formulates precise questions and allows you to frame precise arguments.

307
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,240
He thinks in the end, some of its presuppositions are wrong. And those are things the pragmatists

308
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,000
are right about, but the pragmatists also are not in a position to do anything very interesting

309
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,840
with that. It's sort of like, let's say a great philosopher with brilliant ideas brings up a child

310
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,200
to have that perspective on the world, but not to actually have any of the arguments

311
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,680
be able to formulate anything precisely. And so this little kid kind of has, let's say,

312
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,840
the right philosophical ideas, but can't defend them, can't articulate them very clearly.

313
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,600
Quite almost sees the pragmatists as being like that child. And so I think in the end,

314
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,240
that's why, here at least is a method that he thinks is a useful method, whereas he doesn't

315
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,160
think the pragmatists historically had a very useful method, even though their views were in

316
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:35,000
the end closer to the truth. Yeah. I don't understand why the John Seesmerian

317
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,920
rule that you introduced, why would he say that that's arbitrary?

318
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,360
All right, good question. It's not just a rule of like seeing. You could substitute

319
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,880
other than like, John, here is Mary saying or whatever. Oh, right, exactly. It's a more general

320
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,800
rule than that. Yes, that's right. And in fact, in practice, linguists do this kind of thing all

321
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,760
the time. And if you said, well, gosh, is it part of personal medical rules that people see with

322
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:10,200
their eyes? The linguists would typically say, no, that's not really part of my theory. Why not?

323
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:21,000
Well, gosh, why not exactly? I think the linguists would typically say, because that doesn't really

324
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
fit into this compositional structure, that's not something that has to be built into the theory

325
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,920
of meaning. That's just an additional fact about seeing. And there is a kind of rough and ready

326
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:42,040
intuition that supports that thought, I think. So one of the things that lurks underneath this

327
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,120
and forms the foundation of a number of people like Rice and Strauss are not projecting to what

328
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,760
Kwan does, is the thought that, look, actually, in practice, linguists don't have any proof

329
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,320
figuring out what they should write down as a semantical rule and what they would actually

330
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,400
account as a bit of world knowledge about things. There's huge agreement in the linguistic community

331
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,440
about that. And the same thing is true about logic. We don't have any problem writing down things

332
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,600
about and or even about knows that and things like that. And so why, if nobody seems that confused

333
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:19,160
about this, we should re-attack the distinction. There must be something that we're all responding

334
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,360
to here. Now, in the end, is the analysis is going to be, well, we're responding to distance from

335
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,320
the edge of experience or something like that. And so the analytic truths are going to be the ones

336
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,080
here that are pretty far from empirical dependency. And so they're going to be

337
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,760
way in the center of the level of belief. But in the end, it's a matter of degree.

338
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,960
And this is why there will be vague cases in the boundaries and blah, blah, blah.

339
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,240
I think to get a better answer than that, though, what we really need to do is think,

340
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,480
what exactly is coin objecting to? Is he saying there's no way to draw the distinction? Because

341
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,440
you might think, what we're doing to give you a semantic theory is drawing the distinction.

342
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,760
So what do you mean we can't do it? That's like saying we can't do semantics,

343
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,520
but people do semantics all the time. So we've got to distinguish, I think, several questions.

344
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:24,520
One is, what coin is really done? And let me see where I can put this. Let me get rid of this.

345
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:37,080
What coin is really done, in a sense, is say, analytic is part of a set of concepts, meaning

346
00:32:37,640 --> 00:33:01,320
synonymy. Definition. Substitution. Substitutability. Substitution. And semantic rule.

347
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh, I could put a certain kind of necessity in here, too. And he's in the end saying,

348
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,640
we've got this whole set of concepts, and we can characterize them in terms of one another.

349
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,920
And we do, to a surprising degree, agree about how to use these things. But here's the thing.

350
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:29,240
He thinks they're all, in a sense, ill-founded. He wants to find some way of making sense of them.

351
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,280
From outside that circle. Now, one response is to say, why? The circle is fine as it is.

352
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,880
If I say I define courage in terms of bravery and bravery in terms of courage, that's not very

353
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,600
illuminating. But you might still say, but I'm right, right? And it would be very strange to say,

354
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,840
so there's no such thing as courage as a result of that. So what is he really concerned about?

355
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,440
To some extent, I think this is developing within the context of logical empiricism.

356
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:05,160
And he's thinking, okay, what is logical empiricism all about in the end? Observation,

357
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,360
right? Bringing things back to observation. And so he's thinking, I don't know how to give

358
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,920
an observational account of any of these. How do I explain, in terms of observation,

359
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,640
what any single one of those is? You might think, oh, I observed definitions in the dictionary.

360
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,200
Yeah, but they're putting them in the dictionary because of some identity of meaning,

361
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:33,000
Zanari, let's say. But how do I characterize that in terms of observation? The closest I could come,

362
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,720
maybe, is the terms are used in exactly the same way. And so something like a criterion of

363
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,000
substitutability. But we saw that doesn't really work either. That's neither necessary nor sufficient.

364
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,280
And so in short, he ends up saying, this whole structure is something that we would really like

365
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:57,480
to find the foundation with respect to observation, with respect to usage, with respect to behavior,

366
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,520
something we can actually pin down from the perspective of a logical empiricism. And it's

367
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,040
all sort of floating up there, and it's something we can't find any observational content to.

368
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,880
So one way of looking at it is to say, within the project of logical empiricism,

369
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,280
he can't find any way of making sense of what it is. Now, if you frame it that way,

370
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,960
you've got a reason why this is an objection to people like A.R. and Russell and Karnan.

371
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,240
You don't have much of a reason why anyone on the other side should care about this,

372
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,640
because you can have cards or Heidegger or Descartes or whatever saying. But I don't start

373
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,440
with those purposes. I don't care about resting this on observation. Why should I care? So that's

374
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,680
best an answer that will explain why these people are going to be in trouble here,

375
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,520
because on their own likes, they can't really assign any of this any meaning. Yeah.

376
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,160
Sorry. It's been a long week. And so this was just to explain the

377
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
why semantic rules are put into the creature?

378
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,920
Well, no. Really, now I'm trying to respond to the question of what's going to be your picture

379
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,360
here? What's the real objection come to? And I think it comes down to the fact that these

380
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,800
concepts can all be defined in terms of one another, but there's no way to define any of them

381
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,040
in terms that are outside of that. And in particular, that would rest on something like

382
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,280
observation or behavior or usage or something we could tie these down to in ways that don't already

383
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,600
involve something that's in that circle. Yeah. On the analytic synthetic kind of

384
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:35,560
way of looking at things, where would art be? Where would art be? Well, art isn't really giving us

385
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:43,320
truths, you might think. And so it doesn't really have propositional content that would allow us

386
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,280
to classify them one way or another. For example, suppose I say, ah, you want to work at artwork,

387
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,800
I will now give you an artwork. This is Bonnevac's logical empiricism defined.

388
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,440
Okay. So we've constructed a lot of symbols. Oh, I should put a lamp this morning.

389
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,000
There. Now, there's no propositional content to that, right? I haven't said anything. I haven't

390
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,040
asserted anything. So if you say, is that analytic or synthetic? It's kind of like, yeah,

391
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,920
there's nothing there to be analytic or synthetic. Now, as soon as I say things about it on the other

392
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,320
hand, so art criticism or that sort of thing will have to find a place somewhere. If I say,

393
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,760
ah, that's a terrible work of art, right? Where do I put aesthetic judgments like that?

394
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,880
Presumably it's not through my definition that it's a bad work of art. That's something that would

395
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,440
require some content. So presumably something like that would be synthetic. Now, in so far as

396
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,680
it's a value in it, it raises special philosophical questions because what about all value judgments

397
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,960
like that's a bad work of art or that was a bad action or something. Presumably those are typically

398
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,440
going to be synthetic claims, though they might have a special status and make us worry about

399
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,280
things. But most normative claims are going to end up being over here on the synthetic side.

400
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,000
Things like murder is wrong or that's a bad work of art. Now that I look at it.

401
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,280
My drawing teacher would be very happy because it was very fast. Oh yes, the faster you draw it,

402
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,400
the more you get the essence of the object. You can actually see some of the face in the middle

403
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,760
of a little bit. Oh, you sort of can. Yeah, there's a little bit like Wittgenstein.

404
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,560
And it's on a blackboard like that famous portrait of Wittgenstein in front of the

405
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,920
blind board. So see, it not only is a nice work of art in there, it contains allusions of other

406
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:55,080
works of art. See, you just see more and more levels as you come. This is the kind of thing that

407
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:01,800
got me an A in art. See what's going on. Oh, that's a great idea. Okay, well, never mind that.

408
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,800
Yeah, oh yes, we've got five minutes left and we haven't even moved on to the second dog.

409
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,960
So by the after spring break, we'll forget what the second dog even is. So let's talk about the

410
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:24,760
second dog. It's one about reduction. And it turns out to be, well, we can take it as really

411
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,520
reduction in something like the sense that Frege and Russell were concerned with, the

412
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,840
reducibility of mathematics for logic. But in a certain sense, I think we can characterize

413
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,120
what Klein's doing here much more simply without going into the details of that.

414
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,120
So suppose we just thought of it this way. For any sentence,

415
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,800
S, let's say,

416
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:55,560
there are sets of observations

417
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,360
that would confirm

418
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,960
or disconfirm

419
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,640
S. And let's call these, oh, I don't know, like O plus and O minus.

420
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:27,720
Okay. O plus here would be the set of observations that would tend to confirm

421
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,920
sentence S and O minus the set of observations that would tend to disconfirm S.

422
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,680
So now, if we actually could do that, if we could associate with any sentence,

423
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,080
whether we call that its meaning or not, presumably people like A are saying that is the

424
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,000
meaning of S. But whether or not we say that, we could say, all right, if we can characterize

425
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,960
sentences in terms of pairs of sets of observations that would confirm them or

426
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:00,120
disconfirm them, then we could say, aha, then we can define analyticity. S is analytic

427
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,080
if and only if every observation

428
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:19,480
is in that O plus or S. Yes, we should make that specific to that sentence.

429
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,360
Okay. So everything confirms it, then we make it an analytic truth. Yeah.

430
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,160
Oh, well, I've been thinking, and this has popped up before in class,

431
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,840
where like this sentence is false, like as, how do we apply that?

432
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,800
Good point. What will happen if we have a paradoxical sentence?

433
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:51,960
This sentence is false. What confirms that? Oh, you might think nothing confirms that, right?

434
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,120
Suppose there were an observation that confirmed it. Well, then it would imply that it was false,

435
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:02,040
but that would disconfirm it. And so, what if something disconfirmed it? Well,

436
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,160
it says it's false, so that would actually confirm it. And so, you could be thinking, oh,

437
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,720
gosh, I get every observation both confirms and disconfirms it, or maybe you could think,

438
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,600
actually, nothing ends up really confirming it or disconfirming it.

439
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,800
I haven't said anything about what the relationship between these would be, but if we say,

440
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,920
assume these are disjoint sets and nothing both confirms and disconfirms the sentence,

441
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,800
then we would end up saying, gosh, yeah, maybe a paradoxical sentence is one,

442
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,560
which is going to look actually very much like a meaningless sentence.

443
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,240
The way the logical empiricists understand it, no observation would confirm or disconfirmed.

444
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,680
So, you might say, if S has no empirical content,

445
00:42:50,280 --> 00:43:01,240
if and only if O plus S and O minus S are just the empty set, nothing confirms it,

446
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,560
nothing disconfirms it. And paradoxical sentences would probably end up being in that sort of

447
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:14,600
thing. So, it would end up saying, yeah, this sentence is false, that has no empirical content.

448
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,560
But admittedly, that's a trickier problem and it might give us headaches for other reasons as

449
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,120
soon as we think about what truth means more broadly. But anyway, this at least has some hope.

450
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,600
So, suppose we were able to do this, what's quite a subjection to that? This is actually,

451
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,840
in a sense, what Carnap is trying to do, ultimately, at a certain stage of his thought.

452
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,600
What? What? What's wrong with that?

453
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:53,800
Ground time! But I'm not going to say the answer comes next time, because actually,

454
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,960
next time we won't have class and your offer spring break and no one will remember the question.

455
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:05,560
So, what we're going to do is just make, look, it's one answer, do head, okay? These things

456
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,240
don't face the tribunal of experience one-on-one. We have to do our examination of what confirms

457
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,200
or disconfirms in the context of about a broader theory. And so, in the end, he says it's really

458
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,160
all of science together that confronts the tribunal of experience, not each sentence together.

459
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,480
So, in short, he says there's really no way to define O plus and O minus here,

460
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,280
because we only know what confirms or disconfirms something in the context of a background theory.
