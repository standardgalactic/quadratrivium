00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Today, our topic is transcendental arguments.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,860
It's a very special kind of argument.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,800
It's one first found in the work of Immanuel Kant, who writes the critique of pure reason

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,920
and includes within it a big section called the transcendental deduction.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,280
In the first edition it takes one form, it takes a second form in the second edition,

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,840
he almost completely rewrites the argument there, and it is the critical argument of

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
the work.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,160
Also the one that people most associate with Kant.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,400
But if we analyze the form of the argument, I think we'll see that it has a very general

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,720
structure and you can find it in all sorts of places in the history of philosophy.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,800
It's a very powerful kind of argument and not only subsequently the Kant have philosophers

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,840
thought a lot about it, people like Hegel and Heidegger for example, but also if you

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,760
go back in time, I think you can find similar arguments in Plato, in Augustine, in Anselm,

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,520
in a variety of other thinkers, who are all contemplating this general kind of structure.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,480
Now what is a transcendental argument?

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,360
Well let's start with a much simpler form of argument to which it bears a close relation.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
That is to say modus ponens.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,480
Modus ponens is often taken to be the fundamental form of inference, in fact in some logical

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,240
systems it is the only rule of inference, and it says this, if p then q, p therefore

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
q.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,480
So let's write that out in a more precise and more abstract form.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,120
Here's the general structure of an argument for modus ponens.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:46,440
We have some sentence, let's just say a, and then we have a claim, if a, then b, we

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,360
include therefore b, okay?

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,720
So if it's sunny out, the streets aren't wet, it is sunny out.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,800
So the streets aren't wet.

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Or if Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,800
That's a very simple form of argument, familiar to most of us, anybody who's studied introductory

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,520
logic knows all about modus ponens, or it's sometimes called a rule of conditional exploitation

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,520
or conditional elimination, and so it's a very familiar kind of logical structure.

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Now then, what's a transcendental argument?

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,600
It makes a few small changes in the form of modus ponens, but it does it in a way that

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,000
makes that argument immensely powerful.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So at first it's going to seem like magic, but I'll argue it isn't magic.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,440
So first of all, what's the change?

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Well, we take that premise, a, and we simply weaken it, actually, to possibly a.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,060
It's possible to a, in other words.

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,140
And so you might think, well, gee, okay, I don't see how that's going to help me.

40
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,660
I now have a weaker premise.

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,380
Well it's going to be a huge advantage if I can get the same or even stronger conclusion

42
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,020
out of a weaker premise.

43
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,540
That makes it a much more powerful argument.

44
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,580
So let's take that, possibly a.

45
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,780
Now I simply say, well, if possibly a, then b.

46
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,940
But I want this not only to be true, but necessarily true.

47
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,420
So I'm going to say, necessarily, if possibly a, then b.

48
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,180
You might think, okay, okay, I see.

49
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,420
It's just modus ponens with, instead of a, possibly a.

50
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,740
So if possibly a, if possibly a, then b, therefore b.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,380
Huh, that's no big deal.

52
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,620
Indeed, that would be no big deal.

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,060
But look what I'm going to write.

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,700
I'm not going to write down b.

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm going to write down necessarily b.

56
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,780
So what have I done?

57
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,620
First of all, I've replaced a over here in the premises with possibly a.

58
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,260
So first big change is that I've weakened what I need for those premises.

59
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,500
At least I've weakened this premise.

60
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,340
I don't need that a is even true anymore.

61
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,940
I just need that it's possible.

62
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,460
Second major change is that I've changed the antecedent of this conditional correspondingly.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,500
Well, okay, that does make this a stronger conditional.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,380
Now it's not just saying that if a is true, b follows, it's saying if a is even possible

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
to be followed.

66
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,100
So that's making a stronger, much more powerful claim.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,380
So if I've weakened this, I've strengthened this.

68
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,060
But I've also strengthened it in another way, I've said necessarily.

69
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,180
I've said that connection is necessarily true.

70
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,220
Now a lot of the connections we talk about in ordinary life are not like that.

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,540
They're contingent connections.

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,380
They don't have to be necessarily true.

73
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,460
And so if that's the case, you could say, well, this isn't going to work because the

74
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,100
connection I have in mind is not necessary.

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,740
This is a form of argument that won't work in those contingent contexts, but it will work

76
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,740
when we're dealing with logic, when we're dealing with metaphysics, when we're dealing

77
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,500
with things where there really are necessary connections.

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,940
It may even work in natural science when we're thinking about scientific laws because there

79
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,540
we have in mind law like necessary connections between things.

80
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,260
And so it's quite plausible in those cases to say, look, it doesn't just so happen.

81
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,780
For example, that if I release this, it will fall.

82
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
There's a necessity to that.

83
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,500
If I release this, it has to fall.

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,420
And so whenever we've got that kind of necessity to our connection, this is a form of argument

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,580
that we could apply.

86
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,300
Now the conclusion is really the big change, though.

87
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,060
I don't just get, it is a fact that be, I get be is necessary, it is a necessary truth

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,500
that be, and that's a much more powerful conclusion.

89
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,820
Now why does this even follow?

90
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,820
It's something that doesn't follow in every system of modal logic.

91
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,980
There are systems for possibility and necessity that would say this form of argument does

92
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,220
not work.

93
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,140
But it works in the most popular and the oldest form of modal logic, the logic of possibility

94
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,260
and necessity.

95
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,780
It's called S5 after the work of C.I. Lewis, who developed five systems of modal logic

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,860
and S5 was the most powerful one.

97
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,020
This is the system that is taken for granted by figures including Ansem, Aquinas, Leibniz,

98
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,340
Kant, and so on.

99
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,500
And here's what it says, necessity is truth in all possible worlds.

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,380
Possibility is truth in some possible worlds.

101
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,500
So we could think of it this way, imagine a class of possible worlds.

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,940
These are possible circumstances, possible situations, if you will, cases to which we

103
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:39,460
might apply these various claims about metaphysics, about law-like connections in science, about

104
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,420
logic, and so forth.

105
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,940
And so we're thinking of these as our possibilities.

106
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,300
Now I'm going to put us here, let's let this world, W0, be the actual world.

107
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,660
We're actually here.

108
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,820
In this world, what do we know?

109
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,780
Well, possibly A is true in our world here.

110
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,020
And so I'm going to write that as logicians would, not with the word possibly, but with

111
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,340
a diamond to represent possibility.

112
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,780
Okay, so A is not necessarily true here, but possibly A is.

113
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,340
What can we infer from that?

114
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,420
Well, necessarily, if possibly A then B. So since this is a necessary truth, this connection

115
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,100
holds in every possible world, it holds here.

116
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,900
So if possibly A is true here, B is true here.

117
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,700
Okay, so far so good.

118
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,180
That would give us this conclusion.

119
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,980
That's really just an application of modus ponens.

120
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,600
We didn't need the necessarily at all.

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,740
But now, what else can we infer?

122
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,940
How do we get this necessarily?

123
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,060
Well possibly A is true here.

124
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,060
And I said that possibly A means that A is true in some possible worlds.

125
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,460
So let's take one of those worlds, we'll call it W1, and assume that A is true in that world.

126
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:59,180
So we go to that world W1, this other situation where A is true.

127
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,340
Right now I'm wearing a yellow striped shirt.

128
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,460
I could be wearing a blue shirt.

129
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,300
So here it's possible for me to wear a blue shirt.

130
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,340
In this world I'm actually wearing the blue shirt.

131
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,540
Well good, what's true here?

132
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,340
Well if A is true there, of course possibly A is also true at that world.

133
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:24,460
But in addition, since it's a necessary truth that if possibly A then B, B is true at that world.

134
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,820
Okay, so far so good.

135
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,220
But we want to know whether B is true in every single world, not just in some possible world.

136
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,140
So far all we get out of that is something we could have gotten anyway, which is possibly B.

137
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,700
So big deal.

138
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,500
That gives me B's truth in some possible worlds, but not in all of them.

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,780
To establish that, I need to show that B is true in just some arbitrarily selected world.

140
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,140
Any world at all that we pick out of this set.

141
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,820
So I'm going to pick some arbitrary world over here.

142
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,700
Let's call it W2.

143
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,260
And I need to convince you that B is true there.

144
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,820
Why would that be true?

145
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,580
Well look at it this way.

146
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,180
A is true here, right?

147
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,900
And it's one of these possibilities.

148
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,340
That means from the point of view of this world, well A is possible.

149
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,060
Here's a situation where it would hold.

150
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,940
So we can say, look, A isn't necessarily true down in this world, but possibly A is.

151
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,580
Because A is true up there.

152
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,780
Now I've said, hey, wait a minute.

153
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,340
It's a necessary truth that if possibly A then B.

154
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,180
So B has to hold good in this world.

155
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,540
Ooh, B true here, B true here.

156
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,620
B true in this arbitrarily selected world.

157
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,860
Now I didn't pull any tricks there.

158
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,700
After all, you might say, well, that works for this world.

159
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,900
Will it work for any other world?

160
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,300
Yeah, let's take W3.

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,580
Possibly A is going to be true here because of that world.

162
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,260
And so big surprise, B has to be true with that world.

163
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,700
Pick any world in here that you like, B has to be true.

164
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,140
That means B is necessarily true.

165
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,100
Something that logicians would write with a box to indicate necessarily.

166
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,340
B is a necessary truth, but that's exactly the conclusion we wanted.

167
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,780
Moreover, take a look at all these other worlds.

168
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,140
Because no matter where we pick in here, B is going to have to be true.

169
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,860
All of these worlds will be B worlds, which means that in every single one of

170
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,140
these worlds, we don't just get B, we get necessarily B.

171
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,780
Now in general, that form of argument is one that assumes that all of

172
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,900
these worlds are in it together.

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,260
And what I mean is to say that all of them define a sphere of possibility.

174
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,940
That is the sphere of possibility for all of them.

175
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,620
Now, for certain kinds of necessity, that seems pretty reasonable.

176
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,220
Metaphysical necessity, logical necessity.

177
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,780
It seems like, yes, we can talk about the logically possible worlds.

178
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,180
Or the metaphysically possible worlds.

179
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,380
That's not something, for example, that changes over time.

180
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,660
But on the other hand, there are lots of senses of possibility,

181
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,940
where things do change over time and we can't go back.

182
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,660
So for example, what can I do with the rest of my life?

183
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,700
Well, there are lots of things I can do, but I can't change the past.

184
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,460
And so what I've done in the past, I can't change.

185
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,900
I can change the future, but I can't change the past.

186
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,220
And that tells you that as we go along through time,

187
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,500
the sphere of our options, the sphere of our possibilities tends to shrink.

188
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,020
Of course, I might develop a new skill and

189
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,460
all of a sudden new things become possible for me.

190
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,700
So the range of possibilities changes over time.

191
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,500
That is to say the real possibilities for a human life.

192
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,020
What Heidegger would call my horizon is something that can shrink,

193
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,340
but maybe can also expand depending on how I think about abilities,

194
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,660
capacities, and so on.

195
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,660
However, here in the realm of all, you might say, logically possible situations,

196
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,700
or all physically possible situations.

197
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,940
Maybe if I'm abstracting from where I am now in time and

198
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,780
just thinking about all possible physical configurations of the universe.

199
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,700
Or I'm thinking about all metaphysical possibilities.

200
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,140
And then this principle seems quite reasonable.

201
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,060
There is just one set of all the possibilities, and

202
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,860
they all are relevant to all the others.

203
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,140
And when I've got that kind of situation, this form of argument works.

204
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,660
So far I've been talking about the logic of this situation.

205
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,060
The logic of transcendental arguments.

206
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,100
But you might say, well, big deal, okay, I see the logical point.

207
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,500
You weaken an important premise, you get a much stronger conclusion, and

208
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,060
you do it by making those two changes in the other premise.

209
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,100
Good for you.

210
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,660
That's very interesting, but what can you do with this?

211
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,380
Well, I've said it was Immanuel Kant who really first gave these their name of

212
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,020
transcendental arguments and brought people's attention to them.

213
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,900
And here's what he does with it.

214
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,980
This is a passage from the critique of Pure Reason.

215
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,780
All necessity, without exception, is grounded in a transcendental condition.

216
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,380
There must therefore be a transcendental ground of the unity of consciousness in

217
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,420
the synthesis of the manifold of all our intuitions.

218
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,020
This must consequently also be a transcendental ground of the concept of objects in general.

219
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,780
And so of all objects of experience, a ground without which it would be impossible to think

220
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,900
any object for our intuitions.

221
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,180
For this object is no more than that something, the concept of which expresses such a necessity

222
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,700
of synthesis.

223
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,500
At one other point, he says it even more directly and clearly, this original and transcendental

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,100
condition is no other than transcendental aperception.

225
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,940
But what is Kant doing here?

226
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,340
He's saying, in order for me to have, not just if I have experience, then I have, for

227
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,740
example, a unity of consciousness, a transcendental aperception, or something of that kind.

228
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,980
So I do.

229
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,380
He is saying, experience of the world is possible, experience of objects is possible, experience

230
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,060
of myself is possible.

231
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,660
What makes those possible?

232
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,220
What are the necessary conditions for the possibility of something?

233
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,720
A transcendental argument is an argument about the necessary conditions for the possibility

234
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,220
of something.

235
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,780
So let's take a look at this premise.

236
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:20,820
If possibly a, then b, I'm asking about the necessary conditions of the possibility of

237
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,300
something, the things that are necessary conditions for something, not just to be true, but even

238
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,180
to be possible.

239
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,900
That's what a transcendental argument is all about.

240
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,500
And so Kant is saying, how could I have experience of the world?

241
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,780
How could I have experience of objects in the world?

242
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,980
You convinced him that actually my experience is highly varied.

243
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,780
It's a manifold of intuition, as he puts it, that is to say, my senses give me just this

244
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,580
huge flux of information.

245
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,140
It's not just experience as if it's one thing, actually.

246
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,540
It's a matter of thoughts and feelings and perceptions.

247
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:02,180
And the perceptions are combinations of, well, visual elements, auditory elements.

248
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
I can smell.

249
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
I can taste.

250
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
I can touch.

251
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,480
I may have a sense of motion.

252
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,180
There are all these things that go into my senses, and somehow they all get put together

253
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,180
into a unified perception.

254
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,300
And then I combine those perceptions into an object.

255
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:28,360
And then I categorize that object as, for example, a hand or a marker or a whiteboard

256
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,860
or a camera.

257
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:37,660
And what I'm doing when I do that is a multi-stage process of combining sensations into sensations

258
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,900
of an object, and then thinking in terms of the category of that object, that object

259
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,260
I recognize as a something.

260
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,100
It's this such, as Aristotle would have put it, a substance, this hand.

261
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,660
And so what's happening here is I've got some perceptions, then across time I have

262
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,660
other perceptions of the hand, and I end up saying that's a hand, and I group all those

263
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,420
together as one object.

264
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,860
How do I do that?

265
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,740
There must be something that enables me to do it.

266
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,580
There must be a unity in consciousness where I put all this stuff together and it gets

267
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,380
unified somewhere.

268
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,900
His objection to Hume is that Hume just has a bundle here, but there's nothing that can

269
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,160
do the bundling.

270
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,900
There is nothing that can put them all together.

271
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,020
There's no place where all of those perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and so forth can be combined

272
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,620
into one thing.

273
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,220
For that combination to be possible, he says, it is a necessary truth that I have to have

274
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,980
a unity of consciousness, the transcendental unity of our perception.

275
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:44,540
Moreover, I must have innate concepts, things that he considers the categories, the logical

276
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,940
functions of judgment give us the clue to the categories, their necessary conditions

277
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:56,000
for the possibility of that last stage of my grouping these perceptions under the heading

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,740
of some concept or other, and then sometimes connecting those concepts, connecting those

279
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,860
things, seeing the links between objects, the relations between them.

280
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,740
Well, that general form of argument is something that then has this structure in mind.

281
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,460
Experience of objects is possible.

282
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,260
I'm doing it right now.

283
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,300
Necessarily, if it's possible, then there must be a unity in consciousness.

284
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,100
So necessarily there is a unity in consciousness, the thing that he calls the transcendental

285
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,220
unity of our perception.

286
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,340
This form of argument had been found earlier in Descartes.

287
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:39,460
In fact, it's how Descartes tries to break out of just having the I think I am as things

288
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,820
of which he can be certain.

289
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,700
Many readers have said, wait, he goes from I think I am, I can be sure of that, to suddenly

290
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,020
I can trust my clear and distinct ideas.

291
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,940
And they say, well, wait, that you can trust one or two clear and distinct ideas that I

292
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,260
don't see why you get to trust all of them.

293
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,300
That seems like a bad inference.

294
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,060
And so they've accused him of committing a fallacy.

295
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,180
But from this point of view, it's not fallacy.

296
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:11,580
What he's saying is, I have complete faith that I am, I have complete faith that I think

297
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,860
if I doubt either one of those, well, doubting is thinking.

298
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,260
First of all, it's actually I'm doubting, so there must be a me to do the doubting.

299
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,580
Consequently, he ends up saying, look, it is possible for me to be certain of something.

300
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,700
But what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of certainty?

301
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,540
Well, I have a clear and distinct perception that the I think could not be false.

302
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,060
I have a clear and distinct perception that I am could not be false as long as I'm here

303
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,260
to think it or say it.

304
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,820
So now I look at I say, aha, so it is possible for me to be certain of some things.

305
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,480
But necessarily if I'm certain of something, then I've got to be able to trust my clear

306
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,980
and distinct perceptions.

307
00:18:50,980 --> 00:19:05,700
So necessarily I can trust my clear and distinct perceptions.

308
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,780
We find a similar form of argument in a lot of other thinkers.

309
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,260
In later thinkers, for example, in Heidegger, he begins to ask, well, Caught, you did a

310
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,460
great job.

311
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,980
You've said it is a necessary condition for the possibility of experience of objects that

312
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,620
I have a unity of consciousness, your transcendental unity of that perception.

313
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,860
But now what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of that?

314
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,780
And in fact, what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of existence, of being,

315
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:40,020
not just of the I think I am, but of anything being at all.

316
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,100
And those are questions that lead Heidegger into very deep metaphysics.

317
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,700
And by the end of his thinking, really, into saying, whatever the answer is, it's inexpressible.

318
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,140
Language cannot take me there.

319
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,380
Conceptual thinking cannot take me there.

320
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,340
But we can back up in time.

321
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,020
I think a similar form of argument takes place even in Plato, where Plato is thinking, look,

322
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,900
it is possible for me to categorize things, for me to recognize something as a triangle,

323
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
for example.

324
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,820
But what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of the recognition of something

325
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,300
as a triangle?

326
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:20,140
Well, if it's possible for me to see that thing as a triangle, I must be able to apprehend

327
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,180
the concept of triangularity.

328
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,220
I must have the concept of triangularity, and I can have it only by apprehending triangularity.

329
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,780
So necessarily, I apprehend the form of triangularity.

330
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,500
We see this in Anselm in the ontological argument.

331
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,100
And here I think there's a brilliant twist, because Anselm notices, actually, what if

332
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,900
A and B are the same thing?

333
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
So what would we get then?

334
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:51,940
We would get, well, possibly, and here I'll just use G for God exists.

335
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,340
And to simplify the writing, I'll just put the diamond and the box for possibly and

336
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,620
necessarily.

337
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,340
He says, look, it is possible that God exists.

338
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,460
God is that the greater than which cannot be conceived?

339
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,900
And I have the idea of that.

340
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,500
It's certainly conceivable.

341
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,780
I think that what is conceivable is possible.

342
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,060
Now, potentially, big jump, big place you could object right there.

343
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,460
Maybe we should read this as it's conceivable that G to be faithful to what he says, but

344
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,140
for the moment, just go with me, okay?

345
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,900
Possibly God exists.

346
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,340
But wait a minute, if it's possible that God exists, then God exists.

347
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,180
And I'm going to say that whole thing is necessary.

348
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,620
Conclusion, necessarily God exists.

349
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Notice what I've done.

350
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,540
I've just replaced A and B with G. God exists here.

351
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,500
And I get, if it's even possible for God to exist, then God does exist.

352
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,700
In other words, God's existence can't be contingent.

353
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,140
It would be equivalent to say, if God exists, then God exists necessarily.

354
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,180
Maybe we can turn this around and you would find it more plausible.

355
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,540
If I simply say, well, yeah, that seems kind of like cheating.

356
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,980
But let's do it this way.

357
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,220
If God exists, then necessarily God exists.

358
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,660
Conclusion, necessarily God exists.

359
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,660
That more clearly says God's existence can't just be contingent.

360
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,020
If God exists at all, God is necessarily existent.

361
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,300
So I think Anson's ontological argument has the same logical structure.

362
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,460
It too is a transcendental argument.

363
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,260
It's saying God's existence is a necessary condition for the possibility of God's existence,

364
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,860
for in effect God's conceivability.

365
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,420
And then once we see that, we can recognize the argument that Descartes uses in the Third

366
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,260
Meditation has the same basic structure.

367
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,180
It looks like a causal argument and it goes into complexities about formal and objective

368
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,060
reality, and so almost no other philosopher has said that argument is worth really trying

369
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,260
to resuscitate or take seriously.

370
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,180
But from this point of view, it's not so strange.

371
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,740
What we're really saying there is, well, something closely related to Anson, but not

372
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,980
quite the same, he's saying here, it's possible for me to have a concept of God.

373
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
I do have the idea of God, he says.

374
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,800
I have an idea of a perfect being.

375
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,020
But necessarily, if it's even possible for me to have such a concept, then God must

376
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
exist.

377
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,580
And here's the causal part of the argument, where else could I have gotten the concept?

378
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,620
So he argues, since I can't explain any acquisition of that concept from experience, it must be

379
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,100
a priori, but how could it be a priori unless God put it there?

380
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,060
In any case, I'll leave that part out.

381
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,540
But I think that's part of how he supports this claim, that God's existence is a necessary

382
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,140
condition for the possibility of me even thinking of God.

383
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,580
So it's possible for me to think of God, but a necessary condition for the possibility

384
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,380
of thinking about God is the existence of God, so necessarily God exists.

385
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,940
That in a nutshell is the third meditation argument for God's existence.

386
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:06,220
Well all of these arguments, from Plato, from Anselm, from Descartes, from Kant, from Heidegger,

387
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,300
have this same basic structure.

388
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,660
It's a very powerful sort of structure, and it's a structure that I think you need to

389
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,220
take seriously and think hard about, because you're going to find this popping up in philosopher

390
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,780
after philosopher.

391
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,540
Not only philosophers of historical significance, but on the contemporary scene as well.

392
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,900
So the critical question behind any transcendental argument is simply this, what are the necessary

393
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,780
conditions for the possibility of something?

394
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,980
And if that thing is even possible, then those necessary conditions aren't just conditions

395
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,260
that hold, they hold necessarily.
