00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,160
Hi, today I want to talk about the philosophy of Hegel, one of the last great system builders.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,800
I am going to ignore the warning of some analytic philosophers that one must never finagle with

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Hegel, there can be no apology for his phenomenology, and instead talk about some of the ideas in

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,200
his work, The Phenomenology of Spirit, and a number of other works, especially we're

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,720
going to focus on Hegel's dialectic, his way of thinking about the way in which thought

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,440
is transformed, the dynamics of thought, if you will, the way it changes over time.

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,600
Logicians tend to think about the logical relations among propositions, what's a premise,

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,440
what's a conclusion, and so forth.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,080
It's a very static picture.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,040
Occasionally they talk about how language changes, a logic might try to take into account

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,920
the fact that sentences are said in sequences, building on one another, not merely as sets

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,240
that all somehow get presented at the same time, but most logical systems abstract away

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
from all of that.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,400
Hegel thinks that the most fundamental ideas of logic, however, should have to do with

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,240
the dynamics of thought, the way in which thought progresses, thought changes.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,640
And that's a very different conception, so logicians who pick up Hegel's logic are

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,440
going to be surprised, they're going to be finding very little that's familiar, and

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,520
a great deal that seems to them very, very strange.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,360
It's because Hegel is interested in those dynamic questions, not in the static question

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,240
of how this proposition relates to that proposition, but instead how people thinking about a problem

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,440
in a certain way or having a certain kind of view are going to find themselves confronted

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,400
with things that will then lead them to think about things in a different way.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,760
So he's interested in something like the dynamics of thinking, whereas you might say that most

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,320
logicians are focused on the statics or the kinematics at most of thinking.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,600
So Hegel is giving us a very different conception, not just of logic, but of the philosophy of

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,440
mind, of the nature of the world than we find in earlier philosophers, and his impact over

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,240
the last two centuries has been immense.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,920
Let's begin by recalling some key facts about Kant.

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,960
Kant's rationalism held that there were innate ideas, pure concepts of the understanding

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,880
in his way of presenting it, the categories that were based on the logical functions

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,140
of judgment.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,820
And then there were synthetic a priori truths or laws of the understanding, things that

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,660
we used as part of our conceptualization of the world to actually construct the objects

34
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,420
of experience.

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,260
So Kant was a kind of idealist.

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,980
The objects of experience are things we construct through our own mental activity.

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,900
We receive information from sensibility, but then that gets processed in a multi-stage

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,740
process into objects that we synthesize.

39
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,180
And so we can know things about them, our priori, independently of experience by understanding

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,300
that process of synthesis.

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,340
But all of this applies only within the realm of experience.

42
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,460
It applies to things that are being projected, not to the world itself.

43
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,900
Hegel has a very different idea.

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,580
So to think about what he is doing to change the picture, let me draw you a little sketch

45
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,220
of what Kant had in mind.

46
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,780
Kant's picture, as we've laid it out, is something like this.

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,860
Kant, let's say, depicts a thought as occurring within a mind, a mind that is receiving information

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,340
in some fashion from sensibility.

49
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,540
So here we have sensibility, our faculties of sense, perception.

50
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:45,380
And here out there is something that is generating that, the thing in itself, numina is his technical

51
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,940
term for that.

52
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,660
We relate, in a multi-stage process, the information coming from sensibility, let's

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,700
say, through this perception, to some concepts here.

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,300
Maybe some empirical concepts we've derived from experience.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,700
Maybe from, well, from our a priori concepts of the understanding.

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,260
And then the mind projects on the basis of this an object of experience, the thing that

57
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,140
we experience as a triangle.

58
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,660
And we take our thought to be about that triangle.

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,580
But really, it's not a direct line of that triangle affecting us, as in Plato or Aristotle

60
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,300
or many earlier philosophers.

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,540
Instead, this thing is an appearance.

62
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,220
It is something that is being constructed.

63
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,300
It's an appearance.

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,700
He also refers to that as an object of experience.

65
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,540
He uses the Greek term, this is a phenomenon.

66
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,700
This is a numinon, that is to say, the thing in itself.

67
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,900
So in general, the phenomena of experience, the objects of experience, are things that

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,420
are the product of mental activity.

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,100
I compared this, in my talk about Kant, to a projector.

70
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,020
The mind is something like a projector.

71
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,260
And some information comes into the projector, a digital file, a film strip, something that

72
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,620
gives it information about what it is to project.

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,700
But then it projects something on the screen of experience.

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,820
And we can know something a priori about the things that will be projected on that screen

75
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,100
by knowing something about the projector.

76
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,700
But given that we have knowledge of things on the screen, and we are able to have some

77
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,860
reflective knowledge of the nature of the projector, what then do we infer about the

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,660
thing in itself?

79
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,300
Well, we have no guarantee that these things will obey the laws of the understanding, they're

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,860
the inputs.

81
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,460
So for example, it might be that everything that can appear on that screen, because we're

82
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,660
using a black and white projector, is black and white.

83
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,420
That doesn't mean that reality is just black and white, that what goes into it is black

84
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,340
and white, that what goes into it has any color at all.

85
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,060
For that matter, it could just be a digital file, it might be zeros and ones, or really

86
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,940
just electrical impulses that are meant to represent zeros and ones.

87
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,580
And so what's getting projected here is no similarity to this at all.

88
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,220
So in short, we can infer nothing about the nature of the thing in itself.

89
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,940
He refers to this as the unconditioned equal to x.

90
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,860
That is to say, it is unknown.

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,140
We don't know.

92
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,700
Something he thinks must be affecting sensibility.

93
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,540
It's not just doing this of its own accord, it's not just kind of off on a wild flight

94
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,300
of fancy.

95
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,700
And after all, different people seem to perceive the same thing at the same time.

96
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,180
If you were to walk into this room, you would see chairs, you would see lights, you would

97
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,460
see me.

98
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,340
And so that, I mean, that needs to be explained, we'll talk about that problem much later.

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,340
But Kant says all this is reason to think there is a thing in itself.

100
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,700
First thing Hegel does is say, wait a minute, I don't think that's doing anything for you.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,820
Look, you're saying sensibility is receiving information from the thing in itself, the

102
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,620
new and the world.

103
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,700
And then this is all taking place, and we can know about this part.

104
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,340
We can know about this part.

105
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,780
We can deduce something about all of this, even our priori, good with you with all that.

106
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,860
But now what role exactly is this playing?

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,460
You can't officially even say this exists, or that it's causing us to perceive things

108
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,800
in any way, because causation and existence are some of the categories.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,420
You know they apply the things out here, you have no reason for thinking they apply here.

110
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
Maybe they do.

111
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,220
I mean, you can't rule it out on the basis of what you've said.

112
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,260
But in short, the thing in itself is playing no role in the theory.

113
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,900
It is doing nothing for you, okay?

114
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,780
It's sitting around like an independent wheel, or like an appendix, you might say, in a human

115
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,300
body where maybe it's good for something, but it doesn't seem like it's good for anything.

116
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,520
So Hegel says, first of all, get rid of that.

117
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,140
It accomplishes nothing in this theory.

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,420
We end up having some weird thing there, and we say, well, we can't say anything about it.

119
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,620
We don't know what's going on.

120
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,860
In short, it's just like substance in luck from Barclay's point of view, for example,

121
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,220
or from Hume's point of view.

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,780
You end up saying, well, there must be something I know not what in which these qualities in

123
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,820
here that makes this all hang together as an object.

124
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,060
Well, what is it, says Barclay.

125
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,900
Something you know not what?

126
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,940
That's no theory of anything.

127
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Just get rid of it.

128
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
You don't need it.

129
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,700
There's just a bunch of qualities here, right?

130
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,060
You say, no, they're in something.

131
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,060
They're in something.

132
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,060
What?

133
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
I don't know.

134
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,020
I mean, Barclay's in effect saying, that's no theory.

135
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Get rid of it.

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,900
It's doing no theoretical work for you at all.

137
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,780
And Hegel says the same thing to Kant here.

138
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,260
He says, OK, so all of this process rests ultimately on a thing in itself that is doing something

139
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:36,020
I know not what, and has something I know not what character that enables it to do whatever

140
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,540
I don't know what it's doing.

141
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,980
And in short, he says, that just explains nothing.

142
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Get rid of it.

143
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
It's not doing any work.

144
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,060
It explains nothing, whatever.

145
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,580
But the second thing he does is to say, OK, you're getting something a priori here, and

146
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,260
you've got these laws of the understanding, the a priori concepts.

147
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,140
Well, all right, there are empirical things like triangle, but then there's all this stuff

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,940
here that you claim is a priori.

149
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,460
And you say from that, you can get universal knowledge.

150
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,860
You can get necessary knowledge.

151
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Well, Hegel says, that's going to be true, only if we all have exactly the same a priori

152
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,340
concepts of the understanding.

153
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,220
Only if the same laws of the understanding operate for everybody, every human being,

154
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,780
and every culture, every time, every place, why should we think any of that is true?

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,740
Why should we believe that all of us share the same a priori concepts?

156
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
That all of us share the same laws of the understanding?

157
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,380
All of us approach experience in the same way and have our minds function in the same

158
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,380
way?

159
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,260
Hegel says, I don't see why that should be true at all.

160
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,140
So Hegel thinks about these categories, these concepts of the understanding and the laws

161
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,540
of the understanding, and says, why should they be constant and invariable?

162
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,060
Why do they have to be universal, all human beings, all times, all places?

163
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,380
That doesn't seem right.

164
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,420
We're going to get universal and necessary knowledge of the world only if all of that

165
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,540
is constant, the same for all people, all times, all places, all circumstances, all

166
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,500
societies, all cultures, all historical periods, etc.

167
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,340
But there's no reason to expect that.

168
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,780
Why should we expect human beings to construct the world in the same way at all times and

169
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,180
places, all circumstances, all cultures?

170
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,300
Think about somebody seeing the world as a resident of ancient Egypt.

171
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,260
Apparently they saw the world as two-dimensional, that's a joke, or someone who is a resident

172
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,820
of a medieval village, or someone living in the midst of the Kalahari Desert, or modern-day

173
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,340
Manhattan.

174
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,500
Why should all of these people construct the world in the same way?

175
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,380
Why should they all approach it with the same set of concepts?

176
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,300
Of course they're going to have different concepts coming in from experience, but Hegel

177
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,780
doesn't just mean that.

178
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,500
Why should we assume they have all the same starting points at the outset?

179
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,020
So Hegel says, I'm a historicist.

180
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,500
What does that mean?

181
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,180
The way we construct the world develops over time.

182
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,060
Philosophy, and these a priori concepts, these laws of the understanding, they vary with

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,580
historical circumstances.

184
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:35,820
The famous quotation here is, philosophy is its own time raised to the level of thought.

185
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,420
Hegel says, tell me what an ancient Egyptian said in philosophy, or what an ancient Greek

186
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,780
said, or a medieval villager said, or a resident of the modern-day United States says.

187
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll tell you, those are the cultural assumptions.

188
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,540
Those are the assumptions, the concepts they're bringing to understand the world.

189
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
Are they all identical?

190
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
No.

191
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
There are some overlap.

192
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,260
I mean, it would be surprising, given that they're all human beings who face basic human

193
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,100
problems if there were no overlap at all.

194
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,060
Of course there's overlap.

195
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,140
And you might try to find that overlap as, aha, that's the true universal necessary

196
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,620
a priori thing, which I think is Kant's attitude.

197
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,340
But Hegel says, I'm not so sure about that.

198
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,180
It might be that just that set of people in that set of circumstances historically developing

199
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,980
have that set of concepts.

200
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,900
Now go study the people in the Kalahari Desert.

201
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Go study those who are indigenous peoples above the Arctic Circle.

202
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Go find some people living on remote Pacific islands or remote areas of the Amazon.

203
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,980
Are they going to conceptualize things the same way?

204
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,580
I mean, maybe they do get hungry.

205
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,140
They do get thirsty.

206
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,860
There may be some things that they all have in common as human beings.

207
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,620
But we shouldn't assume that at the outset, that's a question for anthropologists.

208
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,900
And so Hegel says, really, when I think about how people organize experience, I don't find

209
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,180
them all saying, oh yes, every event must have a cause.

210
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,620
In fact, in the contemporary world, now that we've been exposed to quantum mechanics and

211
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,860
the real possibility that some things just happen without cause, that it bests their

212
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,060
statistical regularities at some level of reality.

213
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Not clear, by the way, that that's in the end how to interpret those theories.

214
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,180
But it's a very plausible way to interpret them.

215
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,300
And by now, we're used to that thought.

216
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,700
So we look at Kant, or earlier philosophers, saying every event must have a cause.

217
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,580
This is built into the structure of the mind.

218
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,580
And we're inclined to say, well, no, it's not.

219
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,260
I can entertain the possibility that's not true.

220
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,900
That some things are truly random.

221
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,460
What about other ideas, like, gosh, the idea that the amount of matter in the world cannot

222
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,620
be destroyed or expanded?

223
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Maybe, but maybe that's exactly what happens when we have an atomic explosion.

224
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,940
We convert matter into energy.

225
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,140
Maybe the amount of energy in the world remains constant.

226
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,980
Our physical theory tells us that it is.

227
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,420
On the other hand, I can imagine that it's not.

228
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,020
So in short, we're now thinking, there are a lot of things that these philosophers thought

229
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,700
was impossible for us to entertain that we think we can entertain.

230
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,820
Those things seem to change over time.

231
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,660
Well, they do change.

232
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,260
But Hegel says, that doesn't mean that I want to end up as an absolute relativist who says,

233
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,860
well, you know, if just the truth varies with time and place.

234
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,700
Or to become a skeptic who says, who knows, who's right?

235
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,220
We all approach the world differently, and blah, blah, blah.

236
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,420
And instead, he says, no.

237
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,740
There are ways in which thought progresses.

238
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,820
There are ways in which cultures progress.

239
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,060
There are ways in which thinking progresses.

240
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,940
And he calls that, well, in German, the term is geist.

241
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,140
In fact, his great work is the phenomenology of geist.

242
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,060
That is to say, of spirit or of mind that progresses through stages toward absolute knowledge.

243
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,460
Here in talking about geist, he doesn't mean just specifically your mind.

244
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,580
Or my mind.

245
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,980
He really means thinking itself.

246
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,540
The ways in which human beings approach the world the way they think about the world

247
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,420
progress as human beings live in this world over time.

248
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,260
It progresses toward absolute knowledge.

249
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,140
He has hopes that we will finally reach it.

250
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,500
Maybe it'll be a limit we will never really achieve.

251
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
But in any case, that's what's happening.

252
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,660
So it's not a random process.

253
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,940
We aren't sitting there thinking, well, who knows who's right?

254
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,820
He says, no, thinking is getting better and better.

255
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,100
We're approaching the ultimate truth.

256
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,620
But we could still be far away from it.

257
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,100
So what takes place as we progress through these stages?

258
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,020
What really matters here is not how this set of people happens to see the world at this time.

259
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,100
Instead, it's the dynamic principles that govern the development of thinking over time.

260
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,100
If we have reason to think that we're going to eventually attain absolute knowledge of the world,

261
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,140
well, it must be because we understand what's going on with these dynamic principles.

262
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,540
So what can we say about that?

263
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,940
Hegel says, philosophy can express universal and necessary truths, but not of the kind

264
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,060
that Kant thought.

265
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,940
Not necessary and universal truths about the world as he or earlier, Abbaseno or Descartes

266
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,780
or Leibniz or other rationalists tried to sketch out.

267
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,380
He says, not that kind of thing.

268
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,100
You're looking for things that are constant across all times, places, cultures, historical

269
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
periods and so on.

270
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,700
That's not it.

271
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm talking about the laws that govern the development of thought itself.

272
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,060
So what we're going to be able to find as universal and necessary isn't anything about

273
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,260
the world.

274
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,540
It's about the development of thinking, the dynamic principles that govern thought.

275
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,100
There will not be a a priori propositions about the world.

276
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,020
There will not be innate concepts about the world.

277
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,420
There will be these innate higher order abilities and tendencies of thinking that are going to

278
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,340
allow us to articulate universal and necessary dynamic principles.

279
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,500
So these are high level dynamic principles.

280
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,620
Not about the world, but about our thinking about the world.

281
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,940
They govern the development of thought.

282
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
Hegel is thinking about thinking.

283
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:16,860
He is thinking about our processes of cognition over time and the way we develop our theories,

284
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,860
the way we approach the world, the concepts we use and the ways in which they change in

285
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,500
response to experience.

286
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,940
He has a number of these dynamic principles.

287
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,300
By far the most famous is what's become known as the thesis, antithesis, synthesis pattern.

288
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,540
And it is a common pattern.

289
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,980
He thinks he outlines this and the details of its development in a number of different

290
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
ways.

291
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,340
So he sees this happening again and again.

292
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
Now what is it?

293
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,100
Well, let me use an analogy.

294
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,340
Physics tries to give us some constant universal necessary scientific laws.

295
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,140
It looks at a world with things changing, but says nevertheless there's something that

296
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
isn't changing.

297
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,860
The laws according to which things are changing, they don't change.

298
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,180
So the scientific laws are constant.

299
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
The things in the world are changing.

300
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
But we can say how.

301
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,980
And that's what physics tries to do in laws of gravitation, laws of motion, laws governing

302
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,580
electromagnetism, and in a variety of other ways.

303
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,300
The theory of relativity does something similar.

304
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,980
It looks at the qualities of things in the world.

305
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:28,820
Things like velocity or motion or even, well, gosh, mass, a variety of things that would

306
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,780
have been taken to be primary qualities in the things themselves by Descartes and Locke.

307
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,180
And it says, well, actually those things change.

308
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,460
They change across various reference frames.

309
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,500
They're really relative to a reference frame.

310
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:48,100
But the scientific laws, things like this is the speed of light, or like, well, momentum

311
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,100
is inertial mass times velocity.

312
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,800
Those are things that are invariant across reference frames.

313
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,260
And so some scientific laws are invariant, no matter how we look at things, no matter

314
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,660
whether we're moving or stationary and so on.

315
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,260
But the qualities of things, including the primary qualities, as traditionally understood,

316
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,700
they do change across frames.

317
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,220
Hegel's historicism is doing something similar.

318
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,860
It says, our theories about the world are basic concepts that we use about the world

319
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:26,700
change, but there are dynamic principles about those concepts and theories that are constant.

320
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,140
So he is looking at a changing set of things.

321
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:36,140
In this case, not a changing world or a changing set of reference frames, but instead a changing

322
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,580
set of theories about the world.

323
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,500
And he's saying, I can formulate laws for how those theories change.

324
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,780
And so if you look at a changing world here and then think of our theories as being one

325
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,220
level up, trying to be constant, Hegel's looking and saying, yeah, but they're not very constant,

326
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
are they?

327
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,860
Look one level higher.

328
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,060
That's where you get the constant.

329
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,180
Theories about the way in which our thinking about the world changes.

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,340
So if you might say an ordinary science of the world and traditional philosophies are

331
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,700
looking at the world saying, we got a changing world, but maybe we can find some unchanging

332
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,140
truths about it, Hegel says, I see a bunch of changing theories about those unchanging

333
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,380
truths, but I can tell you how those theories are changing.

334
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,900
And I'll come up with the only truly unchanging things one level higher at the level of thinking,

335
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,700
not about the world, but thinking about thinking.

336
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,900
So here's his idea, behind thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

337
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
We start with a thesis.

338
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,420
It transforms itself into an antithesis, or you might say it comes into conflict with

339
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,900
an antithesis, and then out of that arises a synthesis.

340
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,060
All of this can be presented in a way that makes it sound utterly mysterious and mystical,

341
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,620
and some philosophers have rejected it that way.

342
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,300
The African philosopher Quasiruridu, for example, is looking at this saying, these are just

343
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,620
seemingly mystical laws, and insofar as Marx takes them over and builds them into the foundations

344
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:09,100
of Marxism, there's similarly this mystical thing going on at the basis of Marxism.

345
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,380
Well, turning here just to the Hegel part, forget Marx for a moment, we can say, I think

346
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,620
he has in mind something that isn't quite as mystical as all of that.

347
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,860
Here's the underlying idea.

348
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,380
Suppose we are interested in mapping out the course of, well in this case, the Colorado

349
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,660
River as it's going through southern Utah and headed toward the Grand Canyon.

350
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,540
We find formations like this, and you can see here the river has been cutting through

351
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:45,620
this rock over eons to make shapes like this dramatic and beautiful scenery, but also has

352
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,500
a bizarre and complex path as it goes through the rock.

353
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,540
Well, suppose I'm trying to do this, and let's say there's a border between two counties

354
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,700
that is supposed to follow the river, and I'm trying to chart where exactly this boundary

355
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
is.

356
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,100
Well, I am doing this using surveying tools that require me to use straight lines.

357
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,380
In a certain sense, intuitively, we can say, look, it's in the center of that river, so

358
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,820
it does go like this.

359
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,180
But hey, come on, I'm supposed to be surveying this, right, and reporting coordinates, and

360
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,140
I can't do curves like that.

361
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,380
I have these things, and I look through them, and I do sight lines, and I need to reduce

362
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,140
this to straight lines somehow.

363
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
So how do I do it?

364
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,780
Well, here's the idea.

365
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,260
It's too complex, really, to be captured by any finite set of straight lines.

366
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,540
So what I'm doing is approximating, and I approximate it first in this way.

367
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,420
I try this line, this line, this line.

368
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,740
But then you come back and you look and you say, well, that's not quite right, I mean,

369
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
come on, look.

370
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,660
Over here, it's going over there.

371
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,860
You're not really capturing the curve correctly.

372
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,700
So we say there are inadequacies to that thesis.

373
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,660
Let's try solving the problem.

374
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,780
You've got this mistake here.

375
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,780
Let's fix that.

376
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,940
In fact, if we draw the thing differently in this way, start over here instead, and try

377
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,020
to map this, then we get something different.

378
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,220
So here, in a grossly oversimplified form, over on the left there, I've got the thesis.

379
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,860
Okay, we try drawing that line, and we say, well, wait a minute.

380
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,780
That's not capturing this little oxbow thing going on here.

381
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,180
And this little peninsula there, that's being left out, and so on and so forth.

382
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
We say, this isn't quite right.

383
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,860
So we draw a different line through this, and that I've got marked as the antithesis.

384
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,140
But then the same thing happens there.

385
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,660
We look and we say, well, yeah, you reported this, but now we've gone in in our more detailed

386
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,300
survey, and that's not quite right.

387
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,620
I mean, that's not the center of the river here.

388
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,520
It's cutting off all sorts of rock formations and so forth.

389
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,860
So we synthesize them.

390
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,320
We come up with something else.

391
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,480
Now here I've drawn it as something halfway in between, roughly.

392
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
But of course, that's not always the case.

393
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,800
In fact, we might reconceptualize and say, you know, we need a totally different technique.

394
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,840
This isn't going to do it at all.

395
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,760
So the synthesis tries to combine the strengths of the thesis and antithesis, but sometimes

396
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,720
there's a compromise between them, often is a transcendence of them.

397
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,440
And Hegel's term for this, they are alfgahoban.

398
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,960
They are transformed.

399
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,520
They are transcended by the synthesis.

400
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,680
So it's not just a compromise, it's not just a blending or a combination.

401
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,880
We somehow replace them with this new way of thinking about things.

402
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,280
And ideally, it really is a transformation of the way we're thinking, not merely some

403
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,780
compromise or combination.

404
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,980
So here's the general pattern.

405
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,040
People adopt a certain way of looking at and thinking about things.

406
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,820
That's the thesis, but it's only partially correct.

407
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,400
The world's a complicated place.

408
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
It's not going to be totally right.

409
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,880
So it faces contrary evidence, faces counter examples, anomalies, contradiction, problems

410
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,960
emerge.

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
And then we say, well, all right, we tried going with that hypothesis, and we encountered

412
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
all sorts of problems.

413
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,840
For a while, people tried to solve the problems.

414
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,280
And then they say, you know what, maybe we should have a new way of looking at things.

415
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,120
And indeed, in science, this often happens.

416
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,200
People are getting a theory, they're trying to develop the theory, they say, well, that's

417
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,280
a problem case, this is a problem case, but we can solve it, we can solve this.

418
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,120
And the theory becomes more and more complicated until finally somebody says, that's the wrong

419
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,620
way to approach it.

420
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,520
Why don't we start from this side instead?

421
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,400
And so they come up with the antithesis.

422
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,600
They shift to this new and contrary way of looking at things.

423
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,800
But it's also only a partial truth.

424
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,120
I mean, it's a new way of thinking about things, in a sense.

425
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,640
It denies the starting point of the other one, so let's approach it from a different

426
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
direction.

427
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,480
But it too ends up facing contrary evidence, counter-examples, anomalies, contradictions.

428
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,680
Again, the world's a complicated place, it doesn't get everything right.

429
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,080
So eventually we realize we have to, in some way, combine the strengths of both and avoid

430
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,000
the weaknesses of both.

431
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,120
So we resolve the conflict between the thesis and the antithesis and transcend them in a

432
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,360
new synthesis.

433
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,000
It draws elements from both, it transforms how people think, how people see things, and

434
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,960
it becomes a new thesis.

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,600
But then the problem starts again.

436
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,840
The process starts again.

437
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,280
We begin thinking, oh yes, but now it is the new exciting idea, we go with it, and then

438
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,000
it starts encountering anomalies, contradictions, counter-evidence, counter-examples.

439
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,720
And now we say, well, what do we do about it?

440
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,840
And the same thing happens.

441
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,920
So thought keeps doing this.

442
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,240
Hegel traces it through a number of things.

443
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,920
You can see it happening in pre-Socratic philosophy, where we've got some people saying,

444
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,760
there is one kind of thing at the foundation of the world, atoms.

445
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,160
Somebody else, or sorry, one thing, water, that says Thales.

446
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,920
Someone else says, no, there are different kinds of things, air, water, fire.

447
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,560
And then somebody else says, no, there are many, many different kinds of things, all

448
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,160
these atoms, okay?

449
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:04,000
And someone else, you know, Heraclitus says, changes, constant, everything is just constantly

450
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
changing.

451
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,120
And this is nothing ever changes.

452
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,680
Then Plato and Aristotle say, well, things change, but they remain the same thing across

453
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,800
change.

454
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,000
They change their accidental properties, but they retain their essential properties, and

455
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so forth.

456
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,600
So these kinds of syntheses between opposing ideas keep happening.

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,040
Well, Hegel says that's the general pattern of human thought.

458
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,200
That just keeps happening.

459
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,200
But notice that as it happens, you are trying to eliminate contrary evidence, counter examples.

460
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,720
You're getting your straight lines to approximate that curve more and more closely.

461
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,800
So there's a sense in which you hope you're getting closer to the absolute truth.

462
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,240
And he's confident that in the long run, we keep getting better and better at thinking

463
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
about things as we do this.

464
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,720
We do confront the counter examples, the contrary evidence, the anomalies, the contradictions.

465
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,320
And we do try to improve our ways of thinking that retains the explanatory power and the

466
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
strength of our earlier theories.

467
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,560
So in that way, our theories keep getting better and better.

468
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Who understood the physical world better, Aristotle in his physics, or contemporary

469
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
physicist?

470
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,880
Surely, we hope the contemporary physicist, because all sorts of anomalies over centuries

471
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,800
have been taken care of or incorporated into the strength and power of that modern theory.

472
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,480
Well, as we do this, we have to recognize that we're not doing this in a vacuum and

473
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
we're not driven just by the world.

474
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,360
We do this in a social and historical context.

475
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,680
We frame our thinking and our theories in terms of language.

476
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,000
Those linguistic units that we use, the words, the phrases, the ways in which we describe

477
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,480
the world, are shaped by basic categories of thought and they reveal the basic categories

478
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,100
of our thinking.

479
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,880
But other people at our time, or slightly earlier, other people in our context, in our

480
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,480
circumstances, in our society, are teaching us language.

481
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,760
So I think about the world in a certain way because I speak a certain language.

482
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,680
I've learned that language from other people in a certain historical context.

483
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,880
I think about the world, well, I know other languages, but I am a native speaker of English.

484
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,440
That shapes how I see the world.

485
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,520
And I learned that English within a particular social setting, given a certain interpretation

486
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
of it.

487
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,680
So, what humor attributed to custom or habit or feeling, what caught another rationalist

488
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,080
attribute to our priori concepts and laws of reason, Hegel says, I see that as coming

489
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,680
out of the social context, out of a particular place and time.

490
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,840
Our thinking is shaped socially.

491
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,440
It is really in society that we live and move and have our being to steal a phrase from

492
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,480
an ancient philosopher quoted famously by Paul in Acts 17.

493
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,680
And so Hegel says, really, it is society playing that role.

494
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:17,000
We learn our language and our ways of thinking in a given social and historical context.

495
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,600
That shapes how we think everything.

496
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,600
In particular, Hegel attacks the idea of a given.

497
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,320
He attacks Kant's distinction between understanding and sensibility.

498
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:36,440
He attacks the empiricist's understanding of thinking as depending on sensation, impressions

499
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,240
and then ideas and so on.

500
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,760
He says, actually, no.

501
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,640
Our perceptions of the world are shaped by our concepts from the very start.

502
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,560
He is against what he calls immediacy.

503
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,200
This idea that there is anything we contact in the world immediately.

504
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,040
He says, even in a basic perception, I might think that this looking at my hands is just

505
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,760
a basic perception.

506
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,320
He says, but I'm already thinking of them as hands.

507
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,880
I'm already conceptualizing them.

508
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,600
How I perceive the world and the concepts I use to frame that perception are all part

509
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
of one big process.

510
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,040
It is not that sensibility does its thing, then the understanding does its as Kant thinks.

511
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,720
It's not the case that I have these impressions and then I form ideas.

512
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,360
The ideas, the impressions, the sensations, the understanding, the conceptual resources,

513
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,480
all of that is going on at the same time.

514
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,360
There is no way to divide.

515
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,120
Concepts from percepts, sensation from thinking about sensation, the concepts we use to understand

516
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,560
sensations, our concepts shape the way we perceive the world and our perceptions are

517
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,600
already thoroughly conceptual.

518
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,640
If you don't give me the concepts, then I'm not going to perceive the world in the same

519
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
way.

520
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,440
I won't see things that really you might say, oh look, the information is there.

521
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,120
Why aren't you seeing it?

522
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,600
Because I don't have the concepts to process it.

523
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,480
And so he says there just is no given preconceptual portion of experience that we could isolate

524
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,200
and call sensibility or sensation or impressions or anything else like that.

525
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,920
The whole division on which rationalism and empiricism rest, that whole thing has to be

526
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,480
rejected.

527
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,760
Well, whatever I've said about concepts and perception in the world in general, thinking

528
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,520
in general also applies to norms.

529
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,040
Norms of ethics but norms governing our behavior in all sorts of ways.

530
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,480
We construct them.

531
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,160
We construct them relative to a certain historical period and social context.

532
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,920
Now they do express the world spirit, geist, in its current state of development.

533
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,080
And so they are to be sneezed at, but on the other hand they are relative to our time and

534
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,400
place in formulating principles of ethics.

535
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,120
We are not formulating universal and necessary laws that stem from the laws of nature as

536
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,720
in natural law theory or that stem from human nature and our responses to pleasure and pain

537
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,440
or happiness or flourishing or thriving, nor is there anything like a categorical imperative

538
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,880
that applies to all rational beings.

539
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,120
These are things that we formulate as useful guides for human life at a given time and

540
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
place.

541
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,920
Nevertheless, he says, we're not doing that arbitrarily.

542
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,040
We are doing it because of the successes and failures of earlier systems of norms.

543
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,200
And so these too are going to progress toward the absolute.

544
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,680
And in fact, what we think about these things now, he says, is the best we can do now at

545
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,080
understanding what that absolute is.

546
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,760
So as a rather shocking conclusion, he says, whatever is, is right.

547
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,080
Whatever is, is rational.

548
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,760
This is as far as rationality has taken us at this point.

549
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,160
And the best we can do is adopt the norms that are the most rational given our circumstances.

550
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,800
So there's a sense in which whatever the ethical norms of our time and place are, they're

551
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,200
the right norms for us to have at that time and place.

552
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,720
That's not to say it's all purely relative.

553
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,160
Tomorrow we may look at ourselves today and think we were barbarians.

554
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,560
Nevertheless, he says, look, it was the best we could do at the time.

555
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,680
And so in general, we think that norms too are relative to a time, relative to a place.

556
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:27,040
But nevertheless, have a kind of standing because they are putting us on the path and

557
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,120
in fact our expressions of how far along we are on the path toward absolute knowledge

558
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,800
of how to live.
