1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
Well, today I want to return to our discussion of the debate between Karnap and why.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,400
Two people whose views are closely aligned, but who nevertheless disagree about some fundamental

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,720
questions about logical truth, about conventionalism, about ontology, and about the nature of philosophy

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
in general.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,000
So let's begin by going back to what we introduced right at the end of last time.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,640
We were talking about the idea of a framework, and indeed that's something fundamental to

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Karnap.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,760
The thought that we introduced frameworks, linguistic frameworks ultimately, but I think

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
we could also refer to them as conceptual frameworks if that didn't in some sense make

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,960
a question that Karnap is interested in avoiding.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,480
But in that case, we talked about some of these last time, and we focused on the distinction

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,960
between logic, mathematics, and then natural science, state physics.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
We're going to talk about other frameworks today too.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
But let's start with that distinction.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,880
Quoting thinks it's tempting with respect to the first two.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,080
When he sees the logical empiricism by Karnap as in general saying about the first two,

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
these things are true by conventional.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,440
We adopt certain linguistic conventions, and things in logic and mathematics are true.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,920
By virtue of the meanings of the terms, those meanings are determined by those conventions.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,960
Physics is something that isn't a question of convention, that's something that's actually

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,360
talking about the real world.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,840
Well, as I see it, Quine is basically saying, with respect to this idea of truth by convention,

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,200
that it makes sense only for one of these three.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Which one could we legitimately argue about, whether or not that thing is true by convention?

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Logic?

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,280
Well, you'd think logic.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,280
That is what, in a sense, quite a card game, Karnap, we're arguing about, except that

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,400
actually there, Quine disagrees with Karnap and thinks that the question is ultimately

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
unintelligible.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,000
It's not so much that he thinks, oh, Karnap thinks it is true by convention.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think it's not.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,360
And there's a well-defined question we can debate.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,400
He thinks, he says, look, my objection here isn't so much to question the truth of this

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
point as it's set.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Yeah.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I would say physics.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Physics, there, we might argue, somebody might say there's certain conventions that are established

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
in physics.

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,880
Others might say, oh, it's purely an empirical question.

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Actually as we'll see there, too, Quine thinks there's a huge amount of arbitrarians.

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,240
And so that it's not clear that there's any real sense to the question of whether anything

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
in physics is true by convention.

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, that leaves only one more possibility, right?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Math.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,080
And there he thinks it is actually a legitimate question whether this is true by convention.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,520
Now why is there that difference?

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
We need to think about this sort of question.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,440
So let's raise this issue of truth by convention.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,080
And here I mean, I'm going to put question mark to indicate, I mean the question of whether

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
this is true by convention.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,120
I don't really mean to say what I'm about to do is, with respect to the truth, is it

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
true by convention?

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,720
But rather, does the question even make sense?

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
This answer is with respect to logic.

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
No.

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
And with respect to physics?

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
No.

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
But with respect to mathematics?

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Yes.

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Now, why is it different?

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,480
What are his arguments in each case?

62
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,640
He thinks with respect to logic, for example, that we can't say anything meaningful in saying

63
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,040
that logic is true by convention or true by the meanings of the terms not or if some

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,320
all and other logical symbols or other logical words.

65
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,920
Now why is that true?

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
What's wrong with this idea of truth by convention there?

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,000
Not in the sense that it's false, but in the sense that it's just meanings.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
What kind of argument is he given?

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,080
I've got to say that when I started out reading Quine as an undergraduate, I thought he was

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,600
a breath of fresh air.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
He was so clear compared to other philosophers.

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,320
But then again, I had studied mostly continental philosophy, so in a certain sense compared

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,240
to Hegel and Sartre and Heidegger, he's a breath of fresh air.

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,920
On the other hand, I've got to say the older I get, the less I understand Quine.

75
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,920
And so I don't think it's an easy question to say what are his arguments against this

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,640
position here and here and what's his argument in favor of its intelligibility with respect

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
to math.

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,280
I used to think I got it, and it was sort of there on the surface.

79
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,600
Now I think it's very hard to tease out what's really going on.

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Yeah?

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,320
I guess I'm kind of confused because I thought in the two dogmas, or his paper, whatever,

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,680
I think it's called just the two dogmas.

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,640
He talks about physical objects being the only, I can't remember if it's physical objects

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,840
or physics being the only thing so we can, you know, no study, whatever.

85
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Right, right.

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Well, we're going to end up thinking about a variety of other frameworks, as you point

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,200
out, and one of them is going to be just the framework of things.

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,160
We've talked about this issue in relation to Russell and a few other people, whether

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,640
we should really think of the ultimate constituents of the world, something like sense data or

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,200
sensations or other perceptions, this type of thing, or whether we can really legitimately

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,480
talk about objects, like people in tables and chairs or clocks, as the objects that

92
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
are in the world.

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
So there's that question, and we're similarly going to begin with other frameworks like

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:49,240
the framework of propositions and a framework of properties, but you're right that certain

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,920
of these client things are matters of, well, there's a sense in which you might say all

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,960
of these are really questions of empirical investigation, right?

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,920
In the end, his model is that web.

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,480
It's not that there's some sort of foundation of given things, either given by virtue of

99
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,400
the means of terms or given directly in experience, and then we construct all these other things

100
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
on the basis of it.

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Instead, there are certain things we're trying to explain about the appearances of the world

102
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,120
and we're just building these frameworks in an attempt to understand the world, period.

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
And so it's all sort of mixed together there, whereas in a sense for the earlier logical

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,840
empiricists, there's a clear divide.

105
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,920
Certain things go into the foundation, things like logic and mathematics, and maybe some

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,920
things directly perceived, and then everything else gets built on top of that.

107
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,680
So if you want to think of it this way, here's the older logical empiricist view, it's this

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,760
layer cake view, where down here is sort of logic, math, sensation, and then everything

109
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
else gets constructed on top of it.

110
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Whereas in Quine, so that's the logical empiricist picture, then in Quine, we get this picture

111
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,640
of, well, gosh, what?

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,640
The web, I'm not too good at drawing webs.

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
It's like a seal.

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
It does look like a seal.

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Like a tiger striped seal.

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
By the way, what's going on on campus today?

117
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I walked past camels to get here.

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Why are there camels?

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah, they're camels.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
It's the Israel block party.

121
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Oh, okay.

122
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Right out there in front of the Martin Luther King Center.

123
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
I had no idea what was going on.

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
There's all this stuff near the main building, too.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
People handing out t-shirts.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't know.

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Well, never mind.

128
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Talking about a framework of editing.

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
There's this framework going on campus today.

130
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
But anyway.

131
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Yeah, there's this sort of web of belief that it all hangs together in a certain sense

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
in trying to explain experience.

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
There's no one part we can isolate exactly the contribution it's making to the whole.

134
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Now, if we go back to this question about conventionalism,

135
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
and we look for Quine's arguments about this,

136
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
in a sense, as I said, it's a little hard to uncover

137
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
because it goes into so much detail

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
and there's so much being presupposed.

139
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,520
But I think the core of it is something like this.

140
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,520
What's wrong with the idea in logic

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
that it is true by convention?

142
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Or for that matter, not.

143
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
In the end, he says, look, we could say

144
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
we established these conventions about me.

145
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,520
And then logic follows from those conventions.

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Or we could say

147
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
that, really,

148
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
they're just general features of the world.

149
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Like things are self-identical.

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Or, you know, gosh.

151
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm trying to correspond to the law of non-contradiction.

152
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Reality is not contradictory.

153
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Something like that.

154
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Reality is consistent.

155
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
And in the end, he says, there's no real difference

156
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
between those two pseudo-doctrines.

157
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Now, why not?

158
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Well, really, to understand this,

159
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I think we have to go back to his paper Truth by Convention.

160
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
And there,

161
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
there's a lot of complicated stuff going on.

162
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
But in the end, it comes down,

163
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
I think, to a key move.

164
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
How would we establish

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
conventions in logic?

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Here's a really simple convention.

167
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Universal claims

168
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
imply their instances.

169
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Right?

170
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
So we might say, here's a rule

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
that the universe will quantify.

172
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
In logical notation, we could put it this way.

173
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
If for all x,

174
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
a holds of x,

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
then a holds of c.

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Let's say, for any constant c,

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
we substitute for x.

178
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay?

179
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Or, to put it in English,

180
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
we could just say, okay, everything

181
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
is a.

182
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Therefore,

183
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
that is a.

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
And, that would be true for any

185
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
that.

186
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Right?

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Okay, so now,

188
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
there, I've tried to establish a certain convention

189
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
that partially establishes

190
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
the meaning of all, or everything,

191
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
or the universe will quantify.

192
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
But now, Klein says,

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
wait, I can't do that.

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
What's wrong

195
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
with saying, hey, I've just

196
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
established a convention, that's part of the meaning

197
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
of the universal quantifier

198
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
of all, or every, in English.

199
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
What's the problem

200
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
with that?

201
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Can you rephrase that?

202
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah, sure.

203
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
He says, look, here's some card

204
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
and other logical empiricists were thinking

205
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
about this, and thinking of logic is true by convention.

206
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
I established certain conventions,

207
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
certain rules for my language,

208
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
and maybe I do that by having a

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
semantics for all,

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
or for the universal quantifier,

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
in a kind of formal sense.

212
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Maybe, I don't. Maybe I just

213
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
introduce some rules like this. I say, that

214
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
establishes the meaning. Or I could do it with

215
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
am. I could say, here's what

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
am means. We have ways of introducing

217
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
am, so if I have the truth of a and b,

218
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
I can then say a and b.

219
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
And if I have the truth of a and

220
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
b, then I can deduce

221
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
a, or for that matter, b,

222
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
whichever I want.

223
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
And I might say those introduction

224
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
rules establish the meaning of a and.

225
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
And I could introduce

226
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
an introduction rule for the universal

227
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
quantifier and say, there,

228
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I've given you the meaning of the universal

229
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
quantifier. I've told you under what

230
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
circumstances we can infer from something

231
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
else. I've told you under what circumstances

232
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
we can infer something else from it.

233
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
And that's all there is to establishing the

234
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
meaning. Now, Coins' way of saying,

235
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I can't really do it.

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
There's something wrong with saying,

237
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
in doing this, I've just established

238
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
a logical

239
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
truth.

240
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
And why?

241
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Let's take

242
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
a very simple example of one of these.

243
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Like,

244
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
what's a good universal

245
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
claim? True of everything.

246
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Gravity

247
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
is

248
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
universal.

249
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Yeah, everything

250
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
exerts

251
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
gravitational force.

252
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Therefore,

253
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
you

254
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
exert

255
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
gravitational force.

256
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
I want to say that's true just by

257
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
virtue of logic. Okay, and why?

258
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Because of conventions.

259
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Specifically, this convention

260
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
is what makes that true.

261
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Now,

262
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
that seems plausible enough, right?

263
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
But what have I done in going from

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
this to that?

265
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Here,

266
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
I have

267
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
a of x.

268
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Here, I have

269
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
exerts gravitational force, right?

270
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
I

271
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
substituted

272
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
that to be a

273
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
in both cases.

274
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Well,

275
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
how, what enabled me to do that?

276
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
What justified that?

277
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah.

278
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
The word everything?

279
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
The word everything, yeah.

280
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
And so, you might say,

281
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
well, it's just a matter of everything, right?

282
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
It appeals to some, well, and the mind says,

283
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
ah, yes, right, but wait a minute.

284
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Notice what else I did.

285
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
I actually said, aha,

286
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
this is saying this is true for every a, right?

287
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
And so, I substituted

288
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
exerts

289
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
gravitational force in for the a,

290
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
in both cases.

291
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
But now, that was just

292
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
a bit of, well,

293
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
the very same,

294
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
actually, in this case, yeah, the very same

295
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
sort of

296
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
logical, in other words,

297
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
to get from my logical convention

298
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
to any actual

299
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
logical truth, I have to be willing

300
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
to engage in a bit of logical reason.

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
So, in other words, he says,

302
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
I can't actually establish a convention

303
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
without presupposing

304
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
logic.

305
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
In order to establish convention by doing

306
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
this, or by doing this for

307
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
conjunction, for example,

308
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I have to already presuppose

309
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
some logic. I have to presuppose

310
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
logic that says, oh, you mean I can

311
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
substitute any sentence for a, and any

312
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
sentence for b, and have this make sense,

313
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
right? In other words, this is true

314
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
for all a and b.

315
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
And so, I'm presupposing something about

316
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
logic. And I'm saying moreover,

317
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
think about what I'm saying in the rule. Ah,

318
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
if you have both a and

319
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
b, you can conclude a and b.

320
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I say, wait a minute.

321
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
I already have to understand

322
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
and to understand what it means to have both a

323
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
and b, right? Similarly

324
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
here, I said, if you've got a and b,

325
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
then you can conclude a

326
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
or b, whichever you choose,

327
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
right? And I could also frame it by saying

328
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
if you've got a and b, you can conclude a.

329
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
If you've got a and b, you can conclude

330
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
b. Both of those things are true.

331
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
He said, wait, both of those things are true.

332
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
To understand your convention, I already have to

333
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
understand the meaning of both, and

334
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
and all.

335
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
And so, you can't give me those things by convention.

336
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I don't understand the conventions

337
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
and how to apply them unless I already know

338
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
logic.

339
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
So the central argument, as I see it,

340
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
of his paper truth about convention,

341
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
with respect to logic,

342
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
is that the conventions

343
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
or maybe, well, stating the conventions

344
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
I think, but also applying the conventions

345
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
presuppose

346
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
logic.

347
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
And so, they can't give you logic.

348
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
They can't give you the logical truth.

349
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
They can't specify the meanings

350
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
of logical particles.

351
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
You don't understand them unless you already

352
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
understand the conventions.

353
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
And here, I've done it in terms of

354
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
syntax.

355
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
In terms of, you know, actually

356
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
saying what the rules are,

357
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
but it wouldn't be any better

358
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
if I did it in terms of meanings.

359
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
In fact, how do we usually do that?

360
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
People will say something like this.

361
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
The truth value

362
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
of A

363
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
and B

364
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
is truth

365
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
if and only if

366
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
the value of A

367
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
well, actually, in this case

368
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
it's often done

369
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
to equal size, but I won't do it that way.

370
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
The value of A is true

371
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
and the value of B

372
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
is truth.

373
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
And notice what I've done.

374
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I've given you

375
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
by convention the meaning of A.

376
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm assuming, of course, you already understand.

377
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
And

378
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
right?

379
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
And it often goes this way.

380
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
The truth value of not A

381
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
is equal to truth if and only if

382
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
well, here's one way to do it.

383
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
The truth value of A

384
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
is not equal to truth.

385
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
You say, hey, I already have to understand not

386
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
in order for that to make sense.

387
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Now, this is not a criticism

388
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
of these symmetrical rules

389
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
or a piece in tactical rules.

390
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
It's not any objection to logic.

391
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
It's just saying I can't understand

392
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
these conventions about meaning or about

393
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
use without already knowing

394
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
some logic.

395
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
You're defining the meaning of A

396
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
in a background language that includes A

397
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
or not, and well, that includes not.

398
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Or here, the defining universal

399
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
quantifier

400
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
in a background language where I already have to understand

401
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
how to use the universal quantifier.

402
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Now, I can't be getting logical truth

403
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
out of these conventions.

404
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
I only can state the conventions that apply to them

405
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
by already understanding logic.

406
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Do these conventions always follow

407
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
things that seem to be logically true?

408
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
It's never like a convention's established,

409
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
then something follows

410
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
from that. It's the other way around, right?

411
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Like, that's what this is saying.

412
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
That's what's quite the same. Right, exactly.

413
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
It's not like we established the convention

414
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
and then these things follow in logic.

415
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
It's rather that we have to already

416
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
know the logic to even state the convention.

417
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
So what does that mean?

418
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Well, what he thinks what it means is that

419
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
here would be a simple way of concluding.

420
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Ah, so logic isn't true by convention.

421
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Somehow

422
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
stating conventions or applying conventions

423
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
and so on would already

424
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
presuppose logic. So conclusion,

425
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
logic is not true by convention.

426
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Interestingly, he doesn't really say that.

427
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
He says, I don't think

428
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
it makes any sense to talk about logic

429
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
as true by convention. So

430
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
it's not so much he thinks the claim is false.

431
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
He thinks it's unintelligible and we still

432
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
have to ask why that would be true. Yeah.

433
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Can't you define them other ways

434
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
like the truth tables that

435
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
don't seem to

436
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
imply or, you know,

437
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
don't seem to presuppose anything

438
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
or like that? Let's try that.

439
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Okay, so

440
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
we have A, B,

441
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
and then A and B

442
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
and we're going to set up truth

443
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
tables so I say, well, there are four possibilities

444
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
here. These might both be true.

445
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
A true, B false.

446
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
A false, B true, both false.

447
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
And now I'm going to say that

448
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
A and B is true if and only if

449
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
well both are true otherwise false.

450
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
So I write a table like that

451
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
and that seems to establish a convention

452
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
that specifies the meaning of AND.

453
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Now have I in any sense

454
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
presupposed the meaning of AND

455
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
or other logical

456
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
particles? I mean one thing I've

457
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
posed right is

458
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
universal character. You might say

459
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
the schematic letters A and B

460
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
already assume that I understand

461
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
something about universal quantification.

462
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
But have I in any sense

463
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
assumed something of the meaning of AND here?

464
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Well, you wouldn't be able to write

465
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
the truth values on the right side

466
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
if you didn't know AND already meant...

467
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Well, that's true.

468
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Although

469
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
yeah, one way of looking at it

470
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
is to say, where am I coming up

471
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
with these? I must not really understand

472
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
if I'm going to do that. Now, of course

473
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I could say, no, no, no, I'm not doing that.

474
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm doing that in a purely formal way.

475
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
In fact, I could say, given that

476
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
there are two terms here

477
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I'm just interested in defining

478
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
certain connectives with two

479
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
truth values. There are 16

480
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
different truth functions. And so

481
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
I could really just be specifying all of

482
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
those. And then once I've specified

483
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
them all, I say, oh look at this one. I'm going to call that

484
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
AND. And that's my convention.

485
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
That's the convention about AND.

486
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
And, you know,

487
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
that might be fine. So others

488
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
we might have to think a while to realize

489
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
what on earth is, if anything,

490
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
that corresponds to a natural language.

491
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Yeah. Yeah, I think, but

492
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
in this case, it's tempting to say

493
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
what Quine does, because AND is part of

494
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
our language, and you kind of have

495
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
to, you know,

496
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
understand what, it seems like

497
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
you have to understand what AND is to fill out the table,

498
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
but you can do something purely arbitrary

499
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
with like a three,

500
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
you know, something that takes in three inputs

501
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
that has no analogy

502
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
in our language, you know,

503
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
it's just some arbitrary

504
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
truth table that you can define by convention.

505
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Yeah, right.

506
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
This is really off topic,

507
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
but I can't resist

508
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
telling you about one of my favorite connectives.

509
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
This is post negation.

510
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay. Suppose we have

511
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
three truth values, truth,

512
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
indeterminacy, and falsehood.

513
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Well, a post negation,

514
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
and I don't know

515
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
exactly how to write a post negation,

516
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
so

517
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
I'll just say post A.

518
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Is this? It's true

519
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
if this is false.

520
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
It's indeterminate if it's true, and it's false

521
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
if it's indeterminate.

522
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
So what it does is mathematically

523
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
very interesting. It just rotates

524
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
all the truth values one place, right?

525
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
So it rotates it back

526
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
like this one place, and so it's super useful.

527
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
It turns out that

528
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
in a many valued logic, this is

529
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
a wonderful way of getting a functionally

530
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
and complete set of connectives.

531
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
But now,

532
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
what does that mean?

533
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
I mean, ordinary negation would be

534
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
true if this is false, and false

535
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
if that's true. Here it's indeterminate if that's true.

536
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
And if A

537
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
is indeterminate, it's let's say

538
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
a borderline case of vagueness, for example,

539
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
but this is just false.

540
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I can't think of what that means

541
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
in English. I can't come up with any

542
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
English equivalent. And as soon as

543
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
you get to either three truth values

544
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
or more than two

545
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
positions here, it's very easy

546
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
to come up with connectives where you say,

547
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
well, I don't know how to say that in English.

548
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
It doesn't seem to correspond to anything.

549
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
With one or with two, it's not too hard.

550
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Usually it comes up with some

551
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
English expression that captures the meaning.

552
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
But a third truth

553
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
value or a third term

554
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
in the collection

555
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
here in that compound

556
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
sentence becomes very easy

557
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
to generate. So you could say,

558
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
look, that's just arbitrary. Don't worry

559
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
in other words about this part. That's

560
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
something maybe we could just say, we

561
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
arbitrarily filled out. Then we arbitrarily

562
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
assign the word and to that meaning

563
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
and thereby establish a convention.

564
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
So I don't think this

565
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
is going to be the source

566
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
of the objection that the client would have.

567
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
But is there another one?

568
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Yeah? So that post-negation

569
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
thing, I know it's about topic, but like

570
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
so what

571
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
are there any institutions in the

572
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
world that would apply?

573
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I don't know what use is it.

574
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
What use is it? Well,

575
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
because in a many-valued logic

576
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
the way it's usually done,

577
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
we introduce connectives in

578
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
a kind of intuitive way and negation would be

579
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
just true if this is false, false

580
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
if that's true and then indeterminate like that.

581
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
So that's a typical negation

582
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
in a many-valued logic.

583
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
But it turns out that

584
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
when you do this in the kind of natural way

585
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
introducing this third

586
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
truth value of indeterminacy

587
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
there are all sorts

588
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
of truth functions you cannot express

589
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
in that basic language. Because what happens

590
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
is you get a fixed point at

591
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
indeterminacy, for example.

592
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
If all the inputs are indeterminate, the

593
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
output is always indeterminate.

594
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
And so in standard

595
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
many-valued logics

596
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
once you sort of hit indeterminacy

597
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
you can't get out. And the same thing is

598
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
true of determinacy. If all the inputs are

599
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
indeterminate, the output is always

600
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
indeterminate. So you can't actually

601
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
define a truth function that takes

602
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
determinacy into indeterminacy or vice-versa.

603
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
And that's a real

604
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
mathematical limitation of the system.

605
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
You might think it's also a real

606
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
meaning limitation since it seems

607
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
as if we ought to be able to

608
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
take indeterminate inputs

609
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
and get a determinate output. For example

610
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
if somebody says, oh, it's indeterminate that

611
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
we ought to be able to actually

612
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
then say, oh, that's true because

613
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
all the inputs are indeterminate.

614
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
And so it means

615
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
that illogic has it standardly done. You

616
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
can't express things like

617
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
it is determinate whether or it is

618
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
indeterminate that and so forth.

619
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
And so this

620
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
is a way of letting you define all of those

621
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
things. It's a very mathematically

622
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
elegant way of letting you define them.

623
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
It's also just a mysterious way

624
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
of letting you define them from an English

625
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
sort of human point of view. But that's

626
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
why it's useful. How do you get to that,

627
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
though? How do you just change it?

628
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
How does that work?

629
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Well, in math you can do anything you want

630
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
to. Just, you know,

631
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
instead of saying, you know, you can just say,

632
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
well, take a logic with or and

633
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
and not define the usual way and then

634
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
oh, add the post-connective

635
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
and boom, you can now define anything.

636
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
You can define, it is determinate whether

637
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
or it is indeterminate that.

638
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Or it's definitely true, and I mean true

639
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
and not false and not indeterminate that

640
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
and so on.

641
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
And so it's really useful.

642
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
It just requires something that we can't

643
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
assign a real meaning to in English.

644
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Yeah.

645
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
So just going back to the original question.

646
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Yeah.

647
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
We have several different systems of logic

648
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
and you've just shown another one and

649
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
you can define some logics in terms of

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
other logics.

651
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
So why doesn't that show that

652
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
logics can be defined conventionally

653
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
so long as the conventions are based on other

654
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
logics? Like why can't you just kind of do a

655
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
circle? Well, good question.

656
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
There are a lot of contemporary logicians

657
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
who think, yeah, logic is true by convention

658
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
and indeed, you can see it

659
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
as soon as you move to some of these other

660
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
logics and you think what convention should

661
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
we establish? In fact, just the idea

662
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
that we could have more than two truth

663
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
logics who think, ooh, what should we say

664
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
that about and, about or, about not

665
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
in such a logic?

666
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
And it feels in many cases as if you're being

667
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
asked to define certain conventions,

668
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
not as if you're being asked to

669
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
presuppose what you already

670
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
mean or already do.

671
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
And it certainly has that feeling

672
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
when you are characterizing something like

673
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
quantum logic or certain other logics

674
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
for highly specific purposes.

675
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
So it is a defensible position.

676
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
But now, let's get back

677
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
to the client's objection. How would he object to it

678
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
there or here?

679
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
It's not going to be on the basis of this,

680
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
although that's very tempting to say

681
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
yeah, look,

682
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
it's in somehow filling that in

683
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
that we're establishing a convention. Here it has

684
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
that feeling strongly because this isn't capturing

685
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
the meaning of anything we're presupposing. It's not like

686
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
oh, come on, we were all using the post-negation

687
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
all the way along, right? No, we weren't.

688
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
But in this case, let's go back to this

689
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
because it's a much simpler case and then we'll

690
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
go back. Here,

691
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
what is this first row of the table?

692
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
How do I explain what's going on in the first row?

693
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I said,

694
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
suppose A

695
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
is true and B is true.

696
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
A is true

697
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
and B is true.

698
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
A is true and B is false.

699
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
A is false and

700
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
B is true.

701
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Just in explaining what the table was,

702
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
I used and, right?

703
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
And I don't know how to avoid that.

704
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
So I've already got

705
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
and sort of built in here.

706
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
That seems very odd because

707
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
you could do all of those, do all the tables

708
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
just as I said with just and,

709
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
but and is not logically complete.

710
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Right.

711
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Which seems very strange, right? You can base it all

712
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
on something not logically complete.

713
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
All right, good, good, good, good.

714
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Yeah, notice what I, in this example

715
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
and really with any of these where I use the schematic

716
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
letters, it looks like, what am I presupposing?

717
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I'm presupposing something about universal

718
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
quantification.

719
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Whether I stated explicitly

720
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
or whether it's really just in the background

721
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
by me using letters like A and B.

722
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
And then here, do you even explain

723
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
the row of the truth table? Before I get to this,

724
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I've got to be using

725
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
and.

726
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
And we've seen that here.

727
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I've got both A and B so I can do

728
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
A and B, etc.

729
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I suppose

730
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
you could argue, I've presupposed it then

731
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
if both of these are true then

732
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
that's true.

733
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
So maybe I've presupposed

734
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
if in that way. In fact, once I get

735
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
to this, here I've

736
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
just got A, right? So I'm not presupposing

737
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
and, but I am saying if A is

738
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
true then this post-connective

739
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
applied to A is indeterminate.

740
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
And so I seem to be

741
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
presupposing if then.

742
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
What about not?

743
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
When we got to negation

744
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
it looked like I had to say something

745
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
about not. I had to say

746
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
not A is true if and only if

747
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
A is not true.

748
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
And so maybe I've presupposed not.

749
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
But now if I've got all of that

750
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
I do have a functionally

751
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
complete set. So you're absolutely right

752
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
that if I look at individual ones

753
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I'm not using all of those. I might

754
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
depending upon the way I'm doing it

755
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
be committed to let's say here

756
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
all and and maybe if then.

757
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
But that's not functionally

758
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
complete. Only certain things are going

759
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
to actually require negation.

760
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
And then

761
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I'm going to end up presupposing the whole thing.

762
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
If you did the entire

763
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
if you did the truth table for the

764
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Shephard stroke to build an entire logic

765
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
counter. Would you need

766
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
all a logically complete thing to

767
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
define it? That's a good question.

768
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Would you need the not? Let's do it.

769
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Let's do Shephard stroke.

770
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Which is the not A.

771
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Okay. So it means basically

772
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
not both A and B.

773
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Well, if you've got both A

774
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
and B it's false.

775
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Here

776
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
you don't have both A and B. So it's true.

777
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
And true and true.

778
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Okay.

779
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Now what did I presuppose in doing that?

780
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Well, I said

781
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
if this and that then this.

782
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
So I've got and and if

783
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
I've got the schematic letter.

784
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
So I've got the universal.

785
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
I never need the negation.

786
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
I ever have to presuppose negation.

787
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Since this means not A

788
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
you'd think surely I did.

789
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
But how?

790
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
You might think it's already implied in the false

791
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
but

792
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
not necessarily right.

793
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Because we don't have to think of false

794
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
as just not true. And the possibility

795
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
of many value logics indicates

796
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
why we might think that's not right.

797
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
But for example here I said

798
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
if this is true and that's false

799
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
then this is true.

800
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Didn't seem like

801
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I had to use negation there.

802
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Now in thinking about

803
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I did I had to think oh it means

804
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
not both A and B. So

805
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
here they are both true so

806
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
if this is not true it's false.

807
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
That went on in my head

808
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
but in terms of actually just stating

809
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
what the convention is I didn't have to do.

810
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
So I think it's kind of interesting

811
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
that I don't at least see why this presupposes

812
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
not.

813
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Does it also presuppose truth values

814
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
or would that not fit under there?

815
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Well yeah it does

816
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
presuppose truth and false.

817
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
So true and false

818
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
get in here too.

819
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
And I suppose you might say

820
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
there's got to be someone there.

821
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Moreover if I've got false

822
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
then actually can't I define not?

823
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Some people have tried

824
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
to do that and said yeah

825
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
not A for example

826
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
is just if

827
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
A then

828
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
false.

829
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
And so if that

830
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
would work as a definition of negation then

831
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
by having false in there I can actually already

832
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
get negation out.

833
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
But anyway I think it's a good question

834
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
you're raising and something to climb

835
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
in both of these papers just glides over quickly.

836
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Just like oh well

837
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
the presupposes logic I can't get

838
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
I can't state the convention, I can't apply the convention

839
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
unless I've already got logic.

840
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
But that's really sloppy.

841
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
What I need depends on the nature of the convention

842
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
right?

843
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
And maybe in the end

844
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I need all the first order logic

845
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
but maybe I don't.

846
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
That's something that really has to be argued for.

847
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
It's not just something to vaguely allege.

848
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
So thank you for raising these questions

849
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
and if it seems like I've gone off on a long logical

850
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
regression here. Not really

851
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
because the whole idea here is that

852
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
in stating these conventions we're presupposing

853
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
not just a little tiny fragment

854
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
of logic but logic

855
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
period and

856
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
so it matters what we're actually presupposing

857
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
to evaluate quite

858
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
the time.

859
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Now

860
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
let's move on to math.

861
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
It's supposed to be okay

862
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
to worry about the conventionalism

863
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
of mathematics. Again he's not

864
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
committed to claiming that math is true by convention

865
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
but just that the question makes sense

866
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
with mathematics.

867
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
So

868
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
before we guess that, maybe we should do physics.

869
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
What's wrong with saying that certain

870
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
things in law in physics are true by convention?

871
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Now nobody's going to want to say all of physics

872
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
is true by convention.

873
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
It's obviously an empirical science and there's a lot of

874
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
experimental stuff and observation

875
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
required but

876
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
could there be certain things that are established just by

877
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
convention? You might say

878
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
for example in classical mechanics

879
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
well let's say Newton's laws

880
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
of motion. One of them

881
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
is force

882
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
is, I keep writing things low

883
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
in the blank, force is

884
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
mass times acceleration.

885
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Now is that

886
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
an empirical claim

887
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
that requires observational backing

888
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
or is it a definition of force?

889
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Is that something that we could say is true by definition?

890
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
The definition.

891
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
All right,

892
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
suppose we say it's true by definition.

893
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Now what does that imply about certain other things?

894
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
What's another physical

895
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
law that involves force?

896
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Well for example, work is

897
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
force times distance.

898
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Is that a definition?

899
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
All right, so suppose we say it's

900
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
true by definition. Then we've got

901
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
work is equal to

902
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
well gosh,

903
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
distance times mass times acceleration.

904
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
And presumably that now follows for our definition.

905
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
That's just an analytic truth.

906
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Well what about this relationship?

907
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Kinetic energy

908
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
is equal to one half m v square.

909
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
Is that a definition of kinetic energy

910
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
or is it an empirical claim?

911
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I don't know.

912
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Moreover,

913
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
how about this?

914
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Momentum

915
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
is mass times velocity.

916
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
It's not very clear

917
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
what I should take as definition.

918
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
I might axiomatize physics

919
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
in the way that I might axiomatize geometry.

920
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
But the point is that

921
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
it's sort of arbitrary which of these

922
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
I take as definitions and which I take

923
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
as actual

924
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
empirical claims.

925
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
And his point is, in a certain sense, physics

926
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
stands or falls with all of these.

927
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
It's not as if,

928
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
well for example, I've chosen

929
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
this example. Neutronian mechanics.

930
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
In part because we now think this theory is wrong.

931
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Okay, we teach it to all our

932
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
high school students. We teach it to people in

933
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
intro physics classes in college.

934
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
But it's false.

935
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Now why is it false? Well because

936
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
the speed of light should really be in here.

937
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
We need to distinguish between inertial mass

938
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
and rest mass.

939
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
And so forth.

940
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Now where's the falsehood?

941
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
You might think, ah, certain of these things are just

942
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
analytic. So the falsehood all has to be in the

943
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
empirical claim.

944
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
But that seems a screwy way of doing it.

945
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
The fact is we have to just figure out

946
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
and for example, this is one of the places we

947
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
make some adjustments typically.

948
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
And so if we

949
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
start adjusting that in relativistic mechanics,

950
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
you might say, well maybe that

951
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
really wasn't a definition.

952
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Or you might say maybe our concept of energy

953
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
has changed. Certainly our concept of

954
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
mass has changed when we distinguish rest mass

955
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
from inertial mass.

956
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
So in a way here, Klein's point is just,

957
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,480
it's not that it's unintelligible.

958
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
It's just arbitrary.

959
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
It's this

960
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
great line that says asking

961
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
which of these physical claims are really

962
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
axioms and are really

963
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
definitions is really

964
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
kind of like asking which points in Ohio

965
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
are starting points.

966
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
And presenting the theory, I can introduce

967
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
anything as a definition I want

968
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
as long as it has the right logical form.

969
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
And then other

970
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
things will emerge as empirical claims.

971
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
But it's really kind of arbitrary how you would do

972
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,480
that. It's not like

973
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
some of these are just obviously

974
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
definitions and others are obviously empirical

975
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
claims. So we adjust that with our

976
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
presentation of the theory. Just as we do

977
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
in geometry, what should we take as the

978
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
axioms of geometry? Well,

979
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
you could take all sorts of things as

980
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
axioms of geometry and

981
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
then derive other things as theorems.

982
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
There's nothing about a certain kind of claim that

983
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
just says, oh, that's going to be a fundamental

984
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
axiom. What we take as basic

985
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
is just a matter of how we present

986
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
the theory.

987
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
But Klein's point on the other hand

988
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
is just that, look,

989
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
in the end, when we change a physical theory

990
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
it's not like certain things are analytically true

991
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
and are off the table. We have to figure out

992
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
how to adjust things in the theory. And some of the

993
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
things in the theory we keep, other things

994
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
we throw out, sometimes we take

995
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
one notion and replace it with two notions

996
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
and in short, draw a distinction we hadn't

997
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
drawn before. And there's no way

998
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
to predict which of these things are

999
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
libel and empirical challenge

1000
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
and which ones are immune from that because they're

1001
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
analytic. Yeah.

1002
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Do any of them have to be definitions or

1003
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
can they all be empirical?

1004
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Yeah, they can all be empirical. We don't

1005
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,480
have to make any of them definitions, right?

1006
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
And in a sense, Klein's point is that in

1007
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
the end, yeah, that's really the right way to say it.

1008
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
I mean, if I'm writing

1009
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
a physics textbook and I want to present

1010
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
some as really just defining

1011
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
the term momentum, let's say, or defining this or

1012
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
that, then okay, I can do that.

1013
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I can do that as a matter of my presentation.

1014
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
But that's a question of how

1015
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
I'm presenting the theory. It's not like

1016
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
something that is fundamentally true

1017
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
within each of the subjects. So

1018
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
for example, in thinking

1019
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
about actually every day in class

1020
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
how to come in and talk about what I'm going to talk about,

1021
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
I think, well, where do I start?

1022
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
But it's not as if

1023
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
I look at the subject matter.

1024
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
In this case, the Klein-Karab debate

1025
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
and just see, aha,

1026
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
there is the foundational question.

1027
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I try to identify what I think

1028
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
the foundational questions are, but in terms of

1029
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
my presentation, where do I start?

1030
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
It's not like I look in and just find starting

1031
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
points in these debates.

1032
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I have to think how am I going to structure

1033
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
this, how am I going to discuss it

1034
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
and explain it, and I pick a place to start.

1035
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
And in short, it would be like that.

1036
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
So it's not as if

1037
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
in the physics book we couldn't introduce any definitions.

1038
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
It's just that

1039
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
we're doing that as a matter of presentation,

1040
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
as convenience, not as a way

1041
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
of reflecting that there really is a distinction

1042
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
in the underlying physical claims.

1043
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
So I suppose in that sense

1044
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
it could be easily misconstrued.

1045
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
It would be in a way a bad idea

1046
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
in a physics book to say, ah,

1047
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
just true by definition of that.

1048
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Because that sort of implies that it's

1049
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
really true about the claim

1050
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
rather than just by way of talking about it.

1051
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
And indeed, physics books generally

1052
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
don't. They're wise enough

1053
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
not to think, oh, this is a definition

1054
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
of force or a definition of kinetic energy

1055
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
or something.

1056
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Now, we should

1057
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
end with mathematics.

1058
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
What makes this question

1059
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
intelligible for that?

1060
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Well, all math adds to luck,

1061
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
as we saw last time, was that

1062
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
and then other things that can be defined

1063
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
in terms of membership. All we need

1064
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
really is certainty.

1065
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
So,

1066
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
how can we

1067
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
introduce that? Now, here, Klein says,

1068
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
actually at this point we are

1069
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
doing something like

1070
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
leading by convention.

1071
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Does my introduction of that

1072
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
actually presuppose sense?

1073
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
He thinks it doesn't.

1074
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
And so, I don't fall into the trap

1075
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
of logic falsification.

1076
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
On the other hand, neither is it purely

1077
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
arbitrary

1078
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
because after all, I'm not just

1079
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
dealing with a bunch of empirical claims

1080
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
in characterizing the world of sense.

1081
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
I'm not investigating the sense. It's like,

1082
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
ooh, there's a set of students in the room

1083
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
that study the scent.

1084
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
I don't do set experiments

1085
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
like that.

1086
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Instead, what do I do? Well,

1087
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
I'm characterizing an idea that I'm

1088
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
in effect making up.

1089
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
So, what would I

1090
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
actually do?

1091
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
When I characterized that theory, we talked about this

1092
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
some last time,

1093
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
but today maybe we should do it a little more

1094
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
officially.

1095
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
Here is a principle

1096
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
that we tend to adopt.

1097
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Extensionality

1098
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
and what it says in logical terms

1099
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
is that

1100
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
well, it establishes an identity

1101
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
criterion for sense.

1102
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
It says for any sense x and y

1103
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
x equals y

1104
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
if and only if for all z

1105
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
z belongs to x

1106
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
if and only if

1107
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
z belongs to y

1108
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
and so

1109
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
to put it in English

1110
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
sets are identical

1111
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
if and only if

1112
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
if and only if

1113
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
they have the same members.

1114
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Now notice

1115
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
that in doing that

1116
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
I am certainly presupposing

1117
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
logic, right? I'm assuming

1118
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
you understand universal quantification

1119
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
and if and only if and something about

1120
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
well, actually identity is being defined here

1121
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
that's not being presupposed

1122
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
even though when I say it this way

1123
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
the same members might think

1124
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
it sounds like I am, but really

1125
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
I can characterize that just in terms

1126
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
of the if and only if and the all.

1127
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
So this is presupposing

1128
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
logic.

1129
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Is it arbitrary?

1130
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Well

1131
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
no, not really

1132
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
I mean I can treat it

1133
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
as a definition of identity with respect to

1134
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
sets or I can treat it as a claim

1135
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
a substantive claim about the nature

1136
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
of sets, but

1137
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
the fact is it does feel like

1138
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm establishing a convention that lays down what a

1139
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
set is. How is a set different

1140
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
from a property for example where this is not

1141
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
true? So it does have the

1142
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
feel of a convention. Now

1143
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
is it exactly a convention

1144
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
do I have to be a convention when I'm talking

1145
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
about it? Well no, I can argue

1146
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
that there is an underlying truth about sets

1147
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
and so forth, so he doesn't want to say

1148
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
this question is decided, but it's not

1149
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
absurd to say I'm establishing this by convention

1150
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
it's not really arbitrary

1151
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
because I

1152
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
do need

1153
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
I do need

1154
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
I do need identity conditions

1155
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
for sets and moreover

1156
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
it has the feel

1157
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
it's a stipulative definition

1158
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
remember

1159
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
stipulative definitions

1160
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
were ones that he thought actually

1161
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
do a set or something like an analytic

1162
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
plane. Why? Because

1163
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
I'm just saying let blah blah blah

1164
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I introduce

1165
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
a term and I just define it in a certain

1166
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
way and I'm not trying to capture previous

1167
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
use it, I'm not

1168
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
introducing this in the context of a broad

1169
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,480
theoretical understanding, I'm just saying

1170
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
let this be that

1171
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
you know, let a metric space be

1172
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,480
blah blah blah blah

1173
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
and that defines a metric space

1174
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I'm just introducing the term in that way, it's not like

1175
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
I have some previous concept on that, yeah

1176
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
but isn't the

1177
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
set

1178
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
symbol in the definition?

1179
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
the set symbol is in the definition

1180
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
oh, I see what you're saying, so wait a minute

1181
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
why don't I presuppose

1182
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,480
sets? This seems like twice as clear

1183
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
as the logic of why it would presuppose

1184
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
yeah, right

1185
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,480
what I end up doing

1186
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,480
is introducing a bunch of different

1187
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
axioms

1188
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,480
all of which are going to involve this symbol

1189
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
and so

1190
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
now I end up saying, yeah, really

1191
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,480
I can treat it as a definition of this

1192
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
but what about that?

1193
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
am I presupposing the sets in all of this

1194
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
by putting in that symbol?

1195
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
I think the

1196
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
claim is meant to be, no, I'm giving

1197
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
you a bunch of statements about

1198
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
that symbol and then that symbol

1199
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
is supposed to be defined as whatever those claims

1200
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
are true of

1201
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
but yeah, that's

1202
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
that's a doctrine

1203
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
called implicit definition, Russell's

1204
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,480
well, other people were fond of it actually

1205
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,480
at one point, Russell said it had

1206
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
all the advantage of theft over honest

1207
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
toy

1208
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
and so

1209
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
in a way, that's why Gwynne thinks

1210
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
look, it's a meaningful question but

1211
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
it would be possible to say

1212
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
can I treat it that way?

1213
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
his claim is that that isn't presupposed

1214
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
it's in part characterized by this

1215
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
you could do the same thing for logic though

1216
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
right, couldn't you do implicit

1217
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
definition and just call it

1218
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
implicit and say it's not presupposed

1219
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
it's whatever, yeah, yeah, well

1220
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
that's a good question

1221
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
unfortunately, we're past

1222
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
of time

1223
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
so, next time we'll think about that

1224
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
question and we'll look at Carnap's

1225
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
paper, empiricism, mathematics and

1226
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
ontology and see how he tries

1227
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
to avoid these problems
