00:00.000 --> 00:14.100
One of the most basic philosophical questions is the relation between mind and world.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.080
How exactly does my mind relate to the world?

00:17.080 --> 00:21.320
I hope to know things about the world, I hope to understand it, I hope to be able to act

00:21.320 --> 00:26.760
in the world in a way that makes sense, is reasonable, and will let me succeed at achieving

00:26.760 --> 00:28.880
my goals.

00:28.880 --> 00:29.880
But it's hard to do that.

00:29.880 --> 00:35.520
I don't know how the thoughts, the desires, the intentions, the plans I make, the other

00:35.520 --> 00:39.240
aspects of my mental life correspond to the world.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.720
So the question of the relationship between mind and world is really fundamental.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.840
I want to know to what extent they correspond and various things that I think I want to

00:48.840 --> 00:52.640
know whether they're reflecting things that are really going on in the world or whether

00:52.640 --> 00:58.080
they're things that I am contributing, that I am maybe hoping for or fantasizing or in

00:58.080 --> 01:01.160
some other way getting wrong about reality.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.760
It's going to affect the way I act, it's going to affect the way I think, what I take

01:04.760 --> 01:09.720
to be a belief, what I take to be knowledge, I'm going to get into a lot of trouble conceivably

01:09.720 --> 01:14.640
if I've got a lot of things going on in my mind that correspond to nothing in the world.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.000
Descartes and Locke draw a fundamental distinction that's supposed to help us understand this

01:19.000 --> 01:23.920
question, the distinction between primary qualities of objects and secondary qualities.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.400
The primary qualities are really in the things themselves.

01:27.400 --> 01:33.400
They're inseparable from the things themselves, they're constant, whereas the secondary qualities

01:33.400 --> 01:36.800
are a matter of how those things affect us.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.840
They're being contributed by the mind.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.840
So our ideas of secondary qualities, things like colors and tastes and textures, those

01:43.840 --> 01:47.680
are not really in the world, those are being contributed by the mind.

01:47.680 --> 01:53.040
But things like extension, solidity, mass, movement, those are really in the world, those

01:53.040 --> 01:56.280
are primary qualities of the things themselves.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.960
So to some extent our minds are getting the world right, Descartes and Locke think.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.600
They are matching characteristics of the world.

02:02.600 --> 02:07.440
Descartes and Locke are what we had called today scientific realists.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.160
Science is revealing the real essences of things, the true nature of things, and the

02:12.160 --> 02:16.800
qualities that are identified by science as going on in the world, those are the real

02:16.800 --> 02:18.520
qualities of objects.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.120
But everything else is something that our mind is contributing, it's a question of

02:22.120 --> 02:26.360
how those things are affecting our perceptual and cognitive faculties.

02:26.360 --> 02:30.120
They're not really in the world.

02:30.120 --> 02:35.000
That kind of distinction between the qualities that are really in the things themselves,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.180
and described by science, and the things that are not really in the things themselves but

02:39.180 --> 02:45.360
contributed by the mind, came under surprising and sustained attack.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.560
It was begun by Bishop Barkley, responding to Locke, continued by David Hume, and then

02:50.560 --> 02:55.760
spawns an entire idealist tradition that has dominated much of the philosophical world

02:55.760 --> 02:58.080
for the last couple of centuries.

02:58.080 --> 03:03.080
So it's sort of surprising that that took place, given that our ordinary attitude I

03:03.080 --> 03:07.200
think is very much in line with a primary, secondary quality distinction.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.880
But today I want to talk about Barkley and Hume and their attack on that distinction,

03:11.880 --> 03:13.640
their conception of qualities.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.920
They're going to say there is no place for the kind of distinction that Descartes and

03:17.920 --> 03:23.640
Locke are drawing, no way for us to say those qualities are really in the objects themselves.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.280
In fact, in their view, everything is going to end up being something like a secondary

03:27.280 --> 03:32.080
quality, everything really turns out to depend on the mind.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.520
Well, Bishop George Barkley himself was the Dean of Derry.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.040
He was Irish, lived in Northern Ireland specifically.

03:41.040 --> 03:46.600
He was a philosopher of the 18th century, as you can see here, and he was a very notable

03:46.600 --> 03:51.520
character, important in the history of philosophy for starting that entire tradition within

03:51.520 --> 03:53.160
Western philosophy.

03:53.160 --> 03:59.720
Here you see him pictured with a group of people referred to as his entourage.

03:59.720 --> 04:05.160
Barkley held that idealism, the thesis that everything in the world is mind dependent,

04:05.160 --> 04:09.160
that the entire world, as we understand it, is really a projection or construction of

04:09.160 --> 04:10.160
the mind.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.880
That's the best defense of common sense against skepticism.

04:13.880 --> 04:18.560
He thinks in particular that Descartes and Locke's ideas of objects make no sense and

04:18.560 --> 04:21.800
attacks the concept of a primary quality.

04:21.800 --> 04:26.520
He correspondingly attacks the concept of a substance, of a material object in general.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.200
In the end, he says there are only ideas.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.840
The entire world is a construction of the mind.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.120
The world has to be understood as fundamentally mental or spiritual.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.720
Well, how does this constitute a defense against skepticism?

04:40.720 --> 04:43.200
You might think of it as a surrender to the skeptic.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.840
After all, Barkley seems to be saying, well, gosh, mind.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.480
Everything is really mind, so nothing corresponds to the world.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.240
Wow, why aren't we skeptics as a result?

04:52.240 --> 04:54.040
He doesn't think that's what he's doing.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.040
Instead, he thinks what's happening is that the danger of skepticism is the gap between

04:59.040 --> 05:00.040
mind and world.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.360
I've got a set of ideas about things.

05:02.360 --> 05:07.760
I think certain things are true about the world, and if there's a gap between the way

05:07.760 --> 05:11.880
I think and what's really going on in the world, then there is the danger that a lot

05:11.880 --> 05:17.760
of my thinking diverges, and a lot of my beliefs diverge from the way the world really is.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.840
That's what gives skepticism its power.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.340
We think about scenarios where I'm wrong about this or that, or maybe everything as

05:24.340 --> 05:26.840
in Descartes' evil deceiver scenario.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.400
Well, how does he propose to get rid of that?

05:30.400 --> 05:34.040
Notice Descartes and Locke are saying, let's use science to help address that.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.640
Some things, yes, we're going to have to surrender to the skeptics.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.280
There really are no colors.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.200
There really are no textures.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.660
But there really is such a thing as mass.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.240
There really is extension in space.

05:45.240 --> 05:49.800
There really is solidity and motion and so forth.

05:49.800 --> 05:55.160
Barkley and Hume both are going to say, I don't think that will do it.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.060
Science will not give us a way of drawing that distinction.

05:58.060 --> 06:03.040
The best way of getting rid of the gap between mind and world is to push the world up into

06:03.040 --> 06:04.680
the mind.

06:04.680 --> 06:10.120
If the world is mental through and through, if all we've got are ideas, there's no problem

06:10.120 --> 06:12.280
that how our ideas match the world.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.400
The world consists of our ideas.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
That's it.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.680
So there's a sense in which it does get rid of skepticism.

06:18.680 --> 06:23.080
It gets rid of the gap between mind and the world because the world is entirely mental.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.980
It is itself a projection or construction of mind.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.440
So there is no gap.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.020
There's no place for the skeptic to get a foothold and drive a wedge and say, maybe

06:32.020 --> 06:33.560
we're wrong about this.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
What do you mean?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.280
We're wrong about our own ideas?

06:36.280 --> 06:38.800
Our ideas are our ideas.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
That is the world.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
That's all there is.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.080
There isn't any longer any gap.

06:43.080 --> 06:46.720
Well, that's an unusual strategy.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.480
But let's go back to what Descartes and Locke have in mind and see why Barclay thinks it

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
doesn't work.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.400
A primary quality is in the object itself.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.400
It's constant.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.960
It's the thing that we find even in the most minute part of the object.

07:00.960 --> 07:07.760
So things like extension, figure, motion, rest, solidity, impenetrability, number.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.400
These are things that are there in the wheatberry.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.320
They're also there in the flour.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.680
The secondary qualities can differ.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.440
They are the powers of the object to affect us.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.600
They are often not in its minute parts.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.440
So the color of the object, once we pound it, may become quite different.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.680
The way it sounds may be quite different.

07:28.680 --> 07:33.120
Drop a pound of flour on the floor, it's going to sound differently from a pound of wheatberries

07:33.120 --> 07:35.400
being dropped on the floor.

07:35.400 --> 07:40.000
And in general, the secondary qualities are going to change between the large parts of

07:40.000 --> 07:42.760
the object and the small parts of the object.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.440
Sometimes we will perceive them that way, sometimes not.

07:45.440 --> 07:51.120
They are dependent on the mind, dependent on our own perceptual and cognitive faculties.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.400
Well, that's the distinction.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.080
That's the way it's supposed to go.

07:55.080 --> 08:00.120
But Barclay says, actually, we have no basis for thinking that any of our ideas correspond

08:00.120 --> 08:02.840
to some mind-independent reality.

08:02.840 --> 08:07.520
The whole idea here is supposed to be that some ideas, like the idea of mass or the idea

08:07.520 --> 08:12.960
of velocity, the idea of motion, the idea of taking up some space, those really correspond

08:12.960 --> 08:14.240
to the world.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.880
But things like color and texture and taste don't.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.160
Barclay says, actually, I don't see how there's a basis for thinking that any of them do,

08:21.160 --> 08:23.320
even the primary ones.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.600
There are several reasons he gives for this.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.920
One of the arguments is that we can't judge their resemblance to reality.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.040
Locke and Descartes say the primary qualities are adequate.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.960
They correspond to the way the world really is.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
Barclay says, how would you know?

08:37.960 --> 08:44.080
Our perceptions of heights, of weight, of width, and so on, he says moreover, are not

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
constant.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.000
They vary while the objects remain unchanged.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.640
So that's the second argument.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.200
First argument is there's no way to judge this resemblance.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.200
We can't have access.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.760
We basically can't get outside of our heads to judge whether our ideas are matching the

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
world.

08:58.760 --> 09:04.240
One is, you say the test is whether they're constant and invariable and inseparable.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.200
Actually primary qualities are just as inseparable, just as variable.

09:08.200 --> 09:12.000
So let's look at those arguments in turn.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.280
Here is the first argument about resemblance.

09:14.280 --> 09:18.160
Barclay says an idea can be like nothing but an idea.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.120
A color or figure can be like nothing but another color, another figure.

09:22.120 --> 09:26.760
If we look but ever so little into our thoughts, we shall find it impossible for us to conceive

09:26.760 --> 09:30.160
a likeness except only between our ideas.

09:30.160 --> 09:35.560
So the whole thought of Locke and Descartes of a primary quality is it's an idea that

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
matches the world.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.400
But what do you mean, match the world?

09:39.400 --> 09:43.760
What do you mean there's a resemblance between this, that it's adequate in the sense that

09:43.760 --> 09:47.640
it matches or corresponds to what's in the world exactly?

09:47.640 --> 09:52.960
How would we know is partly Barclay's issue, and partly the issue is what without even

09:52.960 --> 09:53.960
mean.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
An idea is an idea.

09:55.080 --> 09:59.840
It's something in my mind, and it's supposed to be something that corresponds to or matches

09:59.840 --> 10:03.080
precisely or resembles something that's really in the world.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.560
Well, I don't understand what this sense of resemblance could be.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.880
So I don't know what it would mean for an idea to resemble something that's not an idea,

10:10.880 --> 10:15.600
but also even if that made sense, I wouldn't know how on earth to get outside the realm

10:15.600 --> 10:20.520
of my ideas to be able to compare it to a thing unaffected by my ideas.

10:20.520 --> 10:25.760
So in a way he's giving us a version of that argument from comparison, saying I am always

10:25.760 --> 10:32.600
perceiving a thing as processed by my faculties, I am always perceiving the thing by virtue

10:32.600 --> 10:33.800
of an idea.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.720
What's before my mind is always an idea.

10:35.720 --> 10:39.000
I can't compare the idea to something that is not an idea.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.520
I can compare ideas to ideas that I can do, but I can't compare ideas to something else.

10:44.520 --> 10:51.360
So not only do I deny he's saying that there is any way for there to be a resemblance here,

10:51.360 --> 10:53.560
but even if there were, how could I know it?

10:53.560 --> 10:57.600
I'd never be able to get at the thing itself to compare.

10:57.600 --> 11:02.680
So I think what really is going on here is something that relates to Locke's conception.

11:02.680 --> 11:07.040
When we were talking about Locke on ideas, I pointed out that the way he characterizes

11:07.040 --> 11:09.400
them is actually somewhat puzzling.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.160
He says that an idea is whatsoever is the object of the understanding what a man thinks.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.400
It's whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.600
It's what his mind is applied about while thinking.

11:21.600 --> 11:26.720
Well, I tried to reconstruct that in terms of first-order cognitive abilities, but Barclay

11:26.720 --> 11:30.640
is taking Locke's words very literally and very directly.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.840
He's saying it's what I'm thinking about.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.240
It is what is before my mind when I'm thinking.

11:35.240 --> 11:41.800
Well, if that's right, then I can never think about the triangle, for example, directly.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.800
I never think about the paper directly.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.960
Always what's before the mind is my idea of the paper.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.800
So my thoughts are really about the idea.

11:52.800 --> 11:57.000
Now that's what worried us before about Locke's definition, but Barclay is going to push that

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
in a certain direction.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.680
He's going to say, look, if what's before my mind when I'm thinking is always an idea,

12:02.680 --> 12:06.840
and then you ask me to judge resemblance, what am I doing?

12:06.840 --> 12:08.600
What's before the mind here?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.360
Let's say it's these two hands.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.320
I'm asked to judge whether this is similar to that.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.560
OK, I can know how to do that because they're hands, but what am I doing when I do it?

12:18.560 --> 12:23.920
I've got two ideas, two perceptions in my mind, and I'm comparing those.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.480
So I'm doing it by comparing the ideas.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.600
Now you say, don't compare the two hands to one another.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.960
Don't compare the two ideas of the hands you have to one another.

12:32.960 --> 12:38.640
Instead, compare the idea of this hand to the hand as it is in itself without using an

12:38.640 --> 12:40.080
idea.

12:40.080 --> 12:44.560
But wait, whatever's before my mind when I think is an idea according to Locke, I never

12:44.560 --> 12:50.080
get at the thing itself without an idea in the way, without an idea in between.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.480
So I can't do it.

12:51.480 --> 12:56.160
A, I don't know what it even means since I have no experience of these things in themselves

12:56.160 --> 12:59.440
to say what that kind of resemblance would even be.

12:59.440 --> 13:04.400
But even if it makes sense, I can't get out of the realm of ideas to do it.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.960
Every time I employ my mind in thinking, I've got an idea.

13:07.960 --> 13:13.040
So at best, I could compare my idea of the thing to the idea of the thing.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.360
Maybe I could do that.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.360
But to compare the idea to the thing, impossible.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.360
No way for me to do it.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.800
Here is a little diagram that might indicate the general kind of thing that Locke seems

13:23.800 --> 13:28.080
to have in mind and what drives Barclay crazy about it.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.600
Within my mind, I have a certain thought of a triangle, let's say, since that's my favorite

13:31.600 --> 13:33.640
example throughout this course.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.960
That thought has a certain content, hey, that's a triangle.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.200
It's using the content of my idea of a triangle.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.400
And that represents that individual object.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.360
Well, okay, that's supposed to be the picture.

13:46.360 --> 13:50.120
And indeed, often that's described as the representative theory of perception.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.400
I represent the triangle in my mind.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.040
But wait a minute, Barclay says.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.080
I don't quite understand what's happening here.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.880
Let's take a look at how this is supposed to develop.

14:02.880 --> 14:07.080
I've got an object I'm perceiving here, like this triangle.

14:07.080 --> 14:12.760
And I within my mind do that by having a thought.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.240
There's a relation of perception.

14:14.240 --> 14:20.000
I perceive the triangle, so in some way the triangle is causing me to have this perception.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.400
And it's got a certain content.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.560
It's related to my idea or concept of a triangle.

14:25.560 --> 14:31.240
And that concept applies to that triangle.

14:31.240 --> 14:35.600
I'm leaving out a lot of things here about the word that might go along and relations

14:35.600 --> 14:38.560
of meaning and reference and all of that.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.640
But the point emerges with something very simple.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.160
Because notice what's going on.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.280
How am I able to think about this triangle?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.840
I think about it by virtue of the fact of having an idea.

14:48.840 --> 14:54.360
Now I say whenever I'm thinking, that's what's before the mind, the idea.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.680
So think of the mind as something like a screen.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.280
And what's playing on the screen are my ideas.

15:01.280 --> 15:08.920
Ah, now the question that Locke and Descartes are trying to solve is this question of the

15:08.920 --> 15:15.360
relationship between my idea and the thing.

15:15.360 --> 15:20.600
I want to know whether there is in particular the kind of resemblance that will allow me

15:20.600 --> 15:22.960
to say this idea is adequate to the thing.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.200
It's a good representation of the thing.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.200
I want there to be a relation of representation here.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.520
And so I need to judge the adequacy of this to use Locke's term.

15:33.520 --> 15:40.520
And I'm going to do that, Barkley says, in terms of resemblance.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.680
But now notice what's going on.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.440
I have to judge the resemblance between my idea and the thing.

15:46.440 --> 15:52.920
But everything that is within my mind here that I have access to is an idea.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.040
So how do I get the thing itself?

15:55.040 --> 16:03.640
I've got to compare now this, that idea, to this, this thing.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.040
But how on earth do I do that?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.160
You want me to think about that thing in itself?

16:08.160 --> 16:11.480
Well, I do that by virtue of having this idea.

16:11.480 --> 16:19.400
If you want me to think about the idea, OK, I guess I can have an idea of an idea.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.840
But notice, that's not going to help me.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.560
I still don't get at this relation.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.760
I now have to think about this relation.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.680
You say, well, think about the idea of that.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.040
Well now I get something else here.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.920
I can have ideas about my ideas about my ideas.

16:33.920 --> 16:34.920
But you get the point.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.600
I never get outside of my own mind to the thing itself.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.680
So I can't judge the resemblance.

16:39.680 --> 16:45.040
So first of all, I have no experience of this kind of relationship between an idea and a

16:45.040 --> 16:46.200
thing.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.760
And remember, Barkley, like Locke, is an empiricist.

16:48.800 --> 16:54.240
He's saying, if I have an idea, it's coming from some impression, some perception or experience.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.320
But I don't have an experience of this.

16:56.320 --> 17:00.760
All the mental experiencing I'm having of comparing is within my own mind of ideas to

17:00.760 --> 17:05.080
ideas, or ideas of one thing to ideas of another thing.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.480
And then, where could I do this?

17:08.480 --> 17:12.880
It's the moment you ask me this question and make me think about it, I'm forming more

17:12.880 --> 17:14.000
ideas.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.720
And so I never get at the thing itself.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.960
I can't get out of it.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.960
Now that's part of what's driving Barkley crazy.

17:20.960 --> 17:25.840
But part of it is, and this is beautiful in a way, he frames this in terms of a dilemma

17:25.840 --> 17:27.000
for Locke.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.680
He says, look, I don't understand.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.400
In this kind of picture, can I think about the triangle?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.440
Can I perceive the triangle?

17:34.440 --> 17:41.280
He says, I ask whether these supposed originals or external things, of which our ideas are

17:41.280 --> 17:45.840
the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or no.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.360
If they are, then they're ideas.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.920
And we've gained our point.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.840
But if you say they're not, I appeal to anyone whether it be sense to assert that a color

17:55.840 --> 18:00.520
is like something that's invisible, hard or soft like something that's intangible, and

18:00.520 --> 18:02.620
so on of the rest.

18:02.620 --> 18:08.440
So he's basically saying, OK, I want to ask you a question about this thing.

18:08.440 --> 18:14.480
I want to ask a question about this triangle, the thing itself, this external object, this

18:14.480 --> 18:16.360
original, as he puts it.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.920
And I want to say, is that something I can perceive or no?

18:18.920 --> 18:21.920
Locke, you've said that ideas are what's before the mind.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.680
Well, you also characterize this in representational terms.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.480
That idea is supposed to represent the thing out there in the mind, or out there in the

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
world.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.480
Well, can I perceive that thing or not?

18:34.480 --> 18:40.760
If you say yes, I can perceive that thing, wait a minute, what do I perceive?

18:40.760 --> 18:42.960
Everything before the mind is an idea.

18:42.960 --> 18:48.120
So if you answer yes, I can perceive this, you've just put it in the mind and made it

18:48.120 --> 18:51.920
into an idea by your own definition of idea.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.600
So as you say, no, I can't perceive it.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.040
Only ideas are the things I perceive.

18:58.040 --> 19:02.600
Then it's even worse, because now you're saying, OK, I can't perceive this.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
I can't see it.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.840
It's invisible.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.960
And you're saying this idea is like something invisible?

19:08.960 --> 19:12.600
That doesn't make any sense.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.840
Little things don't have three sides and three angles.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.600
This has three sides and three angles.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.680
What are you talking about?

19:17.680 --> 19:23.720
So in short, Barkley is saying there's something confused about the way that Locke is describing

19:23.720 --> 19:25.520
this entire scenario.

19:25.520 --> 19:30.800
What's before the mind is supposedly an idea, but the idea is supposed to represent a thing.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.680
And yet whenever we think about anything, we're thinking about an idea.

19:34.680 --> 19:40.080
Well, either that triangle, that thing is just another idea, and it's really mental

19:40.080 --> 19:43.560
and mind-dependent, or it's not.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.880
But then this whole talk of representation makes no sense.

19:46.880 --> 19:51.080
So he thinks he's got Locke in a real trap.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.760
What are you going to say about these external objects?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.160
Can I perceive them?

19:55.160 --> 19:58.920
If yes, they're mental by your own definition.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.840
If not, then they can't resemble any of these things that are ideas.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.600
And either way, the theory is sunk.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.160
So in our diagram, we can put it this way.

20:10.160 --> 20:16.000
Do I have a relation of perception between my thought and that actual triangle as external

20:16.000 --> 20:17.160
to me?

20:17.160 --> 20:20.120
If so, that object becomes an idea.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.400
And if not, we can't evaluate resemblance.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.360
There's no way to talk about adequacy or inadequacy.

20:26.360 --> 20:31.240
The conclusion that Barkley draws is that there are no primary qualities.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.280
Extension, figure, and motion are only ideas existing in the mind.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.960
An idea can be like nothing but another idea.

20:37.960 --> 20:43.360
Consequently, neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance.

20:43.360 --> 20:48.680
Hence it's plain that the very notion of what's called matter or corporeal substance involves

20:48.680 --> 20:50.520
a contradiction in it.

20:50.520 --> 20:54.320
So notice here, he's arguing there are no primary qualities.

20:54.320 --> 20:59.040
The moment you postulate some quality that is in the thing itself, I'm forced to talk

20:59.040 --> 21:00.880
about the idea of that.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.120
And ideas can be like nothing but another idea.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.960
So actually, they can't exist independently of the mind.

21:06.960 --> 21:12.360
If I'm to talk about adequacy or representation or any kind of match or resemblance, then

21:12.360 --> 21:18.480
they have to be mental, along with the ideas that I can characterize in this way.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.680
But then they aren't really substances.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.240
They aren't really matter.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.800
They're creatures of the mind.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.680
And so there is no way to talk about qualities.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.080
They're really out there in the thing itself, independently of the mind.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.680
There is nothing independent of the mind.

21:31.680 --> 21:39.280
Well, that is, he thinks, what follows from taking seriously Locke's talk that we think

21:39.280 --> 21:44.680
by having ideas before the mind, and those ideas are meant to represent things.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.120
Those things end up being mental.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.120
And if that's true, there's no such thing as a primary quality.

21:50.120 --> 21:54.200
There's no such thing as a material substance.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.160
Let's take a look at the other argument he gives, an argument based on variability.

21:58.160 --> 22:02.320
The whole way of distinguishing primary from secondary quality, he says, is supposed to

22:02.320 --> 22:05.160
be that the primary qualities are inseparable.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.680
They are constant.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.200
But actually, they're not.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.640
People's perceptions vary, says the argument from variability.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.200
And there's no way to decide among them, so we should suspend judgment.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.200
Well, Barclay goes back to that skeptical form of argument and uses it against Locke,

22:20.200 --> 22:24.640
and says, you say this is a reason for us to think that the secondary qualities aren't

22:24.640 --> 22:25.980
really in the world.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.240
They can vary.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.560
They can depend on context.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.480
They can depend on the perceiver.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.240
And there's no way to decide what would really be in the object, so we should suspend judgment

22:34.240 --> 22:38.000
about that and, in fact, deny that they are in the object.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.040
He says, but wait a minute, the same thing applies to the primary qualities, too.

22:42.040 --> 22:46.000
They also vary, and there's no way to decide among them.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.360
So you claim that this will allow us to draw the distinction.

22:50.360 --> 22:54.060
This set of qualities is invariable and inseparable.

22:54.060 --> 22:57.100
This one is variable and separable.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.740
Barclay says they're all variable.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.540
They're all separable.

23:00.540 --> 23:04.220
Nothing ends up being a primary quality by that criterion.

23:04.220 --> 23:08.580
The perceptions we have of primary qualities vary, too.

23:08.580 --> 23:09.580
Now why?

23:09.580 --> 23:14.360
Well, let's take a look, he says, at a mites view of the world.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.740
This is an actual photograph of dust mites on a carpet.

23:18.740 --> 23:23.060
Now to us, that carpet might look clean.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.660
It might look bug-free.

23:25.660 --> 23:29.300
It might look as if it's a smooth textured carpet.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.140
To a mites, it looks very different.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.020
It's crawling with other mites.

23:33.020 --> 23:37.240
It's actually very rough and has a kind of texture that's quite complex.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.500
It looks like a bowl of spaghetti.

23:39.500 --> 23:43.980
And so the mites view of that is very different from our own view.

23:43.980 --> 23:47.700
Even though notice here, we're not talking just about texture in the sense of being a

23:47.700 --> 23:53.380
secondary quality, we're talking about the actual shape of the thing.

23:53.380 --> 23:57.460
The shape looks really different from a mites point of view.

23:57.460 --> 24:00.880
This is an even more disturbing photograph.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.660
These are mites on human skin.

24:03.660 --> 24:09.580
That is what human skin that feels smooth to us looks like to one of these mites.

24:09.580 --> 24:13.020
Looks like a series of caverns, deeply disturbing.

24:13.020 --> 24:16.020
Looks like that person badly needs some hand cream.

24:16.020 --> 24:20.060
But whatever we want to conclude about that, the mites view, it is really different from

24:20.060 --> 24:21.260
our view.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.980
Even though again, we're talking about the shape.

24:23.980 --> 24:26.260
We're talking about the extension of it.

24:26.260 --> 24:31.620
We're talking about things that ought to be among the primary qualities.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.460
But perceptions vary.

24:34.460 --> 24:36.060
Among species, yes.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.740
But even for us.

24:37.740 --> 24:43.060
Phylonus, one of the characters in the dialogue here, says, from what you've laid down, it

24:43.060 --> 24:47.660
follows that both the extension by you perceived and that perceived by the mite itself, as

24:47.660 --> 24:51.860
likewise all those perceived by lesser animals, or each of them the true extension of the

24:51.860 --> 24:53.100
mites foot.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.900
After all, these are perceptions of a primary quality.

24:55.900 --> 24:59.100
So they're supposed to be in the things themselves.

24:59.100 --> 25:03.700
But Phylonus says, by that criterion, you're led into an absurdity.

25:03.700 --> 25:08.660
We see this as having a certain kind of, now I don't want to say just texture, but a certain

25:08.660 --> 25:09.860
kind of shape.

25:09.860 --> 25:12.860
The mite views it as having a very different kind of shape.

25:12.860 --> 25:14.140
What does that tell us?

25:14.140 --> 25:18.260
If shape is a primary quality, that's supposed to be really in the thing.

25:18.260 --> 25:22.300
But it's the shape as perceived by the mite that's in the thing, or the shape as perceived

25:22.300 --> 25:24.300
by us that's in the thing.

25:24.300 --> 25:28.740
We've got to say, if we really take that to correspond, in both cases, that they're

25:28.740 --> 25:29.740
both in the thing.

25:29.740 --> 25:32.140
But that's a manifest contradiction.

25:32.140 --> 25:36.620
Well, it's not just a question of different species.

25:36.620 --> 25:40.060
Maybe we want to say, I don't care how a mite sees things, or how an elephant would

25:40.060 --> 25:42.060
see it, or a bat would see it.

25:42.060 --> 25:43.500
I mean, maybe we should.

25:43.500 --> 25:47.140
But suppose you say, let's stay in the human realm.

25:47.140 --> 25:48.980
The same problem emerges.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.780
Phylonus says, look, think about a human being.

25:51.780 --> 25:56.900
As we approach an object or a seed from it, the visible extension varies, being at one

25:56.900 --> 25:59.660
distance ten or a hundred times greater than another.

25:59.660 --> 26:05.660
Doth it not therefore follow from hence likewise that it's not really inherent in the object?

26:05.660 --> 26:07.700
My perceptions vary.

26:07.700 --> 26:11.820
Depending upon, well, all sorts of things, maybe dependent on my mood, depending upon

26:11.820 --> 26:17.380
the time of day, how tired I am, but also on the basis of my distance from the object.

26:17.380 --> 26:19.780
So here's an example.

26:19.780 --> 26:23.900
This is a mountain known as Shiprock in northwestern New Mexico.

26:23.900 --> 26:29.300
It was something that was used as a guidepost by people who were on wagon trains across the

26:29.300 --> 26:32.760
west headed for California and other destinations.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.420
You can see it from hundreds of miles away.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.740
And here it is from hundreds of miles away.

26:37.740 --> 26:41.680
It looks rather small there, and it's hard to tell how far away you are.

26:41.680 --> 26:47.080
That might be a smaller mountain, and you're not that far away, or it might be a very large

26:47.080 --> 26:49.120
mountain and you're quite far away.

26:49.120 --> 26:59.320
In any case, as you approach Shiprock, it looks bigger and bigger.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.720
And by the time you get right up to it, you realize this thing is huge.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.000
That's why you can see it hundreds of miles away and why it was a good guidepost for

27:07.000 --> 27:09.360
people seeking to cross the desert.

27:09.920 --> 27:15.160
Well, that sort of thing is not just something that happens in wagon trains, it's something

27:15.160 --> 27:16.640
that happens all the time.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.720
I see something across the room, and it looks very small.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.280
In fact, you might ask me a question about it, and I might find it hard to answer.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.920
I could hold up these keys, for example, and ask you about the shape of the keys, and you

27:27.920 --> 27:29.800
might say, well, they look very small.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.760
But if I bring it toward the camera, they look larger and larger.

27:33.760 --> 27:38.880
And indeed, if I bring them closer to my eyes, they look bigger and bigger in my visual field.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.200
That kind of thing is commonplace.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.680
I see something far away as I'm driving.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.520
It looks very small, far away.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.360
I might be driving toward Dallas.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.360
I see the Dallas skyline, but I'm far away.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.000
And I think, well, Dallas doesn't look that impressive.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.440
But then when I get up close to it, I realize, oh, this is a big city, and it looks much

27:57.440 --> 27:58.920
more impressive.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.360
The same thing can happen when you're flying over something.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.200
Imagine being in an airplane looking down on, let's say, New York City.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.300
I've often flown over New York City.

28:08.300 --> 28:13.960
You look down, and from a distance or a very high height, it doesn't look that big.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.400
And the buildings there are barely discernible.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.640
It looks tiny.

28:17.640 --> 28:22.240
But on the other hand, when you're flying much lower over it, things look large.

28:22.240 --> 28:26.440
And of course, if you're there just in a building, like at the top of the Empire State Building

28:26.440 --> 28:29.280
looking at it, it looks huge.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.760
So New York City is something that looks gigantic.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.000
When you're close up, it can look small if you're far away.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.220
You might have had the experience being very in a very tall tower, a tall office building

28:40.220 --> 28:44.680
or something like that, where you look down at the road and people look like ants.

28:44.680 --> 28:48.680
Well, that's because they look really small when you're far away.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.320
On the other hand, when you're up close, you realize, no, they're the normal size for people.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.520
And that sort of phenomenon is every day.

28:56.520 --> 29:01.360
So yes, the sizes of things can vary, not only from context to context.

29:01.360 --> 29:06.480
I mean, something might look much smaller if I put it next to something that's really large.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.960
And in fact, often people, to take a photograph of something really large, will put something

29:10.960 --> 29:14.760
next to it or have a person stand next to it or something so that you get a sense of

29:14.760 --> 29:19.040
scale and so that you can see, look, I know it looks small in the photograph, this thing

29:19.040 --> 29:21.240
is really large.

29:21.240 --> 29:26.800
And that's because all of these things can affect our perception, our perception of primary

29:26.800 --> 29:27.880
qualities.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.920
The same thing can happen with respect to something like mass or motion.

29:31.920 --> 29:37.760
The same motion might feel very fast or very slow, depending upon the context.

29:37.760 --> 29:42.240
In this case, not how close we are to it, though that can be true too, watch an airplane

29:42.240 --> 29:43.320
go across the sky.

29:43.320 --> 29:46.960
The plane is going at hundreds of miles an hour, but it looks for our vantage point

29:46.960 --> 29:50.200
on the ground as if it's traveling very slowly.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.200
The same thing can happen if you've ever flown a plane.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.520
I have.

29:54.520 --> 30:00.080
And when you stop flying a plane and get into your car, for example, the speed you're going

30:00.080 --> 30:03.720
in a car feels so unbelievably slow.

30:03.720 --> 30:08.920
I had a friend who was a pilot and he was constantly getting speeding tickets.

30:08.920 --> 30:12.240
And it's not really just because he was the kind of person who speeds a lot and ignores

30:12.240 --> 30:13.240
the law.

30:13.240 --> 30:18.520
It's because when you've been up in an airplane, the speeds you get used to are the speeds

30:18.520 --> 30:20.680
of going hundreds of miles an hour.

30:20.680 --> 30:26.120
When you then are on the ground traveling at 60, it feels like you're crawling.

30:26.120 --> 30:30.000
And so that kind of thing is a phenomenon we're familiar with.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.920
But wait, velocity was a primary quality.

30:32.920 --> 30:36.600
So is that airplane moving across the sky quickly or not?

30:36.600 --> 30:40.680
Well, we're perceiving a primary quality of motion there.

30:40.680 --> 30:45.840
But the feeling for the pilot and the feeling of us on the ground can't both be right.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.760
They can't both match the actual velocity.

30:48.760 --> 30:54.120
And the same thing is true of driving a car when you haven't driven in a while and then

30:54.120 --> 30:56.280
when you've been flying an airplane.

30:56.280 --> 31:00.560
It's the same velocity, but one time it feels fast to you, another time it feels slow.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.600
It can't be both fast and slow.

31:02.600 --> 31:06.380
But again, motion, velocity, is supposed to be a primary quality.

31:06.380 --> 31:10.120
So it looks like we're immediately led into trouble.

31:10.120 --> 31:14.080
Filonius concludes in the dialogue, this isn't in the object.

31:14.080 --> 31:18.720
He says, is it not the very same reasoning to conclude that there is no extension or

31:18.720 --> 31:20.520
a figure in an object?

31:20.520 --> 31:23.880
Because to one eye, it shall seem little, smooth, and round, while at the same time

31:23.880 --> 31:26.720
it appears to the other great, uneven, and regular.

31:26.720 --> 31:32.600
Hylis, who is defending the Lochte-Cart point of view in the dialogue, says, the very same.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.720
But does this latter fact ever happen?

31:34.720 --> 31:38.920
Filonius says you may at any time make the experiment by looking with one eye bare and

31:38.920 --> 31:41.000
with another through a microscope.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.640
So doubt the examples I've given about mites, about speeds of airplanes, about other things.

31:47.640 --> 31:52.200
Maybe they don't convince you, but Filo says, hey, look at a leaf.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.960
Here's how a leaf looks every day.

31:53.960 --> 31:58.960
And we can describe, not just its secondary qualities, its green and so on, but its primary

31:58.960 --> 32:07.520
qualities, describe its shape, describe the actual figure that it corresponds to, describe

32:07.520 --> 32:11.880
it in any way you like, and now look through a microscope.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.240
It looks like that.

32:15.240 --> 32:21.120
Now, yes, its secondary qualities have changed, but the primary qualities have changed too.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.640
That bottom edge, for example, looks smooth.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.000
It's not smooth.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.720
It's pretty bumpy.

32:27.720 --> 32:32.440
And the same thing is going to be true of all sorts of primary qualities of the thing.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.680
Your perception will be very different through a microscope.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.200
You'll be seeing it very up close.

32:38.200 --> 32:44.200
And your perception of the size, of the velocity, of the shape, all of that is going to

32:44.200 --> 32:45.840
be quite different.

32:45.840 --> 32:51.280
Conclusion, Barclay draws, there's no distinction between primary and secondary qualities.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.320
They're all in the mind alone.

32:53.320 --> 32:58.280
If we insist on using those terms at all, the point is all of those qualities are really

32:58.280 --> 33:00.240
secondary qualities.

33:00.240 --> 33:06.280
And so we should be idealists about all qualities, none of them are in the things themselves.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.160
They are all in the mind alone.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.720
Everything is really a construction or a projection of the mind.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.680
Every single quality we attribute to an object is mind dependent.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.680
It is variable.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
It is separable.

33:18.680 --> 33:25.800
It is the kind of thing that is there in the mind, but is not there in the object.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.320
I want to leave you with a question.

33:29.320 --> 33:33.920
We've been attacking here with Barclay that distinction between the primary and secondary

33:33.920 --> 33:35.520
qualities.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.840
But could we do this in a different way?

33:37.840 --> 33:42.680
Instead of saying all qualities are really primary, could we do it in the opposite way?

33:42.680 --> 33:44.600
Actually, they're all in the object.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.600
They're all primary qualities.

33:46.600 --> 33:52.360
Now notice we would have to get rid of Locke's idea that everything before the mind is really

33:52.360 --> 33:53.360
an idea.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.040
We'd have to say, no, I can perceive the triangle.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.240
I don't have to just have an idea before the mind.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.920
The triangle can really be before my mind.

34:01.920 --> 34:09.720
I would also have to say that actually these tests of constancy and invariableness, maybe

34:09.720 --> 34:11.400
those aren't the right tests.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.560
The right test is something else.

34:13.560 --> 34:18.000
But even a secondary quality, maybe I could push all of those into the thing.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.280
I can say, ah, you think the yellow isn't really in the paper?

34:22.280 --> 34:23.440
What if it is?

34:23.440 --> 34:28.080
What if we end up saying, look, being yellow is just reflecting certain wavelengths of

34:28.080 --> 34:29.080
light.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.400
And the paper really does reflect those wavelengths.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.680
That really is a quality of the paper itself.

34:34.680 --> 34:41.200
I think these arguments, as framed, are quite effective against the way Locke sets it all

34:41.200 --> 34:42.400
up.

34:42.400 --> 34:47.280
But maybe the general problem of mind and world here could be addressed in a kind of

34:47.280 --> 34:50.360
Barclayan spirit, but in a different way.

34:50.360 --> 34:55.600
Instead of pushing the world up into the mind, maybe we could push the mind in effect down

34:55.600 --> 35:03.000
into the world and say, actually all of those ideas are about things in the world.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Our thinking is about the things.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.880
It's not about the ideas.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.080
The thing can itself be before the mind.

35:09.080 --> 35:13.320
We can make direct reference to the thing in our thoughts and in our language.

35:13.320 --> 35:18.480
And maybe we could instead then say, actually all those qualities are really in the things

35:18.480 --> 35:19.480
themselves.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.840
They're all primary qualities.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.000
It's not just a question of affecting us in certain ways.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.520
Being red might be reflecting wavelengths of light of a certain kind.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.160
Same thing with being yellow.

35:31.160 --> 35:34.840
Maybe the same thing is true of all of the other secondary qualities.

35:34.840 --> 35:40.280
So even if Barclay succeeds at denying the distinction, maybe we don't have to become

35:40.280 --> 35:42.680
idealists about everything.

35:42.680 --> 35:48.160
Could we instead become realists about all of it and attribute all of this to the things

35:48.160 --> 35:48.920
themselves?
