0	13040	Hi, I want to talk about Aristotle on substance. Aristotle's categories give us ten modes
13040	18240	of being, the most fundamental, the primary one, of which is substance. Everything else
18240	22600	is really a quality of a substance, a quantity of a substance, a relation between substances
22600	28440	and so on. So substance is fundamental. But what is substance? We've talked some about
28440	34000	criteria for identifying substances. Substances can admit contrary qualities. They don't
34000	40400	themselves have contraries. A substance is this such. It's this particular example of
40400	45840	a certain more general kind. And there are a variety of others. But what does that really
45840	51040	mean for what substance is and what kinds of things are substances? You might think,
51040	55400	look, I know already everything I need to know about this. Substances are in the primary
55400	61000	sense particular things. And then in the secondary sense kinds of things. End of story.
61000	66560	Well, not quite. And Aristotle goes into, in great detail in one of the books of the
66560	72060	metaphysics known as metaphysics zeta, about what it really means for something to be a
72060	78320	substance and what substance really is. It turns out the picture is complicated. My only
78320	84800	incomplete that I received during my graduate education was in a course on Aristotle. I
84800	90160	took on the problem of explaining Aristotle's analysis of substance in metaphysics zeta
90160	95640	as the topic for my term paper. I couldn't finish it within the semester. And I figured,
95640	99960	well, I'll write it over the summer. Over the summer I studied the question. I read more
99960	106140	and more about it. Finally, I became convinced I couldn't solve the problem. And so quickly
106140	111160	shifted my topic to Aristotle on infinity and wrote a paper about that, which was not
111160	118600	exactly my greatest work. But that problem about substance, I in the end considered insoluble.
118600	122960	And as you'll see today, I have more ideas about it. But actually, I think still Aristotle's
122960	129080	point in a way is nothing really fulfills all of the considerations, all of the criteria
129080	135360	intuitively that we have for being a substance. Why is it complicated? Well, let's start
135360	141040	our discussion by reminding ourselves about the role that substance plays in the categories.
141040	147320	Substances that are in no way composite signify substance, quantity, quality, relation, place,
147320	153800	time, position, state, action, or affection. Those are the basic categories. Substance,
153800	156920	in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the word, is that which is neither
156920	162840	predictable of a subject nor present in a subject. And so all of those other things are predicated
162840	168280	of substance. He refers to these, in fact, as figures of predication. And so we talk
168360	173720	about quantities of substance or qualities of substance, relations between substances.
173720	177200	Substances being in a certain position or in a certain state as doing things, having
177200	183040	things done to them. In short, we predicate other things of substances. But substances
183040	187440	are the things that aren't predictable of something else. They aren't present in something
187440	194040	else. They are the ultimate subjects of predication. So Aristotle says everything except primary
194040	199080	substances is either predicated of primary substances or is present in them. And if these
199080	203280	didn't exist, it'd be possible for anything else to exist. If there were no substances,
203280	207040	there would be no quantities or qualities or relations or places or times or anything
207040	213240	else as well. So they are most properly called substances because they underlie everything
213240	220640	else. As the name suggests, they stand, stand, under, sub, everything else. They are the
220680	227680	basic foundation, the basic things the universe consists of. So he says the science of substance,
228400	232920	understanding substance, must be of the nature of wisdom. If you really want to understand
232920	237840	the world at the deepest level, you've got to understand substance. That turns out, however,
237840	243480	to be rather difficult. The overall question here is the deepest question, I think, of
243480	249760	metaphysics, which is the question of ontology. And Willard Van Orman Quine, a 20th century
249800	254120	philosopher, has put this question beautifully at the beginning of one of his papers called
254120	259520	On What There Is. A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity. It
259520	264840	can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables. What is there? It can be answered moreover
264840	270240	in a word, everything. And everyone will accept this answer is true. However, this is merely
270240	274760	to say there is what there is. There remains room for disagreement over cases. And so the
274800	280800	issue is stayed alive down through the centuries. Well, that's precisely right. What is there?
280800	286200	Everything. Well, Aristotle's a little more specific than that. What is there? Substance.
286200	293200	But what's substance? Well, substance is that which is primarily, not in any qualified sense,
293480	300480	but without qualification. It's what exists. That is substance. But we need criteria for
301000	305720	figuring out what substance is and for identifying then the particular things that we take to
305720	311040	be the fundamental constituents of the world. Well, all substance, he says, appears to signify
311040	317800	that which is individual. It is this as well as such. It's an individual thing as well
317800	323200	as a thing of a certain kind. Another mark of substance is that it has no contrary. There's
323200	328560	no opposite in the way that hot is the opposite of cold or right is the opposite of left or
328640	334560	being on top of something is the opposite of being under something or there isn't anything
334560	340800	like that with substance. Substance doesn't admit a varying degrees. We don't have something
340800	345640	that is more a cat than other things. If you're either a cat or you're not a cat, one cat
345640	350680	can't be more cat than another cat. The most distinctive mark of substance, he says, is
350680	355680	that it admits contrary qualities. The cat can be awake or asleep. It can be running
355680	362680	or it can be staying still. It can be meowing or it can be silent. So here are some criteria.
363120	368680	Putting these down on a list of substance isn't predictable of or present in anything else.
368680	373800	It underlies everything else. It's individual. It's of this. It has no contrary. There are
373800	380080	no degrees of it and it admits contrary qualities. It can be changed and undergo a change of
380080	387080	quality while remaining the same. Now, what do we mean when we say substance is primary?
388840	392600	That's not that easy a question to answer. Aristotle says there are actually several
392600	398000	senses in which a thing may be said to be primary or first. Substance, however, is first
398000	402840	in every sense. It's first in definition. It's first in order of knowledge and it's
402840	409840	first in time. So let's think first about time. Other categories can't exist independently,
409840	414600	only substance. You can't just have the color red floating around independently. It's
414600	419920	got to be a red something. You can't just have an action of throwing, for example, without
419920	424640	anyone doing the throwing or anything being thrown. And so substance has to be there in
424640	429080	order for anything else to exist. If there were no substance, nothing could be thrown,
429080	434040	nothing could throw. Nothing could be red or could be tall or could be lying over on
434040	441040	its side and so on. And what about first in definition? Well, everything else is a quality
442000	447480	of a substance, a relation among substances, a quantity of a substance, an action or a state
447480	454480	or affection of a substance. So in short, all of those have substance in their very definitions.
454920	461920	And what about in the order of knowledge? We know substances most fully and most particularly.
461920	466560	It says, here's the way to do it. Think about knowing something. Before you really can know
466560	471000	anything else about it, the most important thing to know is what is it? What kind of
471000	478120	thing is it? Is it a man? Is it fire? Is it a horse? Is it an action? You need to know
478120	481800	what kind of thing it is. You need to know what a thing is before you can even start
481800	487200	describing it. Surely first in the order of knowledge is knowing that it's a person or
487200	490880	knowing that it's a book, knowing that it's a table, knowing that it's a vegetable and
490880	497880	so forth. Now, Aristotle says the question raised of old and raised now and always, what
500880	506400	is substance? Well, he gives us four candidates. And this is interesting because you might
506400	510480	have thought, well, wait, we've known this already, right? We mean particular things
510480	516320	like this book and then the general kind book or this particular human being and then the
516360	523360	general kind humanity or human being. But not so fast. In metaphysics Zeta he says there
523800	528320	are actually four candidates. Well, four and question mark, there's really an obvious
528320	533400	fifth which he somehow seems to neglect in the discussion. The word substance is applied,
533400	538040	if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects, for both the essence and the
538040	543760	universal and the genus are thought to be the substance of each thing and fourthly the
543760	548280	substratum. Now, this is quite startling when you see it. Wait a minute. I thought we had
548280	552440	particular things and then kinds of thing. That's it. But now we're talking, well, I
552440	557000	mean, what happened to the things? What happened to the kinds? We've got, well, we've got genus
557000	561480	as a kind type term. Those are the secondary substances of the categories. But we've got
561480	568480	essences and universals and the substratum. What's going on here? Well, I thought we were
568720	574760	talking about primary substances, individual things, things like this book or this human
574760	581760	being. Ah, well, let's go through our criteria. Not predictable of or present to anything else.
581760	587160	True. I am not predictable of anything else. Neither is that book. Underlying everything
587160	591680	else. Yes, individual things seem to underlie everything else. If there were no individual
591680	595880	things there would be nothing at all. So nothing would have any qualities or relations
595880	602880	and so on. Individual. Yes, it's this book, this human being. And so individuality. Check.
603600	608800	No contrary. Right. There's no contrary. Nothing that's the opposite of being Dan Bonnevac.
608800	614280	No degrees can't be more Dan Bonnevac than somebody else. So either you are or you aren't.
614280	618880	And the same thing with just being human. You either are or you aren't. Admitting contrary
618880	625160	qualities. Yes, I can speak. I can be silent. So I can exhibit contrary qualities. The book
625160	633440	might be closed. The book might be open. Contrary qualities. But ah, primary. Here Aristotle
633440	638160	says, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm looking for the ultimate constituents of the world.
638160	644720	The things that are primary in the sense that they are the most basic things. And actually
644720	651720	this book or this human being, they seem composite. There is both the this and the such aspect.
651720	658720	They seem to have matter and form. I am this person in this body, in this flesh and blood.
660920	665960	I have a certain form. I have an essence. And we'll talk more about what essences are.
665960	670000	But certain things are accidental to me. They can change and I remain the same. Other things
670000	676360	might be essential to me in that if they change, I am no longer who I am. And so we can talk
676360	684040	about my essence, my form, my matter. Ooh, I seem to be composite. But Aristotle says,
684040	687720	I'm not talking about composite things now. I want to know what the ultimate constituents
687720	691760	of the world are. And these particular things that I took to be primary substances in the
691760	698040	categories, they look composite. What are they made up of? What are their ultimate constituents?
698040	704080	Hmm, maybe they're physical parts. Maybe they're form. Maybe something else. Now we have to
704120	710880	investigate. Well, one possibility is the substratum. Okay, so Aristotle says the substratum
710880	716840	is that of which everything else is predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything
716840	724000	else. So I think about myself as a human being. And I think, okay, good, humanity is being
724000	729200	predicated of me. Human being, that's something like a species. So that's a more general kind
729240	736040	of thing. It's a secondary substance, but it's found here in me a primary substance. But admittedly,
736040	741240	I'm not predicated of anything else. I satisfy that criterion. But am I basic? I do seem to have
741240	750120	matter, this flesh and blood. And then I have a form in this general shape of a body. But also,
750120	755000	we can talk about my form in a sort of mental state, talk about my personality or my consciousness
755080	760120	or something of that sort. And then I have an essence, things that could not change while I
760120	768760	remain the same person. And then you could say, well, let me ask a different question. What or
768760	775120	who is it that is Dan Bonobak? After all, we've said, aha, humanity, that gets attributed to Dan
775120	781440	Bonobak. Dan Bonobak, well, something here is being Dan Bonobak. What is that thing? Suppose I
781480	786120	say, well, it's that flesh and blood. You could say, well, what is it that is that flesh and blood?
786120	793440	I don't know what to say about this. And we're going to see this in a number of different
793440	799880	philosophers throughout the term. But you might think, okay, look, maybe I mean, whatever that
799880	804760	ultimate thing is, that is Dan Bonobak. So I look at the book and I say, yeah, I'm not talking about
804760	809360	the book as the fundamental thing. After all, books are obviously not basic constituents of the
809360	815120	universe. They're made up of pages and those pages contain words. And, and so it looks as if this
815120	819920	book is something that I can't identify as a basic constituent of the universe. There is something
819920	825320	that is this book. Let's say it's these pages. Well, there's something that constitutes these pages.
825320	832440	What's that? And I can keep pushing down. And so Aristotle thinks maybe there is a substratum here,
832440	838240	maybe here in the end, it's the paper, let's say, or in my case, maybe it really just is the flesh
838400	843800	and blood, or it is the ultimate constituents of my biochemistry, whatever we end up saying about
843800	849880	that. We end up with a substratum that isn't predictable of or present in anything else that
849880	858680	does seem to underlie everything else. But is it individual? Hmm, it's primary in a way, but the
858680	863120	individuality seems disturbing. Let's think about a statute. It's a little easier than thinking
863120	869480	about a human being or a book. In one sense, matter is said to be the nature of the nature of a
869480	874640	substratum in another shape and in a third the compound of these. By the matter, I mean, for
874640	880520	instance, the bronze. By the shape, the pattern of its form, in this case, the cap. And by the
880520	886440	compound of these, the statute, the concrete hole. So if I'm looking for ultimate constituents of the
886440	893760	universe, well, primary substance in the terms of the book, the categories, is that sculpture. But
893760	899760	now I say, well, that sculpture doesn't really seem primary. So what is it that is that sculpture?
899760	907640	It's a certain shape, but what is in that shape? Well, the bronze. Now, later philosophers will
907640	913560	say, so what is that bronze? And push it even further. But Aristotle is willing to stop with the
913560	919440	bronze or the paper or the flesh and blood, etc. In any case, we've got to consider those
919440	924120	possibilities. Maybe the ultimate constituent is simply the statue, the hole, the matter and form
924120	929320	together, that individual object. That's what he assumes throughout the book, the categories. But
929320	935440	it could also be just the matter, just the bronze, it could be just the form, just the shape. So,
935440	943160	let's take those in turn. The compound, could it be the compound of matter and form? That is to
943160	950320	say, that matter in that particular shape, that bronze shaped that way. Well, Aristotle says,
950320	956560	look, we can easily dismiss that. It's obviously posterior. It's nature is obvious. It is not
956560	961960	the basic thing. It's not like you say, what's the basic constituent? Oh, it's this bronze statue
961960	970360	of a cat. No, right? Surely that is a compound of the bronze put in that shape. So it's not primary,
970520	976560	it's not going to count. What about the matter, the bronze, there in the shape of the cat, here in
976560	984680	the shape of the man? Well, is it the bronze that is primary? Aristotle is tempted to go in that
984680	990440	direction, but then he says, well, that statement is obscure. On this view, matter becomes substance.
990440	995760	If this isn't substance, it battles us to say what else he is. When all else is stripped off,
995800	1002120	evidently nothing but matter remains. So I look at the sculpture and I say, take away the shape,
1002120	1007440	abstract away from the shape, take away that olive branch behind his ear, take away the nose,
1007440	1013360	take away all of that. What's left? Well, just the bronze. But really, in the end, it's just well,
1013360	1018080	stuff like bronze. I mean, it might be, right? If we're thinking in terms of chemistry, we might
1018080	1024160	say the ultimate elements, the iron. Actually, bronze is something of a compound, there are a
1024160	1030840	mixture. So really, it should be things like, okay, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, etc. The basic
1030840	1035720	chemical elements, maybe that is what counts as the ultimate constituents of the universe. Or
1035720	1042000	maybe it's the atoms of those or the micro particles making up those atoms. But in any case,
1042000	1048960	well, nothing but matter is really going to remain. So what's wrong with that? Well, Aristotle says,
1049120	1054080	look, take away length and breadth and depth. There's nothing left unless there's something
1054080	1060480	bounded by these. So if you consider the matter this way, matter alone must seem to be substance.
1061040	1065680	Well, that would be neither a particular thing nor a certain quantity nor assigned to any of the
1065680	1070880	other categories by which it's determined. All those determinations are gone. We can no longer
1070880	1076400	say, oh, it's a statue or it's a man or it's a book or it's anything of any particular kind. It's
1076400	1081600	just the matter in the end. So he says, look, we lose something really important. Maybe we gain
1081600	1087040	some degree of primacy, but we lose other things we cared about. The ultimate substratum would
1087040	1090720	itself be neither a particular thing or a particular quantity or otherwise positively
1090720	1096320	characterized. Nor would it be the negations of these. They would belong to it only by accident.
1097040	1103600	So it would turn out that matter is substance, but hold on a second. We said that being of this
1103680	1110720	such was crucial to substance. Being separable, having its own independent individual existence,
1110720	1117840	being of this, those are among our criteria too and matter surely fails that. So that won't work.
1117840	1124240	Matter can't be right. Well, the substratum then satisfies us with respect to being not
1124240	1129600	present in anything else, not being predictable of something else, underlying everything else,
1129600	1133840	good, but individual. No, it's not individual. It fails that test.
1135200	1141600	What about essence? I do have an essence as a human being. Well, how about that? Is that
1141600	1149120	something that can count? He groups those together under shape, form, the universal.
1150320	1154240	The question of essence is complicated. We'll talk about that separately. But for now, let's
1154240	1158400	just go with this idea that by essence, I mean something like the shape or the form or the
1158400	1164320	universal I exemplify. I mean something like being a human being in my case, or being a book,
1164880	1170960	or maybe being a statue of a cat in that particular shape, or of a Greek goddess,
1170960	1178560	or of an Olympic winner, etc. Shape, you might think, is a universal. So those are coins,
1178560	1183760	all of which are bronze coins, but all of which are in basically the same shape, the same form.
1184000	1190400	Well, can we count the universal or the shape or the form as itself substance?
1191600	1197600	Plato, Aristotle thinks, wants to do that. But he says, no, that can't be right. It seems impossible
1197600	1203040	that any universal term should be the name of a substance. Why? Well, the substance of a thing
1203040	1208240	is what is peculiar to it that doesn't belong to anything else. But the universal is common.
1208320	1215200	Universal is, by definition, something that is multiply instantiated. So look, it, by its very
1215200	1219280	nature, belongs to more than one thing. There can be more than one human being, more than one triangle,
1219280	1225840	more than one statue, more than one cat. So where's the individuality? It looks like universal can't
1225840	1230720	be it. And it can't be shape or form or anything like that. We can have lots and lots of different
1230720	1236400	statues produced in a factory with exactly the same shape, multiply instantiable,
1236400	1243200	so we don't get what's unique. So Aristotle says, well, look, no universal attribute can be a
1243200	1249520	substance. And not only for that reason, because also it is predictable of things. I can say that
1249520	1255520	has the shape of a cat. And that's something that I can predicate of that statue. So it's
1255520	1260080	predictable of other things. It is something that can be in something else. It's multiply
1260080	1265600	instantiable. It flunks a bunch of different tests of substance. It fails our test of not
1265600	1272240	being predictable, but it fails others as well. And so we want to say, look, everything that's common
1272240	1278800	indicates not of this, but a such. But a substance is of this. We agreed that substance was of this
1278800	1285920	such, particular of a certain kind. And a universal isn't like that. It is purely the universal part.
1285920	1292320	Maybe it's an answer to the such part. It is not an answer to this part. So it fails individuality.
1292320	1302400	Well, what about a kind? We've talked about that as a secondary substance in the categories. And so
1302400	1307200	we might look at it and say, well, maybe Aristotle's changed his mind by the time he gets to metaphysics.
1307200	1312000	Maybe he's decided the secondary is really primary. And we should be talking about kinds,
1312000	1318240	about general sorts or types of things. But look, that doesn't work either. It's
1318240	1324800	predictable of something else. I am a human being, for example. That animal is a cat. That is a book.
1325760	1331920	It also fails individuality. Because after all, it's of this such, this human being.
1333120	1339200	The kind is giving you the such, not this. So we summarize and we say, well, we've looked at now
1339200	1345280	five possibilities. Is it an individual thing? It looks like that's compound. It's not primary.
1345280	1351360	Matter? It's not individual. What about shape or form or universal? It's predictable and it's not
1351360	1356160	individual. What about a kind? It's predictable. It's not individual. What about the combination
1356160	1360960	of matter and form? Well, now we're back to the individual thing. It's compound is not primary.
1360960	1366880	So in the end, I think Aristotle thinks nothing on that list really satisfies everything we wanted
1366880	1374080	about the nature of substance. We went thinking, look, I've got a very intuitive idea. What is the
1374080	1377680	basic structure of the world? Let's look at the structure of language and the structure of thought.
1378480	1383760	Everything is really about in the end. Well, in language, nouns. It's about persons,
1383760	1388480	places, things. It's about individual objects, individual people, individual things. But then
1388480	1395120	we look and we say, wait a minute. I wanted it to be, yes, individual, but also primary and not
1395120	1399440	compound. Something that underlies everything else I wanted it to be having. The ability to
1399440	1404320	admit contrary qualities, but to have no contrary itself and so on and so forth. I didn't want it
1404320	1409520	to become positive. I wanted it to be simple and basic. And it turns out I can't have it all.
1409520	1416080	I can either go with the compound, but hey, in other respects, satisfying things, that is to say,
1416080	1421280	the matter plus form, the individual thing, or I can go with some element like the essence or the
1421280	1426880	shape, form, universal, matter, kind. And then I'm going to have to give up the idea that this is not
1426880	1431760	practicable. I'll have to give up the idea of individuality. I will have to surrender my
1431760	1437600	conception that substance is not this such. I have a big price to pay no matter what. So in short,
1437600	1445120	the moral seems to be this. Nothing satisfies all the criteria for being a substance. Well,
1446800	1452960	that's disappointing. And so Aristotle in a kind of summary says, well, look, what are we really
1453040	1458720	in the undo then? If we can't have everything, what do we settle for? Here's what we settle for.
1458720	1464080	We call substance, first of all, the simple bodies, like the elements, in other words, earth, air,
1464080	1471040	fire, water, everything of that sort. But also the individual things composed of them, bodies, books,
1471040	1475760	human beings, and so forth. All those are called substance because they're not predicated of a
1475760	1481520	subject. Everything else is predicated to them. So in short, we refer to both the basic elements
1481520	1485760	and then the things made up out of those elements, the compounds, the individual objects,
1485760	1490720	the individual people, those are substances. They satisfy at least some of the criteria
1490720	1497280	for being a substance. We sometimes refer to substances as a principle or even a cause and
1497280	1503840	pursue it from that starting point, he says. So sometimes we focus on the cause. And here we're
1503840	1508720	looking towards something like an essence, like the soul of an animal or a human being.
1509360	1514640	And we think about a person's mind, let's say, and we think of that as something like a substance.
1514640	1519520	It's not a material substance, but nevertheless, it's something like the cause of the motion
1519520	1525680	of the material substance. And so sometimes we extend it in that direction too. Then we talk
1525680	1531280	about the parts of things. Okay, so there's me, this human being, but then there's also this hand,
1531280	1537040	and that hand, and this hair, and those eyes, and so forth, the various parts of me. And then
1537040	1542080	ultimately, of course, the individual atoms, the individual microparticles that make me up.
1542080	1548000	So those are in a different sense, substance. And then finally, he says, the essence.
1549360	1555040	Who am I really? You might think, what is my essence? What is really the essence of being Dan
1555040	1561200	Bonobak? Or, you know, what is this? It's a book. Well, what is it to be a book? I'm looking for the
1561200	1566640	essence of books. So maybe the best answer to what it is, is ultimately an explanation of the essence
1566640	1572320	of the thing. We call that substance too. So in short, we have a variety of criteria. Does
1572320	1579120	anything meet all those criteria? No. But we settle. And we settle in various ways. Sometimes we refer
1579120	1583440	to substances as the individual things. Sometimes to the elements out of which they're composed.
1583440	1587920	Sometimes to the parts out of which they're composed. Sometimes to something like the cause,
1587920	1596400	the mind, the soul. Sometimes we actually refer to, well, gosh, the kind. After all,
1596400	1601120	there are secondary substances. We refer to a bunch of different things. So in the end, he says,
1601120	1604720	and you might think here, he's going to say, so substance has four senses or something.
1605440	1611120	He gives us two, really. Because of those criteria, he tells us, look, we either choose
1611120	1616800	the substratum, the thing that is basic, but forces us to lose the individuality part.
1616800	1622400	So we think about the basic elements, for example, or the bronze. We think about that type of thing
1622400	1627600	where we basically preserve the underlying everything else, but we lose the individuality
1627600	1632880	part. Or we think about the individual things, that this is, whether it's the whole thing or
1632880	1640240	the parts of the thing, this part, this hand, that hand, and so on. Those things we can also take.
1640240	1645920	But then we lose some sense of primacy because they're compounds. So we can't have it all.
1646480	1651440	We settle. We either say, well, this satisfies most of the criteria. I have to give up the
1651440	1655920	individuality part. Or we say, well, it satisfies most of the criteria, but I have to give up
1655920	1663200	the primacy part. In the end, we settle because we can't have everything. So we look at the sculpture,
1663200	1669040	and sometimes we say, what is that? It's bronze. Sometimes what is that? A child reading a book.
1669040	1676080	Sometimes we say, what is that? Well, it consists of several parts. There is the child,
1676080	1680640	there is the base of it, there is the book, and the individual things that are marked so
1680720	1686000	they look like pages. In short, we do lots of different things to answer questions like,
1686000	1699120	what is that? Because, well, there is no one simple way to understand what substance really is.
