00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
Today we return to the wonderful desert landscape of Kwa. And we're gonna be

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,000
talking about an issue that is, well, in a way dominates the next several decades

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,840
in philosophy. Now at first glance you might think it's a very surprising thing.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,160
What is this issue? It's often referred to as the problem of

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
quantifying it and dealing with the issues that arise from a quantified

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,920
load a lot from combining ideas about possibility and necessity or for that

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,760
matter various attitudes on belief and knowledge with quantifiable apparatus

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,320
that allows you to use terms like some and all. Now at first glance you might

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,840
think why is this significant? Why does this pose serious philosophical problems?

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,720
The answer is roughly this. There is a traditional way of looking at

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,080
metaphysics where you think about objects. As in Aristotle, for example,

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,600
there are substances, they have properties, they stand in relation, and some of the

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,400
properties of these substances are essential to them. They couldn't lose

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,840
them without altering what they are. Okay? Other properties are accidental. They

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,280
can change without affecting the identity of the object at all. So for example, what

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,200
are some accidental properties of me? They could change, I would still be me. Yeah.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
Where you're standing? Where I'm standing, exactly. I'm standing here right now, but I

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,320
can move around, I'm still me. Okay? If I do this, you can't suddenly say, well, we

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,760
just keep getting a new professor in this class. Right? I'm still me. Other properties

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,880
that are accidental. What are you wearing? What I'm wearing, exactly. I could wear

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,320
different things, I'm still me. That I'm wearing this kind of sort of cream colored

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,280
shirt. That is an accidental property of mine. What are some other accidental

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:03,200
properties of mine? The color of your hair. Color of my hair? Yeah. I guess I could

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,240
do something about that. It used to be different, but I was the same person. In

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,960
fact, somebody recently saw me. I guess they hadn't seen me in a while. They said,

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,720
when did your hair turn like this? I don't know. Actually, I sort of do know. It all

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,720
happened rather suddenly. But anyway, that's something that is an accidental

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,920
property of mine. What about essential properties? These are properties that are

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,760
necessary to a thing. And in fact, Aristotle gives us three ways of thinking

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,600
about these properties that are necessary to a thing. One is just that. The

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,720
thing cannot lose them without stopping to be what it is. A second is that they

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,280
are the things by virtue of which the thing is what it is. We might say that

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,760
they are the nature of the thing. That's the way he sometimes refers to it. And

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,960
Aquinas later calls it the nature of the thing. It's what makes it what it is. And

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,080
then finally, we could think of it as something like the definition of the

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,880
thing or what corresponds in the thing to what would be a definition of it. Now,

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,480
could there be a definition of me? Aristotle talks about the question of

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,960
whether there could be a definition of Socrates, for example. But there could

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,600
certainly be a definition of a general kind. So we might think we could have a

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,400
definition of bachelor or a definition of human being even. And that these things

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,960
would express what is necessary to being a bachelor or a human being, what makes

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,520
somebody a bachelor or a human being, what would correspond in the thing, the

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,120
properties in the thing that would match the definition of those terms

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,360
bachelor and human being. So are there such essential properties? Well, from one

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,400
point of view, yes, in the Aristotelian tradition, in fact, not only are there

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
such properties, but they're crucial to understanding the nature of the world.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,160
After all, the accidental properties aren't really very important in detailing

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,960
what a thing is, but the essential properties are. And so Aristotelian

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,160
essentialism is this doctrine that some of the properties of a thing are really

50
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,360
substantively identical to it, right? Not identical to it, essential to it. And

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,000
constitutive of its identity in some way. Now, there has been throughout the history

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,720
of philosophy some resistance to this idea. And so there are people, I think

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,120
John Walk would be a good example, at least in, well, in a certain respect, in

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,720
another respect, not at all. Maybe Hume is a good example of someone who is

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,160
doubtful about this idea of essentialism. Why do I say, well, Locke distinguishes

56
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,080
the real from the nominal essence of the thing. He does think things have a real

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,440
essence connected to the real internal constitution of the thing. But most of

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,920
the essences he thinks that are talked about in the Aristotelian tradition are

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,200
actually just nominal essences. They do correspond to something like the

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,000
definition. But the definition, you might say, is something that depends on our

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,200
categories, our way of understanding the thing. So understand me as a human

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,600
being and certain things will look essential to me. But we could also ask,

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
well, am I essentially a human being? Maybe, maybe not. And if I'm not

64
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,160
essentially a human being, then those properties that are essential to me

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,000
qua human being might not be essential to me, qua soul, let's say, or qua

66
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,200
something else. And so it depends how a thing is described, what is essential to

67
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,400
me. From this perspective, you might say, essence depends on the description of

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,080
the thing. It's something that we use to understand the thing, but it's not in

69
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,400
the thing itself. And so one way of framing this issue is, if we grant that

70
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,520
some properties have this status of being essential, either to a thing or to a

71
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,480
kind of thing, then is that something that really is about that object? Is it

72
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,000
really about that kind? Or is it something that we are supplying as part of our

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,120
conceptual framework for understanding that thing, that kind? It's really a

74
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,360
question of realism versus a kind of anti-realism about those essences. So

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,200
almost nobody is going to say, oh, just nothing's essential to anything, in the

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,040
sense that we never can talk about something being necessarily this or

77
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,120
that, or we can't really talk about definitions. It's a question of whether

78
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,160
that distinction is something that we find in the world among the properties of

79
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,040
the thing or the kind, or whether it's something that really is just our

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,320
creation. Now suppose you're a logical empiricist and you think, well, first of

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,240
all, you're going to be uncomfortable with this talk of necessity in the first

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,600
place, right? And we'll get some more of that in a moment. But whether or not

83
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,360
you're willing to talk about necessity at all, you're going to think, well, what

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,280
is necessity from a logical empiricist point of view? It's basically analytic

85
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,840
truth. It is coming from our verbal conventions. And so you're going to

86
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,280
think that, of course, to the extent that we can talk about essences at all,

87
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,080
they're things that are coming from our conceptual capacities. They're coming

88
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,680
from our linguistic framework. And so sure, we can have definitions of

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,000
terms, but that's not expressing some fundamental distinction between

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,600
properties in the thing. It's simply a function of the definitions of the

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,200
terms we're using. So it's all coming from us. From a more traditional

92
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,920
perspective, though, you might think, no, there really are things that are

93
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,280
essential to me and I couldn't lose without ceasing to be me. There are other

94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,200
things that may be, well, certainly I can lose and still be me, like the color

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,640
of my hair or the color of my shirt or where I'm standing. Now, if we start

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,880
asking, well, what are the kinds of things that are essential to me? It's

97
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,440
much harder, right? Easy to list accidental properties. But if I say

98
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,920
suddenly, well, one is essential to me, then that's a really hard question to

99
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,280
answer. Yeah.

100
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,760
Do these essential properties actually need to you?

101
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,240
Well, not all of them certainly, right? There could be some things that are

102
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,920
essential to me. For example, you might say, I've got an idea. Self-identity is

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,280
essential. You are necessarily you. Okay? So Dan Bonovac is necessarily Dan

104
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,720
Bonovac. Now, that seems pretty safe. And also a good example of something that

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,480
seems analytic, right? It's not something that really expresses something you might

106
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,240
think about the nature of me, but about the way we use identity. And certainly,

107
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,480
it's not unique. Every object would have that property and have that property

108
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,440
essentially. So not all of these are going to really be unique to me. On the

109
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,880
other hand, you might have the idea that what makes me differ from anyone else is

110
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,840
that if you take the collection of these essential properties, there's something

111
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,080
that's unique to me about that collection. So individually, they might not be

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,040
unique, but that combination might be. On the other hand, maybe not. So have you

113
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,240
ever seen a movie multiplicity? The guy gets cloned and then the clones start

114
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,440
cloning themselves and it all gets sort of outrageously outhand. But anyway,

115
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,360
suppose we did have a cloning mechanism so that there were just a bunch of

116
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
duplicates of me. Would those be me? Would we not say, oh, Dan Bonovac used to be a

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,720
particular, but now he's a general kind and there are a bunch of them. He's

118
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,320
multiply instantiated. Or would there be something that distinguishes me from them?

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,400
Something about my origin, maybe, the way in which I came to be. They came to be

120
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,240
in a very different way by means of the cloning machine. Or maybe it's a

121
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,120
transporter malfunction in Star Trek. You know, you get in the transporter and

122
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,560
actually we don't send your particles down. We just rebuild you on the other

123
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,640
side and kill you here. It's a really disturbing view of the transporter system,

124
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,880
but suppose you have that view. And then suppose it malfunctions so that we don't

125
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,920
kill you here. So you're still on the ship. But also now there's a clone of you

126
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,640
running around on the planet. And then the clone comes back and what that means is

127
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,600
now there's a second one of you on the ship and that guy's still stuck down

128
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,840
there and they all claim to be you. Well, I don't know what to say about such cases.

129
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,920
So it's not clear to me now whether we have three of you or whether, no, you're

130
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
still you. There's something essential to you about the way in which you were

131
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,600
created. These are copies of you, but they're not you. Just as if you produce a

132
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,320
copy of a file on a computer. You've got a copy of the file. You don't have that

133
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:26,040
same file. In any event, however that may be, does this whole idea of an essence of

134
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,240
the thing make any sense? Well, I've already mentioned one reason why is a

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,960
logical empiricist. You might think it doesn't. But there are other reasons you

136
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,640
might think it doesn't. And they are more general. After all, Klein is not a logical

137
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,320
empiricist. He's attacked the analytic synthetic distinction. He's attacked the

138
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,640
identity of truth by convention. So you might think he's the kind of guy that's

139
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,200
actually going to be very friendly toward this idea of essential problems,

140
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,440
really beating the world. But not true. And why not? Well, really, let's go back and

141
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:12,280
think about the essential major of empiricism. What is an empiricist? An

142
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:20,240
empiricist thinks that, oh, knowledge comes from what? Well, well, analytic

143
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,800
and synthetic truth, but fundamentally experience, right? And then, yeah, there

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,800
are these things that are really, well, knowledge of a sort, but really, in the

145
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,840
end, knowledge of linguistic conventions or something like that, you might

146
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,000
think. But all of our knowledge of the world comes from experience. Now, if

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
you're quite, you're not actually going to single out some of these analytic

148
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
judgments or conventional judgments or something like that as an exception. In

149
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,200
the end, it's all really about the world. And so it's all coming from

150
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,520
experience. It's all judged by the tribunal of experience. So in the end, it

151
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,640
all comes down to experience. But now, there are going to be things that are

152
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,000
hard to explain in connection with experience. So think about the kinds of

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,200
things that you as trouble accounting for, for example. Okay, we can talk about

154
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,760
the color of my shirt. But now, there are going to be other properties of me,

155
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,800
dispositional properties of me that you might think are not so evident. What do

156
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:26,000
we say about dispositional properties? What are some examples of dispositional

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,880
properties? You can't directly observe them. They have to do with the way I

158
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,040
would behave in certain circumstances. But those circumstances might actually

159
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,000
never come about. Like the match, let's say. We say it's not soluble, even though

160
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,280
it's never placed in water. It's a we never really have the experience of

161
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,080
finding out. Similarly, the salt in my salt shake. I say it is soluble, but

162
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,320
actually, it might never encounter water. And so we might never find out.

163
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,120
Look at your temper. Sorry. Would your temper be one?

164
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,200
Okay, good. My temper. Am I somebody who is a rassable, easy to anger? Or am I

165
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,400
somebody who's gentle, mellow, difficult to anger? Well, I think I don't know. Not

166
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,440
much happens in the average analytic tradition course to really upset me. And

167
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
so you might think this is like the match that's never been placed in water,

168
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,440
right? I mean, nothing's ever happened in your in your experience to really test

169
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,080
whether I'm easy to anger or not. And the same thing is true with respect to you

170
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,000
given my experience, right? Are you easy to anger or not? I don't have any

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,640
experience that's relevant to that. I mean, you might be the sort of person who

172
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,240
flies off the handle. What, analytic judgments? No. And you know, analytic

173
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,760
philosophy does that to some people. There's the famous story about

174
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,040
Wittgenstein threatening copper with the poker. But wordarily, you might think,

175
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,440
yeah, it doesn't really come up in the context of this sort of course. So we

176
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,160
don't find out. And maybe I never find out that about them. Yeah.

177
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,640
We're saying that these dispositional probabilities are like essential things.

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything about them being essential. I'm just

179
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,240
thinking, yeah, well, I should make it clear what I'm saying here. What are

180
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,880
potential trouble for an empiricist? Things where we say, gosh, what

181
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,320
experience could that be based on? Right? Now, maybe I do have experience.

182
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,280
There might be some people who see you get angry and they have a sense you're

183
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,080
either easy to anger or hard to anger. But maybe we never encounter that,

184
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,680
right? You just go through life and it's all pretty good. Go through life. It's

185
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,880
like, you know, all right, there's this story about a kid who, you know, never

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,320
spoke. Parents took him to all sorts of specialists, had him examined. He seemed

187
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,440
normal in all other ways, but just never said a word. Well, finally they gave up,

188
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,120
right? They take him to this specialist, that specialist, do all sorts of brain

189
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
scans and so on. He seems absolutely normal, seems to be intelligent. Nobody

190
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,280
can figure out why this child does not speak. So eventually they just kind of

191
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,200
give up. And then one morning, the kid's sitting down before going to school for

192
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,760
breakfast. Mom gives him this piece of toast. Kid suddenly looks at it and says,

193
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,720
this toast is burnt. Well, suddenly she and her husband, they're all like, you

194
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,960
spoke, you spoke, they're so happy, right? And the kid said, well, of course I

195
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,480
can speak. Why haven't you said anything up to now? It's been 12 years. Kid said,

196
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,320
well, it's all been okay up to now. Okay, so it might be that the kid goes through

197
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
life the whole way, right? I mean, we never find out whether this person is

198
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,760
easy to anger because just nothing ever happens to upset them. Yeah, why would

199
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,680
that really be a problem? Because we don't have the knowledge then. So, I mean, you

200
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,000
don't have to justify it with empiricism if you don't know it. Okay, good. You might just say,

201
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,720
well, then we don't know, right? Whether this person is erasable or gentle or what

202
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,520
have you. And so that's fine. It's fine to have things we do not know. But now you

203
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,600
might think, well, here's the problem. Remember, we were talking about this in

204
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,640
Karnap, where Karnap was trying to define terms like soluble in terms that were

205
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,400
strictly observational. And he probably couldn't do it with a regular conditional.

206
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,280
He needed something like a counterfactual conditional. So it had to be something like

207
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:28,000
if blah, blah, blah were to happen, right? Then blah, blah, blah would happen.

208
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,440
And now the problem is that were to and that would. It seems to refer to things that

209
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,240
actually, well, aren't part of this world. The way philosophers now, following Leibniz,

210
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,360
said to think about this, it's talking about other possible worlds. If you were to be placed

211
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,080
in this kind of situation, right, but maybe you never are, then this would happen. And so it's

212
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,560
not just that we don't happen to know. It feels like the kind of thing that actually

213
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,360
it would be hard to explain our possession of such a property. What could it even mean

214
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,520
to attribute such a property on empiricist grounds? Because you might think, gosh, it's not

215
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,920
just that to notice I'd have to somehow have contact with these other possible worlds. The

216
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,240
very definition of what it is that such a property seems to refer to these other worlds.

217
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:27,840
And so there's something strange about that. Yeah. I mean, you could just arrive at that knowledge

218
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:36,000
inductively and say salt dissolves when placed in water, right? I don't really, I remember

219
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,520
talking about this before, but not that we'll be visiting it like this. I don't really see why

220
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,320
you need counterfactuals. Good, good. Well, you might think, look, I don't really need

221
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,200
any mysterious knowledge here. Here's how I do it. I have inductive evidence about this rule,

222
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,560
right? And on the basis of that inductive evidence, I conclude certain generalizations.

223
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,400
And some of those I actually consider laws. Now, some of these generalizations I consider

224
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,880
accidental. It just so happens that this takes place. I can't infer it to have any really

225
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,680
lawline character. It's just been a matter of chance that it's worked out that way. However,

226
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,520
some of these other things might seem to me to reflect some deeper pattern.

227
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,440
And so I think that's a law. Now, what's involved in my going from the generalization

228
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,480
that G puts salt in water and it dissolves to the law, put it in water, it must dissolve?

229
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,680
Where does the must come from? Where does the necessity come from? And you might say,

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,080
look, it's just if we have enough inductive evidence, right? We do this in the United States.

231
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,480
We do it in Europe. We do it in Africa. We do it in India. We do it in China. We do it in Russia.

232
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
And gee, no matter where we go, no matter when it is, it seems to all be the same.

233
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,640
And we start thinking, this isn't just an accident. This is really lawlike.

234
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,000
And so one way of looking at this is to say, we start attributing something like necessity,

235
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,760
like the must, like calling that a law, when the inductive evidence is just very broad,

236
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,120
very powerful, seems very, what, have a huge scope in space and time and so on.

237
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
Which is, by the way, why it would be so hard to come up with equivalent laws in the social sciences,

238
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,760
because you might think it's very hard to have that kind of fraud, inductive evidence.

239
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,840
Maybe in psychology, you can do it because you can observe lots of people in lots of cultures

240
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,000
and so forth. But if you're thinking about political science, you might think, gosh,

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,120
where's the science? Because here we call that a department of government, right?

242
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,560
We don't claim it to be a science. But you might think, the problem is really,

243
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,440
we can't get enough inductive evidence. I mean, how many countries are there in the world now?

244
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,760
That's quite few, but not in comparison to grains of salt, for example. And what kinds of experience

245
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,720
have we had, let's say, with revolutions? Well, some, but not equivalent to putting salt in water

246
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,960
and finding out what happens. And so, you might think there, the inductive evidence is just

247
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
sparse enough, very hard to make that move. Anyway, I don't have any real objection to that.

248
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,920
In fact, I think that's the way Locke thinks all of this goes. It's Hume, who after all says,

249
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,080
wait a minute, look at what's happening in these cases. We observe this happening,

250
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,120
we observe that happening, we never see the causal connection. We never actually observe the link.

251
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,280
Yeah. I don't really see how this inductive evidence would work. Like, if someone were to

252
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,760
tell me that salt doesn't dissolve in oil, I wouldn't necessarily have to do the experiment over and

253
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,440
over again to understand that for certain, but I could still believe it conceptually. So, I feel

254
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
like inductive evidence isn't necessarily the only way to get some kind of dispositional property or

255
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:08,240
something. Right. Well, here's the problem. Sometimes you're right. We do take one counter

256
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,120
instances enough to establish either a connection or the lack of a connection. But I'm thinking of

257
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,880
cases like the cold fusion experiments. People claim to have discovered cold fusion. And then,

258
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,880
for at least a decade, there was a huge attempt to try to replicate those experiments to figure

259
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,320
out whether there really was a principle underlying this and there was really a technology that would

260
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,920
enable cold fusion or whether this was due to some, the results they got were due to some kind of weird

261
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,400
phenomenon in their lab. And for a long time, it was unsettled what it was. I think now most

262
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,120
people dismiss the possibility, though I think there are still some authors who think that

263
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:59,280
there may still be something there that one could do. But many of them, from one experiment,

264
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,360
people thought, oh, that's intriguing. It made them want to do more experiments. But people

265
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,000
didn't immediately say, we've got the technology in the future. Let's start building cold fusion,

266
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,320
power plants, and so forth. They felt the need to do more experimentation. So, I think in some

267
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,760
contexts, especially when something refutes along, then it's very powerful. We say, wait a minute,

268
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,480
this is going to happen. We put the salt in the oil and then what happens when we put the salt in

269
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,680
the oil? We've never done it before. We're doing it for the first time. And we might say, aha,

270
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,120
this is what happened. It did dissolve, so salt does dissolve oil or it didn't dissolve. But

271
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,600
the evidence for that is rather thin until we repeat it. And if it's the kind of thing that we

272
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,960
can't repeat, then it's hard to know what to do, which is, again, part of the reason why it's a

273
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,200
political science. It would be so difficult to come up with something law-like. You can't start

274
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,800
saying, whoa, what if that would happen again? Let's hold the last presidential race over again

275
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,360
and see if Trump still wins under these conditions or something. Yeah, can't do that.

276
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:18,400
And so, in short, it's the kind of thing that, well, yeah, it's going to depend a lot on how

277
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,880
this fits in with the rest of our knowledge. And so, quiet at least will say, yeah, you're right,

278
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,800
this is how it goes. But a lot of that is driven by where this is in the web, how close we are to

279
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,680
experience, how much other theoretical support there is and so forth. Anyway, we're getting sort

280
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
of off track because I don't want to spend a huge amount of time thinking about how we can

281
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,920
account for dispositional properties, except to say that there's a sense in which essential

282
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:52,000
properties raise the same kinds of questions. I was hoping here to be referring to something we all

283
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,200
agree about, but oh well. Anyway, essential properties are kind of the same. Why? Because we

284
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:12,480
think, well, yeah, I'm saying here, gosh, if the object were right to lack the property,

285
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:28,400
it wouldn't be what it is. And that's similarly modal, right? It's similarly talking about what

286
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,680
would be the case. And maybe I never, in fact, lack the property. And so, you know, for example,

287
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,760
would I still be me if I were bald? Well, let's suppose I just never go bald. And then you might

288
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,600
say, well, gosh, we never find out. Now, in fact, we think, oh, come on, it's still me himself

289
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,240
to be bald. And so, we think we know something about that. And yet, it looks like, in a sense,

290
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,880
what we're knowing here goes similarly beyond experience directly. So, if you're in the school

291
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,360
of lock as an empiricist, you're going to say, well, we reach inductive conclusions about this,

292
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,040
just as we do about these scientific laws, just as we do dispositional properties. If you're more

293
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,760
humian, you're going to see a deeper problem here. And think that the very idea takes you

294
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:24,640
beyond the bounds of experience in a way that makes you uncomfortable. So, why did I stand on that?

295
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know. It was really just to make the point that there is kind of this distinction

296
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,560
between the lockians and the humians here, and that there's a sort of parallel problem here.

297
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,960
So, just as Karnab worried a lot about this, and a lot of people start writing about

298
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,720
counterfactual conditionals, and how to understand them, and what the nature of laws is, and so

299
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,160
forth. So, similarly, we have an analogous problem with essential properties. Now, we can characterize

300
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,640
certain contexts in language and in thought as referentially transparent, and others as

301
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,840
referentially opaque. And that's an important distinction for Karnab. So, here's the general

302
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:11,200
idea. We've got this notion of identity. Okay? And there, or just expressed by is in English.

303
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,280
And ordinarily, it allows us to substitute. So, typically, we can substitute identicals

304
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:37,280
for identities. So, here's an example. Two plus two is four. Four plus four is eight.

305
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,880
Well, I should be able to substitute two plus two for four in that equation to get two plus two

306
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:52,640
plus two plus two is eight. And that, that seems right, right? That works out just fine.

307
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,280
And so ordinarily, this is a legitimate rule. Leibniz's law in general says that things are

308
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,440
identical. If they have exactly the same properties, and if they have exactly the same properties,

309
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,080
you should be able to substitute one for the other. And typically, we can do that. If Dan

310
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,400
Bonobak is talking, and Dan Bonobak is the professor, then the professor is talking, etc.

311
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,960
But now, there are some contexts where that prevails. So, we'll say that a context is transparent.

312
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,040
If that works, that is to say, if substituting identicals for identicals always preserves

313
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:41,360
truth value. So, it turns true sentences into true sentences, and false sentences and false

314
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:55,440
sentences. And opaque, if it sometimes fails, which means it doesn't always preserve truth value.

315
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,920
So, Quine is worried about these opaque contexts, where we've got some situations where substitution

316
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,400
doesn't always work. Here's one of his examples. Basically, well, yeah, we can say things that

317
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:23,600
involve quotation, either directly or indirectly. So, yeah, here's one of these examples. Cicero,

318
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:35,920
a name, right, contains six letters. This fall, by the way, there's going to be a

319
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,840
course on Cicero and Catullus in the classics. So, you should all take it. It would help with your new lab.

320
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,920
Yeah, well, I'm very fond of both of them. So, now, Cicero, what is his actual name?

321
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Well, it's Marcus Tullius Cicero. And so, he's sometimes called Tully as a nickname. So, Cicero

322
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:08,240
is Tully. But then we might think, ah, so we can substitute. Tully contains six letters.

323
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,840
Well, that obviously fails, right? We don't preserve truth by that kind of substitution. We

324
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,400
can substitute in direct notation. And that's sort of a surprise, really, because after all,

325
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,080
this is about the name, Cicero, and not about the person. And so, the identity of the person here

326
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,840
doesn't mean that the names are going to share the properties. So, it's easy to explain why that fails.

327
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,040
Now, this can also be indirect. So, for example, he gives us this case. Georgione is called Barbarelli.

328
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,800
Sorry, Georgione is Barbarelli. Georgione Barbarelli was the first of the great painters of the

329
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,360
Italian Renaissance. And in particular, he's thought to have painted a painting called The Three

330
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,680
Philosophers, which is perhaps why Klein knows about it. Sort of a mysterious character. He died

331
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,480
when he was around 30 of the play, and only painted a few paintings. So, little is known about him.

332
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,800
But anyway, here's a quite example. Georgione was so-called because of his size. Big guy.

333
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Okay? Barbarelli was so-called because of his size. Well, that's not right.

334
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,840
Okay? So, so-called here is something that sort of sneaks in a reference to the name. And so,

335
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,000
it's kind of an indirect, well, not literally, an indirect quotation. But nevertheless,

336
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,840
it's something like a quotation context. It sneaks it in. So, there are those kinds of cases.

337
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:40,080
But there are much more interesting kinds of cases. So, in particular, necessity

338
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,560
is one of these. One way of thinking about an essential property is that it's necessary to the

339
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,520
thing, or to the kind of thing. But now we can think, well, wait a minute, necessity is weird

340
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,240
because it's opaque in this way. So, here's an example that might show that.

341
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,720
The number of planets

342
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,000
is 9.

343
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,160
Necessarily,

344
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,520
9 is greater than 7. Therefore, necessarily, the number of planets

345
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,360
is greater than 7. Now, does that work?

346
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
No. What's gone wrong?

347
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,880
There's no necessity that there'd be more than 7 planets.

348
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,920
Exactly. There's no necessity that there'd be more than 7 planets.

349
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,880
I think there could have been 6 planets. I mean, a little while ago,

350
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,800
they demoted Pluto for being a planet. Now, again, they promoted Pluto back up again.

351
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,280
So, there are 9 planets again. Yay! Go ahead, because it makes it easier to teach quine here.

352
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,600
But, actually, somebody said, well, wait a minute, I'm not sure. The Earth is a planet.

353
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,200
And you might think, oh, wait, we're going to change the definition of planets. So,

354
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,720
even the Earth isn't a planet. Maybe it will turn out that only, I don't know,

355
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,720
would satisfy their new definition of planets. Those people got their way.

356
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,520
But there might be way fewer than 7 planets by that criterion. In any case, you might think,

357
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,400
yeah, look, it's highly contingent whether or not there are more than 7 planets. That's not a

358
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,720
necessary truth. But this surely is a necessary truth. 9 is greater than 7. That seems necessary.

359
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,760
Something that follows from the laws of arithmetic. And the number of planets is 9.

360
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,560
So, why can't we do this substitution? Well, here's what quine ends up concluding.

361
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,920
Is this property, so you can frame it this way, is the property of being

362
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:13,440
necessarily greater than 7? Well, maybe I don't want to. We could just say, is that true?

363
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Let's say, is the property of being greater than 7 necessary to 9, the object 9?

364
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Now, one way of looking at it, if you're a realist, you think you can answer the question. If you're

365
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,200
a realist, the amount is essences, right? Because then you think, yes, the essence is in the object.

366
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,960
And so, what is the realist going to say about this question?

367
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,200
Is the property of being greater than 7 necessary to 9?

368
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:54,480
Yeah, sure it is. Because 9 is necessarily greater than 7. You couldn't make it less than 7,

369
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,240
for example, or equal to 7 without changing what 9 is. But suppose we're one of these anti-realists.

370
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,480
Then how are you going to answer that question?

371
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:18,960
It depends how you designate it, right? If you call it, if you're thinking of 9 as 9,

372
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,800
then yes, it's necessarily greater than 7. It has that property unnecessarily.

373
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,960
But suppose you're thinking of it as the number of planets, then it doesn't.

374
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:36,480
9 quad, 9, you might think, necessarily has that property. But the number of planets,

375
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:44,720
9 quad, the number of planets does not. And so, it sort of depends on how it's described.

376
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,200
And that's in the end client's position. It depends how it's described. So we can talk

377
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:05,360
about things having essences, but only as, when described as such and such. 9 described as that

378
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,080
number. We're already sort of describing it in terms of its position in the number sequence.

379
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,040
And so, yes, it's necessarily greater than 7, but 9 described as the number of planets. No,

380
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,240
that's not necessarily greater than 7. 9, just without any description, he says,

381
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,480
I don't think I could make any sense of the idea. Yeah.

382
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,640
Well, why is 9 described as the number of planets not necessarily greater than 7?

383
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,360
Because there could have been fewer than 7 planets.

384
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,920
But there aren't.

385
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,520
There aren't. Yeah, there aren't.

386
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,880
That's why I'm confused. Like, there could have been, but if there would have been,

387
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,960
then it just wouldn't have been 9 in the first place. It would be different. So it wouldn't

388
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,760
necessarily, you know.

389
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. You might think the number of planets, wait a minute,

390
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,680
I'm not sure what to do with that when I start thinking about other possible circumstances.

391
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,400
After all, you say that could have been fewer than 9 planets. Well, we're now talking about some

392
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:08,000
other possible world, right? And so, what about one of these worlds where there are now fewer

393
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:18,080
than, here's the sun, and here's Mercury, let's say, and here's Venus, and the big bang worked

394
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,240
out a little differently in this world. So all the other planets flew off in this space,

395
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,560
and there are only those two remaining. Okay. So in this world, there are two planets.

396
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,040
Now, what does the number of planets refer to in that world?

397
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,040
Two. Okay. One wavelength. Yeah, look, the number of planets here is just two.

398
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,320
But then it looks like the number of planets is 9 in this world, 2 in that world, so it's not

399
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,120
necessarily greater than 7. On the other hand, you might think, wait a minute, no, when I said the

400
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,520
number of planets is 9, I mean the number of planets in this world. And so I don't mean the

401
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,960
number of planets, let's call the actual world here w, in this world, w prime, let's say, then

402
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:10,000
really I have to distinguish the number of planets in w prime from the number of planets

403
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,560
in w. And the number of planets in w is still 9, right? Because it is what it is. It doesn't

404
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,880
matter what world you're viewing it from, in that world, in our world, the number of planets is

405
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,080
9. And so you might think, wait a minute, when I say the number of planets, do I mean that to

406
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,000
vary with world? So, ooh, now the number of planets is this. Or do I mean the number of

407
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,080
planets there actually are? And that actually would be something that ties this to this world.

408
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:44,080
The actual number of planets? That sort of means that's not going to vary from world to world.

409
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,760
But if I don't sort of pin it down with actually, then it looks like it could vary.

410
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,200
On the other hand, people don't ordinarily go around, unless they're teaching seminars on

411
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,600
motor logic, they don't go around using the term actually much in that way. And so often,

412
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,880
if we just say the number of planets, the number of students in the class, etc., etc., we mean the

413
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,520
actual number. We're not talking about something that might vary. You know, I say the number of

414
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,560
students in the class is, what is it in this class? Like 25. And somebody says, well, what if a

415
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:28,400
bunch of people dropped? Well, yeah, then the number of planets would change. The number of

416
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,440
students that are in the class then would be different. On the other hand, the number of

417
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,920
students who were in the class now would remain the same. And so you might think that actually

418
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,920
there's a sort of hidden ambiguity here, which I think is part of this. You might think, look,

419
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,160
it depends on how it's described. And here's an additional way in which it depends.

420
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,480
Do I mean the number of planets that happen to be in a given world? Or do I mean the number

421
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,560
of planets that actually are in this world? And those would be, as it were, two different

422
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,520
descriptions. And that too would affect what we end up saying about this question.

423
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,560
Okay, well, that's one sort of problem. It's connected to a problem about quantification.

424
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,960
Because now if I say, so there is something

425
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
that is necessarily

426
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,160
greater than seven. How do I evaluate that?

427
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Now, Quine doesn't have any problem with necessity applied to a sentence.

428
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,240
He doesn't have any problem with necessity on the outside of this, you might say. It's a necessary

429
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,680
truth that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He worries about the necessity being inside.

430
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,040
Okay, there is something that is necessarily greater than seven, that has been greater than seven

431
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,440
as an essential property of it. And why does he worry about that? Because this something

432
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,800
isn't described as being of any particular kind. And if it really does depend on how it's described,

433
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,760
then it doesn't make any sense to talk about whether the object itself is necessarily greater

434
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,400
than seven or not. What makes sense is to say the number of planets is not necessarily greater

435
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,520
than seven, but nine is necessarily greater than seven. And yet we're talking about the same object,

436
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,760
so it depends on the description. And so he's worried that things like this don't fully make sense.

437
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,040
Now, the same sort of thing can happen with respect to attitudes. And that's what the paper

438
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,600
quantifiers in propositional attitudes is about. This begins, by the way, with one of my favorite

439
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:58,960
passages of analytic philosophy. The incorrectness of rendering Tessius is hunting unicorns. In the

440
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,960
fashion that there is an X, such that X is a unicorn and Tessius is hunting X, is conveniently

441
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,080
attested by the non-existence of unicorns. But it's not due simply to that zoological Kunah.

442
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,880
It would be equally incorrect to render Ernest's hunting lions as there is an X such that X is

443
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,720
a lion. And Ernest is hunting X, where Ernest is a sportsman in Africa. The force of one is

444
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,640
rather that there is some individual lion or several, which Ernest is hunting, stray circus

445
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,680
property, for example. The contrast recurs in I want a sloop. The version, there is an X such

446
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,120
that X is a sloop, and I want X. It's suitable insofar only as there may be said to be a certain

447
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,600
sloop that I want. If what I seek is mere relief from slooplessness, then do guess the wrong idea.

448
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,560
Okay, now this is something that actually linguists have worried a lot about. What do you do about

449
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,040
cases like hunting a unicorn or hunting a lion or wanting a sloop and so forth?

450
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,480
And then he kind of leaves that problem behind, but it's an interesting problem.

451
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,920
Anyway, that's one difficulty where we want to say, wait, hunting, actually, yeah, I should

452
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,040
sort of put in here. We've got this additional thing now of attitudes. Hunting is something

453
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:24,240
that does involve some kind of attitude. Hunting, searching for wanting.

454
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:35,520
But there are others. So here is a wonderful story. Consider the difference between there is an X

455
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,200
such that Ralph believes that X is a spy and Ralph believes that there is an X such that X is a spy.

456
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,800
They're two very different states, right? They may be ambiguously phrased as Ralph believes that

457
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,760
someone's a spy, but they may be unambiguously phrased respectively as there's someone who Ralph

458
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,040
believes to be a spy, and Ralph believes there are spies. The difference is vast. If Ralph is like

459
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,840
most of us, aid is true, that is to say, he does believe there are spies, but there's no particular

460
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:10,160
person of whom he believes that that person is a spy. Well, here is the marvelous story.

461
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,280
There's a certain man in a brown hat whom Ralph has glimpsed several times under questionable

462
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,560
circumstances on which we need not enter here. Suffice it to say that Ralph suspects he's a spy.

463
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,360
Also, there's a gray-haired man vaguely known as Ralph as rather a pillar of the community whom

464
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,000
Ralph is not aware of having seen except once at the beach. Now, Ralph does not know it, but the

465
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,440
men are one and the same. Can we say of this man, Bernard J. Orcutt, to give him a name,

466
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,880
that Ralph believes him to be a spy? If so, we find ourselves accepting a conjunction of this type.

467
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,120
W sincerely denies blah-blah-blah and yet believes that blah-blah-blah. With one and the same sentence

468
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,920
in both of these planks, for Ralph is ready enough to say in all sincerity Bernard J. Orcutt

469
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,160
is no spy. He's that upstanding member of the community, right? If on the other hand, with a

470
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,840
view to disallowing these situations, we say Ralph believes the man in the brown hat is a spy,

471
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,320
Ralph doesn't believe the man seen at the beach is a spy. But wait a minute, the man in the brown

472
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,400
hat is the man at the beach. Now, what do we say about Ralph's beliefs? So here the problem is,

473
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:22,080
well, in general about belief, but also specifically about this. Does Ralph have a belief for Ralph

474
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:44,480
Bernard J? Well, here's Ralph. He believes the man in the brown hat is a spy, but Ralph doesn't believe

475
00:44:45,280 --> 00:45:02,880
that the man at the beach is a spy. In fact, he would outright deny it, but those two are identical,

476
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,680
right? They're both Bernard J. Orcutt. So does Ralph believe that Orcutt is a spy or not?

477
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,360
Well, under one description, the man in the brown hat, yes. Under the other description,

478
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,680
the man at the beach, no. And so it's very tempting here to say that actually belief

479
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,560
is not something you have about an object, it's something you have about an object under a certain

480
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:36,560
description.
