0	6800	Well, now let's start talking about Klein and his analysis of ontology.
6800	13520	Klein's way of thinking about Oziloffical Matters has been hugely significant.
13520	17360	The thing starts, you might say, his project starts in the 1930s.
17360	23240	He goes to Vienna, he's working with Karnapp, takes a position at Harvard and stays at Harvard
23240	28440	his entire career, ends up shaping the Harvard Department in crucial ways and turning it
28440	33280	into one of the, well, for the entire time he was there, really, one of the top two or three
33280	36240	departments of philosophy in the United States.
36240	40600	Klein's influence was felt partly through the power of his work.
40600	46400	He's a great writer and so has a lot of influence, partly because it is important
46400	51960	philosophically, partly because the stylistic excellence of this makes him fun to read.
51960	55360	And it's not often you encounter philosophy that's fun to read.
55360	62360	So I think a lot of people read Klein when they might have been tempted not to read a similar set of ideas
62360	66960	from another writer just because he's such a great writer.
66960	74480	But also because Klein's students end up having a huge amount of power in the profession and well-deserved power.
74480	79360	He has many of the greatest philosophers of the next generation studying with him.
79360	83560	And so there are lots of people whose views he shapes.
83560	92880	Saul Kripke, David Lewis, a variety of other people are Klein students and end up shaping the world of philosophy in the realm.
92880	96640	So Klein's influence is both direct and indirect.
96640	106520	Now last time we were examining Klein on autology and we saw there was something key that he develops.
106520	113600	It becomes known as Klein's criteria of logical commitment.
113600	122400	There are different ways of putting this, but the most famous formulation, as we saw, was just this.
122400	135280	To be is to be a value of a variable.
135280	137640	And last time we talked about what that meant.
137640	146320	The idea was really that we have some statement like this.
146320	150520	And what does that say? There is an x such that a holds true of x.
150520	158560	Or in other words in English that says there are a's.
158560	165240	Now understood in terms of its meaning, what this really means is that there is some domain of objects.
166200	170800	And then we identify some of those as a's.
170800	174800	So there are some objects x in here such that a is true of x.
174800	183800	And we might think, okay, so one way of looking at this is that there is some non-empty subset of that domain consisting of a's.
183800	187800	And so you might think, yeah, that's the a's in our domain.
187800	189320	And that's what this means.
189520	197960	So we could even think about the English but what, when we con Knight ourselves ontologically to something when they say there are such things.
197960	206280	To ontologically commit yourself to people is to say there are people, to ontologically commit yourself to red things is to say there are red things.
206280	214380	Does ontologically commit yourself to numbers is to say there are numbers, to ontologically commit yourself to attributes is to say there are attributes.
214380	217300	And all of those could be put in logical terms
217300	218580	in this sort of way.
218580	219940	They could be put in English terms
219940	222460	by just saying there are these things.
222460	225340	We can think of it in terms of model theory, which
225340	228780	is what this way of interpreting the logic comes to.
228780	230500	These things are understood as models.
230500	233460	There's a domain of objects and then properties and relations
233460	235780	that can be defined on that set of objects.
235780	238420	And to say there are attributes is just
238420	241020	to say some of the things in our domain are attributes.
241020	242740	To say there are red things, some of the things
242740	243620	that are domain are red.
243620	247060	There are people, some of the things in the domain are people.
247060	250820	So we can think of this in sort of syntactic terms,
250820	252740	either formally or informally.
252740	254660	We can think of it in semantic terms,
254660	257140	as saying there are certain kinds of things in our domain.
257140	261380	And ultimately, the domain is the domain of all things.
261380	262220	That's right.
262220	264220	Well, yes.
264220	267540	This can be understood as the domain of just everything,
267540	268820	all things.
268820	271340	On the other hand, in a lot of contexts,
271340	273180	we don't have in mind everything.
273220	277420	So for example, suppose I am thinking
277420	279380	about the various people in this class
279380	281380	and how you're doing on your papers,
281380	283580	then actually the domain that's relevant to that
283580	286420	are the people in the class and the papers.
286420	288340	And I'm not worried about the rest of the word.
288340	290820	If somebody says, but what about Vladimir Putin?
290820	291540	I don't think.
291540	293300	Oh, yeah, Vladimir Putin's an art domain.
293300	295100	I better think about him, too.
295100	296180	No.
296180	298980	I'm just going to say, yeah, the domain of objects
298980	300980	that's relevant to this particular context
300980	302620	is one involving students and papers.
302620	303580	And that's it.
303580	306660	So frequently in language, what happens
306660	310020	is we don't focus on this entire domain of everything.
310020	312260	If I say, everyone's here.
312260	314300	I don't mean everyone in the universe here.
314300	317580	I mean, everyone in the class, for example, is here.
317580	320220	So often in language, we really are talking about a much
320220	321980	more restricted domain.
321980	324500	But yes, in the abstract, we could
324500	326260	be talking about everything.
326260	328500	And indeed, when we're thinking about ontology
328500	330860	in the broadest sense, that's what we want to do.
330900	333260	Think about the way Klein opens his famous essay
333260	335460	on what there is.
335460	337340	A curious thing about the ontological problem
337340	338740	is its simplicity.
338740	342060	It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.
342060	343020	What is there?
343020	346180	It can be answered, moreover, in a word, everything.
346180	348620	And everyone will accept this answer is true.
348620	351540	So in a sense, if we're asking that basic ontological
351540	354780	question, what is there, then the answer is everything.
354780	357060	And so we do want this domain to include everything
357060	359580	for those purposes.
360020	362460	However, this is merely a saying that there is what there is.
362460	364580	There remains room for disagreement over cases.
364580	367500	And so the issue is stabilized after centuries.
367500	370420	And so that tells us when we're doing metaphysics,
370420	372900	we typically have in mind a domain that just consists
372900	375020	of everything.
375020	377900	Well, OK, so this looks like a very simple picture.
377900	379980	But it's actually not quite so simple.
379980	382940	Because even in his essay from 1939,
382940	386220	a logistical approach to the ontological problem,
386220	389300	after saying that to be is to be a value of a variable,
389340	392500	he says, well, of course, sometimes we
392500	395420	speak as if certain sync-categorical expressions
395420	398060	were names of entities.
398060	400540	We talked last time about the roundness of pebbles,
400540	402500	or the roundness of the clock.
402500	404660	And you might think, actually, roundness
404660	406860	is something I don't want to recognize.
406860	409460	Admittedly, it looks like I'm quantifying over that.
409460	414060	If I say pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.
414060	416020	But I might want to think, no, that's
416020	417900	an avoidable way of speaking.
417900	419380	And there might be other things that it
419380	422460	looks like I'm committed to by my use of a noun
422460	424500	that I want to retreat and say there's no such thing.
424500	426300	Actually, one of Quine's favorite examples
426300	428700	is to say for the sake of something.
428700	432180	I did it for her sake.
432180	435740	Does that mean there is an x such that I did it for her x?
435740	438500	No, I mean, sakes aren't things, right?
438500	441340	That's something we'd want to paraphrase in some other way.
441340	443340	If I did that for my wife's sake,
443340	445820	then I want to be ontologically committed to my wife.
445820	447340	But I don't want to be ontologically committed
447340	448340	to her sake.
448340	450700	I don't know what that would even be, right?
450700	455180	So sometimes he says, we speak as if these things are actually
455180	458460	names of entities, but we hold that these are merely
458460	460740	manners of speaking, that the expressions are not actually
460740	464180	names, that the alleged entities are convenient fictions.
464180	466300	This notion of fiction can be given a clear meaning
466300	468260	from the point of view of the present developments
468260	470980	to speak as if certain expressions were names
470980	473540	is to allow those expressions to replace and be replaced
473540	476180	by variables according to the laws of quantification.
476180	479580	But if this is to be merely a convenient and theoretically
479580	481340	avoidable manner of speaking, we must
481340	485460	be able to translate such usage into another idiom, which
485460	487420	does not require the expressions in question
487420	490540	to replace and be replaced by variables.
490540	494980	So there is another possibility that emerges here.
494980	497900	This is, you might say, the basic way to be committed.
497900	501780	But now we can also say sometimes these things
501900	502980	are avoidable.
502980	505020	So we can say, here's a criterion
505020	506180	of being committed to something.
506180	508420	To be is to be a value of a variable.
508420	510940	It's for us to include it in the domain.
510940	513060	But then we can say, well, all right,
513060	514700	there's another way of looking at this.
514700	518860	Sometimes we do that, and yet we think, nevertheless,
518860	520900	the term is really synchro-grammatic.
520900	523580	We're not really committed, OK?
523580	527140	And so when we really have commitment,
527140	528980	when we can't avoid this.
528980	531660	So sometimes, Quine just puts it this way.
531700	534100	But sometimes he puts it in a different way.
534100	535660	And we'll see an exact formulation
535660	538380	of that in his essay on what there is.
538380	540660	It's really, to be is to be something
540660	542860	that has to be in the domain for what
542860	544140	we're saying to be true.
544140	547780	And it might be that it has to be in the domain directly
547780	550860	because we're saying there are a's and there are a's in the domain.
550860	556340	But sometimes it's the case in this very indirect fashion.
556340	558860	We say there are a's, but really that's
558860	560620	an avoidable way of speaking.
560620	564860	And in the end, what we are quantifying over in our final
564860	567220	domain is just the things we have to recognize,
567220	569100	some things we translate.
569100	571020	So in short, there's this possibility
571020	574340	of, well, reduction of translation,
574340	577100	of eliminating certain ways of speaking.
577100	580420	And before we formulate that in official terms,
580420	582180	I want to give us some examples and see
582180	584780	how he thinks about this.
584780	588060	So let's turn back to on what there is.
588060	591900	Because here he formulates a nice puzzle right at the outset.
591900	593460	Suppose there are two philosophers,
593460	596100	MacEx and I, differing over ontology.
596100	598940	Suppose MacEx maintains there is something which I maintain.
598940	600100	There is not.
600100	602540	MacEx can, quite consistently with his own point of view,
602540	603780	describe our difference of opinion
603780	606820	by saying I refuse to recognize certain entities.
606820	608340	I should protest, of course, that he's
608340	610060	wrong in his formulation of our disagreement,
610060	612180	for I maintain there are no entities in the kind which he
612180	613860	alleges for me to recognize.
613860	616420	But my finding him wrong in this formulation of our disagreement
616420	618700	is unimportant, for I'm committed to considering him wrong
618700	620380	in his ontology anyway.
620380	622460	When I try to formulate our difference of opinion,
622460	624780	on the other hand, I seem to be in a predicament.
624780	627100	I can't admit that there are some things which MacEx
627100	629940	countensess and I do not, for admitting that there are such
629940	632700	things I should be contradicting my own rejection of them.
632700	634380	Now notice what he can't say.
634380	638580	Yeah, there's some things that MacEx countensess that I don't.
638580	640580	Because if I am saying that, look what I'm saying.
640580	644140	There are things that he recognizes that I don't.
644260	646700	And it sounds like I'm saying there are things
646700	648580	that I don't believe in.
648580	650380	But wait a minute.
650380	654460	If I confess that there are things that I think there aren't,
654460	656900	it sounds like I'm contradicting myself, right?
656900	659620	Or at least I'm saying that my own beliefs are false.
659620	661540	I'm saying, yeah, you know, there are these things
661540	663820	that I don't think there are.
663820	666820	And so it looks like I'm in trouble.
666820	669060	Now, he says, it looks like this reason
669060	671940	can sound that anybody in the logical dispute who's
671940	676020	denying the existence of anything is a severe disadvantage.
676020	677860	Because the moment you try to say, yeah, there
677860	680060	are these things that I don't accept,
680060	681900	it looks like you're actually committing yourself
681900	684460	to the things and undermining your own position.
684460	687260	Well, this, he says, is the old platonic riddle of non-being.
687260	689140	Non-being must, in some sense, be.
689140	691580	Otherwise, what is it that there is not?
691580	694500	This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's beard.
694500	696940	Historically, it's proved tough, frequently dulling
696940	699100	the edge of Occam's reason.
699140	702500	That's some of that great writing that I was mentioning.
702500	704820	So he says, consider Pegasus.
704820	708060	We want to say something like this.
708060	711180	Does Pegasus exist?
711180	711680	No.
711680	712820	No, right?
712820	715100	Pegasus is supposedly a winged horse.
715100	717460	But there are no winged horses, so we might say yes.
717460	719380	Pegasus does not exist.
723500	726420	But now you might think, well, this is a problem.
726420	730020	What does our logic do with constants, with names?
730020	732420	Well, they have to stand for things in the domain.
732420	736100	So you might think, ah, OK, so I see what's happening here.
736100	740780	This is like saying, gosh, my shirt is not blue.
740780	742780	And what's going on there?
742780	745540	Well, I'm referring to the shirt.
745540	747260	And then I'm saying something about it, right?
747260	748620	That it is not blue.
748620	750580	So I may think, OK, so similarly here,
750580	752540	I'm saying something about Pegasus.
752540	755540	This winged horse.
758420	761780	Yeah, horses have manes, they have eyes.
761780	762860	So there we go.
762860	764180	Pegasus, OK?
764180	766260	And I'm saying it doesn't exist.
766260	769420	Like saying, my shirt is not blue, there's Pegasus.
769420	771300	And Pegasus doesn't exist.
771300	772900	But now, that's weird, right?
772900	774500	For one thing to say it doesn't exist,
774500	776540	that's a bad thing to predicate an object.
776540	778820	But secondly, it looks like I have to have an object.
778820	780780	So my domain has Pegasus in it.
780780	783420	And then I'm saying, but Pegasus doesn't exist.
783420	785220	And so I'm in trouble.
785220	790180	Now, gosh, what do I do about it?
790180	792500	It's a problem with all of these names
792500	793900	that don't denote anything.
793900	797100	How should I, in general, deal with those things?
797100	799740	It becomes a problem in logic.
799740	801940	And so there are various ways of dealing with it.
801940	803860	Quiet outlines one in this essay.
803860	806820	There's an entire branch of logic called free logic
806820	809820	that tries to accept that there are terms like Pegasus that
809820	812500	don't denote anything and to allow them in the logic.
812500	814660	But then what you do, you can't allow yourself
814660	817260	to go from Pegasus doesn't exist to, OK,
817260	819580	there are things that don't exist.
819580	822500	And in fact, that's a good test case.
822500	826620	Suppose I say, there are things that don't exist.
826620	827740	Does that make sense?
827740	831620	Or is that somehow self-contradictory?
831620	833300	Self-contradictory.
833300	836060	OK, Klein wants you to think, yes, that's self-contradictory.
836060	837740	There are things that don't exist.
837740	838300	What do you mean?
838300	840420	You're saying there are things that there aren't?
840420	842060	That's absurd, OK?
842060	844820	And so he's trying to get that intuition going.
844820	846100	Now, there were other philosophers
846100	847980	who think it makes perfectly good sense.
847980	851900	Terence Parsons writes a book on non-existent objects, in fact.
851900	854780	And one of the things he says right at the start
854780	857580	is there are some things that don't exist, like Pegasus.
857580	859940	For example, and he thinks that's just fine,
859940	862180	and we can say that without any problem.
862180	865180	In fact, it's great.
865180	867940	His dedication is to my parents, without whom I might have
867940	871380	been one, and mine is to love it.
871380	876580	So anyway, that's something that you could say is up for dispute,
876580	878540	whether you can say intelligently there
878540	880700	are things that don't exist.
880700	882660	But many of it, let's get back to Pegasus.
882660	883820	Pegasus doesn't exist.
883820	886180	We don't want that model of what's going on here.
886180	887700	But what can we do?
887700	890220	Well, our philosopher, Meg X, is thinking about this.
890220	892180	And says, well, actually, I don't want to say
892180	894100	there are rain horses, right?
894100	896580	In fact, it looks like I've got a problem.
896620	899980	Because if I've now got Pegasus in my domain,
899980	905220	and I've got this, like Pegasus is a horse.
905220	907020	That seems true.
907020	909380	Pegasus is white.
909380	913060	Pegasus is winged.
913060	916100	Now I've got white winged horses in my domain.
916100	918740	And so we can actually get Pegasus out there to say,
918740	922100	look, some horses have wings.
922100	924300	And it will turn out to be true, right?
924340	927060	But I don't want to say that's true.
927060	930340	And it doesn't help to say, of course, some horses have wings.
930340	932780	Pegasus, for example, you still want to say,
932780	935140	no, Pegasus isn't real.
935140	937020	And so what can you do?
937020	939660	Well, one way to do it is to try to turn Pegasus
939660	941100	into something else.
941100	944620	So Meg X here, for example, says, ah, yeah, of course,
944620	947540	I don't want to say there's an actual horse that is white,
947540	950020	it has wings, and is written by Valerafon, and so on,
950020	951820	as in medical stories.
951820	953860	No, instead, I'm saying there is something
953860	960100	like the idea of Pegasus, the idea, the concept of Pegasus.
960100	963900	So maybe this exists in the realm of ideas, or concepts,
963900	966620	or something like that.
966620	969580	And indeed, we can say, yeah, a fellow doesn't really exist,
969580	972300	but a fellow exists in the realm of characters,
972300	973500	for Shakespeare.
973500	976940	And so we could have realms of ideas, of concepts,
976940	979980	of characters, of fictions, and so forth,
979980	981740	where we want to say the object exists,
981740	983460	but in that special world.
983460	987620	So maybe this is ideas, maybe this is a realm of fictions,
987620	991140	maybe it's a realm of characters,
991140	995940	or of mythological creatures, whatever
995940	1000380	we want to say about this, we find some way of putting it
1000380	1002460	in a place where it doesn't do any harm,
1002460	1007180	and where we don't have to admit that it's a real horse.
1007180	1010940	Well, Klein doesn't like that option of saying,
1010940	1012260	it's just an idea.
1012260	1014180	And so when I say Pegasus doesn't exist,
1014180	1016420	I'm referring to an idea, or a fiction, or a character,
1016420	1019460	or a mythological creature, and saying that it doesn't exist.
1019460	1023260	Now, why doesn't he like that option?
1023260	1024140	What's wrong with that?
1033020	1034700	Does he talk about meaning and beings?
1034700	1036300	Is that where he goes with this?
1036300	1037700	Well, eventually, yes.
1037700	1041540	But the outset, there's something wrong with just the idea part.
1041540	1045220	Think about something that does exist.
1045220	1048940	Are you going to, is that a claim about an idea too?
1048940	1055100	Suppose I say that Harvey Friedman exists.
1055100	1057340	There really is a person named Harvey Friedman.
1057340	1060020	He's giving a talk at four o'clock today.
1060020	1062980	And so there really is that guy.
1062980	1066060	And now, if I say Harvey Friedman exists,
1066060	1068580	am I saying that, oh, am I talking about the idea
1068580	1072140	of Harvey Friedman, or a mythological creature
1072140	1074660	of Harvey Friedman, or a character, or a fiction?
1074660	1075300	No, right?
1075300	1080340	I'm actually talking about this person, this mathematician.
1080340	1085180	And it looks as if, in that case, you say, well, gee,
1085180	1086340	it's very clear, right?
1086340	1089580	I've got this here I am, let's say, and here's my mind.
1089580	1092980	And I've got this idea of Harvey Friedman.
1092980	1094620	But then here's Harvey Friedman.
1099220	1103140	Wow, that's a great picture of him.
1103140	1105900	He wears glasses.
1105900	1106540	That's ridiculous.
1106540	1110700	But anyway, I'm not tempted to confuse Harvey Friedman
1110700	1113060	with my idea of Harvey Friedman.
1113060	1114940	My idea of Harvey Friedman is mental,
1114940	1116980	but Harvey Friedman isn't mental.
1116980	1117860	He's an actual guy.
1117860	1119740	He's an actual mathematician.
1119740	1123500	And so you might say, look, I'm in no danger with that.
1123500	1125940	His example in the essay is the Parthenon.
1125980	1127700	I'm not going to confuse the Parthenon, which
1127700	1130780	is on the Acropolis, from my idea of the Parthenon,
1130780	1132900	which is in my head.
1132900	1134820	And so it's very clear there when
1134820	1137900	I'm talking about the Parthenon or Harvey Friedman,
1137900	1139780	and when I'm talking about my idea of the Parthenon
1139780	1143100	or my idea of Harvey Friedman.
1143100	1146980	Yet, if I look at Pegasus, well, now,
1146980	1148420	it looks like I'm getting confused.
1148420	1149740	Pegasus doesn't exist.
1149740	1151220	I'm talking about the horse, right?
1151220	1153580	It's saying it doesn't exist, but I'm talking about my idea.
1153580	1154220	Yeah?
1154220	1158780	How does this relate to idealism?
1158780	1160940	Is this kind of what gave rise to the idea
1160940	1164220	of everything not just in your head?
1164220	1166540	Because this seems to presuppose some sort of realism,
1166540	1168180	right?
1168180	1171300	That there is a Harvey Friedman in the real world,
1171300	1174100	and not just in the mind.
1174100	1177700	Well, Coyne is thinking of realistic terms.
1177700	1179900	He's framing this in realistic terms.
1179900	1183820	MacEx historically probably stands for MacTigert,
1183820	1185380	who is an idealist.
1185380	1188260	And so one way to interpret what's going on in this essay
1188260	1190340	is that it is an attack on idealism.
1190340	1191940	On the other hand, I'm not sure that's
1191940	1192940	the best way to look at it.
1192940	1195700	Because everything, and in fact, I
1195700	1197580	think it's part of the reason that Coyne refers
1197580	1200500	to fictional philosophers here, rather than actually engaging
1200500	1201860	specific people.
1201860	1204820	It's because even the idealist is
1204820	1207580	going to have to draw a distinction between the things that
1207580	1209860	are mind dependent in this way and the things that
1209860	1212180	are mind dependent in that way, right?
1212220	1216620	So the Parthenon will be mind dependent if I'm
1216620	1219740	an idealist, holding that everything is mind dependent.
1219740	1222540	But I can also then refer to my idea of the Parthenon.
1222540	1226060	I'm not identifying them as an idealist.
1226060	1229340	Moreover, I still want to draw the distinction between Pegasus
1229340	1230420	and the Parthenon.
1230420	1232740	The Parthenon really exists.
1232740	1234300	And Pegasus doesn't.
1234300	1237700	They both are, in a sense, mental projections or constructions
1237700	1239380	from an idealist's point of view.
1239380	1240940	But they have a really different character.
1240980	1243060	You can actually go to see the Parthenon.
1243060	1244980	But you can't go see Pegasus.
1244980	1246820	And so there's something fundamental.
1246820	1248980	You can go hear Harvey Friedman talk.
1248980	1252660	But if I say Santa Claus is going to be on campus
1252660	1257940	on December 25th, you can't wait around and go here
1257940	1259220	and talk by Santa Claus.
1259220	1261500	So something different is going on, even
1261500	1263460	from an idealist's point of view.
1263460	1266740	Idealists would distinguish between their idea of the Parthenon
1266740	1268620	and the actual Parthenon.
1268620	1270380	Sure, I think they have to.
1270380	1272700	Now, there's going to be an intimate relationship
1272700	1273620	between them.
1273620	1275100	What is that going to look like?
1275100	1280380	Suppose we took the following idea.
1280380	1283700	We thought, and Russell thinks this at a certain stage,
1283700	1286260	so does John Stuart Mill.
1286260	1289780	They are in this stage of their thinking phenomenalist.
1289780	1291500	And so they're, in a sense, saying,
1291500	1293580	what we call a physical object is really
1293580	1297060	just a collection of actual and possible sensations.
1297060	1299220	Now, since sensations are mental,
1299220	1301860	this is a way of being an idealist.
1301860	1304580	And if you take that view, then what's
1304580	1308140	the difference between Pegasus, for example,
1308140	1309820	and the Parthenon?
1309820	1312780	Well, in both cases, you're identifying the object
1312780	1316540	with these actual and possible sensations of them.
1316540	1320940	But now, yeah, so what does existence
1320940	1323420	come to for an idealist?
1323420	1327020	How do we distinguish that actual and possible,
1327020	1330540	I should say, the collection of actual and possible sensations
1330540	1333300	of a real thing as opposed to a collection
1333300	1338460	of actual and possible sensations of a fictional?
1338460	1341820	Presumably all of those are possible, right, but not actual.
1341820	1343900	These are, well, there are some actual ones,
1343900	1345260	but possible ones.
1345260	1348860	On the other hand, they're real things that nobody's seen.
1348860	1350340	And so I don't want to just say, oh,
1350340	1352900	it's the difference between actuality and possibility,
1352900	1355540	because there might be something we've had no actual sensations
1356300	1360380	of that we hope to gain sensations of.
1360380	1362420	So how could we do it before I do this?
1365660	1368460	Yeah, some of you are.
1368460	1371780	So there's one, I mean, it's a problem
1371780	1373860	that any idealist needs to face.
1373860	1376900	And interestingly enough, if you think about classic ideals,
1376900	1378740	what would Barclay say about this, for example?
1378740	1381060	What would Kant say about this?
1381060	1383580	My answer is, I have no idea, because they don't address
1383580	1384780	this question at all.
1384820	1388820	What's Kant's account of fictional entities, or Barclay's
1388820	1391460	account, this is not a problem they ever talk about.
1391460	1395460	And so in a certain sense, you could say, gosh,
1395460	1397380	have idealists recognize that they actually
1397380	1399460	have a task to perform here?
1399460	1400660	But let's help them out.
1400660	1401660	What could you say?
1405340	1408300	Collective belief.
1408300	1410620	Collective belief, well, how would that help?
1410620	1412460	I don't know, if multiple, well, I
1412460	1414740	guess if you have some kind of threshold problem,
1414740	1416860	people believe in something, and then that threshold
1416860	1418420	is fulfilled, and you can turn that
1418420	1421580	into an actual thing that exists.
1421580	1424460	Oh, well, I should say, OK, look, here's the difference.
1424460	1426100	Not many people believe in Pegasus.
1426100	1428100	Lots of people believe in the Parthenon.
1428100	1429740	That's what it comes down to.
1429740	1432220	But gosh, that means if a religious revival sweeps through
1432220	1435820	and everybody starts believing in God, God exists now, right?
1435820	1440060	Or if people give up on religion, then God no longer exists.
1440060	1441260	But that seems silly, right?
1441260	1442780	Whether there's a God or not doesn't
1442780	1445500	depend on how many people believe it.
1445500	1447660	So that's one thing that's problematic.
1447660	1449020	Secondly, it looks like it's going
1449020	1451740	to wreak havoc with science, because suppose scientists
1451740	1454300	become convinced that there is such a thing as flogistan,
1454300	1455540	for example.
1455540	1458460	And then our physical theory changes.
1458460	1460460	Well, now, what do we say?
1460460	1463860	Oh, yeah, there used to be this stuff called flogistan.
1463860	1467660	And when you burn something, it was an escape of flogistan.
1467660	1469580	But now, and it had negative weight and stuff,
1469580	1473500	which is why it went up to the air and so on.
1473500	1476580	But then it stopped existing.
1476580	1479340	And all of a sudden, things started oxidizing.
1479340	1483220	Gosh, before oxidation wasn't a thing.
1483220	1484060	No, it's a thing.
1484060	1486060	Flogistan used to be a thing.
1486060	1488260	Found it all over the medieval world.
1488260	1493060	But then around 1750, flogistan just went out of existence.
1493060	1494540	And that seems ridiculous, right?
1494540	1496140	That's not right.
1496180	1500500	So it isn't entirely easy to figure out what to say.
1500500	1504300	We might say, look, it's a question of systematic,
1504300	1508060	predictable collections of actual and possible sensations.
1508060	1509940	So then if I go and visit the Parthenon,
1509940	1511020	I'm there on the Acropolis.
1511020	1512220	I'm looking at it.
1512220	1514620	I close my eyes, open them again.
1514620	1515740	It's still there.
1515740	1517380	I walk around to this side.
1517380	1518740	It's still there.
1518740	1522860	Whereas Pegasus, that's not necessarily the case.
1522860	1525100	Suppose I'm imagining Pegasus, and then
1525100	1527780	I stop imagining Pegasus.
1527780	1530500	Do I suddenly then start imagining Pegasus again?
1530500	1531020	No, right?
1531020	1532820	It's not nearly so systematic.
1532820	1535060	So you might say there's a kind of patterning
1535060	1537380	to actual and possible sensations of the Parthenon,
1537380	1539500	but there isn't the case of Pegasus.
1539500	1539940	Yeah.
1539940	1543180	Why can't the idealist just say that the Parthenon is an idea
1543180	1548580	in the mind, and Pegasus is an idea of an idea?
1548580	1553940	Parthenon is an idea, and Pegasus is an idea of an idea.
1554060	1556500	And that's basically what Pegasus is.
1556500	1559580	Well, but then how do we explain that Pegasus
1559580	1561460	is a horse seems true?
1561460	1564460	We'll just say, no, Pegasus is an idea of a horse.
1564460	1565100	I say, no, no, no, no, no.
1565100	1566820	Polarifon wrote Pegasus.
1566820	1569820	No, you're saying the idea of Polarifon
1569820	1573420	wrote the idea of Polarifon, Pegasus.
1573420	1575980	So anyway, yeah, of all horses.
1575980	1576780	Yeah, I don't know.
1576780	1578880	I mean, there's an appealing thought there
1578880	1581540	that it feels like there's some sort of difference in level.
1581540	1586140	And yet, as soon as you start trying to think about how then we'd talk about these things,
1586140	1588220	it's going to get really weird fast.
1588220	1592260	So that's how to say we can't deal with that weirdness, maybe we can, and find a translation
1592260	1594580	pattern that makes it make sense.
1594580	1597340	But it's at least going to be an obstacle to that approach.
1597340	1598340	Yeah?
1598340	1599340	Yeah.
1599340	1602340	I mean, it seems like, I don't know if this is even helpful at all, but when I'm talking
1602340	1608980	about my idea of Parthenon and my idea of Pegasus, they can interact very easily in
1608980	1609980	my ideas.
1610140	1616020	I can talk about Pegasus landing on the Parthenon, and that's not problematic that they go together
1616020	1618020	very well.
1618020	1623860	So that you have ideas that could be fictional of real things, just like you have ideas of
1623860	1624860	fictional things.
1624860	1626340	Well, okay, good, good.
1626340	1631780	Yes, this turns out to be a mess because of exactly what you're pointing out.
1631780	1635980	There are all sorts of mixtures of real things and fictional things, right?
1635980	1639100	Often stories that are fictional stories include some real things.
1639100	1640100	But maybe not.
1640100	1643860	Maybe in a science fiction universe, you're dealing with something where everything is
1643860	1648020	really strictly imaginary, but often fiction isn't like that.
1648020	1650340	It's based on something real.
1650340	1652860	So Sherlock Holmes lives in London.
1652860	1653860	London is a real place.
1653860	1656220	It's not just fiction.
1656220	1659860	But Sherlock Holmes is fictional, and so you've got this mixture of the fictional and the
1659860	1660860	non-fictional.
1660860	1663860	Similarly, you might have Pegasus landing on the Parthenon.
1663860	1668620	Well, Pegasus in the story is a mythological creature, but on the other hand, the Parthenon
1668620	1672260	is not mythological, and we mix them together in certain ways.
1672260	1677100	And so if we've suddenly got some big difference in level, that's like, well, an idea landed
1677100	1679020	on this, right?
1679020	1680020	And that's going to be bizarre.
1680020	1682700	How can an idea land on a building?
1682700	1686580	So there's something very strange about those mixtures, and that's going to make it super
1686580	1691220	hard to really sustain the difference in levels throughout.
1691220	1695900	We want fictional things and non-fictional things to interact, at least in the fictions.
1695900	1702700	So, oh gosh, maybe a case that's extreme in this instance is a historical novel.
1702700	1706500	When I was a kid, I used to love these books called You Were There.
1706500	1708540	You Were There at the Battle of Hastings.
1708540	1713180	You Were There at the Battle of Guadalcanal or something, and it's written as if you're
1713180	1714180	actually there.
1714180	1715180	It's like, wow.
1715180	1720620	In fact, if I were really there at the Battle of Guadalcanal or something, that'd be terrifying.
1720620	1723500	But all of a sudden it's like, yes, you're nine years old and you were really there
1723500	1729060	watching all the battle take place, and they were very effective fictions written for elementary
1729060	1732540	school kids, putting you there in that situation.
1732540	1738100	But of course, now what's going on is partly actual events from the battle.
1738100	1741620	But it's partly, you know, you're not really there, and there are other characters you
1741620	1746660	meet who are fictional characters, but inserted into this real historical situation.
1746660	1751900	And so in historical novels, this sort of thing is going on all the time.
1752900	1757660	If all of that's true, you might think, well, yes, we're going to have trouble actually
1757660	1765180	referring to Pegasus in a way that separates these levels and keeps that distinction of
1765180	1766900	levels going throughout.
1766900	1769500	Intuitively speaking, there's something that feels right about it.
1769500	1773900	We think, but wait, Pegasus is something like a character, is a fiction, is a mythological
1773900	1775700	preacher.
1775700	1781100	And yet to say, well, that just makes Pegasus mental in a certain way, that other things
1781100	1782100	are not.
1782100	1786100	Looks like it's going to be puzzled, not only from an idealist point of view, but from
1786100	1788180	anybody's point of view.
1788180	1790700	So what if we took another strategy?
1790700	1795660	He says, ah, yes, now we have another philosopher, why?
1795660	1798420	Who says, here's the way to think about this.
1798420	1801380	And by the way, it's not just sort of a hypothetical approach.
1801380	1804740	This is something taken by many people in free logic.
1804740	1809540	This was the approach taken by Leblanc and Thomas in 1968, and it has a lot of intuitive
1809540	1810700	appeal.
1810700	1819220	The idea is really that we should think about a domain of possible objects.
1819220	1824500	And then some of those are the actual objects.
1824500	1829700	So if I say that Harvey Friedman exists, or the Parthenon exists, I'm putting Harvey
1829700	1832900	Friedman or the Parthenon in the realm of actual objects.
1832900	1838260	But Pegasus, if I say Pegasus doesn't exist, what I mean is Pegasus is out here in the
1838260	1840380	realm of merely possible objects.
1840380	1844380	So here's Harvey Friedman, here's the Parthenon, they're inside there.
1844380	1853620	But now Pegasus or Sherlock Holmes, they are out here in the realm of merely possible objects.
1853620	1854820	And then I can say exists.
1854820	1855820	I understand what that means.
1855820	1858820	It just refers to that subset of things.
1858820	1865980	Okay, so just as we said here, ah, these are the things that are a's at some subset of
1865980	1866980	our domain.
1866980	1872340	The things that exist are some subset of the domain of possible objects.
1872340	1878820	Now, actually, there is something intuitively plausible about that.
1878820	1881820	Why does Quine object to that?
1881820	1884700	The bald man in the doorway.
1884700	1885820	Okay, good.
1885820	1888300	There are really two arguments he gives.
1888300	1892700	And one of them is precisely that one, the bald man in the doorway.
1892700	1898700	The other one is concerning the round square cupola of Berkeley College, okay?
1898700	1910300	So the first difficulty is now contradictory descriptions.
1910300	1919300	The round square cupola.
1919300	1925780	And then the second one is this thing about identity conditions.
1925780	1930660	It becomes one of Quine's main themes, no entity without identity.
1930660	1935220	For me to say there are such things as a's, for example, I not only have to postulate
1935220	1939460	their existence, I have to give you some identity criteria.
1939460	1944980	At least if a is a count now, there's a distinction between count nouns and mass nouns.
1944980	1945980	Things like water, gold.
1945980	1954980	And to say there is water, that would be just as the treat this as a master.
1954980	1958580	How do you deal, how do you understand those as complicated, but a count noun like there
1958580	1967380	is a person, there is a piece of chalk, there is a flying horse, etc., those things seem
1967380	1971700	to require not only do we say these things exist, but to give us some idea of what makes
1971700	1975220	for there being one or two or three of these.
1975220	1979940	We seem to need criteria of identification and individuation.
1979940	1982340	How do I tell one piece of chalk from another?
1982340	1986180	How do I re-identify something as the same piece of chalk?
1986180	1991060	Well those questions of identity are crucial for actually talking about objects of a certain
1991060	1994900	kind and we need that, he says, for these.
1994900	1998340	So let's take the first argument, contradictory descriptions.
1998340	2000460	What do we do with the round square cupola?
2000460	2005860	Do we put it in the realm of possible objects?
2005860	2007020	That's going to trouble, right?
2007020	2010620	Because then we're saying it's possible that there's something that's both round and square.
2010620	2013220	Could anything be both round and square?
2013220	2014420	No.
2014420	2018940	So the difficulty here is that it looks like that's impossible.
2018940	2022300	But now I could either take the description or I could give it a name.
2022300	2028300	I could say, ah, yes, Franklin, that beautiful round square cupola on Berkeley College.
2028300	2032620	And now you might say, wait a minute, Franklin is now denoting an impossible object.
2032620	2034420	So I seem to have a choice.
2034420	2039620	I can either say something that is false, right, that something could be both round
2039620	2045540	and square, and I'm going to get contradictions out of that, or I say, well actually I need
2045540	2052260	a broader realm now out here of impossible objects.
2052260	2057060	And quite doesn't really go into that in detail, but now I'm going to have a realm of things
2057060	2058860	that are both round and square.
2058860	2062180	I'm going to have a realm of things that have both two and three parts.
2062180	2070660	I'm going to have a realm of things that are both white and black and red all over.
2070660	2074900	And so I'm going to have all sorts of trouble if I introduce those, you might think.
2074900	2077500	At least you might think.
2077500	2080820	By the way, Klein does not actually deduce a contradiction from this, right?
2080820	2084940	He says all sorts of embarrassing questions could be raised about those.
2084940	2090900	He doesn't actually go through and raise those questions and attack this.
2090900	2096740	However, he catches Wyman saying, actually I think something like this is meaningless,
2096740	2100580	and that's very strange to say as Wyman points out.
2100580	2106060	Something that is white and red and black all over is different from something that's
2106060	2107700	both round and square, right?
2107700	2109780	We cannot understand the meaning of both.
2109780	2113700	In fact, it's by virtue of understanding the meaning that we realize there could be no
2113700	2114700	such thing.
2114900	2116100	That won't fly at all.
2116100	2119300	So it looks like this is problematic.
2119300	2120940	What about the identity conditions?
2120940	2123700	This is perhaps the most famous passage in the essay.
2123700	2127220	Can I just ask you some questions here?
2127220	2136300	So when he's saying that, no, that's not meaningless because it has meaning, does that go back
2136380	2144580	to sort of what Karnat was doing is like the logical optimists are saying all these
2144580	2149060	things have no meaning because they can't be very...
2149060	2151140	Okay, yes.
2151140	2154780	We are here floating around with that same question of significance.
2154780	2155780	What has meaning?
2155780	2156780	What doesn't have meaning?
2156780	2158580	Can we draw a distinction?
2158580	2163460	And there are going to be several things that are difficult about this one.
2163460	2166140	One that he points out is a purely logical problem.
2166140	2171780	Church's theorem implies that in the Rommel first horiologic, validity is undecidable.
2171780	2174540	There is no decision procedure for validity.
2174540	2178060	That means there is no decision procedure for contradictoryness.
2178060	2184060	So if whether something is possible, consistent or contradictory, is at issue, that's an undecidable
2184060	2185060	question.
2185060	2188540	But it's weird to think that it's undecidable whether something has meaning or not.
2188540	2192860	We'd like to have not only some criterion, but some way of deciding in principle in a
2192860	2197260	finite time whether this is meaningful or not.
2197260	2202700	And so he wants to say, look, if it turns out that contradictions are meaningless, you're
2202700	2207860	already basically saying the distinction between the meaningful and the meaningless is undecidable.
2207860	2210540	And that's a creepy thing to say.
2210540	2212180	So there's that problem.
2212180	2219740	But in addition to that, you might think there is a difficulty about, well, you might...
2219740	2222140	Let's relate to Hepple's criteria.
2222140	2224420	Remember he said there's a criterion of adequacy.
2224420	2227940	And one of the things that was a corollary from that is that A should be meaningful
2227940	2230300	if and only if not A is meaningful.
2230300	2235300	If I understand a sentence, putting in a not should preserve meaning, or taking a not away
2235300	2237220	should preserve meaning.
2237220	2241580	But what happens here is basically something that is a contradiction.
2241580	2243900	The negation of that will be a logical truth.
2243900	2248100	If I've got something that comes down to P and not P, but then I negate that, I've got
2248100	2249540	a logical truth.
2249540	2254740	And so if it turns out that contradictions are meaningless, it's also got to turn out,
2254740	2260100	if Hepple's right, that logical truths are meaningless.
2260100	2264300	And so actually we won't just say the round square, oh, meaningless, we're going to have
2264300	2268900	to say the claim that nothing could be both rounded square is meaningless.
2268900	2270860	And some philosophers are willing to do that.
2270860	2274300	Wittgenstein in the Tractatus actually thinks about x equals x.
2274300	2279420	Actually, is it in the, I'm sorry, I've forgotten now whether it's in the Tractatus
2279500	2281300	or the Investigations.
2281300	2284500	But Wittgenstein at some point thinks about x equals x.
2284500	2287860	And he says that has no use.
2287860	2289220	It has no function.
2289220	2293180	So actually the claim that x is equal to x is meaningless.
2293180	2295860	And that's a very strange thing to say.
2295860	2299020	But you can see maybe why somebody would be led to think it.
2299020	2303460	Because A should be meaningful if not only if not A is meaningful.
2303460	2308220	So to say x equals x is meaningful is basically to say that x is not equal to x is
2308220	2311300	meaningful, which it is, it is meaningful.
2311300	2316380	But anyway, it's going to turn out not only contradictions have to be meaningless
2316380	2319220	on this criterion, so would logical truths.
2319220	2322180	And that's a hard thing, I think, to swallow.
2322180	2326220	But now let's get back to the identity conditions argument.
2326220	2329500	Wyman's overpopulated universe is in many ways unlovely.
2329500	2333940	It offends the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes.
2333940	2335300	But this is not the worst of it.
2335300	2339460	Wyman's slum of possibles is a greedy crowd for disorderly elements.
2339460	2342700	Take, for instance, the possible fat man in that doorway.
2342700	2344780	And again, the possible bald man in that doorway.
2344780	2347460	Are they the same possible man or two possible men?
2347460	2348540	How do we decide?
2348540	2350980	How many possible men are in that doorway?
2350980	2353660	Are there more possible thin ones than fat ones?
2353660	2354860	How many of them are alike?
2354860	2356660	Or would there be a like, make them one?
2356660	2358260	Are no two possible things alike?
2358260	2361260	Is this the same as saying it's impossible for two things to be alike?
2361260	2364460	Or finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable
2364460	2365980	to unactualized possibles?
2365980	2367900	But what sense can be found with hugging of entities
2367900	2370340	which cannot meaningfully be said to be identical with themselves
2370340	2371780	and distinct from one another?
2371780	2373900	These elements are well-nigh and original.
2373900	2375820	By fregian therapy of individual concepts,
2375820	2377900	some members might be made of rehabilitation.
2377900	2380740	But I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum
2380740	2382700	and be done with it.
2382700	2387260	Now, is there an argument there?
2387260	2389260	And if so, what kind of argument is it?
2389980	2395580	Well, let's look at the doorway.
2395580	2400180	Is there a possible fat man in that doorway?
2400180	2401540	Yes.
2401540	2405060	OK, if we're going with this way of thinking about things, sure.
2405060	2406100	Sure, right?
2406100	2408900	All that is to say, there could be a fat man in that doorway.
2408900	2411660	Now, presumably, it couldn't be too fat or you couldn't get into the doorway.
2411660	2415420	But nevertheless, sure, there could be a fat man in that doorway.
2415420	2418180	Could there be a bald man in that doorway?
2418180	2418740	Sure.
2418820	2421820	So there's a possible bald man in it.
2421820	2422620	Are they the same?
2426500	2427500	Well, good.
2427500	2430940	Yeah, there are some possible men in that doorway
2430940	2432780	that are both bald and fat.
2432780	2436780	There's some that are bald and not fat, right?
2436780	2439460	How many of them are there?
2439460	2440340	What should Wyman say?
2445860	2448180	Well, I think Wyman would say there was infinite, right?
2448180	2449100	Infinitely many, yeah.
2449100	2450940	There are infinitely many, right?
2450940	2454580	Infinitely many possible bald men in the doorway.
2454580	2457820	Infinitely many possible fat men in the doorway.
2457820	2460260	Infinitely many that are both bald and fat.
2460260	2461260	And so on.
2461260	2464380	OK, so I think Wyman would actually
2464380	2466420	be able to answer my questions.
2466420	2470020	Now, how many of them are alike?
2470020	2476060	Oh, could there be two, qualitatively, indiscernible fat bald
2476060	2477300	possible men in the doorway?
2480980	2481700	Sure, right?
2481700	2483660	They could be identical twins.
2483660	2486500	Sure, they could be alike.
2486500	2488420	Is this or no two possible things alike?
2488420	2491260	Well, sure, some of them are alike, right?
2491260	2493300	And in fact, I could say, yeah, there
2493300	2496140	could be a fat man in the doorway who goes away
2496140	2499740	and then reappears, same possible fat man appearing.
2499740	2502460	And so it doesn't seem as if these questions are really
2502460	2505260	unanswerable if we go seriously about this and say,
2505260	2508420	yeah, look, I'm talking about this domain to say
2508420	2510500	there is a possible object here is to just say
2510500	2513100	there could be an object such that blah, blah, blah.
2513100	2516060	And I can say there could be the same object in that doorway,
2516060	2516820	et cetera.
2516820	2519740	So all of that can go out here would seem.
2519740	2523940	And sure, I don't myself find this a very powerful argument.
2523940	2526580	It seems to me easy for somebody who has Wyman's view
2526580	2528420	to respond to these arguments.
2528420	2530500	Now, the first one is more serious,
2530500	2533500	because what do I do about things
2533540	2535220	like the round square cupola?
2535220	2538140	And if I'm doing it with respect to that, whatever I do,
2538140	2543180	why don't I do the same thing with Pegasus and the detective
2543180	2546660	in such and such a story and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2546660	2550180	So I think this is in a way a more serious problem
2550180	2552020	just because of a viable way of solving it.
2552020	2554500	Why can't I use it across the board?
2554500	2558660	But this one seems to me a bit fishy.
2558660	2561380	Anyway, whatever you think about that,
2561420	2563820	Klein doesn't like this approach either.
2563820	2566380	He wants to clear the slum and be done with it.
2566380	2568140	So what does he do?
2568140	2569540	How can we solve the problem?
2572540	2573380	Russell.
2574780	2575700	Russell, exactly.
2575700	2576780	We rustled it.
2576780	2578980	I've spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard
2578980	2580500	and hinted that it's tangled.
2580500	2582180	I've dwells at length on the inconveniences
2582180	2583020	of putting up with it.
2583020	2585300	It's time to think about taking steps.
2585300	2586900	And so the answer is Russell.
2586900	2589180	Now, how does Russell help us here?
2589180	2592860	Well, we can think about Pegasus not existing
2592860	2596060	and say, let's think about this in a slightly different way.
2597380	2599740	Let's think about what we would do
2599740	2602820	with something like the present king of France's ball.
2602820	2606500	We don't say, aha, so there is a present king of France.
2606500	2608980	But of course, he's just mythological, he's fictional.
2608980	2612060	He's just an idea or he's a merely possible object.
2612060	2613460	Instead, what Russell taught us
2613460	2615420	is that we don't have to do any of that.
2615420	2618020	We don't commit ourselves to a present king of France.
2618020	2620700	We just say that saying there is one and only one king
2620700	2623860	of France and that person is bald.
2623860	2627460	But there isn't one and only one king of France, so false.
2627460	2629220	And we're never committed there
2629220	2631300	to there being a present king of France.
2631300	2633500	So do the same thing with Pegasus.
2633500	2637140	Now, we have to turn the name into some kind of description.
2637140	2640740	And so we do have Pegasus as a name.
2640740	2644300	Well, directly speaking, Russell's theory of descriptions
2644300	2645460	doesn't apply to it.
2645460	2647580	But even Russell thought proper names of this kind
2647580	2650820	should be translated really into descriptions.
2650820	2655140	And so it could be like the winged horse
2655140	2656540	written by Bolairefond.
2656540	2659340	It could be just the thing that Pegasizes.
2659340	2662220	And so Quine says, you could just turn this into a verb.
2662220	2665100	And so it could be the Pegasizer.
2666100	2682980	But you can also just say the thing called Pegasus, which
2682980	2687180	might seem a little bit less peculiar than the Pegasizer.
2687180	2689740	In any case, what do we do if we do it that way?
2689740	2693820	Then Pegasus doesn't exist to become something like this.
2693820	2698580	There is, well, actually, yeah, Pegasus.
2698580	2700340	Let's start with Pegasus as a horse.
2705300	2713020	There is one and only one Pegasizer,
2713020	2719020	or a thing called Pegasus, and it's a horse.
2720020	2724020	Now, is that true or false?
2724020	2725020	False.
2725020	2726020	It's false, right?
2726020	2728020	There is no such thing as Pegasus.
2728020	2731020	There's nothing Pegasizes in the actual universe.
2731020	2733020	And so we end up saying that's false.
2733020	2737020	So the strategy was that Pegasus is, of course, false.
2737020	2740020	What about Pegasus doesn't exist?
2743020	2745020	What's going to happen there?
2749020	2760020	It looks like we have to say there is one and only one Pegasizer,
2760020	2763020	and it doesn't exist.
2767020	2770020	But that sounds self-contradictory.
2770020	2773020	That sounds like we're saying there's one and only one thing,
2773020	2775020	and there is no such thing.
2775020	2778020	And so it looks like that's not just false, but logically false.
2778020	2780020	So this becomes logically false.
2780020	2784020	So, actually, if we just try this strategy of Rossellian descriptions
2784020	2787020	and apply it literally to this, we get trouble,
2787020	2789020	because it looks like actually now,
2789020	2791020	Mik-X can say hi-hi, don't you?
2791020	2797020	It turns out this is actually contradictory.
2797020	2800020	And so we're in trouble.
2800020	2802020	Now, what can we do?
2803020	2808020	Well, remember Rossell had this distinction
2808020	2812020	between primary and secondary occurrences.
2812020	2814020	So we can say, ah, wait a minute.
2814020	2817020	This is the same thing as with the present king of France.
2817020	2819020	That's not the way to do it.
2819020	2821020	The way to do it is to say this.
2821020	2824020	Not that there is one and only one thing and it doesn't exist,
2824020	2828020	but to say it's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer
2828020	2830020	and it exists.
2833020	2835020	And then that's true.
2835020	2838020	It's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer.
2838020	2841020	And now it exists part is actually irrelevant.
2841020	2845020	And so now we get something that's true and that occurs.
2845020	2847020	But notice what this means.
2847020	2850020	It means that actually something like Pegasus doesn't exist
2850020	2854020	is ambiguous between a statement that's contradictory
2854020	2858020	and a statement that is true.
2858020	2860020	Now, why doesn't exactly bring that up?
2860020	2863020	Partly because he doesn't like this as a predicate.
2863020	2866020	He doesn't really want to think that it should be understood that way.
2866020	2870020	But now the same thing is going to arise with attributes.
2870020	2873020	We'll have to postpone until next time our talk of roundness
2873020	2876020	and other sorts of attributes like redness.
2876020	2879020	But what happens when we apply this strategy to it?
2879020	2883020	Well, Friday we'll figure out how that all goes.
