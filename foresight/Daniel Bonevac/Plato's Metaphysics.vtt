00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Hi. I want to talk to you today about Plato's metaphysics. Plato is perhaps the greatest

00:09.800 --> 00:15.100
metaphysician of the Western tradition. Alfred North Whitehead once said that all Western

00:15.100 --> 00:20.280
philosophy is really a series of footnotes to Plato. And it's this part of his doctrine

00:20.280 --> 00:26.300
that he really had primarily in mind. Plato gives us a distinctive view, so distinctive

00:26.300 --> 00:31.500
that actually this general kind of view, even today, tends to be known as Platonism. It's

00:31.500 --> 00:36.460
often also called realism, but realism can mean different things. It's a specific kind

00:36.460 --> 00:41.900
of realism. But Platonism is still recognized as one of the most common, one of the most

00:41.900 --> 00:47.720
powerful, and even today, one of the most popular approaches to philosophy. So what

00:47.720 --> 00:53.820
is Platonism, and how do we understand it? I have a separate video in which I talk about

00:53.820 --> 00:58.300
the distinction between universals and particulars. But it's crucial to getting us going, so

00:58.300 --> 01:04.240
I want to remind you of the general shape of that distinction. A universal is something

01:04.240 --> 01:11.540
that can have multiple instances, but a particular cannot. So particulars are things that there's

01:11.540 --> 01:17.820
only one of. You can't have multiple instances of them. I'm a good example. Dan Bonobat,

01:17.820 --> 01:23.940
or any other person for that matter, is a particular. I'm a particular person. As you

01:23.940 --> 01:28.220
could probably tell from this slide, I was talking in another course when I first made

01:28.220 --> 01:32.580
it up about the beginnings of the First World War. So the other person I had in mind was

01:32.580 --> 01:37.900
Gavrilo Principi, the guy who started the war by assassinating the Archduke. The Empire

01:37.900 --> 01:44.860
State Building, or the Pericostinata Library, a particular beach ball, a particular watch,

01:44.900 --> 01:50.860
this grain of sand, a particular city like Austin, or the state of Texas, or Sarajevo,

01:50.860 --> 01:56.620
a particular date or time, an event like the assassination of the Archduke. All of those

01:56.620 --> 02:01.380
are examples of particulars. You can't have a bunch of them. Even if you somehow cloned

02:01.380 --> 02:06.180
me and produced a bunch of people who looked like me, they would all be copies of Dan Bonobat.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.980
And you might joke and say, oh, now there are many Dan Bonobats. But actually, that would

02:11.100 --> 02:15.220
turn that term into a kind term. There would still be just one of me. There would then

02:15.220 --> 02:19.980
be a bunch of copies of me. So particulars, there's only one of them. They can't have

02:19.980 --> 02:25.500
multiple instances. But a universal has multiple instances. You can find it all over the place.

02:25.500 --> 02:32.860
So here are some examples. There are properties like red, or triangular, or large. Relations

02:32.860 --> 02:39.740
like being between, being on something, or loving someone, being friends with someone.

02:39.740 --> 02:44.780
Relations like tiger, or building, pencil, shortstop. Some of these are natural kinds,

02:44.780 --> 02:50.300
like tiger. You find them there in nature. Others are human artifacts, or socially defined,

02:50.300 --> 02:55.420
like pencil or shortstop. There can be books, books like the Bible, or the novel, Edwin

02:55.420 --> 03:01.860
Mulhouse. They're musical works, Lucanbach, Texas, or Box, Takata, and Fugue, and D Minor.

03:01.860 --> 03:06.860
You can find many copies of those musical works. You might find sheet music. You might

03:06.860 --> 03:12.700
find them in a sort of digital form. They might be on a record album. They might be

03:12.700 --> 03:19.300
on a CD. I might start humming the tune. And I could sit down at the piano, maybe, and

03:19.300 --> 03:24.100
start playing the Takata, and Fugue, and D Minor. Actually, it's an organ piece. I would

03:24.100 --> 03:28.460
get into trouble because I wouldn't have pedals. But in any case, those are things that there

03:28.460 --> 03:35.540
can be many, many different instances of. Well, there's nobody much doubts that particulars

03:35.540 --> 03:42.540
are real. You and I exist in the world, if anything does. But are universals real? Well,

03:42.540 --> 03:47.540
there are different attitudes about that. The realist says yes. Not only do they exist,

03:47.540 --> 03:51.140
but they're mind independent. They're really, in some sense, out there. They're not just

03:51.140 --> 03:56.020
concepts. The conceptualist says, I agree with you, they really exist. But I think they are

03:56.020 --> 04:01.020
just concepts. I think they are really, in the end, dependent on the mind. The nominalist

04:01.020 --> 04:05.260
says, I don't think they exist at all. There are no such things. Everything that exists

04:05.260 --> 04:10.500
is a particular object. There is no such thing as humanity. There are simply particular people.

04:10.500 --> 04:17.740
There's no such thing as the color red. They're just a bunch of red things. And so, the realist,

04:17.740 --> 04:22.780
and as we'll see, Plato is the paradigmatic realist, says yes, they really are constituents

04:22.780 --> 04:28.860
of the world. And they're really out there. They're not in here. They are real mind independent

04:28.860 --> 04:31.660
constituents of the world.

04:31.660 --> 04:37.700
Well, as I've said, he is the paradigmatic realist. He is the first one who says yes,

04:37.700 --> 04:43.660
universals are crucial to understanding anything. And he calls them forms. These forms are these

04:43.660 --> 04:50.100
mind independent universals. So, in the Republic, but also in a variety of other works, he lays

04:50.100 --> 04:56.940
out what is known as Plato's theory of forms, trying to explain what they're like, what

04:56.940 --> 05:02.860
access we have to them, how they make possible all sorts of things about our relationship

05:02.860 --> 05:04.300
to the world.

05:04.300 --> 05:09.540
Now why on earth would you think these forms exist? What's the point of them? Well, here

05:09.540 --> 05:17.020
is his idea. And it's, at first glance, an odd idea. He says, look, there is a sense

05:17.020 --> 05:21.420
in which the mind is turned in two different directions whenever I have a thought. I see

05:21.420 --> 05:25.980
something that is a triangle, like that object that I've depicted here on the slide, and

05:25.980 --> 05:32.140
I think this is a triangle. So take that little stop sign looking thing as a mind and that

05:32.140 --> 05:37.740
little squiggle as a thought within that mind. The content is there in the little bubble.

05:37.740 --> 05:45.980
This is a triangle. When I do that, I am recognizing that object I am perceiving as a triangle.

05:45.980 --> 05:51.020
And so I am partly directed toward that object and perceiving it, but partly I am directed

05:51.020 --> 05:58.700
toward triangularity. I'm recognizing it as an instance of triangularity as a triangle.

05:58.700 --> 06:03.980
Well that means whenever I have a thought like that about an object, about a particular,

06:03.980 --> 06:09.180
yes, my mind is directed toward the particular, but it's also directed toward that universal.

06:09.180 --> 06:16.460
I am directed both toward that particular triangle and also I'm thinking about triangularity.

06:16.460 --> 06:22.620
In fact, I am able to recognize that object, that particular, as a triangle because my

06:22.620 --> 06:30.700
mind has some contact with or awareness of triangularity, the form. So abstractions like

06:30.700 --> 06:35.900
the forms, universals, make it possible for me to have thoughts about particular objects.

06:35.900 --> 06:42.540
I couldn't do it. I couldn't think about that as a triangle unless I already had some

06:42.540 --> 06:48.620
awareness of triangularity. That is one crucial reason we think the forms exist.

06:49.660 --> 06:55.740
Why, however, more broadly should we think they exist? In addition to my ability to recognize

06:55.740 --> 07:02.860
things as triangles, as red, as human beings, and so on. There are different explanations he gives,

07:02.860 --> 07:05.660
and I think they fall broadly speaking under five categories.

07:06.860 --> 07:12.300
The forms enable me to think general thoughts. They enable me to recognize regularities about

07:12.300 --> 07:18.780
the world, to recognize and characterize universal and necessary laws that govern the world.

07:19.420 --> 07:24.940
They allow me to explain how it's possible for human beings to communicate and how it's possible

07:24.940 --> 07:30.620
for them to mean anything at all with their thoughts and with their words. And finally,

07:30.620 --> 07:35.580
it explains, well, what philosophers like to call veridicality, something like accuracy,

07:35.580 --> 07:42.620
a question of our thoughts or our statements matching the world. So it's a question of truth,

07:42.620 --> 07:48.620
of objectivity, of accuracy, of faithful representation of the world. The forms he thinks

07:48.620 --> 07:53.420
explain all of that. And if we don't have the forms, then he says we're not going to be able to

07:53.420 --> 07:58.060
think general thoughts. We won't be able to recognize laws or regularities. We won't be

07:58.060 --> 08:02.860
able to communicate, and we'll have no basis for thinking there's such a thing as truth.

08:02.860 --> 08:07.180
We'll have to become skeptics, or even worse than that, we'll simply have to say,

08:07.180 --> 08:11.580
there's no such thing as truth. There's no such thing as communication. Really, in the end,

08:11.580 --> 08:17.580
everybody has their own ideas. We're all confined in our own little worlds, incapable of interacting

08:17.580 --> 08:24.060
meaningfully with anyone else. Let's turn to that first point. The forms make it possible for us

08:24.060 --> 08:30.300
to think general thoughts. Here we can say the general thought, the general principle behind

08:30.300 --> 08:36.620
this general thought argument is this. There must be something all Fs have in common by virtue of

08:36.620 --> 08:43.100
which they are Fs, whatever F happens to be. So I see a herd of horses. Well, there's something

08:43.100 --> 08:47.660
that those animals have in common. What is it? There must be something they have in common.

08:47.660 --> 08:52.460
I call them all horses. What enables me to do that? Now, the nominalist is going to say,

08:52.460 --> 08:57.740
I don't need any universals around. I can just look at those particular objects. And I see

08:57.740 --> 09:02.780
they're similar. And so, hey, I introduce a term for them, horse. I use it for things that are

09:02.780 --> 09:09.260
similar to things like that. But Plato says, wait a minute. Why are they similar? You're recognizing

09:09.260 --> 09:13.900
they have something in common, right? But take that seriously. They have something in common

09:13.900 --> 09:17.900
by virtue of which they are similar. Here's what they have in common. They're horses.

09:18.940 --> 09:25.340
They exemplify the general kind, horse. And so what you're doing in recognizing that they're

09:25.340 --> 09:30.300
similar and that you can apply the same term to them is that you're recognizing the universal that

09:30.300 --> 09:36.300
is present in all those particular animals. So that's an example of that universal and

09:36.300 --> 09:41.420
a contact with the universal making us making it possible for us to think that general thought.

09:41.420 --> 09:47.420
The same would be true of cats. I see a variety of cats and I think, hey, they have something

09:47.420 --> 09:52.700
in common. They're similar. I'll call them cats. What are they similar in what respect?

09:52.700 --> 10:00.060
They're all cats. They have something in common. This is explicit even in the early dialogues.

10:00.060 --> 10:03.740
In the Lockhees, which we talked about separately, for example, about courage,

10:03.740 --> 10:07.980
Socrates says to Lockhees, I was asking about courage and cowardice in general.

10:07.980 --> 10:12.300
I'll begin with courage and once more ask, what is that common quality,

10:12.300 --> 10:16.380
which is the same in all these cases and which is called courage? Notice he's saying,

10:16.380 --> 10:20.540
I'm looking for the thing they have in common. They're courageous people. They're courageous

10:20.620 --> 10:26.460
actions. What do they have in common? There must be some common quality, some form of courage that

10:26.460 --> 10:31.900
is present in all these courageous people in all these courageous actions. They are considered

10:31.900 --> 10:37.580
similar and we call them all courageous for a reason. It's because they exemplify courage.

10:37.580 --> 10:43.660
Okay, there is some quality they all have in common. So even in the early dialogue, Socrates

10:43.660 --> 10:49.340
is already saying there has to be a universal present here. Tell me about that universal.

10:49.340 --> 10:53.580
Don't tell me about particular cases or instances of courage, like standing and fighting and not

10:53.580 --> 10:58.700
running away. Tell me about the universal. Tell me about that common quality. Universals,

10:58.700 --> 11:03.740
we can find in all sorts of different places and sometimes they are abstract things like

11:03.740 --> 11:09.740
triangularity or redness or kindness or courage. Other times they may be tied in some way to a

11:09.740 --> 11:16.460
particular and that's quite possible. Let's return to the theme of thinking general thoughts.

11:16.460 --> 11:22.700
I see a variety of trees, for example, and I think they are similar in some way. They have

11:22.700 --> 11:27.340
something in common. Now it is not trivial what they have in common by any means. It's a hard

11:27.340 --> 11:31.820
biological question what they have in common and there may be vague boundaries. I may say,

11:31.820 --> 11:36.780
well, is this a bush or a tree? I don't know. In fact, things have started growing in my backyard

11:36.780 --> 11:42.220
and I think I don't know what this is. Is this a weed? Is this a bush? Is this a tree? I let it go

11:42.220 --> 11:47.740
and in several cases it's now a 40 or 50 foot tall tree. It wasn't really planned. It was just

11:47.740 --> 11:52.940
this thing that started growing and well, let's see what it is. But in any case, that's something

11:52.940 --> 11:58.460
that is a hard question, what exactly the nature of this thing is, but to notice they have something

11:58.460 --> 12:04.140
in common is in a way to say, yeah, what is that thing? It is being a tree. It is something like

12:04.140 --> 12:12.220
the universal of being a tree. And we can apply the same principle to other cases. So I see a

12:12.220 --> 12:17.900
bunch of triangles. I think, huh, look at all those. Gee, they seem to have something in common.

12:18.460 --> 12:24.300
And then I think, yes, there is something they have in common. They're all triangles. I recognize

12:24.300 --> 12:29.020
triangularity there and that is what enables me to think of them as triangles.

12:29.660 --> 12:35.740
Here is how Plato puts it. Don't you know that though they make use, they hear people doing

12:35.740 --> 12:40.700
mathematics and specifically geometry, they make use of the visible forms and reason about them.

12:40.700 --> 12:46.700
But they're thinking not of these, instead of the ideals they resemble, not of the figures they draw,

12:46.700 --> 12:52.540
but of the absolute square and absolute diameter and so on. The forms they draw or make and which

12:52.540 --> 12:57.180
have shadows and reflections and water of their own are converted by them into images. But they're

12:57.820 --> 13:02.860
really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind.

13:03.740 --> 13:07.660
Perhaps you've taken a geometry course and you've done things like this.

13:08.300 --> 13:13.260
Somebody has written something on the blackboard. Let's say they've said, consider this triangle

13:17.420 --> 13:19.500
and they've given you some information about it.

13:20.460 --> 13:31.660
And then they say, prove that the triangle ABC, let's say, is a right triangle. In other words,

13:31.660 --> 13:37.660
that this is a right angle. Well, here's one way you might think of it doing it. In fact,

13:37.660 --> 13:41.820
my daughter at one point, when she was first learning geometry, was I showed that this is a

13:41.820 --> 13:46.780
right triangle. She took out a protractor and said, see, it's a right triangle, 90 degrees.

13:46.780 --> 13:52.780
Well, that's not what geometry is about. It's not a question of this particular drawing I just made.

13:52.780 --> 13:57.500
In fact, this is just a representation or an image of what we're really talking about,

13:57.500 --> 14:01.580
a triangle with certain characteristics. And if I look at it carefully, I realize it's actually

14:01.580 --> 14:07.820
a pretty sloppily drawn. For example, these two lines don't even meet. And this one sort of curves

14:07.820 --> 14:12.140
there near the end and here they kind of crisscross. So you might say, well, actually, that's not even

14:12.140 --> 14:17.820
a triangle. It's kind of close to being a triangle. But that shouldn't worry us, right? If the geometry

14:17.820 --> 14:22.380
teacher writes this down and you say, I'm sorry, those two lines don't exactly meet. So it's not

14:22.380 --> 14:27.580
a triangle. That's not an answer. We're not talking about this particular drawing. We're talking about

14:27.580 --> 14:33.180
the abstract form. And so Plato says, if you doubt any of the rest of it, think about what

14:33.180 --> 14:38.140
people are doing in mathematics in geometry, in other areas where they're talking about numbers,

14:38.140 --> 14:44.620
let's say, or sets or functions or any kind of mathematical object. They are talking about

14:44.620 --> 14:50.140
things that are abstract. They're not talking about something that is particular. You know,

14:50.140 --> 14:54.780
if I'm talking about the number two, and I hold up my fingers like this, I'm not talking about

14:54.780 --> 15:00.460
these two fingers in particular. I'm talking about the number two. And the same thing with this

15:00.460 --> 15:05.820
triangle. I'm talking about something abstract, something that isn't just written down, but

15:05.820 --> 15:11.340
instead is that form that can only be seen with the eye of the mind. Now, I think that's

15:11.340 --> 15:16.300
an intriguing phrase, the eye of the mind. We're not talking here about what we see,

15:16.300 --> 15:22.860
the individual people, or trees, or diagrams. We're talking about what we can only see with

15:22.860 --> 15:29.740
the eye of the mind, the general kind, or the general property of being a tree, or being red,

15:29.740 --> 15:35.980
or being a triangle of a certain kind. That's what's really at issue. We're thinking about

15:35.980 --> 15:40.780
universals, in other words, not just particular drawings, or particular plants, or particular

15:40.780 --> 15:46.060
colors, or instances of colored objects, or other things like that. We're not discussing

15:46.060 --> 15:52.140
particulars. We're talking about something that lies behind them. His second argument is based

15:52.140 --> 15:58.140
on regularities. We notice all sorts of regularities in the world, and we do it on the basis of

15:58.140 --> 16:04.700
particulars, but we then abstract from those particulars to universals. It might be that the

16:04.700 --> 16:09.980
world just looks like one thing after another to us, and it's all a jumbled mess, but eventually

16:09.980 --> 16:15.580
we start making sense of it. Maybe we're children who are experiencing a severe thunderstorm for

16:15.580 --> 16:20.620
the first time, lots of lightning, lots of thunder, and to us it's just chaos, lightning,

16:20.620 --> 16:25.820
thunder going on, and it's just scary. But eventually we start noticing a pattern,

16:26.460 --> 16:34.620
and we start thinking, wait, I think I can predict the next bout of thunder. I watch for the

16:34.620 --> 16:41.020
lightning, and so I start realizing, wait, those flashes, that's lightning, those booms, that's

16:41.020 --> 16:46.860
thunder, and hey, the thunder tends to follow the lightning, and so I recognize a regularity

16:46.860 --> 16:52.140
that the lightning tends to produce the thunder, and so suddenly the storm starts having a pattern,

16:52.220 --> 16:57.980
and recognizing that pattern, recognizing those regularities is possible because I can categorize

16:57.980 --> 17:05.500
those flashes as a kind, as being reflections of a certain more universal type of thing,

17:05.500 --> 17:12.700
lightning, and those booms as thunder, and then seeing a general connection between those universals.

17:12.700 --> 17:19.900
So any regularity, any pattern is made possible by those abstract forms, those universals.

17:19.900 --> 17:25.340
The same thing is true of laws. When I formulate a scientific law of any kind, I'm not talking

17:25.340 --> 17:30.700
about this particular electrical circuit, for example, I'm talking about any circuit of that

17:30.700 --> 17:36.860
kind. I'm talking about the universal pattern. If I'm thinking about Newton's laws and focusing on

17:36.860 --> 17:42.380
F equals ma, for example, or looking at a mathematical law like the quadratic formula,

17:42.380 --> 17:47.900
or thinking about something involving the reflection of light, or any other scientific law,

17:47.900 --> 17:53.660
I'm thinking about the general universals here. I'm thinking about the relation between mass and

17:54.220 --> 18:00.140
acceleration and force, for example, and it's not a question of that particular force and that

18:00.140 --> 18:05.420
particular mass. It's not a question of, ah, yes, this chalk and the force I apply to it,

18:05.420 --> 18:11.340
and it's rolling and accelerating away. No, I'm talking about the general kinds here.

18:11.340 --> 18:17.180
I'm talking about something universal, and that's what gives it its universality and necessity.

18:17.180 --> 18:21.740
If it weren't for that, it would just be life being one thing after another,

18:21.740 --> 18:24.620
and the scientists would just say, yeah, a lot of stuff happens, I don't know.

18:25.500 --> 18:31.340
We wouldn't be able to formulate regularities or laws. Communication is the same way.

18:32.220 --> 18:37.020
What makes it possible for me to mean anything with my words, for my thoughts to have meaning,

18:37.020 --> 18:42.860
for me to be able to communicate them to anyone else? Well, at first glance, this is hard, right?

18:42.860 --> 18:47.820
I have some idea, and I'm trying to communicate it to you, but why should I think that's even

18:47.820 --> 18:52.940
possible? Why should I think the words I'm using mean anything at all and will mean anything like

18:52.940 --> 18:58.860
the same thing to you? Well, Plato says, look, without anything universal, I have no reason

18:58.860 --> 19:03.180
to expect that. There are just particular thoughts in my head, particular sounds I make,

19:03.180 --> 19:08.300
particular thoughts then in your head. Who knows? They don't really have anything in common,

19:08.300 --> 19:13.820
so there's no way to talk about communication or meaning or that kind of transfer of knowledge

19:13.820 --> 19:21.020
or information being possible. However, it is possible for two people to mean the same thing,

19:21.020 --> 19:26.940
to think the same thought. Here's a silly example. He said it, meet us here at recess at the monkey

19:26.940 --> 19:34.620
bar. Yeah, well, anyway, it is possible for people to misunderstand. We don't want to rule that out.

19:34.620 --> 19:39.180
Sometimes we latch on to the wrong universal and grasp the wrong meaning, and it can happen even

19:39.180 --> 19:44.540
with me myself. Me, earlier in the day, me later in the day, I might think, oh, I had a thought

19:44.540 --> 19:50.380
about that this morning. What was it? And I might have trouble remembering or maybe I misremember.

19:50.380 --> 19:55.900
So those problems of meaning and communication can happen within me at different times or in

19:55.900 --> 20:01.980
different situations, maybe in one situation. I say something. Does it mean the same thing?

20:01.980 --> 20:06.700
And do I remember it? Does it have the same significance? Can I communicate when I'm in a

20:06.700 --> 20:11.180
different situation? Well, intuitively, we want to say, yeah, there can be problems here, but

20:11.180 --> 20:15.820
overall, yes, I can mean the same thing that I meant this morning. I can remember and think

20:15.820 --> 20:20.700
the same thought I thought this morning. I would think the same thought and give you the same

20:20.700 --> 20:25.900
lecture on Play-Doh, even if it were a different day of the week. And so I might say, look, it

20:25.900 --> 20:29.740
should be independent of all that, or at least it's possible for it to be independent of all that.

20:30.380 --> 20:36.940
But if so, then meaning isn't tied to particular objects. Neither is the possibility of communication.

20:36.940 --> 20:44.060
They depend on something universal. How does that go? Well, I must latch on to universal. If I say

20:44.060 --> 20:50.860
this is a triangle, then what I'm doing is linking not just to this particular diagram I've drawn,

20:50.860 --> 20:57.100
for example, but to triangularity itself. When you understand what I mean and say, oh, yes,

20:57.100 --> 21:03.340
that is a triangle, you are recognizing this as a triangle because you have grasp of the same

21:03.340 --> 21:10.540
universal triangularity. And so if you want to think of it this way, here you are thinking about this.

21:10.540 --> 21:19.820
Here I am. We've got two different thoughts going on here. And both of us are thinking, hey, triangle.

21:21.020 --> 21:25.820
But what enables our thoughts to have that significance? And how do we know that we're

21:25.820 --> 21:32.700
thinking anything in common? Answer is, our thoughts must be connected to something like

21:32.700 --> 21:39.820
this universal of triangularity that ties into the contents of our thought. And without that,

21:39.820 --> 21:45.580
he says, look, just something happens in my mind. Something happens in your mind. We have no reason

21:45.580 --> 21:50.380
to expect them to have anything in common or to tie to anything about this particular diagram.

21:51.020 --> 21:57.180
But if there is a universal, then it's possible for it to not only be present in this individual

21:57.180 --> 22:03.020
diagram, but it's possible for our thoughts to latch onto it. So if it's possible for us to mean

22:03.020 --> 22:07.980
anything at all, to communicate even with ourselves at a different time or a different situation,

22:09.180 --> 22:15.420
not to mention other people, it must be the case that we can latch onto these universals to

22:15.420 --> 22:21.820
something outside my mind or your mind that enables us to think the same thought, to communicate

22:21.820 --> 22:27.740
the same thing, to mean the same thing by our words. If that's not possible, it looks like

22:27.740 --> 22:33.500
meaning and communication aren't possible either. Finally, this explains how we can have

22:34.860 --> 22:41.820
accurate thoughts, how things we say can be true, how they can be objective truths about the world.

22:41.820 --> 22:48.220
It really relates to the diagram that I was just drawing. The triangularity is not only

22:48.220 --> 22:53.180
something that is in some sense present in my thoughts and in your thoughts when we communicate

22:53.180 --> 22:58.780
about it, and both think of this as a triangle. It's there in the diagram itself. That diagram,

22:58.780 --> 23:05.260
as Plato puts it, participates in triangularity. So when I say something true, I'm saying something

23:05.260 --> 23:10.700
that links to a universal that really is there in the world. That particular really is exemplifying

23:10.700 --> 23:17.820
that universal. The diagram here is a diagram of a triangle, and you and I recognize it as a triangle,

23:17.820 --> 23:24.300
and in getting that right, in having veridical thoughts, that is to say, and in having true

23:24.300 --> 23:31.660
statements, this is a triangle, then what's going on here is, well, we are tied into the very form

23:31.660 --> 23:37.980
that is in some sense present in that drawing. This is the relationship sometimes described as

23:37.980 --> 23:46.140
participation or exemplification. That diagram is a triangle. It exhibits triangularity. It

23:46.140 --> 23:52.460
participates in triangularity, and it's that participation, that link between the particular

23:52.460 --> 23:58.220
and the universal that makes it possible for me to have knowledge, makes it possible for you and I

23:58.220 --> 24:03.340
to think the same thought, makes it possible for us to get things right about the world.

24:03.340 --> 24:07.820
Otherwise, I have no reason to think my thoughts have anything to do with the world,

24:07.820 --> 24:13.580
and that anything like accuracy, truth, objectivity are possible. But if those same universals

24:14.140 --> 24:20.780
can be present in my thoughts and in a different sense in the world, then I can explain this.

24:22.060 --> 24:28.620
So Plato's philosophy of mind gives us this picture of the mind as directed in two ways,

24:28.620 --> 24:34.940
toward the object, in particular, through perception, for example, and also toward the form.

24:35.900 --> 24:41.100
The content of my thought is linked to the form, my perception, and that representation in my mind

24:41.100 --> 24:45.980
is linked to the form, but the object is linked to it too. And when they link to the same form,

24:45.980 --> 24:50.860
that's when I've got accuracy. That's when I say something true, it's when my thoughts

24:50.860 --> 24:56.140
are veridical or correct representations of the world. But of course, there is a problem here.

24:57.020 --> 25:01.980
We don't perceive the forms. We don't directly see triangularity, for example,

25:01.980 --> 25:07.020
or humanity. We see particular people in particular triangles. If that's true,

25:07.020 --> 25:12.140
how do we know anything about them? Aristotle's answer is we abstract the universals and our

25:12.140 --> 25:17.500
knowledge of universals from the particulars. But Plato says that won't do at all. I recognize that

25:17.500 --> 25:23.100
as a triangle because I already understand triangularity. I can't in some way see a bunch

25:23.100 --> 25:27.260
of triangles and then abstract the idea of triangularity. I've got to first recognize

25:27.260 --> 25:33.500
they have something in common, namely being triangles. So he gives us two answers in different

25:33.500 --> 25:39.340
dialogues. One answer is I recall it. And he tells us a sort of beautiful mythical story

25:39.340 --> 25:43.420
about the soul being in contact with the realm of forms before we were even born.

25:44.860 --> 25:49.100
We forget about that at birth, but we can be reminded by contact with particulars.

25:49.580 --> 25:56.220
The other story is about the form of the good. He ends up saying that I am impelled toward the good

25:57.660 --> 26:03.420
by, well, what exactly? I'm not sure, but in some way the form of the good

26:03.420 --> 26:10.060
illumines the entire realm of forms for me. And so once that happens, the good somehow shines a

26:10.060 --> 26:16.140
light on my mind and makes it possible for me to recognize these forms through recollection,

26:16.220 --> 26:19.100
or in some other way with what he calls the eye of the mind.

26:20.940 --> 26:28.700
Now, is that a plausible account? Well, maybe. There is a problem here. We seem to be limited

26:28.700 --> 26:34.300
in our causal contact to the realm of the senses. So how is it possible for us to have

26:34.300 --> 26:38.940
knowledge of something that lies beyond the senses of this realm of universals of forms

26:38.940 --> 26:44.460
that are not directly present to the senses? It looks as if I can't make sense of the world

26:44.460 --> 26:48.620
and my own thinking about the world and my own communicating about it, unless I assume there are

26:48.620 --> 26:53.980
such universals. But how do I know anything about them? How does that solve the problem exactly?

26:53.980 --> 26:59.340
Surely then I must have some special faculty of knowledge. So it looks as if Plato has to

26:59.340 --> 27:05.820
postulate some special faculty of knowledge, saying I really do have not only my physical eyes

27:05.820 --> 27:10.460
that can perceive things through the senses, I have something like an eye of the mind

27:10.540 --> 27:17.020
that can think about triangularity or humanity or being a tree or something else that is strictly

27:17.020 --> 27:24.140
universal and not directly tied to particular objects. In fact, I can then make up new universals

27:24.140 --> 27:28.860
that I've never seen exemplified in a particular once I've mastered a certain number of these

27:28.860 --> 27:35.020
universals. But how is that possible? That becomes a difficult philosophical question

27:35.020 --> 27:43.580
and occupies plateness for centuries to come.
