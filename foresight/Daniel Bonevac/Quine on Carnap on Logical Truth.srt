1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, how was your spring break?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Too short.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Too short? Yeah, I know, I sympathize with that.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's especially cool to come in here and find Spanish written up there.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It says, how long was your vacation? Did you have a good time? I was like, eh, too short.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But now, the reason I raised the question is not just to be friendly,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but also to make the point that there are a number of ways in which you might answer.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, yeah, did you have a good spring break?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I said, yeah, you know.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Or you could say, no, bad things happened, right?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Went to Port Aransas, got hopelessly drunk up by mosquitoes and what do they call those things?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Portuguese men of war.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, anyway, whatever.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The point is, could you ever say, oh, yes and no?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Alright, yeah, you could, right?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Aren't there times where you could answer a question?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Somebody raises a question like, how was your spring break?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And your answer is something like, well, yeah, yes and no.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, what are some examples of that?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Other than, how was your spring break?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Did you sleep well last night?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good, did you sleep well last night?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, yes and no.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, what would that mean if you said yes and no?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, yes in one way, no in another way.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ah, yes in one way and no in another way.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, that's one way we can interpret this.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes in one way, right?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No in another way.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, with the sleeping business, for example, what would it mean to say, yeah, did you sleep well last night?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes and no, yes in one way.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What's that way?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Suppose I follow up and I say, well, in what way did you sleep well?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Didn't wake up all night.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Didn't wake up, okay.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But is that in what way?

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Not.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bad dreams.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bad dreams, okay, good.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, there would say, well, you're not denying the law of non-contradiction, right?

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There is a logical truth.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In fact, in some ways you might say it seems like the most basic logical truth, non-contradiction.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And so, we could formalize that as, you know, not, both P and not P.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And at first glance, answering a question with yes and no sounds like a violation of non-contradiction.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It sounds as if you're saying, oh, you know, the proposition I slept well last night is both true and false.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And yet you might say, no, that's not really what you're saying.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're saying in one way it's true and in another way it's false.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, I slept well in the sense that I didn't wake up.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I slept poorly in the sense that I had a lot of bad dreams.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are there other sentences you might respond to with a yes and no part answer?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you married?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are you married?

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ooh, yes and no.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, that sounds like a logical contradiction.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, what might you mean if you say yes and no to, are you married?

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you're a sailor and you're married to the sea.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, if you're a sailor and married to the sea, maybe if you're a nun and married to God,

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
where there's some special sense in which you're married but not the most obvious sense,

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
why don't you think of some other way in which somebody might respond that way?

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
An open marriage.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, maybe an open marriage.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, are you married?

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, yes and no.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, that could be the sleazy yes or no.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, I suppose somebody who's separated might respond that way to say, you know,

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
where it really means yes technically but not for very much longer.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Could there be another kind of response or another way in which you'd respond that way

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and that means something?

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's see.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can hear a terrible spouse that cheats a lot.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, yeah, are you married?

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes and no.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, yes, but I act as a woman.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, actually yesterday, the revised common lectionary reading was this passage from the New Testament

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in which Jesus talks to a woman at the well and shake this well.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And he says, well, go get your husband.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And she says, I have no husband.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And he says, oh, you speak truly when you say you have no husband.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You've had five husbands and a current guy is not your husband.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And so you could imagine him asking this question, so he married.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And the answer is sort of, well, yes and no, kind of common law marriage but non-physically married, that type of thing.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So anyway, part of the reason I mentioned these is some of these fit in one way in another way category, right?

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But others refer to maybe different senses of the question.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you married, let's say, is the question.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And it seems like there, it's like, ah, married, what do you mean married?

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you including things as broad as being married to the sea or being married to God?

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Are you including common law marriage or just official marriage?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Are you referring to somebody who actually accepts the normal behavioral norms of marriage or not?

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And so on and so forth.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So there might be all sorts of ambiguities around the word.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so in that case, you'd say, well, it's not so much that proposition being true in one way and false in another way.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It might be just their different propositions being expressed there and you're sort of noting the ambiguity.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And the yes and no is to say, well, you know, if you mean this by your words, then the answer is yes.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you mean that, it's no.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So we've now seen two ways.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There can be this sort of variance in ways or respects or something like that.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then there can be this question of an ambiguity where we end up saying, well, really there are different senses, maybe, of the terms being used.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Different senses of what you've asked or of a proposition.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Are there any other occasions where we might be tempted to say that the law of non-contradiction fails?

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That is to say, somebody seems to assert both P and not P.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, like time.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Like if we go back to the question, did you sleep well last night?

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You could say, yeah, up till 2 a.m. and then no afterwards.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you can say yes or no.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, very good.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So it could be yes and no.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, for a while, but then I woke up really early.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And so there could be a variation, not only in these ways, but in time.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So was it warm winter?

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, yes, for much of the time, but not so much in the third week of March.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Friends in New England and Canada who have been sending me these photographs of three-foot snowdrifts

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
have been complaining about waking up at minus 29 degrees Fahrenheit.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Meanwhile, here it's 80 degrees and I send them pictures of a sunny field.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is for the time of Texas.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But in any case, yeah, it could be differences in time.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right?

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are there other sorts of ways in which you might be willing to say P and not P?

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, let's frame it slightly different.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because the law of non-contradiction says, well, this is a logical truth.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It is not the case that P and not P for any P, really.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, you know, it's just not the case that it's both raining and not raining.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Incidentally, that might be a good example.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Could you ever answer, is it raining outside with yes and no?

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Or a similar case.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Are these walls green?

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right?

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, that identifies another of these.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are cases of just rains where we end up saying, look, when would I say yes and no to?

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Is it raining?

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I don't mean time differences or I'm not claiming that this question about rain is ambiguous.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm not saying, well, one way it's raining and another respect it's not raining.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I really mean it's sort of rain.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right?

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes and no.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's kind of raining.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's like misting something like that where, yeah, drive around and your windshield will

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
get wet, but you don't really have the sense that it's raining and that kind of thing.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, they're going to be faintness.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We're like, are these walls gray?

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are these walls green?

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You might say, oh, yes and no.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Where you really need to sort of kind of, kind of on the borderline of that.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So, all of those are ways of saying something that looks like this but isn't really denying

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
a truth of logic, right?

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Isn't really, because we'd right away say, well, what I mean to say is it's sort of raining

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
or here, yeah, I slept well in one way but not in another way or here, well, married

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in the technical legal sense, no, but common law married, yes, or here, you know, slept

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
well up to 2 a.m. and then after that, not.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And so, there's no real contradiction being asserted.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What about in a question like, is light continuous?

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, is light continuous?

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Good.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So, that seems to actually be yes and no.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, right.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Say a little more about that.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Can we assimilate it to one of these cases or is that a separate case?

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's, I'm not an expert in thinking, but from what I know, it seems to be a separate

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
case that light is both a particle in a way, so continuous and not continuous.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, okay, good.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a case where you look at some things that are characteristics of this one class

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and it has those characteristics.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You look at this, the characteristics of this other contrary class or you would have felt

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
contrary class and it has those characteristics too and you end up saying, wait a minute,

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
there's something very weird going on there.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, there's one case and I'll just sort of refer to it as the case of quantum mechanics

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
because it's hard to characterize exactly what's happening with light or with various

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
other kinds of phenomena that occur in quantum mechanics, but those are cases where you might

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
say, actually, I don't know how to describe this, right?

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't know if this violates the laws of logic or not.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Some people would propose a separate quantum logic that handles these kinds of cases.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And so, one thing we should note in thinking about what Kwan is arguing with Karnab about

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
really is to think about some of these alternative logics and think, where do people actually

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
disagree about the logic?

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You might think that all these kinds of things aren't really reflecting logical differences.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Maybe this one does because if you think, wait, light is continuous and it's not continuous,

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that seems to be a real direct denial of this in the sense that all these aren't.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Or at least it has that appearance of first glance and then you really have to get into the details

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of the theory to understand what's being claimed and whether it's a real violation.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, there might be others.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What about paradoxical sentences like this sentence is false?

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You might think, well, suppose it's true.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It says it's false, so it's false.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Suppose it's false.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It says it's false, so it's true.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So it's both true and false.

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But if it's both true and false, it says it's false.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's true.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But that's okay.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
As I said, it was both true and false.

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So maybe paradoxes are a case where you've got a real instance.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now, most people have said, no, wait a minute.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
A paradoxical sentence like this sentence is false.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There's something deviant about it.

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There's something wrong with it.

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I want to exclude it from consideration.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But notice we can't really say, well, what I meant to say was false yesterday, but it's true today.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or what I really mean is, well, it's false, where that has several different senses.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Or it's true in one way and false in another.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, it doesn't fit any of those cases, right?

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So that too might be something that is a deeper challenge to this.

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All right.

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, quite in this paper.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And by the way, it's a difficult paper.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I had forgotten how difficult it was until I started reading it.

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I don't know if you actually made your way through it or if you did how much you were able to follow.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And it's no, don't feel bad if you either didn't read it at all or didn't get very far.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Or went through it and didn't feel like you understood much because he's assuming a lot of background in this paper.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But let's start with what Carnap is actually claiming that Quine is objected to.

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I want to have this in the background because I wanted us to think about what a logical disagreement would actually be

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and how we might begin to think about.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I wanted some cases on that tape.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, let's think about Carnap's basic scheme.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He develops this initially in the logical structure of the world, then in the logical syntax of language,

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
then in a series of papers and books in the 40s.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And by the time Carnap is right, sorry, by the time Quine is criticized,

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Carnap has a view that is still a version, although it's not exactly the same as the early version, of logical empiricism.

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So what does that really mean?

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It means there is a sharp distinction between the analytic and the syntax.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And we might phrase the question that he's dealing with you as,

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
what is the ground?

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What is the source?

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What is the nature of truth?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Where does truth come from?

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What makes sentences true?

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Now, depending on which of those you focus on, you're going to be led to maybe a different kind of theory.

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But for the moment, let's don't worry about that.

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What makes things true?

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The answer is roughly, well, there's this distinction between the analytic and the synthetic.

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And the analytic includes both logic and then truths by definition.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And what makes them true?

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, the idea is, in the end, the synthetic truths, they're made true by the word.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And in particular, we come to know them by our experience of the world.

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So here we can say, look, the ultimate ground of this is the world.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And moreover, we know it by virtue of our experience of the world.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So there's both the metaphysical question of what makes it so,

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and then the epistemological question of how we know that.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But what about these cases?

239
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What makes a truth of logic true?

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What makes it true that it's never the case that both be anonymous?

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, here's Karnab's answer.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's, in the end, convention.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's linguistic convention.

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So what makes it true here is really language, in the sense that all bachelors are bachelors.

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's just true by virtue of the meanings of the term all and are.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We don't even need the meaning of bachelors there.

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And we come to know that by knowing how to use our language.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But what's the ultimate source, you might say, of those linguistic truths?

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, we operate with a certain set of conventions.

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And so we've got a set of conventions about how we're going to use certain terms.

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And the same is really true of definition.

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's a question of language.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And that's a matter of adapting to certain linguistic conventions.

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So, Karnab's idea is some truths are made true of the world.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And we find out about them through experience.

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Others are made true by our own linguistic conventions.

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And we find out about them by learning our language.

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, that's all.

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So something like this.

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, we don't actually have to know what p is here.

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
All we have to know is the meaning of not and the meaning of a hand.

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And we're good, okay?

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That would require some empirical experience in a way.

264
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ah, here's the objection.

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That would require some empirical experience.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Now, what kind of empirical experience?

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Karnab's response is, well, yes, in the sense that you have to learn the language.

268
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You have to learn what linguistic conventions we adopt.

269
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that is a matter of experience.

270
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We have to learn languages somehow.

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We're not just born learning and knowing these languages.

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And we have to learn all sorts of conventions about the use of language.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So some of them are things that might be involved in the meaning of logical terms like not and and.

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Others might be involved in learning the meanings of terms like bachelor.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Some are matters of linguistic convention or social convention that go beyond this.

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like, I don't know, bumping into someone and saying, oh, excuse me, or I'm sorry.

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And that type of thing.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And indeed, that's the kind of thing that can vary a lot culturally, right?

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I mean, you meet somebody for the first time, what do you do?

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Like, oh, you know, we're just meeting, so what do I say?

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hello, or how do you do?

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Or, you know, nice to meet you or something like that, right?

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It would be weird if somebody said something else, right?

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know, have you read Karnab?

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Now, it could be that that works, right?

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A bunch of philosophers are standing around a meeting in the American Philosophical Association,

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and they're all talking about Karnab, and then some new person comes over and say, hey, have you read Karnab?

288
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And so, you know, it's not necessarily weird, though.

289
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It requires a special social setting.

290
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If somebody just shows up at a party and is introducing their spouse and just says, you know, you say, oh, have you read Karnab?

291
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That would be a reason out of the blue.

292
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Anyway, we learn these kinds of conventions through experience,

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
but Karnab's idea is that once we've learned those, once we've learned to speak the language and learned those linguistic conventions,

294
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
then we know that a bunch of things are true or false.

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So, all I need is to have learned these conventions, the conventions governing God,

296
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and then I can say, okay, good.

297
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now I know that if somebody says P and not P, or answers a question with yes and no, I have to reinterpret, okay,

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
because it sounds like they're denying truths of logic.

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And indeed, this goes along with his question about the issue anthropologically of whether there could be pre-logical people.

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Levy Brewell and some others have claimed that certain tribes are pre-logical.

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They go and translate the language and they're constantly saying things like yes and no, or like P and not P.

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And so Levy Brewell said yes, logic is a sort of cultural achievement and there are pre-logical peoples.

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And Kwan is making fun of the idea, saying, in the end that doesn't.

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that.

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Really, Karnab, in a sense, makes fun of that idea because he says, well, they're there to translate the native speech

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and they're going around saying P, I think in his example, it's P, Ka, Bu, P, and you translate that as and not.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If they go around saying that, how could you possibly be translating that as and not?

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's bad translation, okay, because it's great evidence that this word doesn't mean not or doesn't mean and if people go around saying P and not P.

309
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now, that said, the idea here, the background plot is where does truth come from and where does our knowledge of the truth come from?

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Entirely from the world and from our experience of the world or from our linguistic conventions.

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So all truth is either empirical truth about the world or it's merely verbal truth.

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's something that we, as a word, make up.

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So, you could think, the realist says, you know, the world is independent of our thoughts.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The anti-realist says, no, it's not.

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And Karnab's saying, well, this part really sort of is, but this part is not.

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This part is something that is really governed by our own convention, our own ways of conceptualizing.

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
How much of language would Karnab say you have to learn empirically?

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Because it seems like if you've learned A language, you could learn another language without any empirical basis purely from the first language, like translation.

319
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Alright, that's a great question.

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How much of a language do you actually have to have learned in order for this sort of thing to kick in?

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We're going to see later some people who think that in order to really understand a concept, you have to understand all concepts.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And that implies you don't know the language until you know it completely.

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But that seems absurd.

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like, nobody knows English completely.

325
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There are 500,000 words of English.

326
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Nobody knows all of them.

327
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You might think, I'll read the Oxford English Dictionary in all, you know, in volumes and I'll know them all.

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, no, you won't remember that many.

329
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Your vocabulary can't possibly be that big.

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And so you might think, well, look, if the answer is we have to learn the entire language, that seems unreasonable, how much do we have to learn?

331
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And in particular, how much would we have to learn to actually understand the truth, like the law of non-construction?

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Here is part of the challenge that Kwan has raised.

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He's saying, well, look, in order to make sense of this notion, we have to be able to distinguish these truths.

334
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And two dogmas is a paper about how it's impossible to draw that distinction.

335
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But suppose we neglect that and just focus on the logical part.

336
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The idea is supposed to be that we can draw this distinction and that the definitional truths ultimately reduce to these logical truths once we replace definitions with the terms being defined.

337
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And so in the end, it comes back to this.

338
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But really, now, what part of the language would we have to understand from that?

339
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, I suppose I say it's not true that it's both raining and not raining.

340
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't really have to know what it means to say it is raining.

341
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I have to understand and not.

342
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So the thought is there's a certain logical vocabulary.

343
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And all that I really need for logical truth is that logical vocabulary.

344
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now then, later, to learn that bachelors are unmarried, for example, I actually have to learn the term bachelor.

345
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But for the logical part, all I would really have to master is this logical vocabulary.

346
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Now, in a sense, quite and quite I have to agree about what that is.

347
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, more or less anyway.

348
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You know, it's things like not and or if, what else?

349
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Some, all, is.

350
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But now we can ask what distinguishes those things?

351
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What makes those different from terms like bachelors or light or married or raining or sleep, et cetera, et cetera?

352
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We think we have lots, right?

353
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Or we teach a theory of these words.

354
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You might think, well, I want to take a class in the logic of sleep.

355
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I want to know the logic of sleeping.

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We don't do that, right?

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We don't think of that as part of logic.

358
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But how do we distinguish the logical vocabulary from the last one?

359
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, there's going to be affirmations.

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Some of them seem to be affirmations of what is denoted or what is stated.

361
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:16,000
For example, it's really, it seems to be more like declarations or, I don't know, it's like linking various singles together

362
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
or confirming it and declaring it or disaffirming it.

363
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Ah, okay, yes.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Affirming or disaffirming, denying something?

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, maybe it's not too far from what you're saying to think.

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
These are structural.

367
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They're laying out a certain form if you think about the form of a statement.

368
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So one way of thinking about this is, aha, these are formal in the sense they have to do with form.

369
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
They have to do with the form of what you're saying as opposed to the content.

370
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So if you say all bachelors are bachelors, you have to know bachelor in order to understand the real content of that.

371
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But the form is revealed just by the R, right?

372
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Bachelors are bachelors.

373
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You know the form is just A's or A's.

374
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And that's something that you might think relates to form.

375
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And what you mean by that could be spelled out in all sorts of ways.

376
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But the thought is it has something to do with the structure of thought as opposed to its content.

377
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So that might be one way of thinking about this.

378
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
As you put it, linking various things with content together,

379
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
it's the sort of links among content terms that are really revealed by the logical vocabulary.

380
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Can you think of any other ways of trying to characterize what's different about those words?

381
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And what makes us do logic of war for some in a way that we don't do logic of rain or sleep?

382
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, seems harder to reduce those.

383
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like, I know there's a logic where you do it all with like two connectives,

384
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
but at a certain point it gets harder to reduce them as opposed to married.

385
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You can kind of spell out what that means with other words.

386
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Ah, well, okay, yes.

387
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You might think that, look, in the end definitions, things like married, bachelor, rain, etc.

388
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
All of that you could ultimately explain.

389
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But finally, you've got to get back to starting points, right?

390
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And you might think that logic represents the ultimate starting points in some sense.

391
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That everything else comes down to love.

392
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
They're not empirical claims of the world.

393
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Like, life consists of particles that preserve the claim of the world.

394
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But you might think that in the end, take out the world, knowledge, take out all this many definitions as you can.

395
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You get led back to certain axioms.

396
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And so that would be another way of thinking about this.

397
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
The question of sort of the ultimate axioms, the ultimate starting points.

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Once we've abstracted away from world knowledge, once we've abstracted away from the meanings of specific terms that we can define,

399
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
we ultimately get back to these basics we just can't define.

400
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And maybe you think logic is that theory of those basics, indivisible things.

401
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So it might be a question of ultimate axioms, or it might be a question of ultimate indivisibles, something like that.

402
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And when you see Bertrand Russell getting so excited with Scheffer's discovery that NAND, or NOR,

403
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
are themselves connectives that would allow you to define all the other sentential connectives,

404
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you could think, yeah, why would this be exciting?

405
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
From this point of view, not really about exciting at all, but from this point of view, very exciting.

406
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That you think, ah, got an ultimate symbol now.

407
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Are there other ways of thinking about this book?

408
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Oh, yeah, I'm getting to the bottom of the board, so some of you can't see it.

409
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I've only been teaching for 37 years to realize nobody can see anything below about here on the blackboard.

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Which is especially strange, because as a student, I always sat in the back.

411
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I was just the kind of person who always gravitated to the far corner of the room.

412
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I don't know why.

413
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
See, in this class, there's no point to me, because there's like no reason.

414
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, here's the way some people have tried to do it.

415
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
They've said logic is topic neutral.

416
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So let's say, I ask you, is it raining, and you say yes and no.

417
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What are we talking about?

418
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The weather. This isn't supposed to be our question.

419
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Hard question.

420
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Suppose I ask, so did you sleep well last night?

421
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
We're asking about your sleeping, right?

422
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And so on and so forth.

423
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The walls, green, we're asking about the color of the walls.

424
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
However, and indeed, green, gray, married, unmarried, raining, sleep,

425
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
all of those things have to do with certain topics.

426
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But if I say, ah, I couldn't catch much of their conversation, they were too far away,

427
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but I heard and used the term, and, what were they talking about?

428
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Right? I can't say.

429
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I can use these things all over the place.

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They are topic neutral.

431
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
They're sort of universal things.

432
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Think about playing cards that you might have, and, you know, in some sort of role-playing game,

433
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
this card is only useful in this very rare situation.

434
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Hey, this one's useful all the time.

435
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Okay?

436
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Money is sort of like this.

437
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The economy, money's useful all the time.

438
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So it's topic neutral, you might say.

439
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And a lot of people have tried to define the logical vocabulary that way.

440
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Now, here is why Quine thinks all of this becomes really critical,

441
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and why it's important to distinguish logic from other things,

442
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
partly to just make sense of this claim that logic is true by convention,

443
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
but partly also, well, to distinguish logic from mathematics.

444
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
What's the difference between logic and math?

445
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
In the end, Quine says, it's one thing.

446
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's the vocabulary of membership.

447
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's all you have to add to logic to get set theory.

448
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay?

449
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Or to get the vocabulary of set theory, I should say.

450
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So, in a sense, he's concerned with this distinction between logic and set theory,

451
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
which introduces that, and set theory gives you the entire rest of mathematics.

452
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
He thinks that's what Russell and Whitehead and Fraga show.

453
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And so, in the end, it's really just logic plus this that gives you math,

454
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but logic seems to be what you get if you don't have the membership relation.

455
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But now, how can we say that?

456
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because, after all, isn't this topic neutral?

457
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Doesn't it reflect some sort of ultimate axiom?

458
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
In a way, that's what you do when you axiomize all of math in terms of set theory.

459
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And then he takes card after we've shown in the logical structure of the world

460
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that actually, with logic and set theory, I can now reproduce all of our language about the world,

461
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
not in the sense of getting the troops out, but being able to say what we want to say.

462
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So, in the end, why do we say set theory, or why does Quine say set theory is not logic?

463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What's the difference between logic and set theory?

464
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, this is a place where I think this paper gets hard to understand.

465
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So, let's take a look at how he actually tries to structure this argument,

466
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
because the way the paper proceeds is sometimes confusing.

467
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He grants, for example, that sheer verbal usage is, in general, a major determinant of truth.

468
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And so, for example, Brutus killed Caesar.

469
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, the Ides of March have just passed.

470
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Too bad I am.

471
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Too bad we were up for spring break and couldn't do this on the 15th.

472
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But you might say, look, yeah, you have to know what Brutus and Caesar refer to,

473
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and you have to know what killed means in order to assess the truth of that.

474
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But you also have to know something about the world.

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So, it's not as if here it's just the world, just experience.

476
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's really all of that, plus the conventions.

477
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You need to know the conventions to know what's even being asserted before you can claim to know anything.

478
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And the truth of a proposition like Brutus killed Caesar depends on the linguistic conventions

479
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
about meaning and reference, as well as on the truth of the world.

480
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So, that's an important point.

481
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But now, when we get to the key bit of the argument, we could say, well, yeah,

482
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I thought it would be easy to appeal to my underlinings to make the structure of the argument clear.

483
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Now that I look at them, it seems more difficult.

484
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But, okay, here's one way we might try to characterize the distinction.

485
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Every truth of elementary logic is obvious, or can be made so by some series of individually obvious steps.

486
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Set theory in its present state anyway as other theories.

487
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, here we can say, yeah, in the end this gives amounts to a series of obvious steps.

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Here, not so, okay?

489
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Not obvious, not reducible to obvious steps.

490
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Now, why does he say this, by the way?

491
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,000
What in set theory is not obvious?

492
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Actually, who studied set theory here?

493
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Some of you.

494
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There are several things that are bothering you, I think.

495
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Frege's way of approaching all of this.

496
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
In a certain sense, tried to reduce everything to the obvious axiom of abstraction, comprehension,

497
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
that just said, look, give me a predicate, and I can create the set of things that that predicate is true of.

498
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay?

499
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And then you get things like, is not an element of itself.

500
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It all blows up in Russell's paradox.

501
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So, you can't do the simple thing.

502
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
At that point, people attempt various non-simple things in set theory.

503
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And we've talked a little bit about the most common way of doing this.

504
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You end up with a bunch of different axioms.

505
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
One of which actually is an axiom of extensionality that says two sets are identical if and only if they have the same members.

506
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Is that obvious?

507
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, in a certain sense, you could say that does seem characteristic of a convention about what we mean by set.

508
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's what makes a set different from a property.

509
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Two properties can be different, even though they apply to exactly the same things,

510
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
by creature with a heart and creature with a kidney.

511
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But two sets are identical if and only if they have the same members.

512
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So that, when you might argue, is a question of convention.

513
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It seems obvious once you understand what we mean by set.

514
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But now, what about, well, I've used this example before, the axiom of infinity.

515
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
There is an infinite set.

516
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That doesn't seem obvious.

517
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Hey, there is this infinite object.

518
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There is this infinite set.

519
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Why?

520
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That doesn't seem obvious in the way that other things in logic seem obvious.

521
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Or what about this one?

522
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
A restricted axiom of comprehension that says, essentially, well given a predicate and a previously existing set,

523
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
that I can talk about all the members of that previously existing set that satisfy the predicate.

524
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So I'm always doing that sort of defining of the set within a background set.

525
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You might think that's even more obvious than the original axiom of abstraction since it follows from it.

526
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But actually, it feels like that's weird, right?

527
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
All of a sudden, it's now complicated.

528
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And you might think, wait, why that?

529
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But it's worse.

530
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I now have to have axioms that say there are such things as pair sets.

531
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So given an x and a y, I can form the set that contains just x and y.

532
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And I have to have a power set axiom that says I can take the set of all subsets, begin the set.

533
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And why do I have to do that?

534
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Because those are things that aren't contained within some previously existing set.

535
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So all of those have to be introduced as separate axioms.

536
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Are they obvious?

537
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And then eventually, people introduce an axiom of foundations that says, essentially, that there are no infinite descending epsilon chains.

538
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That if I have a set, I can ultimately trace it back to atoms.

539
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's never like, oh, well, the set contains the subset, which contains the subset, which contains the subset, and so on, now, infinitely.

540
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That is also going to imply that I don't have any loops.

541
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So it's never the case that A belongs to B and B belongs to A.

542
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That doesn't seem obvious, right?

543
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And so a lot of these things end up seeming not obvious at all.

544
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Now, for those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about,

545
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I hope I've said at least enough obscure stuff to convince you that these things aren't obvious.

546
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
For those of you who know enough set theory, you can sort of say, OK, yeah, it does feel like there's a difference among the axioms of set theory.

547
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Some feel pretty obvious, and some don't feel very obvious.

548
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Some, I would have thought were obvious until you told me that, I mean, great danger of running into paradoxes, and now I'm afraid of everything.

549
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So in short, there's that kind of difference between logic and set theory.

550
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Is there any other kind of difference?

551
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, here is a key part to Klein's argument.

552
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
He says, let's consider a logical truth, like everything is self-identical.

553
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Everything is what it is, and not another thing, as Richard Butler once said.

554
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We can say that it depends on the truth, fourth truth, on traits of a language,

555
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
specifically on the identity statement, is, and not on traits of its subject matter.

556
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But we can also say alternatively that it depends on an obvious trait, namely self-identity in its subject matter, namely everything.

557
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The tendency of our present reflections is there is no difference.

558
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
In the end, he says there is no difference between the two pseudo-nauthorians of saying these things are truths about the world

559
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and the claim that these are truths by linguistic convention.

560
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So in a certain sense, he's willing to say, look, there is a distinction here, but it's not the right distinction.

561
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's not the distinction between things that are true by convention and things that are true in some other way.

562
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And if we get the line between that and that physics, that too is not a line.

563
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We can distinguish it in the same sort of way.

564
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Now, why not?

565
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Well, here's part of the reasoning.

566
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We want to say in the end, look, it's us that are responsible for these truths.

567
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They come from our linguistic conventions.

568
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
These things, it's a question of the world.

569
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But Kauai says, now, wait a minute.

570
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Take a look at this.

571
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Is it really just a question of the meanings of not an ant?

572
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Or is it a matter that the world doesn't contain contradictions?

573
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Similarly, with the law of self-identity.

574
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Let's take that as an example, a second example of a logical law.

575
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Self-identity.

576
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So basically, for all x, x equals x.

577
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Is that something that is giving us a truth about the world?

578
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Or is that something that's just true by virtue of the meaning of identity?

579
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He says, I don't know how to tell the difference between those two claims.

580
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
There's no real difference.

581
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
How would you decide?

582
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Here is some of Kauai's underlying logical empiricism coming out.

583
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
He's rejecting a huge amount of a logical empiricist tradition.

584
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But in this respect, he's still in the spirit of it.

585
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He's still saying, what's the difference between the doctrine

586
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
that these things are true by virtue of the way the world is

587
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and the view that they're true by virtue of the meanings of the terms?

588
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Is there any way we can tell which of those it is?

589
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Define a world.

590
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
My world.

591
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, good.

592
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
If I include my linguistic conventions in the world,

593
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
then it looks as if, that's a really good point, right?

594
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Linguists, amazingly enough, think that they're empirical scientists, right?

595
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because they're looking at the world, namely the linguistic conventions.

596
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And that's part of the world.

597
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And it would be very strange to say to the linguist,

598
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
oh, everything you're doing is a priori.

599
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Although, actually, it often has that favor.

600
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I mean, increasingly linguists do actually study corpus' bodies of text.

601
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But for many, many years, linguists didn't do that.

602
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
They just sat around and thought about what was grammatical and what followed from London.

603
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Empirical research consisted of Nick Asher running down the hallway in Wagner Hall,

604
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
saying, Daniel, what do you think of this argument?

605
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I said, oh, it sounds good to me.

606
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That was empirical research.

607
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Now, people really do more of an empirical investigation of the way people use language.

608
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But still, you might say, in the end, what's true or false in linguistics is a matter of convention.

609
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So anyway, it's a good question.

610
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What do we mean by the world and how do we distinguish the conventions from it?

611
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The picture in Cardab is, aha, there's me, really, but all of us together.

612
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We have these conventions we agree upon about the meanings of terms.

613
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That sets a certain framework.

614
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And then we go investigate the world, and we find out certain things,

615
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and we find out what's true and false in this language we've created

616
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
beyond the merely logical truths that were sort of established by the framework itself.

617
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So one way of thinking about the distinction in Cardab is that there are certain things.

618
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And this will help lead us into next time.

619
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We're establishing a certain framework for understanding the world.

620
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It is, in part, a linguistic framework.

621
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
We can think of it more broadly as a conceptual framework.

622
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We're crafting this framework to understand the world.

623
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And part of it is a matter of sort of defining the framework, understanding what this framework is,

624
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and then investigating the world using the framework.

625
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Quine is basically saying, look, that's the wrong picture.

626
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We come up with a framework as we investigate the world.

627
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's not as if we agree upon a language or agree upon this logical structure or these meanings,

628
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and then we go find out what's true in the world.

629
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's rather that we're crafting our language, changing our language, expanding our concepts,

630
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
redefining our logic, maybe coming up with new things in mathematics and so forth,

631
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
all in an attempt to understand the world broadly speaking, including our linguistic behavior.

632
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And as we do that, we come up with certain things.

633
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
We adapt by adding certain claims.

634
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But now, if you say, well, wait a minute, what are the basic things?

635
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What are the ultimate axioms or indefinables?

636
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
He'll say, well, it's a good question, and you can identify axioms in geometry and other views.

637
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But it's sort of arbitrary.

638
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's not like there are certain things that are just intrinsically axioms.

639
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You can axiomatize things in all sorts of ways.

640
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Formal structure, how do I decide what's the form and what's the content?

641
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's an old distinction going back at least to Aristotle.

642
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But I think quiet is challenging in a way, and saying, look, in the end, what I say has a certain content.

643
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What is its form as opposed to the content?

644
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It's a theoretical question, and I can get far in logic or in mathematics by thinking about form in this way.

645
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But in doing that, I'm giving you a theory about my linguistic behavior.

646
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And it's not separate from my theories about the world.

647
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The same thing is true if I think about topic neutrality.

648
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
In talking about the world, I'm going to use certain terms much more often than other terms.

649
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And so it is going to include things like not and or if some all is.

650
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, what are some other really common things that would come up in language?

651
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Let's say we're doing a word count frequency on a big database.

652
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Okay, good. There are going to be lots of things that are really common.

653
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What else?

654
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And indeed, those do feel logical, right?

655
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Hence the theory of indefinite descriptions.

656
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Ah, good.

657
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's going to be really common.

658
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We have is.

659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Another variance of the verb to be will be there.

660
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But what are some other really common words?

661
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You can often tell in a language because they're really short words.

662
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But.

663
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, possessive. Yeah, possessive like so and so's, right?

664
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The apostrophe s, let's say, or but or on.

665
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What are some others?

666
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Does, does, doesn't.

667
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Does. Oh, yeah, does.

668
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Right, right.

669
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
No.

670
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
No. Good.

671
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Now, notice some of those feel logical, like no, but, ah, da,

672
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
but others too on other simple prepositions.

673
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We don't have a logical on, right?

674
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
We don't have a logical to at least the way we ordinarily think of it.

675
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And yet I can use those prepositions in a way that seems pretty topic neutral.

676
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I can say, oh, he was talking about, about would be another good book, right?

677
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We were talking about this or that was about this or, you know, this,

678
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
the book was on the table.

679
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
The top was on quantum mechanics, et cetera, et cetera.

680
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So a lot of these feel pretty topic neutral too.

681
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So in short, Quine is saying, actually, when we think about this framework,

682
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
it's not going to be that obvious how we distinguish logic.

683
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Now, it's not as if we can't.

684
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
He, he's not somebody who says, so there's no such thing as logic or something like that.

685
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
But in a sense, it's part of our overall theory of the world to do that.

686
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
One way of looking at it is we draw these distinctions between analytic and synthetic,

687
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
between logic and definition, between all of that, and then things that require

688
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
experience of the world, between logic and mathematics.

689
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But the ways in which we do it are driven by our overall theories.

690
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's not as if things come up philosophically pre-divided,

691
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and then we fill in these categories in the way Carnot thinks.

692
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's rather we draw these distinctions as part of our overall theory of the world.

693
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So at least the way I like to read Quine here isn't saying there's no difference

694
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
between logic and set theory.

695
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
He thinks there are differences.

696
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
No differences between those in physics.

697
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
There are.

698
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's just that all of that is defined within a certain theory.

699
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's not something that comes to us in advance of theory.

700
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, next time we'll look at Carnot in empiricism, semantics, and ontology.

701
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We'll take a look at some further details of Quine's arguments

702
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
as we look at Carnot's way of thinking about this and responding.
