00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Hi. I want to talk today about David Hume on causation. It's one of Hume's most distinctive

00:12.720 --> 00:18.600
and most surprising philosophical theses. Because when he follows out his method, it

00:18.600 --> 00:24.040
turns out all sorts of things have to be committed to the flames as he puts it dramatically.

00:24.040 --> 00:28.120
All sorts of things turn out either to be meaningless or to have a meaning that is not

00:28.120 --> 00:34.360
at all what we thought. We trace them back to origins in experience. And sometimes we

00:34.360 --> 00:39.240
find there is no origin in experience. This is made up out of thin air. It's bad news.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.720
It's utterly meaningless. There is no content. Other times we find out, well, it does have

00:43.720 --> 00:48.280
a content, but it's not what we thought. And that's what's going to happen with causation.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.560
He's not going to say causation is meaningless, but he is going to say actually what's going

00:52.560 --> 00:55.480
on within is very different from what you might have thought. You thought you were describing

00:55.480 --> 00:59.920
a relation in the world. You're not. You're doing something else. So let's take a look

00:59.920 --> 01:06.280
at how this goes. Hume is considering causal inferences. Sometimes we go from cause to

01:06.280 --> 01:14.360
effect. So we say, aha, here is lightning. So expect thunder. Sometimes we go from the

01:14.360 --> 01:19.560
effect of the cause as when we hear thunder and think there must have been lightning.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.560
Sometimes it's going to be, let's say in a medical context where we see a symptom and

01:23.560 --> 01:29.360
we say, aha, that's evidence that the underlying cause is this illness. Or sometimes we find

01:29.360 --> 01:33.360
out that somebody's tested positive for an illness and we say, aha, here's what you

01:33.360 --> 01:38.280
can expect. Here are the various symptoms you might start to exhibit. Well, we make inferences

01:38.280 --> 01:42.720
then on the basis of causation, sometimes from cause to effect, sometimes from effect

01:42.720 --> 01:49.360
to cause, sometimes from just observing regularities in the world to thinking there is a causation.

01:49.360 --> 01:55.280
What justifies those kinds of inferences? Inferences from a causal relation to an effect

01:55.280 --> 02:02.160
or a cause, inferences to a causal relation from various bits of evidence. Well, Hume

02:02.160 --> 02:07.600
says it's actually tricky to understand this. Why? Well, first of all, the inference doesn't

02:07.600 --> 02:14.360
seem to be something that rests on anything a priori. Why? Because we can imagine it otherwise.

02:14.360 --> 02:19.320
I can imagine that this symptom has a different cause from the disease I thought. I can imagine

02:19.680 --> 02:24.160
that that loud boom was not actually caused by lightning, but was, let's say, a sonic

02:24.160 --> 02:29.320
boom produced by an airplane. I can go in the other direction and think, well, aha, a bit

02:29.320 --> 02:33.920
of lightning. I'm going to hear thunder and then I don't hear it. Or it could turn out

02:33.920 --> 02:38.120
that, okay, people with this disease generally exhibit these symptoms, so expect this to

02:38.120 --> 02:43.120
happen and it doesn't happen. I'm free of that symptom. Yay. Good thing for me. But

02:43.120 --> 02:47.280
it turns out that in short, that doesn't always happen and there's no necessity that

02:47.280 --> 02:52.880
I can, in any case, easily imagine it happening otherwise. It certainly is the case that having

02:52.880 --> 02:57.840
something tossed up in the air generally leads to it coming down, but of course that

02:57.840 --> 03:01.600
could vary, that could change. I can imagine it just continuing to go up or just lingering

03:01.600 --> 03:09.000
in the air. And similarly, normally, my hitting a ball with a pull cue will cause it to move,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.120
but I can easily imagine that I hit it and it doesn't move for some reason. So I can

03:13.120 --> 03:18.540
imagine it otherwise. There's no necessity to this idea of causal relations, at least

03:18.540 --> 03:24.120
not the kind of necessity that means I can't imagine it otherwise.

03:24.120 --> 03:29.680
So Hume puts it this way, the inference we draw from cause to effect is not derived merely

03:29.680 --> 03:34.360
from a survey of these particular objects and from such a penetration into their essences

03:34.360 --> 03:38.540
may discover the dependence of one upon the other. There's no object that implies the

03:38.540 --> 03:42.600
existence of any other if we consider these objects to themselves and never look beyond

03:42.600 --> 03:46.840
the ideas we form of them. Such an inference would amount to knowledge. It would imply

03:46.840 --> 03:51.420
the absolute contradiction and impossibility of conceiving anything different. But as all

03:51.420 --> 03:56.480
distinct ideas are separable, it's evident there can be no impossibility of that kind.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.840
In other words, our knowledge of causation can't be our priori. I can't just reflect

04:00.840 --> 04:05.160
on the nature of billiard balls and say that, oh, striking them will cause them to move.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.880
I can't just reflect on the nature of thunder and realize it's caused by lightning. These

04:09.880 --> 04:14.520
are not things that are part of the concept. It's really about the world.

04:14.520 --> 04:20.280
And so we can imagine all sorts of wild things, right? We can imagine that seeing a statue

04:20.280 --> 04:25.720
of David Hume in Edinburgh immediately makes people fall in love. It's like a love potion.

04:25.720 --> 04:32.080
Well, I can imagine that. In fact, there is no such causal relation. I can imagine whenever

04:32.080 --> 04:36.240
two people fall in love, a statue of David Hume appears. Of course, that doesn't happen

04:36.240 --> 04:40.420
either. But in short, we can imagine anything. That doesn't tell us anything about causal

04:40.420 --> 04:45.000
relations and whether they do or don't exist.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
So we quite reasonably infer any causal inference is really a posteriori. It's something that

04:50.000 --> 04:56.040
can only be discovered on the basis of experience. And indeed, Hume says, look, yeah, of course,

04:56.040 --> 05:00.280
it's by experience only we can infer the existence of one object from that of another,

05:00.280 --> 05:05.360
or the existence or currents of one event on the basis of another. However, he says,

05:05.400 --> 05:11.080
here's the problem. When we think it's derived from experience, we start looking for the

05:11.080 --> 05:15.960
origin of that idea and experience, and we don't find it. He says, actually, it can't

05:15.960 --> 05:22.120
be a posteriori because we don't experience the causal link. You might think we do. I

05:22.120 --> 05:27.680
see the lightning and then I hear the thunder or I strike the ball with a pull cue and

05:27.680 --> 05:33.480
it does move. But he says, don't be misled. What are you seeing there? Are you seeing

05:33.520 --> 05:37.320
the connection between the lightning and the thunder? Are you seeing the connection between

05:37.320 --> 05:44.080
the motion of the cue and the motion of the ball? You're not seeing the connection. You're

05:44.080 --> 05:47.400
just seeing the motion of one and the motion of the other. Or in the case of lightning,

05:47.400 --> 05:53.360
you're seeing the flash and then you're hearing the thunder a little while later, you hope.

05:53.360 --> 05:58.600
And you're just seeing one thing and then another. You're not seeing any link between

05:58.640 --> 06:05.640
them. So, Hume says, let's think about the cause of motion, like the cause of motion of

06:05.640 --> 06:10.600
cogs in a machine or of a billiard ball. He says, motion in one body is regarded upon

06:10.600 --> 06:15.080
impulses the cause of motion in another, like the cue stick and the ball. When we consider

06:15.080 --> 06:19.920
these objects with the utmost attention, we find only that one object approaches the

06:19.920 --> 06:24.960
other, that the motion of it precedes that of the other, but without any sensible interval,

06:24.960 --> 06:29.200
it is vain to rack ourselves with further thought and reflection upon this subject.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.280
We can go no farther in considering this particular instance. So what do we get? We think about

06:34.280 --> 06:40.240
this kind of motion. The cue stick moves. We see it move first. The ball is stationary.

06:40.240 --> 06:50.240
Then there's contact. Then the ball moves. How did that happen? Okay. We see now, contiguity.

06:50.240 --> 06:55.520
It was contact. So the cue stick did touch the ball. We see a succession. We see motion

06:55.520 --> 06:59.840
of cue stick followed by motion of ball. But we don't see what links them. We don't see

06:59.840 --> 07:06.000
the connection. We see the one move, then the other move. It starts when there's contact.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.560
But what happens at that point of contact? Can we look in there? Let's say we get a magnifying

07:11.560 --> 07:16.360
glass and I say, okay, you hit the ball now. I'm still not going to see the connection.

07:16.360 --> 07:22.240
I will see one motion followed by another motion. That's it. So Hume says, when we look

07:22.240 --> 07:27.160
about us toward external objects and consider the operation of causes, we're never able

07:27.160 --> 07:32.400
in a single instance to discover any power or necessary connection. Any quality that

07:32.400 --> 07:36.920
binds the effect to the cause and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other,

07:36.920 --> 07:42.320
we never find such a thing. We never observe the causal relation. We don't see the connection.

07:42.320 --> 07:48.160
We just see one thing followed by another. Franco Malley once said, life is just one

07:48.160 --> 07:52.480
damn thing after another. And that's basically Hume's position. Life is just one damn thing

07:52.480 --> 07:57.800
after another. And so we just get this followed by that. We start talking about causes, but

07:57.800 --> 08:02.160
we never observe anything that is the origin of our idea of causal relations. At least

08:02.160 --> 08:06.960
we don't observe it in the world. It's not there in watching the billiard balls, in watching

08:06.960 --> 08:12.200
the lightning and hearing the thunder. We never see it. What do we find? We find constant

08:12.200 --> 08:17.800
conjunction. We only find that one does actually follow the other. The impulse of one billiard

08:17.800 --> 08:22.600
ball is attended with motion in the second. This is the hole that appears to the outward

08:22.600 --> 08:27.240
senses. I see the motion of the cue stick, the motion of the cue ball, the motion of

08:27.240 --> 08:33.160
another ball. That's all I perceive. I don't see anything beyond that constant conjunction.

08:33.160 --> 08:39.680
This moves, that moves. I don't see the link. So upon the hole, Hume says, there appears

08:39.680 --> 08:45.240
not throughout all nature any one instance of connection, which is conceivable by us.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.720
All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another, but we can never

08:49.720 --> 08:56.200
observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but never connected. The lightning, followed

08:56.200 --> 09:01.520
by the thunder, keeps happening. But do we see the necessity? Do we see the connection?

09:01.520 --> 09:08.000
No. This is a little joke based on this. Don't give me that constant conjunction. Doesn't

09:08.120 --> 09:13.720
imply causal connection. It's yours. Well, anyway, there is a kind of infinite regress

09:13.720 --> 09:18.960
argument lurking here. Hume says, when we infer effects from causes, we must establish the

09:18.960 --> 09:23.600
existence of these causes, which we have only two ways of doing, either by an immediate

09:23.600 --> 09:28.800
perception of our memory or senses, or by an inference from other causes. Which causes,

09:28.800 --> 09:32.400
again, we've got to ascertain in the same manner, either by a present impression or

09:32.400 --> 09:37.400
by an inference from their causes and so on, till we arrive at some object, which we see

09:37.440 --> 09:42.480
or remember. It's impossible for us to carry on our inferences out in full item. The only

09:42.480 --> 09:46.560
thing that can stop them is an impression of the memory or senses, beyond which there's

09:46.560 --> 09:51.800
no room for doubt or inquiry. So we get a classic infinite regress argument here. We

09:51.800 --> 09:58.560
infer some causes and effects in the world. Well, we can infer a causal relation only

09:58.560 --> 10:02.280
from causal relations, unless we can actually find that connection in the world, which is

10:02.280 --> 10:08.160
what we can't, he says. So we get a causal relation only from causal relations. But that

10:08.160 --> 10:13.440
can't go on to infinity. Any inference to cause an effect must start with an impression,

10:13.440 --> 10:20.200
a perception of something. Okay, causal relations can't just lead us around within that circle.

10:20.200 --> 10:26.520
In the end, we can't go on to infinity. It's got to be from something outside that circle,

10:26.520 --> 10:31.840
something that rests on an impression, an experience, a perception of something. But

10:31.880 --> 10:36.120
now we don't find the connection in the world. We just find one thing followed by another.

10:36.120 --> 10:42.720
So how is that going to work? The transition from an impression present to the memory or

10:42.720 --> 10:48.160
senses, the uneven object, which we call causal effect, is founded on past experience and our

10:48.160 --> 10:53.480
remembrance of their constant conjunction. We just have the constant conjunction, the contiguity,

10:53.480 --> 10:59.840
the succession. That is to say, we have the conjunction of this motion, that motion, or that

10:59.880 --> 11:06.640
flash, that boom. And that leads us to draw a causal conclusion. But now Hume says,

11:06.640 --> 11:13.040
that's weird because I can't find the perception. I don't see us seeing the link. And so he says,

11:13.040 --> 11:17.680
this whole inference, admittedly, we do that. We see the constant conjunction. We move to a

11:17.680 --> 11:25.520
causal conclusion. But is that based on reason? Or is it based on something else? He says,

11:25.520 --> 11:30.720
if reason determined, it perceived upon the principle that instances of which we've had no

11:30.720 --> 11:35.040
experience must resemble those of which we've had experience, and that the course of nature

11:35.040 --> 11:40.480
continues always uniformly the same. Well, we'd have to have rational grounds for that principle.

11:41.040 --> 11:47.840
But where could we get that? Ah, he says, there's nowhere to get it. There can be no demonstrative

11:47.840 --> 11:52.240
arguments to prove that those instances that we haven't experienced resemble those of which

11:52.240 --> 11:57.360
we have had experience. We can imagine a change in the course of nature, which sufficiently proves

11:57.360 --> 12:02.880
that such a change isn't absolutely impossible. To form a clear idea of anything is an undeniable

12:02.880 --> 12:08.240
argument for its possibility. So I can conceive of a future that's radically different from the past.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.320
And when I conceive of that, you might say it's the job of science fiction writers to do that.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.600
Well, I'm imagining just the kind of change. So there can't be any rational,

12:17.600 --> 12:22.400
demonstrative, deductive argument for the claim that the future will resemble the past.

12:24.320 --> 12:28.800
Well, is there a probabilistic argument? Well, in general, the past has resembled what came

12:28.800 --> 12:34.080
before it. So I guess it's okay to assume that our future is going to resemble our past. But wait,

12:34.080 --> 12:38.320
what you're saying is there was a regularity in the past that the future would resemble the past?

12:38.960 --> 12:43.840
Huh, I can't say the future is likely to resemble the past because it always has in the past. And

12:43.840 --> 12:49.040
so it's going to in the future. That just looks like a circular argument. And so that won't work

12:49.040 --> 12:54.480
either. It can't be a deductive argument. It can't be an inductive argument based on past experience.

12:54.480 --> 13:00.640
We can't have any argument for it at all. So, Hume says, we've got to seek something outside reason.

13:01.200 --> 13:07.680
Here's how we find it. He says, think about a single case. Okay, one case of that cause leading

13:07.680 --> 13:14.160
to that effect. One flash of lightning leading to thunder. Do we infer cause and effect from that?

13:15.120 --> 13:19.680
No. Right? The first time a child experiences a thunderstorm and sees a flash of lightning

13:19.680 --> 13:24.960
and hears thunder, they don't immediately say, aha, lightning caused thunder. Nobody's going to

13:24.960 --> 13:30.640
guess that from a single case. And so Hume says, we don't get this sort of conclusion at all from

13:30.640 --> 13:37.760
one case. But we can get it from multiple cases. If we observe several instances where the same

13:37.760 --> 13:42.320
things are always conjoined together, we conceive a connection between them and begin to draw an

13:42.320 --> 13:48.240
inference from one to the other. It's that multiplicity of resembling instances that constitute

13:48.240 --> 13:53.760
the very essence of power and connection. And it's the source where the idea of it arises.

13:54.320 --> 13:59.520
That's where we get this. Something about the repetition of cases gives us this idea from

13:59.520 --> 14:05.840
which we get the concepts of power, of connection, of causation. But he says, wait a minute.

14:06.640 --> 14:12.320
I don't get it. Repetition can't give us any new idea, can it? I mean, it just is a perfectly

14:12.320 --> 14:16.480
similar instances. We don't get the idea from one. We're not going to get it from a bunch of them.

14:17.120 --> 14:22.640
And so that doesn't make any sense. All our ideas are copied from impressions. We get the same

14:22.640 --> 14:26.320
impressions of the external world. It's just the same thing again and again.

14:27.040 --> 14:31.440
No new impressions are happening. No new ideas are happening. So look,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.840
it can't be found in one of these. It's not going to be found in multiple.

14:37.280 --> 14:42.240
So what's the source? We might expect him at this point to conclude there is no source.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.800
But that's not where he goes. He says something new does happen. The repetition does something.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.840
But what does it do? It affects me. It forms a new impression, not a new impression of the world.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.360
It's not that I suddenly see something in the lightning or the thunder or the motions of

14:57.360 --> 15:02.720
the billiard balls that I didn't see before. It's instead that I get a feeling of expectation.

15:03.280 --> 15:09.120
I see it enough times that I see the flash of lightning. I expect the thunder. I hit the ball.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.920
I expect the ball to move. And I expect it to contact and hit other balls and make them move.

15:14.720 --> 15:21.040
So I feel a determination of the mind to pass from one thing to another. That's all the changes.

15:21.040 --> 15:26.880
My feeling, my feeling of expectation. From one instance, I can infer nothing causal at all.

15:26.880 --> 15:32.400
From repeated instances, we infer the causal link, but nothing in the world changes.

15:32.400 --> 15:37.520
What does our feeling of expectation? There is a new impression, but it's not a new impression of

15:37.520 --> 15:42.320
anything going on in the world. It's a new impression in us. It is a purely internal impression.

15:42.880 --> 15:49.600
So the origin of our idea of causation is this constant conjunction of events leading to a

15:49.600 --> 15:55.760
feeling of expectation, an internal impression in us. And that gives us the ideas of causation

15:55.760 --> 16:01.440
and necessity. But notice, the source is in us. It's not in the world. Necessity is the effect

16:01.440 --> 16:07.040
of this observation and nothing but an internal impression of the mind. The necessity is something

16:07.040 --> 16:16.240
that exists in the mind, not in objects. So the source of necessity of causation is not in the

16:16.240 --> 16:23.200
world. Those ideas come from something in us. It exists in the mind, not in objects. We project

16:23.200 --> 16:28.880
that regularity onto the world. The mind, he says, has a great propensity to spread itself on external

16:28.880 --> 16:34.400
objects. And that's what we're doing when we talk about necessity or causation. We're projecting

16:34.400 --> 16:40.400
that onto the world. We can't find sources for certain of these ideas in the world, but we do

16:40.400 --> 16:46.320
find the source in experience. It's just not in the world. It's in us. The source is an internal

16:46.320 --> 16:51.360
impression. And it's going to turn out that that's true of lots of ideas, not just causation and

16:51.360 --> 16:59.120
necessity, but substance, matter, the self, identity, morality. The source of all of those is going to

16:59.120 --> 17:06.240
be internal and we project them onto the world. So he says in the end, it is feeling. It is this

17:06.240 --> 17:10.080
internal feeling that leads to belief in all of those things.
