0	13160	Hi, today I want to talk about the philosophy of Hegel, one of the last great system builders.
13160	18800	I am going to ignore the warning of some analytic philosophers that one must never finagle with
18800	24600	Hegel, there can be no apology for his phenomenology, and instead talk about some of the ideas in
24600	29200	his work, The Phenomenology of Spirit, and a number of other works, especially we're
29200	34720	going to focus on Hegel's dialectic, his way of thinking about the way in which thought
34720	40440	is transformed, the dynamics of thought, if you will, the way it changes over time.
40440	44600	Logicians tend to think about the logical relations among propositions, what's a premise,
44600	46440	what's a conclusion, and so forth.
46440	48080	It's a very static picture.
48080	53040	Occasionally they talk about how language changes, a logic might try to take into account
53040	57920	the fact that sentences are said in sequences, building on one another, not merely as sets
57920	63240	that all somehow get presented at the same time, but most logical systems abstract away
63240	64240	from all of that.
64240	68400	Hegel thinks that the most fundamental ideas of logic, however, should have to do with
68400	73240	the dynamics of thought, the way in which thought progresses, thought changes.
73240	77640	And that's a very different conception, so logicians who pick up Hegel's logic are
77640	81440	going to be surprised, they're going to be finding very little that's familiar, and
81440	84520	a great deal that seems to them very, very strange.
84520	89360	It's because Hegel is interested in those dynamic questions, not in the static question
89360	95240	of how this proposition relates to that proposition, but instead how people thinking about a problem
95240	99440	in a certain way or having a certain kind of view are going to find themselves confronted
99440	103400	with things that will then lead them to think about things in a different way.
103400	108760	So he's interested in something like the dynamics of thinking, whereas you might say that most
108760	113320	logicians are focused on the statics or the kinematics at most of thinking.
113320	118600	So Hegel is giving us a very different conception, not just of logic, but of the philosophy of
118600	124440	mind, of the nature of the world than we find in earlier philosophers, and his impact over
124440	128240	the last two centuries has been immense.
128240	131920	Let's begin by recalling some key facts about Kant.
131920	136960	Kant's rationalism held that there were innate ideas, pure concepts of the understanding
136960	140880	in his way of presenting it, the categories that were based on the logical functions
140880	142140	of judgment.
142140	146820	And then there were synthetic a priori truths or laws of the understanding, things that
146820	151660	we used as part of our conceptualization of the world to actually construct the objects
151660	153420	of experience.
153420	156260	So Kant was a kind of idealist.
156260	160980	The objects of experience are things we construct through our own mental activity.
160980	165900	We receive information from sensibility, but then that gets processed in a multi-stage
165900	169740	process into objects that we synthesize.
169740	175180	And so we can know things about them, our priori, independently of experience by understanding
175180	177300	that process of synthesis.
177300	180340	But all of this applies only within the realm of experience.
180340	185460	It applies to things that are being projected, not to the world itself.
185460	187900	Hegel has a very different idea.
187900	193580	So to think about what he is doing to change the picture, let me draw you a little sketch
193580	197220	of what Kant had in mind.
197220	201780	Kant's picture, as we've laid it out, is something like this.
201780	208860	Kant, let's say, depicts a thought as occurring within a mind, a mind that is receiving information
208860	211340	in some fashion from sensibility.
211340	216540	So here we have sensibility, our faculties of sense, perception.
216540	225380	And here out there is something that is generating that, the thing in itself, numina is his technical
225380	226940	term for that.
226940	231660	We relate, in a multi-stage process, the information coming from sensibility, let's
231660	236700	say, through this perception, to some concepts here.
236700	240300	Maybe some empirical concepts we've derived from experience.
240300	246700	Maybe from, well, from our a priori concepts of the understanding.
246700	252260	And then the mind projects on the basis of this an object of experience, the thing that
252260	255140	we experience as a triangle.
255140	258660	And we take our thought to be about that triangle.
258660	265580	But really, it's not a direct line of that triangle affecting us, as in Plato or Aristotle
265580	267300	or many earlier philosophers.
267300	270540	Instead, this thing is an appearance.
270540	273220	It is something that is being constructed.
273220	274300	It's an appearance.
274300	277700	He also refers to that as an object of experience.
277700	282540	He uses the Greek term, this is a phenomenon.
282540	287700	This is a numinon, that is to say, the thing in itself.
287700	292900	So in general, the phenomena of experience, the objects of experience, are things that
292900	295420	are the product of mental activity.
295420	299100	I compared this, in my talk about Kant, to a projector.
299100	301020	The mind is something like a projector.
301020	306260	And some information comes into the projector, a digital file, a film strip, something that
306260	309620	gives it information about what it is to project.
309620	312700	But then it projects something on the screen of experience.
312700	318820	And we can know something a priori about the things that will be projected on that screen
318820	322100	by knowing something about the projector.
322100	326700	But given that we have knowledge of things on the screen, and we are able to have some
326700	331860	reflective knowledge of the nature of the projector, what then do we infer about the
331860	333660	thing in itself?
333660	338300	Well, we have no guarantee that these things will obey the laws of the understanding, they're
338300	339860	the inputs.
339860	343460	So for example, it might be that everything that can appear on that screen, because we're
343460	346660	using a black and white projector, is black and white.
346660	350420	That doesn't mean that reality is just black and white, that what goes into it is black
350420	353340	and white, that what goes into it has any color at all.
353340	358060	For that matter, it could just be a digital file, it might be zeros and ones, or really
358060	361940	just electrical impulses that are meant to represent zeros and ones.
361940	365580	And so what's getting projected here is no similarity to this at all.
365580	369220	So in short, we can infer nothing about the nature of the thing in itself.
369220	372940	He refers to this as the unconditioned equal to x.
372940	374860	That is to say, it is unknown.
374860	376140	We don't know.
376140	378700	Something he thinks must be affecting sensibility.
378700	383540	It's not just doing this of its own accord, it's not just kind of off on a wild flight
383540	385300	of fancy.
385300	388700	And after all, different people seem to perceive the same thing at the same time.
388700	392180	If you were to walk into this room, you would see chairs, you would see lights, you would
392180	393460	see me.
393460	398340	And so that, I mean, that needs to be explained, we'll talk about that problem much later.
398340	403340	But Kant says all this is reason to think there is a thing in itself.
403340	408700	First thing Hegel does is say, wait a minute, I don't think that's doing anything for you.
408700	412820	Look, you're saying sensibility is receiving information from the thing in itself, the
412820	414620	new and the world.
414620	417700	And then this is all taking place, and we can know about this part.
417700	419340	We can know about this part.
419340	424780	We can deduce something about all of this, even our priori, good with you with all that.
424780	426860	But now what role exactly is this playing?
426860	431460	You can't officially even say this exists, or that it's causing us to perceive things
431460	435800	in any way, because causation and existence are some of the categories.
435800	439420	You know they apply the things out here, you have no reason for thinking they apply here.
439420	440420	Maybe they do.
440420	443220	I mean, you can't rule it out on the basis of what you've said.
443220	446260	But in short, the thing in itself is playing no role in the theory.
446260	448900	It is doing nothing for you, okay?
448900	453780	It's sitting around like an independent wheel, or like an appendix, you might say, in a human
453780	458300	body where maybe it's good for something, but it doesn't seem like it's good for anything.
458300	462520	So Hegel says, first of all, get rid of that.
462520	465140	It accomplishes nothing in this theory.
465140	468420	We end up having some weird thing there, and we say, well, we can't say anything about it.
468420	469620	We don't know what's going on.
469620	474860	In short, it's just like substance in luck from Barclay's point of view, for example,
474860	476220	or from Hume's point of view.
476220	479780	You end up saying, well, there must be something I know not what in which these qualities in
479780	482820	here that makes this all hang together as an object.
482820	485060	Well, what is it, says Barclay.
485060	487900	Something you know not what?
487900	489940	That's no theory of anything.
489940	490940	Just get rid of it.
490940	491940	You don't need it.
491940	493700	There's just a bunch of qualities here, right?
493700	495060	You say, no, they're in something.
495060	496060	They're in something.
496060	497060	What?
497060	498060	I don't know.
498060	500020	I mean, Barclay's in effect saying, that's no theory.
500020	501020	Get rid of it.
501020	502900	It's doing no theoretical work for you at all.
502900	504780	And Hegel says the same thing to Kant here.
504780	510260	He says, OK, so all of this process rests ultimately on a thing in itself that is doing something
510260	516020	I know not what, and has something I know not what character that enables it to do whatever
516020	517540	I don't know what it's doing.
517540	521980	And in short, he says, that just explains nothing.
521980	522980	Get rid of it.
522980	523980	It's not doing any work.
523980	526060	It explains nothing, whatever.
526060	532580	But the second thing he does is to say, OK, you're getting something a priori here, and
532580	536260	you've got these laws of the understanding, the a priori concepts.
536260	541140	Well, all right, there are empirical things like triangle, but then there's all this stuff
541140	543940	here that you claim is a priori.
543940	548460	And you say from that, you can get universal knowledge.
548460	551860	You can get necessary knowledge.
551860	560860	Well, Hegel says, that's going to be true, only if we all have exactly the same a priori
560860	562340	concepts of the understanding.
562900	568220	Only if the same laws of the understanding operate for everybody, every human being,
568220	573780	and every culture, every time, every place, why should we think any of that is true?
573780	578740	Why should we believe that all of us share the same a priori concepts?
578740	581740	That all of us share the same laws of the understanding?
581740	586380	All of us approach experience in the same way and have our minds function in the same
586380	587380	way?
587380	591260	Hegel says, I don't see why that should be true at all.
591260	596140	So Hegel thinks about these categories, these concepts of the understanding and the laws
596140	601540	of the understanding, and says, why should they be constant and invariable?
601540	606060	Why do they have to be universal, all human beings, all times, all places?
606060	608380	That doesn't seem right.
608380	613420	We're going to get universal and necessary knowledge of the world only if all of that
613420	619540	is constant, the same for all people, all times, all places, all circumstances, all
619820	623500	societies, all cultures, all historical periods, etc.
623500	625340	But there's no reason to expect that.
625340	630780	Why should we expect human beings to construct the world in the same way at all times and
630780	636180	places, all circumstances, all cultures?
636180	642300	Think about somebody seeing the world as a resident of ancient Egypt.
642300	647260	Apparently they saw the world as two-dimensional, that's a joke, or someone who is a resident
647300	653820	of a medieval village, or someone living in the midst of the Kalahari Desert, or modern-day
653820	655340	Manhattan.
655340	659500	Why should all of these people construct the world in the same way?
659500	663380	Why should they all approach it with the same set of concepts?
663380	666300	Of course they're going to have different concepts coming in from experience, but Hegel
666300	667780	doesn't just mean that.
667780	672500	Why should we assume they have all the same starting points at the outset?
672500	675020	So Hegel says, I'm a historicist.
675020	676500	What does that mean?
676500	680180	The way we construct the world develops over time.
680180	686060	Philosophy, and these a priori concepts, these laws of the understanding, they vary with
686060	688580	historical circumstances.
688580	695820	The famous quotation here is, philosophy is its own time raised to the level of thought.
695820	702420	Hegel says, tell me what an ancient Egyptian said in philosophy, or what an ancient Greek
702420	707780	said, or a medieval villager said, or a resident of the modern-day United States says.
707780	710500	I'll tell you, those are the cultural assumptions.
710500	714540	Those are the assumptions, the concepts they're bringing to understand the world.
714540	715940	Are they all identical?
715940	716940	No.
716940	717940	There are some overlap.
717940	723260	I mean, it would be surprising, given that they're all human beings who face basic human
723260	725100	problems if there were no overlap at all.
725100	728060	Of course there's overlap.
728060	733140	And you might try to find that overlap as, aha, that's the true universal necessary
733140	736620	a priori thing, which I think is Kant's attitude.
736620	738340	But Hegel says, I'm not so sure about that.
738340	743180	It might be that just that set of people in that set of circumstances historically developing
743180	744980	have that set of concepts.
744980	747900	Now go study the people in the Kalahari Desert.
747900	752900	Go study those who are indigenous peoples above the Arctic Circle.
752900	757900	Go find some people living on remote Pacific islands or remote areas of the Amazon.
757900	760980	Are they going to conceptualize things the same way?
760980	763580	I mean, maybe they do get hungry.
763580	765140	They do get thirsty.
765140	769860	There may be some things that they all have in common as human beings.
769860	774620	But we shouldn't assume that at the outset, that's a question for anthropologists.
774620	779900	And so Hegel says, really, when I think about how people organize experience, I don't find
779900	783180	them all saying, oh yes, every event must have a cause.
783180	786620	In fact, in the contemporary world, now that we've been exposed to quantum mechanics and
786620	790860	the real possibility that some things just happen without cause, that it bests their
790860	795060	statistical regularities at some level of reality.
795060	798060	Not clear, by the way, that that's in the end how to interpret those theories.
798060	800180	But it's a very plausible way to interpret them.
800180	802300	And by now, we're used to that thought.
802300	806700	So we look at Kant, or earlier philosophers, saying every event must have a cause.
806700	809580	This is built into the structure of the mind.
809580	811580	And we're inclined to say, well, no, it's not.
811580	814260	I can entertain the possibility that's not true.
814260	816900	That some things are truly random.
816900	822460	What about other ideas, like, gosh, the idea that the amount of matter in the world cannot
822460	825620	be destroyed or expanded?
825620	832460	Maybe, but maybe that's exactly what happens when we have an atomic explosion.
832460	834940	We convert matter into energy.
834940	837140	Maybe the amount of energy in the world remains constant.
837140	839980	Our physical theory tells us that it is.
839980	843420	On the other hand, I can imagine that it's not.
843420	847020	So in short, we're now thinking, there are a lot of things that these philosophers thought
847020	851700	was impossible for us to entertain that we think we can entertain.
851700	853820	Those things seem to change over time.
853820	855660	Well, they do change.
855660	861260	But Hegel says, that doesn't mean that I want to end up as an absolute relativist who says,
861260	864860	well, you know, if just the truth varies with time and place.
864860	867700	Or to become a skeptic who says, who knows, who's right?
867700	870220	We all approach the world differently, and blah, blah, blah.
870220	872420	And instead, he says, no.
872420	874740	There are ways in which thought progresses.
874740	876820	There are ways in which cultures progress.
876820	880060	There are ways in which thinking progresses.
880060	883940	And he calls that, well, in German, the term is geist.
883940	888140	In fact, his great work is the phenomenology of geist.
888140	895060	That is to say, of spirit or of mind that progresses through stages toward absolute knowledge.
895060	899460	Here in talking about geist, he doesn't mean just specifically your mind.
899860	900580	Or my mind.
900580	902980	He really means thinking itself.
902980	907540	The ways in which human beings approach the world the way they think about the world
907540	911420	progress as human beings live in this world over time.
911420	914260	It progresses toward absolute knowledge.
914260	917140	He has hopes that we will finally reach it.
917140	920500	Maybe it'll be a limit we will never really achieve.
920500	922500	But in any case, that's what's happening.
922500	924660	So it's not a random process.
924660	927940	We aren't sitting there thinking, well, who knows who's right?
927940	930820	He says, no, thinking is getting better and better.
930820	934100	We're approaching the ultimate truth.
934100	936620	But we could still be far away from it.
936620	941100	So what takes place as we progress through these stages?
941100	947020	What really matters here is not how this set of people happens to see the world at this time.
947020	952100	Instead, it's the dynamic principles that govern the development of thinking over time.
952100	957100	If we have reason to think that we're going to eventually attain absolute knowledge of the world,
957140	961140	well, it must be because we understand what's going on with these dynamic principles.
961140	963540	So what can we say about that?
963540	969940	Hegel says, philosophy can express universal and necessary truths, but not of the kind
969940	971060	that Kant thought.
971060	976940	Not necessary and universal truths about the world as he or earlier, Abbaseno or Descartes
976940	979780	or Leibniz or other rationalists tried to sketch out.
979780	981380	He says, not that kind of thing.
981380	985100	You're looking for things that are constant across all times, places, cultures, historical
985100	986100	periods and so on.
986420	987700	That's not it.
987700	991980	I'm talking about the laws that govern the development of thought itself.
991980	996060	So what we're going to be able to find as universal and necessary isn't anything about
996060	997260	the world.
997260	1002540	It's about the development of thinking, the dynamic principles that govern thought.
1002540	1006100	There will not be a a priori propositions about the world.
1006100	1008020	There will not be innate concepts about the world.
1008020	1014420	There will be these innate higher order abilities and tendencies of thinking that are going to
1014460	1019340	allow us to articulate universal and necessary dynamic principles.
1019340	1022500	So these are high level dynamic principles.
1022500	1025620	Not about the world, but about our thinking about the world.
1025620	1027940	They govern the development of thought.
1027940	1029940	Hegel is thinking about thinking.
1029940	1036860	He is thinking about our processes of cognition over time and the way we develop our theories,
1036860	1041860	the way we approach the world, the concepts we use and the ways in which they change in
1041900	1044500	response to experience.
1044500	1046940	He has a number of these dynamic principles.
1046940	1053300	By far the most famous is what's become known as the thesis, antithesis, synthesis pattern.
1053300	1054540	And it is a common pattern.
1054540	1059980	He thinks he outlines this and the details of its development in a number of different
1059980	1060980	ways.
1060980	1063340	So he sees this happening again and again.
1063340	1064340	Now what is it?
1064340	1067100	Well, let me use an analogy.
1067100	1072340	Physics tries to give us some constant universal necessary scientific laws.
1072340	1076140	It looks at a world with things changing, but says nevertheless there's something that
1076140	1077140	isn't changing.
1077140	1080860	The laws according to which things are changing, they don't change.
1080860	1083180	So the scientific laws are constant.
1083180	1085180	The things in the world are changing.
1085180	1086740	But we can say how.
1086740	1091980	And that's what physics tries to do in laws of gravitation, laws of motion, laws governing
1091980	1095580	electromagnetism, and in a variety of other ways.
1095580	1098300	The theory of relativity does something similar.
1098300	1100980	It looks at the qualities of things in the world.
1100980	1108820	Things like velocity or motion or even, well, gosh, mass, a variety of things that would
1108820	1113780	have been taken to be primary qualities in the things themselves by Descartes and Locke.
1113780	1116180	And it says, well, actually those things change.
1116180	1118460	They change across various reference frames.
1118460	1121500	They're really relative to a reference frame.
1121500	1128100	But the scientific laws, things like this is the speed of light, or like, well, momentum
1128100	1132100	is inertial mass times velocity.
1132100	1135800	Those are things that are invariant across reference frames.
1135800	1140260	And so some scientific laws are invariant, no matter how we look at things, no matter
1140260	1143660	whether we're moving or stationary and so on.
1143660	1148260	But the qualities of things, including the primary qualities, as traditionally understood,
1148260	1151700	they do change across frames.
1151700	1154220	Hegel's historicism is doing something similar.
1154220	1158860	It says, our theories about the world are basic concepts that we use about the world
1158860	1166700	change, but there are dynamic principles about those concepts and theories that are constant.
1166700	1169140	So he is looking at a changing set of things.
1169140	1176140	In this case, not a changing world or a changing set of reference frames, but instead a changing
1176140	1177580	set of theories about the world.
1177580	1182500	And he's saying, I can formulate laws for how those theories change.
1182500	1187780	And so if you look at a changing world here and then think of our theories as being one
1187780	1192220	level up, trying to be constant, Hegel's looking and saying, yeah, but they're not very constant,
1192220	1193220	are they?
1193220	1194860	Look one level higher.
1194860	1197060	That's where you get the constant.
1197060	1202180	Theories about the way in which our thinking about the world changes.
1202180	1207340	So if you might say an ordinary science of the world and traditional philosophies are
1207340	1211700	looking at the world saying, we got a changing world, but maybe we can find some unchanging
1211700	1217140	truths about it, Hegel says, I see a bunch of changing theories about those unchanging
1217140	1222380	truths, but I can tell you how those theories are changing.
1222380	1227900	And I'll come up with the only truly unchanging things one level higher at the level of thinking,
1227900	1231700	not about the world, but thinking about thinking.
1231700	1235900	So here's his idea, behind thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
1235900	1237700	We start with a thesis.
1237700	1243420	It transforms itself into an antithesis, or you might say it comes into conflict with
1243420	1247900	an antithesis, and then out of that arises a synthesis.
1247900	1252060	All of this can be presented in a way that makes it sound utterly mysterious and mystical,
1252060	1254620	and some philosophers have rejected it that way.
1254620	1258300	The African philosopher Quasiruridu, for example, is looking at this saying, these are just
1258300	1263620	seemingly mystical laws, and insofar as Marx takes them over and builds them into the foundations
1263620	1269100	of Marxism, there's similarly this mystical thing going on at the basis of Marxism.
1269100	1275380	Well, turning here just to the Hegel part, forget Marx for a moment, we can say, I think
1275380	1280620	he has in mind something that isn't quite as mystical as all of that.
1280620	1282860	Here's the underlying idea.
1282860	1287380	Suppose we are interested in mapping out the course of, well in this case, the Colorado
1287380	1292660	River as it's going through southern Utah and headed toward the Grand Canyon.
1292660	1298540	We find formations like this, and you can see here the river has been cutting through
1298540	1305620	this rock over eons to make shapes like this dramatic and beautiful scenery, but also has
1305620	1310500	a bizarre and complex path as it goes through the rock.
1310500	1316540	Well, suppose I'm trying to do this, and let's say there's a border between two counties
1316540	1321700	that is supposed to follow the river, and I'm trying to chart where exactly this boundary
1321700	1322700	is.
1322700	1329100	Well, I am doing this using surveying tools that require me to use straight lines.
1329100	1332380	In a certain sense, intuitively, we can say, look, it's in the center of that river, so
1332380	1334820	it does go like this.
1334820	1339180	But hey, come on, I'm supposed to be surveying this, right, and reporting coordinates, and
1339180	1341140	I can't do curves like that.
1341140	1346380	I have these things, and I look through them, and I do sight lines, and I need to reduce
1346380	1348140	this to straight lines somehow.
1348140	1350140	So how do I do it?
1350140	1352780	Well, here's the idea.
1352780	1357260	It's too complex, really, to be captured by any finite set of straight lines.
1357260	1362540	So what I'm doing is approximating, and I approximate it first in this way.
1362540	1365420	I try this line, this line, this line.
1365420	1368740	But then you come back and you look and you say, well, that's not quite right, I mean,
1368740	1369740	come on, look.
1369860	1371660	Over here, it's going over there.
1371660	1374860	You're not really capturing the curve correctly.
1374860	1378700	So we say there are inadequacies to that thesis.
1378700	1380660	Let's try solving the problem.
1380660	1381780	You've got this mistake here.
1381780	1382780	Let's fix that.
1382780	1386940	In fact, if we draw the thing differently in this way, start over here instead, and try
1386940	1389020	to map this, then we get something different.
1389020	1394220	So here, in a grossly oversimplified form, over on the left there, I've got the thesis.
1394220	1397860	Okay, we try drawing that line, and we say, well, wait a minute.
1397860	1401780	That's not capturing this little oxbow thing going on here.
1401780	1405180	And this little peninsula there, that's being left out, and so on and so forth.
1405180	1407180	We say, this isn't quite right.
1407180	1412860	So we draw a different line through this, and that I've got marked as the antithesis.
1412860	1414140	But then the same thing happens there.
1414140	1418660	We look and we say, well, yeah, you reported this, but now we've gone in in our more detailed
1418660	1420300	survey, and that's not quite right.
1420300	1422620	I mean, that's not the center of the river here.
1422620	1426520	It's cutting off all sorts of rock formations and so forth.
1426520	1427860	So we synthesize them.
1427860	1429320	We come up with something else.
1429320	1432480	Now here I've drawn it as something halfway in between, roughly.
1432480	1434080	But of course, that's not always the case.
1434080	1437800	In fact, we might reconceptualize and say, you know, we need a totally different technique.
1437800	1439840	This isn't going to do it at all.
1439840	1445760	So the synthesis tries to combine the strengths of the thesis and antithesis, but sometimes
1445760	1449720	there's a compromise between them, often is a transcendence of them.
1449720	1452440	And Hegel's term for this, they are alfgahoban.
1452440	1453960	They are transformed.
1453960	1456520	They are transcended by the synthesis.
1456520	1460680	So it's not just a compromise, it's not just a blending or a combination.
1460680	1464880	We somehow replace them with this new way of thinking about things.
1464880	1469280	And ideally, it really is a transformation of the way we're thinking, not merely some
1469280	1471780	compromise or combination.
1471780	1473980	So here's the general pattern.
1473980	1477040	People adopt a certain way of looking at and thinking about things.
1477040	1480820	That's the thesis, but it's only partially correct.
1480820	1482400	The world's a complicated place.
1482400	1484320	It's not going to be totally right.
1484320	1489880	So it faces contrary evidence, faces counter examples, anomalies, contradiction, problems
1489880	1490960	emerge.
1490960	1495840	And then we say, well, all right, we tried going with that hypothesis, and we encountered
1495840	1496960	all sorts of problems.
1496960	1499840	For a while, people tried to solve the problems.
1499840	1503280	And then they say, you know what, maybe we should have a new way of looking at things.
1503280	1506120	And indeed, in science, this often happens.
1506120	1509200	People are getting a theory, they're trying to develop the theory, they say, well, that's
1509200	1512280	a problem case, this is a problem case, but we can solve it, we can solve this.
1513280	1519120	And the theory becomes more and more complicated until finally somebody says, that's the wrong
1519120	1520620	way to approach it.
1520620	1523520	Why don't we start from this side instead?
1523520	1527400	And so they come up with the antithesis.
1527400	1531600	They shift to this new and contrary way of looking at things.
1531600	1533800	But it's also only a partial truth.
1533800	1536120	I mean, it's a new way of thinking about things, in a sense.
1536120	1539640	It denies the starting point of the other one, so let's approach it from a different
1539640	1540640	direction.
1541000	1545480	But it too ends up facing contrary evidence, counter-examples, anomalies, contradictions.
1545480	1549680	Again, the world's a complicated place, it doesn't get everything right.
1549680	1554080	So eventually we realize we have to, in some way, combine the strengths of both and avoid
1554080	1556000	the weaknesses of both.
1556000	1562120	So we resolve the conflict between the thesis and the antithesis and transcend them in a
1562120	1564360	new synthesis.
1564360	1570000	It draws elements from both, it transforms how people think, how people see things, and
1570000	1571960	it becomes a new thesis.
1571960	1573600	But then the problem starts again.
1573600	1574840	The process starts again.
1574840	1579280	We begin thinking, oh yes, but now it is the new exciting idea, we go with it, and then
1579280	1585000	it starts encountering anomalies, contradictions, counter-evidence, counter-examples.
1585000	1586720	And now we say, well, what do we do about it?
1586720	1588840	And the same thing happens.
1588840	1590920	So thought keeps doing this.
1590920	1594240	Hegel traces it through a number of things.
1594240	1599920	You can see it happening in pre-Socratic philosophy, where we've got some people saying,
1600160	1603760	there is one kind of thing at the foundation of the world, atoms.
1603760	1608160	Somebody else, or sorry, one thing, water, that says Thales.
1608160	1612920	Someone else says, no, there are different kinds of things, air, water, fire.
1612920	1615560	And then somebody else says, no, there are many, many different kinds of things, all
1615560	1618160	these atoms, okay?
1618160	1624000	And someone else, you know, Heraclitus says, changes, constant, everything is just constantly
1624000	1625000	changing.
1625000	1628120	And this is nothing ever changes.
1628120	1632680	Then Plato and Aristotle say, well, things change, but they remain the same thing across
1632680	1633800	change.
1633800	1638000	They change their accidental properties, but they retain their essential properties, and
1638000	1639000	so forth.
1639000	1643600	So these kinds of syntheses between opposing ideas keep happening.
1643600	1648040	Well, Hegel says that's the general pattern of human thought.
1648040	1650200	That just keeps happening.
1650200	1656200	But notice that as it happens, you are trying to eliminate contrary evidence, counter examples.
1656200	1662720	You're getting your straight lines to approximate that curve more and more closely.
1662720	1666800	So there's a sense in which you hope you're getting closer to the absolute truth.
1666800	1672240	And he's confident that in the long run, we keep getting better and better at thinking
1672240	1673360	about things as we do this.
1673360	1679720	We do confront the counter examples, the contrary evidence, the anomalies, the contradictions.
1679720	1684320	And we do try to improve our ways of thinking that retains the explanatory power and the
1684320	1686240	strength of our earlier theories.
1686240	1689560	So in that way, our theories keep getting better and better.
1689560	1695120	Who understood the physical world better, Aristotle in his physics, or contemporary
1695120	1696120	physicist?
1696120	1701880	Surely, we hope the contemporary physicist, because all sorts of anomalies over centuries
1701880	1707800	have been taken care of or incorporated into the strength and power of that modern theory.
1708280	1712480	Well, as we do this, we have to recognize that we're not doing this in a vacuum and
1712480	1714640	we're not driven just by the world.
1714640	1719360	We do this in a social and historical context.
1719360	1724680	We frame our thinking and our theories in terms of language.
1724680	1731000	Those linguistic units that we use, the words, the phrases, the ways in which we describe
1731000	1736480	the world, are shaped by basic categories of thought and they reveal the basic categories
1736480	1738100	of our thinking.
1738100	1744880	But other people at our time, or slightly earlier, other people in our context, in our
1744880	1748480	circumstances, in our society, are teaching us language.
1748480	1752760	So I think about the world in a certain way because I speak a certain language.
1752760	1757680	I've learned that language from other people in a certain historical context.
1757680	1763880	I think about the world, well, I know other languages, but I am a native speaker of English.
1763880	1766440	That shapes how I see the world.
1766440	1772520	And I learned that English within a particular social setting, given a certain interpretation
1772520	1773520	of it.
1773520	1779680	So, what humor attributed to custom or habit or feeling, what caught another rationalist
1779680	1786080	attribute to our priori concepts and laws of reason, Hegel says, I see that as coming
1786080	1791680	out of the social context, out of a particular place and time.
1791680	1794840	Our thinking is shaped socially.
1794840	1800440	It is really in society that we live and move and have our being to steal a phrase from
1800440	1805480	an ancient philosopher quoted famously by Paul in Acts 17.
1805480	1809680	And so Hegel says, really, it is society playing that role.
1809680	1817000	We learn our language and our ways of thinking in a given social and historical context.
1817000	1820600	That shapes how we think everything.
1820600	1824600	In particular, Hegel attacks the idea of a given.
1824600	1829320	He attacks Kant's distinction between understanding and sensibility.
1829320	1836440	He attacks the empiricist's understanding of thinking as depending on sensation, impressions
1836440	1838240	and then ideas and so on.
1838240	1840760	He says, actually, no.
1840760	1845640	Our perceptions of the world are shaped by our concepts from the very start.
1845640	1848560	He is against what he calls immediacy.
1848560	1853200	This idea that there is anything we contact in the world immediately.
1853200	1859040	He says, even in a basic perception, I might think that this looking at my hands is just
1859040	1860760	a basic perception.
1860760	1863320	He says, but I'm already thinking of them as hands.
1863320	1865880	I'm already conceptualizing them.
1865880	1871600	How I perceive the world and the concepts I use to frame that perception are all part
1871600	1873200	of one big process.
1873200	1879040	It is not that sensibility does its thing, then the understanding does its as Kant thinks.
1879040	1883720	It's not the case that I have these impressions and then I form ideas.
1883720	1889360	The ideas, the impressions, the sensations, the understanding, the conceptual resources,
1889360	1891480	all of that is going on at the same time.
1891480	1893360	There is no way to divide.
1893360	1900120	Concepts from percepts, sensation from thinking about sensation, the concepts we use to understand
1900120	1904560	sensations, our concepts shape the way we perceive the world and our perceptions are
1904560	1906600	already thoroughly conceptual.
1906600	1910640	If you don't give me the concepts, then I'm not going to perceive the world in the same
1910640	1911640	way.
1911640	1915440	I won't see things that really you might say, oh look, the information is there.
1915440	1917120	Why aren't you seeing it?
1917120	1919600	Because I don't have the concepts to process it.
1919600	1925480	And so he says there just is no given preconceptual portion of experience that we could isolate
1925480	1931200	and call sensibility or sensation or impressions or anything else like that.
1931200	1936920	The whole division on which rationalism and empiricism rest, that whole thing has to be
1936920	1938480	rejected.
1938480	1943760	Well, whatever I've said about concepts and perception in the world in general, thinking
1943760	1946520	in general also applies to norms.
1946520	1950040	Norms of ethics but norms governing our behavior in all sorts of ways.
1950040	1951480	We construct them.
1951480	1956160	We construct them relative to a certain historical period and social context.
1956160	1961920	Now they do express the world spirit, geist, in its current state of development.
1961920	1967080	And so they are to be sneezed at, but on the other hand they are relative to our time and
1967080	1970400	place in formulating principles of ethics.
1970400	1976120	We are not formulating universal and necessary laws that stem from the laws of nature as
1976120	1981720	in natural law theory or that stem from human nature and our responses to pleasure and pain
1981720	1986440	or happiness or flourishing or thriving, nor is there anything like a categorical imperative
1986440	1989880	that applies to all rational beings.
1989880	1995120	These are things that we formulate as useful guides for human life at a given time and
1995120	1996120	place.
1996120	1999920	Nevertheless, he says, we're not doing that arbitrarily.
1999920	2006040	We are doing it because of the successes and failures of earlier systems of norms.
2006040	2010200	And so these too are going to progress toward the absolute.
2010200	2016680	And in fact, what we think about these things now, he says, is the best we can do now at
2016680	2019080	understanding what that absolute is.
2019080	2024760	So as a rather shocking conclusion, he says, whatever is, is right.
2024760	2026080	Whatever is, is rational.
2026080	2029760	This is as far as rationality has taken us at this point.
2029760	2035160	And the best we can do is adopt the norms that are the most rational given our circumstances.
2035160	2039800	So there's a sense in which whatever the ethical norms of our time and place are, they're
2039800	2043200	the right norms for us to have at that time and place.
2043200	2046720	That's not to say it's all purely relative.
2046720	2050160	Tomorrow we may look at ourselves today and think we were barbarians.
2050160	2054560	Nevertheless, he says, look, it was the best we could do at the time.
2054560	2060680	And so in general, we think that norms too are relative to a time, relative to a place.
2060680	2067040	But nevertheless, have a kind of standing because they are putting us on the path and
2067040	2072120	in fact our expressions of how far along we are on the path toward absolute knowledge
2072120	2072800	of how to live.
