00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,040
Hi, I want to talk about Aristotle on substance. Aristotle's categories give us ten modes

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,240
of being, the most fundamental, the primary one, of which is substance. Everything else

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,600
is really a quality of a substance, a quantity of a substance, a relation between substances

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,440
and so on. So substance is fundamental. But what is substance? We've talked some about

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,000
criteria for identifying substances. Substances can admit contrary qualities. They don't

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,400
themselves have contraries. A substance is this such. It's this particular example of

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,840
a certain more general kind. And there are a variety of others. But what does that really

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,040
mean for what substance is and what kinds of things are substances? You might think,

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,400
look, I know already everything I need to know about this. Substances are in the primary

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,000
sense particular things. And then in the secondary sense kinds of things. End of story.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Well, not quite. And Aristotle goes into, in great detail in one of the books of the

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,060
metaphysics known as metaphysics zeta, about what it really means for something to be a

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,320
substance and what substance really is. It turns out the picture is complicated. My only

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,800
incomplete that I received during my graduate education was in a course on Aristotle. I

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,160
took on the problem of explaining Aristotle's analysis of substance in metaphysics zeta

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,640
as the topic for my term paper. I couldn't finish it within the semester. And I figured,

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,960
well, I'll write it over the summer. Over the summer I studied the question. I read more

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,140
and more about it. Finally, I became convinced I couldn't solve the problem. And so quickly

19
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,160
shifted my topic to Aristotle on infinity and wrote a paper about that, which was not

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:58,600
exactly my greatest work. But that problem about substance, I in the end considered insoluble.

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,960
And as you'll see today, I have more ideas about it. But actually, I think still Aristotle's

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,080
point in a way is nothing really fulfills all of the considerations, all of the criteria

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,360
intuitively that we have for being a substance. Why is it complicated? Well, let's start

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,040
our discussion by reminding ourselves about the role that substance plays in the categories.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,320
Substances that are in no way composite signify substance, quantity, quality, relation, place,

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,800
time, position, state, action, or affection. Those are the basic categories. Substance,

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,920
in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the word, is that which is neither

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,840
predictable of a subject nor present in a subject. And so all of those other things are predicated

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,280
of substance. He refers to these, in fact, as figures of predication. And so we talk

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,720
about quantities of substance or qualities of substance, relations between substances.

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,200
Substances being in a certain position or in a certain state as doing things, having

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,040
things done to them. In short, we predicate other things of substances. But substances

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,440
are the things that aren't predictable of something else. They aren't present in something

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,040
else. They are the ultimate subjects of predication. So Aristotle says everything except primary

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,080
substances is either predicated of primary substances or is present in them. And if these

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,280
didn't exist, it'd be possible for anything else to exist. If there were no substances,

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
there would be no quantities or qualities or relations or places or times or anything

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,240
else as well. So they are most properly called substances because they underlie everything

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,640
else. As the name suggests, they stand, stand, under, sub, everything else. They are the

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,680
basic foundation, the basic things the universe consists of. So he says the science of substance,

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,920
understanding substance, must be of the nature of wisdom. If you really want to understand

42
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,840
the world at the deepest level, you've got to understand substance. That turns out, however,

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,480
to be rather difficult. The overall question here is the deepest question, I think, of

44
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,760
metaphysics, which is the question of ontology. And Willard Van Orman Quine, a 20th century

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,120
philosopher, has put this question beautifully at the beginning of one of his papers called

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,520
On What There Is. A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity. It

47
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,840
can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables. What is there? It can be answered moreover

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,240
in a word, everything. And everyone will accept this answer is true. However, this is merely

49
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,760
to say there is what there is. There remains room for disagreement over cases. And so the

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,800
issue is stayed alive down through the centuries. Well, that's precisely right. What is there?

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,200
Everything. Well, Aristotle's a little more specific than that. What is there? Substance.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,200
But what's substance? Well, substance is that which is primarily, not in any qualified sense,

53
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:00,480
but without qualification. It's what exists. That is substance. But we need criteria for

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,720
figuring out what substance is and for identifying then the particular things that we take to

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,040
be the fundamental constituents of the world. Well, all substance, he says, appears to signify

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,800
that which is individual. It is this as well as such. It's an individual thing as well

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,200
as a thing of a certain kind. Another mark of substance is that it has no contrary. There's

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,560
no opposite in the way that hot is the opposite of cold or right is the opposite of left or

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,560
being on top of something is the opposite of being under something or there isn't anything

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,800
like that with substance. Substance doesn't admit a varying degrees. We don't have something

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,640
that is more a cat than other things. If you're either a cat or you're not a cat, one cat

62
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,680
can't be more cat than another cat. The most distinctive mark of substance, he says, is

63
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
that it admits contrary qualities. The cat can be awake or asleep. It can be running

64
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,680
or it can be staying still. It can be meowing or it can be silent. So here are some criteria.

65
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,680
Putting these down on a list of substance isn't predictable of or present in anything else.

66
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,800
It underlies everything else. It's individual. It's of this. It has no contrary. There are

67
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,080
no degrees of it and it admits contrary qualities. It can be changed and undergo a change of

68
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,080
quality while remaining the same. Now, what do we mean when we say substance is primary?

69
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,600
That's not that easy a question to answer. Aristotle says there are actually several

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,000
senses in which a thing may be said to be primary or first. Substance, however, is first

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,840
in every sense. It's first in definition. It's first in order of knowledge and it's

72
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,840
first in time. So let's think first about time. Other categories can't exist independently,

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,600
only substance. You can't just have the color red floating around independently. It's

74
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,920
got to be a red something. You can't just have an action of throwing, for example, without

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,640
anyone doing the throwing or anything being thrown. And so substance has to be there in

76
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,080
order for anything else to exist. If there were no substance, nothing could be thrown,

77
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,040
nothing could throw. Nothing could be red or could be tall or could be lying over on

78
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:21,040
its side and so on. And what about first in definition? Well, everything else is a quality

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,480
of a substance, a relation among substances, a quantity of a substance, an action or a state

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,480
or affection of a substance. So in short, all of those have substance in their very definitions.

81
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,920
And what about in the order of knowledge? We know substances most fully and most particularly.

82
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,560
It says, here's the way to do it. Think about knowing something. Before you really can know

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,000
anything else about it, the most important thing to know is what is it? What kind of

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,120
thing is it? Is it a man? Is it fire? Is it a horse? Is it an action? You need to know

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,800
what kind of thing it is. You need to know what a thing is before you can even start

86
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,200
describing it. Surely first in the order of knowledge is knowing that it's a person or

87
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,880
knowing that it's a book, knowing that it's a table, knowing that it's a vegetable and

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,880
so forth. Now, Aristotle says the question raised of old and raised now and always, what

89
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,400
is substance? Well, he gives us four candidates. And this is interesting because you might

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,480
have thought, well, wait, we've known this already, right? We mean particular things

91
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,320
like this book and then the general kind book or this particular human being and then the

92
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,360
general kind humanity or human being. But not so fast. In metaphysics Zeta he says there

93
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,320
are actually four candidates. Well, four and question mark, there's really an obvious

94
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,400
fifth which he somehow seems to neglect in the discussion. The word substance is applied,

95
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,040
if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects, for both the essence and the

96
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,760
universal and the genus are thought to be the substance of each thing and fourthly the

97
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,280
substratum. Now, this is quite startling when you see it. Wait a minute. I thought we had

98
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,440
particular things and then kinds of thing. That's it. But now we're talking, well, I

99
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,000
mean, what happened to the things? What happened to the kinds? We've got, well, we've got genus

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,480
as a kind type term. Those are the secondary substances of the categories. But we've got

101
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,480
essences and universals and the substratum. What's going on here? Well, I thought we were

102
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,760
talking about primary substances, individual things, things like this book or this human

103
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,760
being. Ah, well, let's go through our criteria. Not predictable of or present to anything else.

104
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,160
True. I am not predictable of anything else. Neither is that book. Underlying everything

105
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,680
else. Yes, individual things seem to underlie everything else. If there were no individual

106
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,880
things there would be nothing at all. So nothing would have any qualities or relations

107
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,880
and so on. Individual. Yes, it's this book, this human being. And so individuality. Check.

108
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
No contrary. Right. There's no contrary. Nothing that's the opposite of being Dan Bonnevac.

109
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,280
No degrees can't be more Dan Bonnevac than somebody else. So either you are or you aren't.

110
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,880
And the same thing with just being human. You either are or you aren't. Admitting contrary

111
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,160
qualities. Yes, I can speak. I can be silent. So I can exhibit contrary qualities. The book

112
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,440
might be closed. The book might be open. Contrary qualities. But ah, primary. Here Aristotle

113
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
says, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm looking for the ultimate constituents of the world.

114
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,720
The things that are primary in the sense that they are the most basic things. And actually

115
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,720
this book or this human being, they seem composite. There is both the this and the such aspect.

116
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,720
They seem to have matter and form. I am this person in this body, in this flesh and blood.

117
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,960
I have a certain form. I have an essence. And we'll talk more about what essences are.

118
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,000
But certain things are accidental to me. They can change and I remain the same. Other things

119
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,360
might be essential to me in that if they change, I am no longer who I am. And so we can talk

120
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:24,040
about my essence, my form, my matter. Ooh, I seem to be composite. But Aristotle says,

121
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm not talking about composite things now. I want to know what the ultimate constituents

122
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,760
of the world are. And these particular things that I took to be primary substances in the

123
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,040
categories, they look composite. What are they made up of? What are their ultimate constituents?

124
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,080
Hmm, maybe they're physical parts. Maybe they're form. Maybe something else. Now we have to

125
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,880
investigate. Well, one possibility is the substratum. Okay, so Aristotle says the substratum

126
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,840
is that of which everything else is predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything

127
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:04,000
else. So I think about myself as a human being. And I think, okay, good, humanity is being

128
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,200
predicated of me. Human being, that's something like a species. So that's a more general kind

129
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,040
of thing. It's a secondary substance, but it's found here in me a primary substance. But admittedly,

130
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm not predicated of anything else. I satisfy that criterion. But am I basic? I do seem to have

131
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:30,120
matter, this flesh and blood. And then I have a form in this general shape of a body. But also,

132
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,000
we can talk about my form in a sort of mental state, talk about my personality or my consciousness

133
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,120
or something of that sort. And then I have an essence, things that could not change while I

134
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,760
remain the same person. And then you could say, well, let me ask a different question. What or

135
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,120
who is it that is Dan Bonobak? After all, we've said, aha, humanity, that gets attributed to Dan

136
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,440
Bonobak. Dan Bonobak, well, something here is being Dan Bonobak. What is that thing? Suppose I

137
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,120
say, well, it's that flesh and blood. You could say, well, what is it that is that flesh and blood?

138
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't know what to say about this. And we're going to see this in a number of different

139
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,880
philosophers throughout the term. But you might think, okay, look, maybe I mean, whatever that

140
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,760
ultimate thing is, that is Dan Bonobak. So I look at the book and I say, yeah, I'm not talking about

141
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,360
the book as the fundamental thing. After all, books are obviously not basic constituents of the

142
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,120
universe. They're made up of pages and those pages contain words. And, and so it looks as if this

143
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,920
book is something that I can't identify as a basic constituent of the universe. There is something

144
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,320
that is this book. Let's say it's these pages. Well, there's something that constitutes these pages.

145
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:52,440
What's that? And I can keep pushing down. And so Aristotle thinks maybe there is a substratum here,

146
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,240
maybe here in the end, it's the paper, let's say, or in my case, maybe it really just is the flesh

147
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,800
and blood, or it is the ultimate constituents of my biochemistry, whatever we end up saying about

148
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,880
that. We end up with a substratum that isn't predictable of or present in anything else that

149
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:18,680
does seem to underlie everything else. But is it individual? Hmm, it's primary in a way, but the

150
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,120
individuality seems disturbing. Let's think about a statute. It's a little easier than thinking

151
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,480
about a human being or a book. In one sense, matter is said to be the nature of the nature of a

152
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,640
substratum in another shape and in a third the compound of these. By the matter, I mean, for

153
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,520
instance, the bronze. By the shape, the pattern of its form, in this case, the cap. And by the

154
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,440
compound of these, the statute, the concrete hole. So if I'm looking for ultimate constituents of the

155
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,760
universe, well, primary substance in the terms of the book, the categories, is that sculpture. But

156
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,760
now I say, well, that sculpture doesn't really seem primary. So what is it that is that sculpture?

157
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,640
It's a certain shape, but what is in that shape? Well, the bronze. Now, later philosophers will

158
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,560
say, so what is that bronze? And push it even further. But Aristotle is willing to stop with the

159
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,440
bronze or the paper or the flesh and blood, etc. In any case, we've got to consider those

160
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,120
possibilities. Maybe the ultimate constituent is simply the statue, the hole, the matter and form

161
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,320
together, that individual object. That's what he assumes throughout the book, the categories. But

162
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,440
it could also be just the matter, just the bronze, it could be just the form, just the shape. So,

163
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:43,160
let's take those in turn. The compound, could it be the compound of matter and form? That is to

164
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,320
say, that matter in that particular shape, that bronze shaped that way. Well, Aristotle says,

165
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,560
look, we can easily dismiss that. It's obviously posterior. It's nature is obvious. It is not

166
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,960
the basic thing. It's not like you say, what's the basic constituent? Oh, it's this bronze statue

167
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:10,360
of a cat. No, right? Surely that is a compound of the bronze put in that shape. So it's not primary,

168
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,560
it's not going to count. What about the matter, the bronze, there in the shape of the cat, here in

169
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,680
the shape of the man? Well, is it the bronze that is primary? Aristotle is tempted to go in that

170
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,440
direction, but then he says, well, that statement is obscure. On this view, matter becomes substance.

171
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,760
If this isn't substance, it battles us to say what else he is. When all else is stripped off,

172
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,120
evidently nothing but matter remains. So I look at the sculpture and I say, take away the shape,

173
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,440
abstract away from the shape, take away that olive branch behind his ear, take away the nose,

174
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,360
take away all of that. What's left? Well, just the bronze. But really, in the end, it's just well,

175
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,080
stuff like bronze. I mean, it might be, right? If we're thinking in terms of chemistry, we might

176
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,160
say the ultimate elements, the iron. Actually, bronze is something of a compound, there are a

177
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,840
mixture. So really, it should be things like, okay, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, etc. The basic

178
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,720
chemical elements, maybe that is what counts as the ultimate constituents of the universe. Or

179
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,000
maybe it's the atoms of those or the micro particles making up those atoms. But in any case,

180
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,960
well, nothing but matter is really going to remain. So what's wrong with that? Well, Aristotle says,

181
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,080
look, take away length and breadth and depth. There's nothing left unless there's something

182
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,480
bounded by these. So if you consider the matter this way, matter alone must seem to be substance.

183
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,680
Well, that would be neither a particular thing nor a certain quantity nor assigned to any of the

184
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,880
other categories by which it's determined. All those determinations are gone. We can no longer

185
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,400
say, oh, it's a statue or it's a man or it's a book or it's anything of any particular kind. It's

186
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,600
just the matter in the end. So he says, look, we lose something really important. Maybe we gain

187
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,040
some degree of primacy, but we lose other things we cared about. The ultimate substratum would

188
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,720
itself be neither a particular thing or a particular quantity or otherwise positively

189
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,320
characterized. Nor would it be the negations of these. They would belong to it only by accident.

190
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,600
So it would turn out that matter is substance, but hold on a second. We said that being of this

191
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,720
such was crucial to substance. Being separable, having its own independent individual existence,

192
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,840
being of this, those are among our criteria too and matter surely fails that. So that won't work.

193
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,240
Matter can't be right. Well, the substratum then satisfies us with respect to being not

194
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,600
present in anything else, not being predictable of something else, underlying everything else,

195
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,840
good, but individual. No, it's not individual. It fails that test.

196
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,600
What about essence? I do have an essence as a human being. Well, how about that? Is that

197
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,120
something that can count? He groups those together under shape, form, the universal.

198
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,240
The question of essence is complicated. We'll talk about that separately. But for now, let's

199
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,400
just go with this idea that by essence, I mean something like the shape or the form or the

200
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,320
universal I exemplify. I mean something like being a human being in my case, or being a book,

201
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,960
or maybe being a statue of a cat in that particular shape, or of a Greek goddess,

202
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,560
or of an Olympic winner, etc. Shape, you might think, is a universal. So those are coins,

203
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,760
all of which are bronze coins, but all of which are in basically the same shape, the same form.

204
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Well, can we count the universal or the shape or the form as itself substance?

205
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Plato, Aristotle thinks, wants to do that. But he says, no, that can't be right. It seems impossible

206
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,040
that any universal term should be the name of a substance. Why? Well, the substance of a thing

207
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,240
is what is peculiar to it that doesn't belong to anything else. But the universal is common.

208
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:15,200
Universal is, by definition, something that is multiply instantiated. So look, it, by its very

209
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
nature, belongs to more than one thing. There can be more than one human being, more than one triangle,

210
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,840
more than one statue, more than one cat. So where's the individuality? It looks like universal can't

211
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,720
be it. And it can't be shape or form or anything like that. We can have lots and lots of different

212
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
statues produced in a factory with exactly the same shape, multiply instantiable,

213
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,200
so we don't get what's unique. So Aristotle says, well, look, no universal attribute can be a

214
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,520
substance. And not only for that reason, because also it is predictable of things. I can say that

215
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,520
has the shape of a cat. And that's something that I can predicate of that statue. So it's

216
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,080
predictable of other things. It is something that can be in something else. It's multiply

217
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,600
instantiable. It flunks a bunch of different tests of substance. It fails our test of not

218
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,240
being predictable, but it fails others as well. And so we want to say, look, everything that's common

219
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,800
indicates not of this, but a such. But a substance is of this. We agreed that substance was of this

220
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,920
such, particular of a certain kind. And a universal isn't like that. It is purely the universal part.

221
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:32,320
Maybe it's an answer to the such part. It is not an answer to this part. So it fails individuality.

222
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:42,400
Well, what about a kind? We've talked about that as a secondary substance in the categories. And so

223
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,200
we might look at it and say, well, maybe Aristotle's changed his mind by the time he gets to metaphysics.

224
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,000
Maybe he's decided the secondary is really primary. And we should be talking about kinds,

225
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,240
about general sorts or types of things. But look, that doesn't work either. It's

226
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,800
predictable of something else. I am a human being, for example. That animal is a cat. That is a book.

227
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,920
It also fails individuality. Because after all, it's of this such, this human being.

228
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,200
The kind is giving you the such, not this. So we summarize and we say, well, we've looked at now

229
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,280
five possibilities. Is it an individual thing? It looks like that's compound. It's not primary.

230
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,360
Matter? It's not individual. What about shape or form or universal? It's predictable and it's not

231
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,160
individual. What about a kind? It's predictable. It's not individual. What about the combination

232
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,960
of matter and form? Well, now we're back to the individual thing. It's compound is not primary.

233
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,880
So in the end, I think Aristotle thinks nothing on that list really satisfies everything we wanted

234
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,080
about the nature of substance. We went thinking, look, I've got a very intuitive idea. What is the

235
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,680
basic structure of the world? Let's look at the structure of language and the structure of thought.

236
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,760
Everything is really about in the end. Well, in language, nouns. It's about persons,

237
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,480
places, things. It's about individual objects, individual people, individual things. But then

238
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,120
we look and we say, wait a minute. I wanted it to be, yes, individual, but also primary and not

239
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,440
compound. Something that underlies everything else I wanted it to be having. The ability to

240
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,320
admit contrary qualities, but to have no contrary itself and so on and so forth. I didn't want it

241
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,520
to become positive. I wanted it to be simple and basic. And it turns out I can't have it all.

242
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,080
I can either go with the compound, but hey, in other respects, satisfying things, that is to say,

243
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,280
the matter plus form, the individual thing, or I can go with some element like the essence or the

244
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,880
shape, form, universal, matter, kind. And then I'm going to have to give up the idea that this is not

245
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,760
practicable. I'll have to give up the idea of individuality. I will have to surrender my

246
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,600
conception that substance is not this such. I have a big price to pay no matter what. So in short,

247
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:05,120
the moral seems to be this. Nothing satisfies all the criteria for being a substance. Well,

248
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,960
that's disappointing. And so Aristotle in a kind of summary says, well, look, what are we really

249
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,720
in the undo then? If we can't have everything, what do we settle for? Here's what we settle for.

250
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,080
We call substance, first of all, the simple bodies, like the elements, in other words, earth, air,

251
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,040
fire, water, everything of that sort. But also the individual things composed of them, bodies, books,

252
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,760
human beings, and so forth. All those are called substance because they're not predicated of a

253
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,520
subject. Everything else is predicated to them. So in short, we refer to both the basic elements

254
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,760
and then the things made up out of those elements, the compounds, the individual objects,

255
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,720
the individual people, those are substances. They satisfy at least some of the criteria

256
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,280
for being a substance. We sometimes refer to substances as a principle or even a cause and

257
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,840
pursue it from that starting point, he says. So sometimes we focus on the cause. And here we're

258
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,720
looking towards something like an essence, like the soul of an animal or a human being.

259
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,640
And we think about a person's mind, let's say, and we think of that as something like a substance.

260
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,520
It's not a material substance, but nevertheless, it's something like the cause of the motion

261
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,680
of the material substance. And so sometimes we extend it in that direction too. Then we talk

262
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,280
about the parts of things. Okay, so there's me, this human being, but then there's also this hand,

263
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,040
and that hand, and this hair, and those eyes, and so forth, the various parts of me. And then

264
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,080
ultimately, of course, the individual atoms, the individual microparticles that make me up.

265
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,000
So those are in a different sense, substance. And then finally, he says, the essence.

266
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,040
Who am I really? You might think, what is my essence? What is really the essence of being Dan

267
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,200
Bonobak? Or, you know, what is this? It's a book. Well, what is it to be a book? I'm looking for the

268
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,640
essence of books. So maybe the best answer to what it is, is ultimately an explanation of the essence

269
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,320
of the thing. We call that substance too. So in short, we have a variety of criteria. Does

270
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,120
anything meet all those criteria? No. But we settle. And we settle in various ways. Sometimes we refer

271
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,440
to substances as the individual things. Sometimes to the elements out of which they're composed.

272
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,920
Sometimes to the parts out of which they're composed. Sometimes to something like the cause,

273
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:36,400
the mind, the soul. Sometimes we actually refer to, well, gosh, the kind. After all,

274
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,120
there are secondary substances. We refer to a bunch of different things. So in the end, he says,

275
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,720
and you might think here, he's going to say, so substance has four senses or something.

276
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,120
He gives us two, really. Because of those criteria, he tells us, look, we either choose

277
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,800
the substratum, the thing that is basic, but forces us to lose the individuality part.

278
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,400
So we think about the basic elements, for example, or the bronze. We think about that type of thing

279
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,600
where we basically preserve the underlying everything else, but we lose the individuality

280
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,880
part. Or we think about the individual things, that this is, whether it's the whole thing or

281
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,240
the parts of the thing, this part, this hand, that hand, and so on. Those things we can also take.

282
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,920
But then we lose some sense of primacy because they're compounds. So we can't have it all.

283
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,440
We settle. We either say, well, this satisfies most of the criteria. I have to give up the

284
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,920
individuality part. Or we say, well, it satisfies most of the criteria, but I have to give up

285
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:43,200
the primacy part. In the end, we settle because we can't have everything. So we look at the sculpture,

286
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,040
and sometimes we say, what is that? It's bronze. Sometimes what is that? A child reading a book.

287
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:56,080
Sometimes we say, what is that? Well, it consists of several parts. There is the child,

288
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,640
there is the base of it, there is the book, and the individual things that are marked so

289
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,000
they look like pages. In short, we do lots of different things to answer questions like,

290
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:19,120
what is that? Because, well, there is no one simple way to understand what substance really is.
