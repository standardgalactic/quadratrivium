00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Well, now let's start talking about Klein and his analysis of ontology.

00:06.800 --> 00:13.520
Klein's way of thinking about Oziloffical Matters has been hugely significant.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.360
The thing starts, you might say, his project starts in the 1930s.

00:17.360 --> 00:23.240
He goes to Vienna, he's working with Karnapp, takes a position at Harvard and stays at Harvard

00:23.240 --> 00:28.440
his entire career, ends up shaping the Harvard Department in crucial ways and turning it

00:28.440 --> 00:33.280
into one of the, well, for the entire time he was there, really, one of the top two or three

00:33.280 --> 00:36.240
departments of philosophy in the United States.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.600
Klein's influence was felt partly through the power of his work.

00:40.600 --> 00:46.400
He's a great writer and so has a lot of influence, partly because it is important

00:46.400 --> 00:51.960
philosophically, partly because the stylistic excellence of this makes him fun to read.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.360
And it's not often you encounter philosophy that's fun to read.

00:55.360 --> 01:02.360
So I think a lot of people read Klein when they might have been tempted not to read a similar set of ideas

01:02.360 --> 01:06.960
from another writer just because he's such a great writer.

01:06.960 --> 01:14.480
But also because Klein's students end up having a huge amount of power in the profession and well-deserved power.

01:14.480 --> 01:19.360
He has many of the greatest philosophers of the next generation studying with him.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.560
And so there are lots of people whose views he shapes.

01:23.560 --> 01:32.880
Saul Kripke, David Lewis, a variety of other people are Klein students and end up shaping the world of philosophy in the realm.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.640
So Klein's influence is both direct and indirect.

01:36.640 --> 01:46.520
Now last time we were examining Klein on autology and we saw there was something key that he develops.

01:46.520 --> 01:53.600
It becomes known as Klein's criteria of logical commitment.

01:53.600 --> 02:02.400
There are different ways of putting this, but the most famous formulation, as we saw, was just this.

02:02.400 --> 02:15.280
To be is to be a value of a variable.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.640
And last time we talked about what that meant.

02:17.640 --> 02:26.320
The idea was really that we have some statement like this.

02:26.320 --> 02:30.520
And what does that say? There is an x such that a holds true of x.

02:30.520 --> 02:38.560
Or in other words in English that says there are a's.

02:38.560 --> 02:45.240
Now understood in terms of its meaning, what this really means is that there is some domain of objects.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.800
And then we identify some of those as a's.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.800
So there are some objects x in here such that a is true of x.

02:54.800 --> 03:03.800
And we might think, okay, so one way of looking at this is that there is some non-empty subset of that domain consisting of a's.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.800
And so you might think, yeah, that's the a's in our domain.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.320
And that's what this means.

03:09.520 --> 03:17.960
So we could even think about the English but what, when we con Knight ourselves ontologically to something when they say there are such things.

03:17.960 --> 03:26.280
To ontologically commit yourself to people is to say there are people, to ontologically commit yourself to red things is to say there are red things.

03:26.280 --> 03:34.380
Does ontologically commit yourself to numbers is to say there are numbers, to ontologically commit yourself to attributes is to say there are attributes.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.300
And all of those could be put in logical terms

03:37.300 --> 03:38.580
in this sort of way.

03:38.580 --> 03:39.940
They could be put in English terms

03:39.940 --> 03:42.460
by just saying there are these things.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.340
We can think of it in terms of model theory, which

03:45.340 --> 03:48.780
is what this way of interpreting the logic comes to.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.500
These things are understood as models.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.460
There's a domain of objects and then properties and relations

03:53.460 --> 03:55.780
that can be defined on that set of objects.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.420
And to say there are attributes is just

03:58.420 --> 04:01.020
to say some of the things in our domain are attributes.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.740
To say there are red things, some of the things

04:02.740 --> 04:03.620
that are domain are red.

04:03.620 --> 04:07.060
There are people, some of the things in the domain are people.

04:07.060 --> 04:10.820
So we can think of this in sort of syntactic terms,

04:10.820 --> 04:12.740
either formally or informally.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.660
We can think of it in semantic terms,

04:14.660 --> 04:17.140
as saying there are certain kinds of things in our domain.

04:17.140 --> 04:21.380
And ultimately, the domain is the domain of all things.

04:21.380 --> 04:22.220
That's right.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.220
Well, yes.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.540
This can be understood as the domain of just everything,

04:27.540 --> 04:28.820
all things.

04:28.820 --> 04:31.340
On the other hand, in a lot of contexts,

04:31.340 --> 04:33.180
we don't have in mind everything.

04:33.220 --> 04:37.420
So for example, suppose I am thinking

04:37.420 --> 04:39.380
about the various people in this class

04:39.380 --> 04:41.380
and how you're doing on your papers,

04:41.380 --> 04:43.580
then actually the domain that's relevant to that

04:43.580 --> 04:46.420
are the people in the class and the papers.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.340
And I'm not worried about the rest of the word.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.820
If somebody says, but what about Vladimir Putin?

04:50.820 --> 04:51.540
I don't think.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.300
Oh, yeah, Vladimir Putin's an art domain.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.100
I better think about him, too.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.180
No.

04:56.180 --> 04:58.980
I'm just going to say, yeah, the domain of objects

04:58.980 --> 05:00.980
that's relevant to this particular context

05:00.980 --> 05:02.620
is one involving students and papers.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.580
And that's it.

05:03.580 --> 05:06.660
So frequently in language, what happens

05:06.660 --> 05:10.020
is we don't focus on this entire domain of everything.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.260
If I say, everyone's here.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.300
I don't mean everyone in the universe here.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.580
I mean, everyone in the class, for example, is here.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.220
So often in language, we really are talking about a much

05:20.220 --> 05:21.980
more restricted domain.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.500
But yes, in the abstract, we could

05:24.500 --> 05:26.260
be talking about everything.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.500
And indeed, when we're thinking about ontology

05:28.500 --> 05:30.860
in the broadest sense, that's what we want to do.

05:30.900 --> 05:33.260
Think about the way Klein opens his famous essay

05:33.260 --> 05:35.460
on what there is.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.340
A curious thing about the ontological problem

05:37.340 --> 05:38.740
is its simplicity.

05:38.740 --> 05:42.060
It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.

05:42.060 --> 05:43.020
What is there?

05:43.020 --> 05:46.180
It can be answered, moreover, in a word, everything.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.620
And everyone will accept this answer is true.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.540
So in a sense, if we're asking that basic ontological

05:51.540 --> 05:54.780
question, what is there, then the answer is everything.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.060
And so we do want this domain to include everything

05:57.060 --> 05:59.580
for those purposes.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.460
However, this is merely a saying that there is what there is.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.580
There remains room for disagreement over cases.

06:04.580 --> 06:07.500
And so the issue is stabilized after centuries.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.420
And so that tells us when we're doing metaphysics,

06:10.420 --> 06:12.900
we typically have in mind a domain that just consists

06:12.900 --> 06:15.020
of everything.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.900
Well, OK, so this looks like a very simple picture.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.980
But it's actually not quite so simple.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.940
Because even in his essay from 1939,

06:22.940 --> 06:26.220
a logistical approach to the ontological problem,

06:26.220 --> 06:29.300
after saying that to be is to be a value of a variable,

06:29.340 --> 06:32.500
he says, well, of course, sometimes we

06:32.500 --> 06:35.420
speak as if certain sync-categorical expressions

06:35.420 --> 06:38.060
were names of entities.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.540
We talked last time about the roundness of pebbles,

06:40.540 --> 06:42.500
or the roundness of the clock.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.660
And you might think, actually, roundness

06:44.660 --> 06:46.860
is something I don't want to recognize.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.460
Admittedly, it looks like I'm quantifying over that.

06:49.460 --> 06:54.060
If I say pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.020
But I might want to think, no, that's

06:56.020 --> 06:57.900
an avoidable way of speaking.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.380
And there might be other things that it

06:59.380 --> 07:02.460
looks like I'm committed to by my use of a noun

07:02.460 --> 07:04.500
that I want to retreat and say there's no such thing.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.300
Actually, one of Quine's favorite examples

07:06.300 --> 07:08.700
is to say for the sake of something.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.180
I did it for her sake.

07:12.180 --> 07:15.740
Does that mean there is an x such that I did it for her x?

07:15.740 --> 07:18.500
No, I mean, sakes aren't things, right?

07:18.500 --> 07:21.340
That's something we'd want to paraphrase in some other way.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.340
If I did that for my wife's sake,

07:23.340 --> 07:25.820
then I want to be ontologically committed to my wife.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.340
But I don't want to be ontologically committed

07:27.340 --> 07:28.340
to her sake.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.700
I don't know what that would even be, right?

07:30.700 --> 07:35.180
So sometimes he says, we speak as if these things are actually

07:35.180 --> 07:38.460
names of entities, but we hold that these are merely

07:38.460 --> 07:40.740
manners of speaking, that the expressions are not actually

07:40.740 --> 07:44.180
names, that the alleged entities are convenient fictions.

07:44.180 --> 07:46.300
This notion of fiction can be given a clear meaning

07:46.300 --> 07:48.260
from the point of view of the present developments

07:48.260 --> 07:50.980
to speak as if certain expressions were names

07:50.980 --> 07:53.540
is to allow those expressions to replace and be replaced

07:53.540 --> 07:56.180
by variables according to the laws of quantification.

07:56.180 --> 07:59.580
But if this is to be merely a convenient and theoretically

07:59.580 --> 08:01.340
avoidable manner of speaking, we must

08:01.340 --> 08:05.460
be able to translate such usage into another idiom, which

08:05.460 --> 08:07.420
does not require the expressions in question

08:07.420 --> 08:10.540
to replace and be replaced by variables.

08:10.540 --> 08:14.980
So there is another possibility that emerges here.

08:14.980 --> 08:17.900
This is, you might say, the basic way to be committed.

08:17.900 --> 08:21.780
But now we can also say sometimes these things

08:21.900 --> 08:22.980
are avoidable.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.020
So we can say, here's a criterion

08:25.020 --> 08:26.180
of being committed to something.

08:26.180 --> 08:28.420
To be is to be a value of a variable.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.940
It's for us to include it in the domain.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.060
But then we can say, well, all right,

08:33.060 --> 08:34.700
there's another way of looking at this.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.860
Sometimes we do that, and yet we think, nevertheless,

08:38.860 --> 08:40.900
the term is really synchro-grammatic.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.580
We're not really committed, OK?

08:43.580 --> 08:47.140
And so when we really have commitment,

08:47.140 --> 08:48.980
when we can't avoid this.

08:48.980 --> 08:51.660
So sometimes, Quine just puts it this way.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.100
But sometimes he puts it in a different way.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.660
And we'll see an exact formulation

08:55.660 --> 08:58.380
of that in his essay on what there is.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.660
It's really, to be is to be something

09:00.660 --> 09:02.860
that has to be in the domain for what

09:02.860 --> 09:04.140
we're saying to be true.

09:04.140 --> 09:07.780
And it might be that it has to be in the domain directly

09:07.780 --> 09:10.860
because we're saying there are a's and there are a's in the domain.

09:10.860 --> 09:16.340
But sometimes it's the case in this very indirect fashion.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.860
We say there are a's, but really that's

09:18.860 --> 09:20.620
an avoidable way of speaking.

09:20.620 --> 09:24.860
And in the end, what we are quantifying over in our final

09:24.860 --> 09:27.220
domain is just the things we have to recognize,

09:27.220 --> 09:29.100
some things we translate.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.020
So in short, there's this possibility

09:31.020 --> 09:34.340
of, well, reduction of translation,

09:34.340 --> 09:37.100
of eliminating certain ways of speaking.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.420
And before we formulate that in official terms,

09:40.420 --> 09:42.180
I want to give us some examples and see

09:42.180 --> 09:44.780
how he thinks about this.

09:44.780 --> 09:48.060
So let's turn back to on what there is.

09:48.060 --> 09:51.900
Because here he formulates a nice puzzle right at the outset.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.460
Suppose there are two philosophers,

09:53.460 --> 09:56.100
MacEx and I, differing over ontology.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.940
Suppose MacEx maintains there is something which I maintain.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.100
There is not.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.540
MacEx can, quite consistently with his own point of view,

10:02.540 --> 10:03.780
describe our difference of opinion

10:03.780 --> 10:06.820
by saying I refuse to recognize certain entities.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.340
I should protest, of course, that he's

10:08.340 --> 10:10.060
wrong in his formulation of our disagreement,

10:10.060 --> 10:12.180
for I maintain there are no entities in the kind which he

10:12.180 --> 10:13.860
alleges for me to recognize.

10:13.860 --> 10:16.420
But my finding him wrong in this formulation of our disagreement

10:16.420 --> 10:18.700
is unimportant, for I'm committed to considering him wrong

10:18.700 --> 10:20.380
in his ontology anyway.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.460
When I try to formulate our difference of opinion,

10:22.460 --> 10:24.780
on the other hand, I seem to be in a predicament.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.100
I can't admit that there are some things which MacEx

10:27.100 --> 10:29.940
countensess and I do not, for admitting that there are such

10:29.940 --> 10:32.700
things I should be contradicting my own rejection of them.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.380
Now notice what he can't say.

10:34.380 --> 10:38.580
Yeah, there's some things that MacEx countensess that I don't.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.580
Because if I am saying that, look what I'm saying.

10:40.580 --> 10:44.140
There are things that he recognizes that I don't.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.700
And it sounds like I'm saying there are things

10:46.700 --> 10:48.580
that I don't believe in.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.380
But wait a minute.

10:50.380 --> 10:54.460
If I confess that there are things that I think there aren't,

10:54.460 --> 10:56.900
it sounds like I'm contradicting myself, right?

10:56.900 --> 10:59.620
Or at least I'm saying that my own beliefs are false.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.540
I'm saying, yeah, you know, there are these things

11:01.540 --> 11:03.820
that I don't think there are.

11:03.820 --> 11:06.820
And so it looks like I'm in trouble.

11:06.820 --> 11:09.060
Now, he says, it looks like this reason

11:09.060 --> 11:11.940
can sound that anybody in the logical dispute who's

11:11.940 --> 11:16.020
denying the existence of anything is a severe disadvantage.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.860
Because the moment you try to say, yeah, there

11:17.860 --> 11:20.060
are these things that I don't accept,

11:20.060 --> 11:21.900
it looks like you're actually committing yourself

11:21.900 --> 11:24.460
to the things and undermining your own position.

11:24.460 --> 11:27.260
Well, this, he says, is the old platonic riddle of non-being.

11:27.260 --> 11:29.140
Non-being must, in some sense, be.

11:29.140 --> 11:31.580
Otherwise, what is it that there is not?

11:31.580 --> 11:34.500
This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's beard.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.940
Historically, it's proved tough, frequently dulling

11:36.940 --> 11:39.100
the edge of Occam's reason.

11:39.140 --> 11:42.500
That's some of that great writing that I was mentioning.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.820
So he says, consider Pegasus.

11:44.820 --> 11:48.060
We want to say something like this.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.180
Does Pegasus exist?

11:51.180 --> 11:51.680
No.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.820
No, right?

11:52.820 --> 11:55.100
Pegasus is supposedly a winged horse.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.460
But there are no winged horses, so we might say yes.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.380
Pegasus does not exist.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.420
But now you might think, well, this is a problem.

12:06.420 --> 12:10.020
What does our logic do with constants, with names?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.420
Well, they have to stand for things in the domain.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.100
So you might think, ah, OK, so I see what's happening here.

12:16.100 --> 12:20.780
This is like saying, gosh, my shirt is not blue.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.780
And what's going on there?

12:22.780 --> 12:25.540
Well, I'm referring to the shirt.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.260
And then I'm saying something about it, right?

12:27.260 --> 12:28.620
That it is not blue.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.580
So I may think, OK, so similarly here,

12:30.580 --> 12:32.540
I'm saying something about Pegasus.

12:32.540 --> 12:35.540
This winged horse.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.780
Yeah, horses have manes, they have eyes.

12:41.780 --> 12:42.860
So there we go.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.180
Pegasus, OK?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.260
And I'm saying it doesn't exist.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.420
Like saying, my shirt is not blue, there's Pegasus.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.300
And Pegasus doesn't exist.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.900
But now, that's weird, right?

12:52.900 --> 12:54.500
For one thing to say it doesn't exist,

12:54.500 --> 12:56.540
that's a bad thing to predicate an object.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.820
But secondly, it looks like I have to have an object.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.780
So my domain has Pegasus in it.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.420
And then I'm saying, but Pegasus doesn't exist.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.220
And so I'm in trouble.

13:05.220 --> 13:10.180
Now, gosh, what do I do about it?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.500
It's a problem with all of these names

13:12.500 --> 13:13.900
that don't denote anything.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.100
How should I, in general, deal with those things?

13:17.100 --> 13:19.740
It becomes a problem in logic.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.940
And so there are various ways of dealing with it.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.860
Quiet outlines one in this essay.

13:23.860 --> 13:26.820
There's an entire branch of logic called free logic

13:26.820 --> 13:29.820
that tries to accept that there are terms like Pegasus that

13:29.820 --> 13:32.500
don't denote anything and to allow them in the logic.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.660
But then what you do, you can't allow yourself

13:34.660 --> 13:37.260
to go from Pegasus doesn't exist to, OK,

13:37.260 --> 13:39.580
there are things that don't exist.

13:39.580 --> 13:42.500
And in fact, that's a good test case.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.620
Suppose I say, there are things that don't exist.

13:46.620 --> 13:47.740
Does that make sense?

13:47.740 --> 13:51.620
Or is that somehow self-contradictory?

13:51.620 --> 13:53.300
Self-contradictory.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.060
OK, Klein wants you to think, yes, that's self-contradictory.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.740
There are things that don't exist.

13:57.740 --> 13:58.300
What do you mean?

13:58.300 --> 14:00.420
You're saying there are things that there aren't?

14:00.420 --> 14:02.060
That's absurd, OK?

14:02.060 --> 14:04.820
And so he's trying to get that intuition going.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.100
Now, there were other philosophers

14:06.100 --> 14:07.980
who think it makes perfectly good sense.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.900
Terence Parsons writes a book on non-existent objects, in fact.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.780
And one of the things he says right at the start

14:14.780 --> 14:17.580
is there are some things that don't exist, like Pegasus.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.940
For example, and he thinks that's just fine,

14:19.940 --> 14:22.180
and we can say that without any problem.

14:22.180 --> 14:25.180
In fact, it's great.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.940
His dedication is to my parents, without whom I might have

14:27.940 --> 14:31.380
been one, and mine is to love it.

14:31.380 --> 14:36.580
So anyway, that's something that you could say is up for dispute,

14:36.580 --> 14:38.540
whether you can say intelligently there

14:38.540 --> 14:40.700
are things that don't exist.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.660
But many of it, let's get back to Pegasus.

14:42.660 --> 14:43.820
Pegasus doesn't exist.

14:43.820 --> 14:46.180
We don't want that model of what's going on here.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.700
But what can we do?

14:47.700 --> 14:50.220
Well, our philosopher, Meg X, is thinking about this.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.180
And says, well, actually, I don't want to say

14:52.180 --> 14:54.100
there are rain horses, right?

14:54.100 --> 14:56.580
In fact, it looks like I've got a problem.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.980
Because if I've now got Pegasus in my domain,

14:59.980 --> 15:05.220
and I've got this, like Pegasus is a horse.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.020
That seems true.

15:07.020 --> 15:09.380
Pegasus is white.

15:09.380 --> 15:13.060
Pegasus is winged.

15:13.060 --> 15:16.100
Now I've got white winged horses in my domain.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.740
And so we can actually get Pegasus out there to say,

15:18.740 --> 15:22.100
look, some horses have wings.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.300
And it will turn out to be true, right?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.060
But I don't want to say that's true.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.340
And it doesn't help to say, of course, some horses have wings.

15:30.340 --> 15:32.780
Pegasus, for example, you still want to say,

15:32.780 --> 15:35.140
no, Pegasus isn't real.

15:35.140 --> 15:37.020
And so what can you do?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.660
Well, one way to do it is to try to turn Pegasus

15:39.660 --> 15:41.100
into something else.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.620
So Meg X here, for example, says, ah, yeah, of course,

15:44.620 --> 15:47.540
I don't want to say there's an actual horse that is white,

15:47.540 --> 15:50.020
it has wings, and is written by Valerafon, and so on,

15:50.020 --> 15:51.820
as in medical stories.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.860
No, instead, I'm saying there is something

15:53.860 --> 16:00.100
like the idea of Pegasus, the idea, the concept of Pegasus.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.900
So maybe this exists in the realm of ideas, or concepts,

16:03.900 --> 16:06.620
or something like that.

16:06.620 --> 16:09.580
And indeed, we can say, yeah, a fellow doesn't really exist,

16:09.580 --> 16:12.300
but a fellow exists in the realm of characters,

16:12.300 --> 16:13.500
for Shakespeare.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.940
And so we could have realms of ideas, of concepts,

16:16.940 --> 16:19.980
of characters, of fictions, and so forth,

16:19.980 --> 16:21.740
where we want to say the object exists,

16:21.740 --> 16:23.460
but in that special world.

16:23.460 --> 16:27.620
So maybe this is ideas, maybe this is a realm of fictions,

16:27.620 --> 16:31.140
maybe it's a realm of characters,

16:31.140 --> 16:35.940
or of mythological creatures, whatever

16:35.940 --> 16:40.380
we want to say about this, we find some way of putting it

16:40.380 --> 16:42.460
in a place where it doesn't do any harm,

16:42.460 --> 16:47.180
and where we don't have to admit that it's a real horse.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.940
Well, Klein doesn't like that option of saying,

16:50.940 --> 16:52.260
it's just an idea.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.180
And so when I say Pegasus doesn't exist,

16:54.180 --> 16:56.420
I'm referring to an idea, or a fiction, or a character,

16:56.420 --> 16:59.460
or a mythological creature, and saying that it doesn't exist.

16:59.460 --> 17:03.260
Now, why doesn't he like that option?

17:03.260 --> 17:04.140
What's wrong with that?

17:13.020 --> 17:14.700
Does he talk about meaning and beings?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.300
Is that where he goes with this?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.700
Well, eventually, yes.

17:17.700 --> 17:21.540
But the outset, there's something wrong with just the idea part.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.220
Think about something that does exist.

17:25.220 --> 17:28.940
Are you going to, is that a claim about an idea too?

17:28.940 --> 17:35.100
Suppose I say that Harvey Friedman exists.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.340
There really is a person named Harvey Friedman.

17:37.340 --> 17:40.020
He's giving a talk at four o'clock today.

17:40.020 --> 17:42.980
And so there really is that guy.

17:42.980 --> 17:46.060
And now, if I say Harvey Friedman exists,

17:46.060 --> 17:48.580
am I saying that, oh, am I talking about the idea

17:48.580 --> 17:52.140
of Harvey Friedman, or a mythological creature

17:52.140 --> 17:54.660
of Harvey Friedman, or a character, or a fiction?

17:54.660 --> 17:55.300
No, right?

17:55.300 --> 18:00.340
I'm actually talking about this person, this mathematician.

18:00.340 --> 18:05.180
And it looks as if, in that case, you say, well, gee,

18:05.180 --> 18:06.340
it's very clear, right?

18:06.340 --> 18:09.580
I've got this here I am, let's say, and here's my mind.

18:09.580 --> 18:12.980
And I've got this idea of Harvey Friedman.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.620
But then here's Harvey Friedman.

18:19.220 --> 18:23.140
Wow, that's a great picture of him.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.900
He wears glasses.

18:25.900 --> 18:26.540
That's ridiculous.

18:26.540 --> 18:30.700
But anyway, I'm not tempted to confuse Harvey Friedman

18:30.700 --> 18:33.060
with my idea of Harvey Friedman.

18:33.060 --> 18:34.940
My idea of Harvey Friedman is mental,

18:34.940 --> 18:36.980
but Harvey Friedman isn't mental.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.860
He's an actual guy.

18:37.860 --> 18:39.740
He's an actual mathematician.

18:39.740 --> 18:43.500
And so you might say, look, I'm in no danger with that.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.940
His example in the essay is the Parthenon.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.700
I'm not going to confuse the Parthenon, which

18:47.700 --> 18:50.780
is on the Acropolis, from my idea of the Parthenon,

18:50.780 --> 18:52.900
which is in my head.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.820
And so it's very clear there when

18:54.820 --> 18:57.900
I'm talking about the Parthenon or Harvey Friedman,

18:57.900 --> 18:59.780
and when I'm talking about my idea of the Parthenon

18:59.780 --> 19:03.100
or my idea of Harvey Friedman.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.980
Yet, if I look at Pegasus, well, now,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.420
it looks like I'm getting confused.

19:08.420 --> 19:09.740
Pegasus doesn't exist.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.220
I'm talking about the horse, right?

19:11.220 --> 19:13.580
It's saying it doesn't exist, but I'm talking about my idea.

19:13.580 --> 19:14.220
Yeah?

19:14.220 --> 19:18.780
How does this relate to idealism?

19:18.780 --> 19:20.940
Is this kind of what gave rise to the idea

19:20.940 --> 19:24.220
of everything not just in your head?

19:24.220 --> 19:26.540
Because this seems to presuppose some sort of realism,

19:26.540 --> 19:28.180
right?

19:28.180 --> 19:31.300
That there is a Harvey Friedman in the real world,

19:31.300 --> 19:34.100
and not just in the mind.

19:34.100 --> 19:37.700
Well, Coyne is thinking of realistic terms.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.900
He's framing this in realistic terms.

19:39.900 --> 19:43.820
MacEx historically probably stands for MacTigert,

19:43.820 --> 19:45.380
who is an idealist.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.260
And so one way to interpret what's going on in this essay

19:48.260 --> 19:50.340
is that it is an attack on idealism.

19:50.340 --> 19:51.940
On the other hand, I'm not sure that's

19:51.940 --> 19:52.940
the best way to look at it.

19:52.940 --> 19:55.700
Because everything, and in fact, I

19:55.700 --> 19:57.580
think it's part of the reason that Coyne refers

19:57.580 --> 20:00.500
to fictional philosophers here, rather than actually engaging

20:00.500 --> 20:01.860
specific people.

20:01.860 --> 20:04.820
It's because even the idealist is

20:04.820 --> 20:07.580
going to have to draw a distinction between the things that

20:07.580 --> 20:09.860
are mind dependent in this way and the things that

20:09.860 --> 20:12.180
are mind dependent in that way, right?

20:12.220 --> 20:16.620
So the Parthenon will be mind dependent if I'm

20:16.620 --> 20:19.740
an idealist, holding that everything is mind dependent.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.540
But I can also then refer to my idea of the Parthenon.

20:22.540 --> 20:26.060
I'm not identifying them as an idealist.

20:26.060 --> 20:29.340
Moreover, I still want to draw the distinction between Pegasus

20:29.340 --> 20:30.420
and the Parthenon.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.740
The Parthenon really exists.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.300
And Pegasus doesn't.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.700
They both are, in a sense, mental projections or constructions

20:37.700 --> 20:39.380
from an idealist's point of view.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.940
But they have a really different character.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.060
You can actually go to see the Parthenon.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.980
But you can't go see Pegasus.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.820
And so there's something fundamental.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.980
You can go hear Harvey Friedman talk.

20:48.980 --> 20:52.660
But if I say Santa Claus is going to be on campus

20:52.660 --> 20:57.940
on December 25th, you can't wait around and go here

20:57.940 --> 20:59.220
and talk by Santa Claus.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.500
So something different is going on, even

21:01.500 --> 21:03.460
from an idealist's point of view.

21:03.460 --> 21:06.740
Idealists would distinguish between their idea of the Parthenon

21:06.740 --> 21:08.620
and the actual Parthenon.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.380
Sure, I think they have to.

21:10.380 --> 21:12.700
Now, there's going to be an intimate relationship

21:12.700 --> 21:13.620
between them.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.100
What is that going to look like?

21:15.100 --> 21:20.380
Suppose we took the following idea.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.700
We thought, and Russell thinks this at a certain stage,

21:23.700 --> 21:26.260
so does John Stuart Mill.

21:26.260 --> 21:29.780
They are in this stage of their thinking phenomenalist.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.500
And so they're, in a sense, saying,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.580
what we call a physical object is really

21:33.580 --> 21:37.060
just a collection of actual and possible sensations.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.220
Now, since sensations are mental,

21:39.220 --> 21:41.860
this is a way of being an idealist.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.580
And if you take that view, then what's

21:44.580 --> 21:48.140
the difference between Pegasus, for example,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.820
and the Parthenon?

21:49.820 --> 21:52.780
Well, in both cases, you're identifying the object

21:52.780 --> 21:56.540
with these actual and possible sensations of them.

21:56.540 --> 22:00.940
But now, yeah, so what does existence

22:00.940 --> 22:03.420
come to for an idealist?

22:03.420 --> 22:07.020
How do we distinguish that actual and possible,

22:07.020 --> 22:10.540
I should say, the collection of actual and possible sensations

22:10.540 --> 22:13.300
of a real thing as opposed to a collection

22:13.300 --> 22:18.460
of actual and possible sensations of a fictional?

22:18.460 --> 22:21.820
Presumably all of those are possible, right, but not actual.

22:21.820 --> 22:23.900
These are, well, there are some actual ones,

22:23.900 --> 22:25.260
but possible ones.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.860
On the other hand, they're real things that nobody's seen.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.340
And so I don't want to just say, oh,

22:30.340 --> 22:32.900
it's the difference between actuality and possibility,

22:32.900 --> 22:35.540
because there might be something we've had no actual sensations

22:36.300 --> 22:40.380
of that we hope to gain sensations of.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.420
So how could we do it before I do this?

22:45.660 --> 22:48.460
Yeah, some of you are.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.780
So there's one, I mean, it's a problem

22:51.780 --> 22:53.860
that any idealist needs to face.

22:53.860 --> 22:56.900
And interestingly enough, if you think about classic ideals,

22:56.900 --> 22:58.740
what would Barclay say about this, for example?

22:58.740 --> 23:01.060
What would Kant say about this?

23:01.060 --> 23:03.580
My answer is, I have no idea, because they don't address

23:03.580 --> 23:04.780
this question at all.

23:04.820 --> 23:08.820
What's Kant's account of fictional entities, or Barclay's

23:08.820 --> 23:11.460
account, this is not a problem they ever talk about.

23:11.460 --> 23:15.460
And so in a certain sense, you could say, gosh,

23:15.460 --> 23:17.380
have idealists recognize that they actually

23:17.380 --> 23:19.460
have a task to perform here?

23:19.460 --> 23:20.660
But let's help them out.

23:20.660 --> 23:21.660
What could you say?

23:25.340 --> 23:28.300
Collective belief.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.620
Collective belief, well, how would that help?

23:30.620 --> 23:32.460
I don't know, if multiple, well, I

23:32.460 --> 23:34.740
guess if you have some kind of threshold problem,

23:34.740 --> 23:36.860
people believe in something, and then that threshold

23:36.860 --> 23:38.420
is fulfilled, and you can turn that

23:38.420 --> 23:41.580
into an actual thing that exists.

23:41.580 --> 23:44.460
Oh, well, I should say, OK, look, here's the difference.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.100
Not many people believe in Pegasus.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.100
Lots of people believe in the Parthenon.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.740
That's what it comes down to.

23:49.740 --> 23:52.220
But gosh, that means if a religious revival sweeps through

23:52.220 --> 23:55.820
and everybody starts believing in God, God exists now, right?

23:55.820 --> 24:00.060
Or if people give up on religion, then God no longer exists.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.260
But that seems silly, right?

24:01.260 --> 24:02.780
Whether there's a God or not doesn't

24:02.780 --> 24:05.500
depend on how many people believe it.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.660
So that's one thing that's problematic.

24:07.660 --> 24:09.020
Secondly, it looks like it's going

24:09.020 --> 24:11.740
to wreak havoc with science, because suppose scientists

24:11.740 --> 24:14.300
become convinced that there is such a thing as flogistan,

24:14.300 --> 24:15.540
for example.

24:15.540 --> 24:18.460
And then our physical theory changes.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.460
Well, now, what do we say?

24:20.460 --> 24:23.860
Oh, yeah, there used to be this stuff called flogistan.

24:23.860 --> 24:27.660
And when you burn something, it was an escape of flogistan.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.580
But now, and it had negative weight and stuff,

24:29.580 --> 24:33.500
which is why it went up to the air and so on.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.580
But then it stopped existing.

24:36.580 --> 24:39.340
And all of a sudden, things started oxidizing.

24:39.340 --> 24:43.220
Gosh, before oxidation wasn't a thing.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.060
No, it's a thing.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.060
Flogistan used to be a thing.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.260
Found it all over the medieval world.

24:48.260 --> 24:53.060
But then around 1750, flogistan just went out of existence.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.540
And that seems ridiculous, right?

24:54.540 --> 24:56.140
That's not right.

24:56.180 --> 25:00.500
So it isn't entirely easy to figure out what to say.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.300
We might say, look, it's a question of systematic,

25:04.300 --> 25:08.060
predictable collections of actual and possible sensations.

25:08.060 --> 25:09.940
So then if I go and visit the Parthenon,

25:09.940 --> 25:11.020
I'm there on the Acropolis.

25:11.020 --> 25:12.220
I'm looking at it.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.620
I close my eyes, open them again.

25:14.620 --> 25:15.740
It's still there.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.380
I walk around to this side.

25:17.380 --> 25:18.740
It's still there.

25:18.740 --> 25:22.860
Whereas Pegasus, that's not necessarily the case.

25:22.860 --> 25:25.100
Suppose I'm imagining Pegasus, and then

25:25.100 --> 25:27.780
I stop imagining Pegasus.

25:27.780 --> 25:30.500
Do I suddenly then start imagining Pegasus again?

25:30.500 --> 25:31.020
No, right?

25:31.020 --> 25:32.820
It's not nearly so systematic.

25:32.820 --> 25:35.060
So you might say there's a kind of patterning

25:35.060 --> 25:37.380
to actual and possible sensations of the Parthenon,

25:37.380 --> 25:39.500
but there isn't the case of Pegasus.

25:39.500 --> 25:39.940
Yeah.

25:39.940 --> 25:43.180
Why can't the idealist just say that the Parthenon is an idea

25:43.180 --> 25:48.580
in the mind, and Pegasus is an idea of an idea?

25:48.580 --> 25:53.940
Parthenon is an idea, and Pegasus is an idea of an idea.

25:54.060 --> 25:56.500
And that's basically what Pegasus is.

25:56.500 --> 25:59.580
Well, but then how do we explain that Pegasus

25:59.580 --> 26:01.460
is a horse seems true?

26:01.460 --> 26:04.460
We'll just say, no, Pegasus is an idea of a horse.

26:04.460 --> 26:05.100
I say, no, no, no, no, no.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.820
Polarifon wrote Pegasus.

26:06.820 --> 26:09.820
No, you're saying the idea of Polarifon

26:09.820 --> 26:13.420
wrote the idea of Polarifon, Pegasus.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.980
So anyway, yeah, of all horses.

26:15.980 --> 26:16.780
Yeah, I don't know.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.880
I mean, there's an appealing thought there

26:18.880 --> 26:21.540
that it feels like there's some sort of difference in level.

26:21.540 --> 26:26.140
And yet, as soon as you start trying to think about how then we'd talk about these things,

26:26.140 --> 26:28.220
it's going to get really weird fast.

26:28.220 --> 26:32.260
So that's how to say we can't deal with that weirdness, maybe we can, and find a translation

26:32.260 --> 26:34.580
pattern that makes it make sense.

26:34.580 --> 26:37.340
But it's at least going to be an obstacle to that approach.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.340
Yeah?

26:38.340 --> 26:39.340
Yeah.

26:39.340 --> 26:42.340
I mean, it seems like, I don't know if this is even helpful at all, but when I'm talking

26:42.340 --> 26:48.980
about my idea of Parthenon and my idea of Pegasus, they can interact very easily in

26:48.980 --> 26:49.980
my ideas.

26:50.140 --> 26:56.020
I can talk about Pegasus landing on the Parthenon, and that's not problematic that they go together

26:56.020 --> 26:58.020
very well.

26:58.020 --> 27:03.860
So that you have ideas that could be fictional of real things, just like you have ideas of

27:03.860 --> 27:04.860
fictional things.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.340
Well, okay, good, good.

27:06.340 --> 27:11.780
Yes, this turns out to be a mess because of exactly what you're pointing out.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.980
There are all sorts of mixtures of real things and fictional things, right?

27:15.980 --> 27:19.100
Often stories that are fictional stories include some real things.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.100
But maybe not.

27:20.100 --> 27:23.860
Maybe in a science fiction universe, you're dealing with something where everything is

27:23.860 --> 27:28.020
really strictly imaginary, but often fiction isn't like that.

27:28.020 --> 27:30.340
It's based on something real.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.860
So Sherlock Holmes lives in London.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.860
London is a real place.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.220
It's not just fiction.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.860
But Sherlock Holmes is fictional, and so you've got this mixture of the fictional and the

27:39.860 --> 27:40.860
non-fictional.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.860
Similarly, you might have Pegasus landing on the Parthenon.

27:43.860 --> 27:48.620
Well, Pegasus in the story is a mythological creature, but on the other hand, the Parthenon

27:48.620 --> 27:52.260
is not mythological, and we mix them together in certain ways.

27:52.260 --> 27:57.100
And so if we've suddenly got some big difference in level, that's like, well, an idea landed

27:57.100 --> 27:59.020
on this, right?

27:59.020 --> 28:00.020
And that's going to be bizarre.

28:00.020 --> 28:02.700
How can an idea land on a building?

28:02.700 --> 28:06.580
So there's something very strange about those mixtures, and that's going to make it super

28:06.580 --> 28:11.220
hard to really sustain the difference in levels throughout.

28:11.220 --> 28:15.900
We want fictional things and non-fictional things to interact, at least in the fictions.

28:15.900 --> 28:22.700
So, oh gosh, maybe a case that's extreme in this instance is a historical novel.

28:22.700 --> 28:26.500
When I was a kid, I used to love these books called You Were There.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.540
You Were There at the Battle of Hastings.

28:28.540 --> 28:33.180
You Were There at the Battle of Guadalcanal or something, and it's written as if you're

28:33.180 --> 28:34.180
actually there.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.180
It's like, wow.

28:35.180 --> 28:40.620
In fact, if I were really there at the Battle of Guadalcanal or something, that'd be terrifying.

28:40.620 --> 28:43.500
But all of a sudden it's like, yes, you're nine years old and you were really there

28:43.500 --> 28:49.060
watching all the battle take place, and they were very effective fictions written for elementary

28:49.060 --> 28:52.540
school kids, putting you there in that situation.

28:52.540 --> 28:58.100
But of course, now what's going on is partly actual events from the battle.

28:58.100 --> 29:01.620
But it's partly, you know, you're not really there, and there are other characters you

29:01.620 --> 29:06.660
meet who are fictional characters, but inserted into this real historical situation.

29:06.660 --> 29:11.900
And so in historical novels, this sort of thing is going on all the time.

29:12.900 --> 29:17.660
If all of that's true, you might think, well, yes, we're going to have trouble actually

29:17.660 --> 29:25.180
referring to Pegasus in a way that separates these levels and keeps that distinction of

29:25.180 --> 29:26.900
levels going throughout.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.500
Intuitively speaking, there's something that feels right about it.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.900
We think, but wait, Pegasus is something like a character, is a fiction, is a mythological

29:33.900 --> 29:35.700
preacher.

29:35.700 --> 29:41.100
And yet to say, well, that just makes Pegasus mental in a certain way, that other things

29:41.100 --> 29:42.100
are not.

29:42.100 --> 29:46.100
Looks like it's going to be puzzled, not only from an idealist point of view, but from

29:46.100 --> 29:48.180
anybody's point of view.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.700
So what if we took another strategy?

29:50.700 --> 29:55.660
He says, ah, yes, now we have another philosopher, why?

29:55.660 --> 29:58.420
Who says, here's the way to think about this.

29:58.420 --> 30:01.380
And by the way, it's not just sort of a hypothetical approach.

30:01.380 --> 30:04.740
This is something taken by many people in free logic.

30:04.740 --> 30:09.540
This was the approach taken by Leblanc and Thomas in 1968, and it has a lot of intuitive

30:09.540 --> 30:10.700
appeal.

30:10.700 --> 30:19.220
The idea is really that we should think about a domain of possible objects.

30:19.220 --> 30:24.500
And then some of those are the actual objects.

30:24.500 --> 30:29.700
So if I say that Harvey Friedman exists, or the Parthenon exists, I'm putting Harvey

30:29.700 --> 30:32.900
Friedman or the Parthenon in the realm of actual objects.

30:32.900 --> 30:38.260
But Pegasus, if I say Pegasus doesn't exist, what I mean is Pegasus is out here in the

30:38.260 --> 30:40.380
realm of merely possible objects.

30:40.380 --> 30:44.380
So here's Harvey Friedman, here's the Parthenon, they're inside there.

30:44.380 --> 30:53.620
But now Pegasus or Sherlock Holmes, they are out here in the realm of merely possible objects.

30:53.620 --> 30:54.820
And then I can say exists.

30:54.820 --> 30:55.820
I understand what that means.

30:55.820 --> 30:58.820
It just refers to that subset of things.

30:58.820 --> 31:05.980
Okay, so just as we said here, ah, these are the things that are a's at some subset of

31:05.980 --> 31:06.980
our domain.

31:06.980 --> 31:12.340
The things that exist are some subset of the domain of possible objects.

31:12.340 --> 31:18.820
Now, actually, there is something intuitively plausible about that.

31:18.820 --> 31:21.820
Why does Quine object to that?

31:21.820 --> 31:24.700
The bald man in the doorway.

31:24.700 --> 31:25.820
Okay, good.

31:25.820 --> 31:28.300
There are really two arguments he gives.

31:28.300 --> 31:32.700
And one of them is precisely that one, the bald man in the doorway.

31:32.700 --> 31:38.700
The other one is concerning the round square cupola of Berkeley College, okay?

31:38.700 --> 31:50.300
So the first difficulty is now contradictory descriptions.

31:50.300 --> 31:59.300
The round square cupola.

31:59.300 --> 32:05.780
And then the second one is this thing about identity conditions.

32:05.780 --> 32:10.660
It becomes one of Quine's main themes, no entity without identity.

32:10.660 --> 32:15.220
For me to say there are such things as a's, for example, I not only have to postulate

32:15.220 --> 32:19.460
their existence, I have to give you some identity criteria.

32:19.460 --> 32:24.980
At least if a is a count now, there's a distinction between count nouns and mass nouns.

32:24.980 --> 32:25.980
Things like water, gold.

32:25.980 --> 32:34.980
And to say there is water, that would be just as the treat this as a master.

32:34.980 --> 32:38.580
How do you deal, how do you understand those as complicated, but a count noun like there

32:38.580 --> 32:47.380
is a person, there is a piece of chalk, there is a flying horse, etc., those things seem

32:47.380 --> 32:51.700
to require not only do we say these things exist, but to give us some idea of what makes

32:51.700 --> 32:55.220
for there being one or two or three of these.

32:55.220 --> 32:59.940
We seem to need criteria of identification and individuation.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.340
How do I tell one piece of chalk from another?

33:02.340 --> 33:06.180
How do I re-identify something as the same piece of chalk?

33:06.180 --> 33:11.060
Well those questions of identity are crucial for actually talking about objects of a certain

33:11.060 --> 33:14.900
kind and we need that, he says, for these.

33:14.900 --> 33:18.340
So let's take the first argument, contradictory descriptions.

33:18.340 --> 33:20.460
What do we do with the round square cupola?

33:20.460 --> 33:25.860
Do we put it in the realm of possible objects?

33:25.860 --> 33:27.020
That's going to trouble, right?

33:27.020 --> 33:30.620
Because then we're saying it's possible that there's something that's both round and square.

33:30.620 --> 33:33.220
Could anything be both round and square?

33:33.220 --> 33:34.420
No.

33:34.420 --> 33:38.940
So the difficulty here is that it looks like that's impossible.

33:38.940 --> 33:42.300
But now I could either take the description or I could give it a name.

33:42.300 --> 33:48.300
I could say, ah, yes, Franklin, that beautiful round square cupola on Berkeley College.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.620
And now you might say, wait a minute, Franklin is now denoting an impossible object.

33:52.620 --> 33:54.420
So I seem to have a choice.

33:54.420 --> 33:59.620
I can either say something that is false, right, that something could be both round

33:59.620 --> 34:05.540
and square, and I'm going to get contradictions out of that, or I say, well actually I need

34:05.540 --> 34:12.260
a broader realm now out here of impossible objects.

34:12.260 --> 34:17.060
And quite doesn't really go into that in detail, but now I'm going to have a realm of things

34:17.060 --> 34:18.860
that are both round and square.

34:18.860 --> 34:22.180
I'm going to have a realm of things that have both two and three parts.

34:22.180 --> 34:30.660
I'm going to have a realm of things that are both white and black and red all over.

34:30.660 --> 34:34.900
And so I'm going to have all sorts of trouble if I introduce those, you might think.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.500
At least you might think.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.820
By the way, Klein does not actually deduce a contradiction from this, right?

34:40.820 --> 34:44.940
He says all sorts of embarrassing questions could be raised about those.

34:44.940 --> 34:50.900
He doesn't actually go through and raise those questions and attack this.

34:50.900 --> 34:56.740
However, he catches Wyman saying, actually I think something like this is meaningless,

34:56.740 --> 35:00.580
and that's very strange to say as Wyman points out.

35:00.580 --> 35:06.060
Something that is white and red and black all over is different from something that's

35:06.060 --> 35:07.700
both round and square, right?

35:07.700 --> 35:09.780
We cannot understand the meaning of both.

35:09.780 --> 35:13.700
In fact, it's by virtue of understanding the meaning that we realize there could be no

35:13.700 --> 35:14.700
such thing.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.100
That won't fly at all.

35:16.100 --> 35:19.300
So it looks like this is problematic.

35:19.300 --> 35:20.940
What about the identity conditions?

35:20.940 --> 35:23.700
This is perhaps the most famous passage in the essay.

35:23.700 --> 35:27.220
Can I just ask you some questions here?

35:27.220 --> 35:36.300
So when he's saying that, no, that's not meaningless because it has meaning, does that go back

35:36.380 --> 35:44.580
to sort of what Karnat was doing is like the logical optimists are saying all these

35:44.580 --> 35:49.060
things have no meaning because they can't be very...

35:49.060 --> 35:51.140
Okay, yes.

35:51.140 --> 35:54.780
We are here floating around with that same question of significance.

35:54.780 --> 35:55.780
What has meaning?

35:55.780 --> 35:56.780
What doesn't have meaning?

35:56.780 --> 35:58.580
Can we draw a distinction?

35:58.580 --> 36:03.460
And there are going to be several things that are difficult about this one.

36:03.460 --> 36:06.140
One that he points out is a purely logical problem.

36:06.140 --> 36:11.780
Church's theorem implies that in the Rommel first horiologic, validity is undecidable.

36:11.780 --> 36:14.540
There is no decision procedure for validity.

36:14.540 --> 36:18.060
That means there is no decision procedure for contradictoryness.

36:18.060 --> 36:24.060
So if whether something is possible, consistent or contradictory, is at issue, that's an undecidable

36:24.060 --> 36:25.060
question.

36:25.060 --> 36:28.540
But it's weird to think that it's undecidable whether something has meaning or not.

36:28.540 --> 36:32.860
We'd like to have not only some criterion, but some way of deciding in principle in a

36:32.860 --> 36:37.260
finite time whether this is meaningful or not.

36:37.260 --> 36:42.700
And so he wants to say, look, if it turns out that contradictions are meaningless, you're

36:42.700 --> 36:47.860
already basically saying the distinction between the meaningful and the meaningless is undecidable.

36:47.860 --> 36:50.540
And that's a creepy thing to say.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.180
So there's that problem.

36:52.180 --> 36:59.740
But in addition to that, you might think there is a difficulty about, well, you might...

36:59.740 --> 37:02.140
Let's relate to Hepple's criteria.

37:02.140 --> 37:04.420
Remember he said there's a criterion of adequacy.

37:04.420 --> 37:07.940
And one of the things that was a corollary from that is that A should be meaningful

37:07.940 --> 37:10.300
if and only if not A is meaningful.

37:10.300 --> 37:15.300
If I understand a sentence, putting in a not should preserve meaning, or taking a not away

37:15.300 --> 37:17.220
should preserve meaning.

37:17.220 --> 37:21.580
But what happens here is basically something that is a contradiction.

37:21.580 --> 37:23.900
The negation of that will be a logical truth.

37:23.900 --> 37:28.100
If I've got something that comes down to P and not P, but then I negate that, I've got

37:28.100 --> 37:29.540
a logical truth.

37:29.540 --> 37:34.740
And so if it turns out that contradictions are meaningless, it's also got to turn out,

37:34.740 --> 37:40.100
if Hepple's right, that logical truths are meaningless.

37:40.100 --> 37:44.300
And so actually we won't just say the round square, oh, meaningless, we're going to have

37:44.300 --> 37:48.900
to say the claim that nothing could be both rounded square is meaningless.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.860
And some philosophers are willing to do that.

37:50.860 --> 37:54.300
Wittgenstein in the Tractatus actually thinks about x equals x.

37:54.300 --> 37:59.420
Actually, is it in the, I'm sorry, I've forgotten now whether it's in the Tractatus

37:59.500 --> 38:01.300
or the Investigations.

38:01.300 --> 38:04.500
But Wittgenstein at some point thinks about x equals x.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.860
And he says that has no use.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.220
It has no function.

38:09.220 --> 38:13.180
So actually the claim that x is equal to x is meaningless.

38:13.180 --> 38:15.860
And that's a very strange thing to say.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.020
But you can see maybe why somebody would be led to think it.

38:19.020 --> 38:23.460
Because A should be meaningful if not only if not A is meaningful.

38:23.460 --> 38:28.220
So to say x equals x is meaningful is basically to say that x is not equal to x is

38:28.220 --> 38:31.300
meaningful, which it is, it is meaningful.

38:31.300 --> 38:36.380
But anyway, it's going to turn out not only contradictions have to be meaningless

38:36.380 --> 38:39.220
on this criterion, so would logical truths.

38:39.220 --> 38:42.180
And that's a hard thing, I think, to swallow.

38:42.180 --> 38:46.220
But now let's get back to the identity conditions argument.

38:46.220 --> 38:49.500
Wyman's overpopulated universe is in many ways unlovely.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.940
It offends the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.300
But this is not the worst of it.

38:55.300 --> 38:59.460
Wyman's slum of possibles is a greedy crowd for disorderly elements.

38:59.460 --> 39:02.700
Take, for instance, the possible fat man in that doorway.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.780
And again, the possible bald man in that doorway.

39:04.780 --> 39:07.460
Are they the same possible man or two possible men?

39:07.460 --> 39:08.540
How do we decide?

39:08.540 --> 39:10.980
How many possible men are in that doorway?

39:10.980 --> 39:13.660
Are there more possible thin ones than fat ones?

39:13.660 --> 39:14.860
How many of them are alike?

39:14.860 --> 39:16.660
Or would there be a like, make them one?

39:16.660 --> 39:18.260
Are no two possible things alike?

39:18.260 --> 39:21.260
Is this the same as saying it's impossible for two things to be alike?

39:21.260 --> 39:24.460
Or finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable

39:24.460 --> 39:25.980
to unactualized possibles?

39:25.980 --> 39:27.900
But what sense can be found with hugging of entities

39:27.900 --> 39:30.340
which cannot meaningfully be said to be identical with themselves

39:30.340 --> 39:31.780
and distinct from one another?

39:31.780 --> 39:33.900
These elements are well-nigh and original.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.820
By fregian therapy of individual concepts,

39:35.820 --> 39:37.900
some members might be made of rehabilitation.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.740
But I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum

39:40.740 --> 39:42.700
and be done with it.

39:42.700 --> 39:47.260
Now, is there an argument there?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.260
And if so, what kind of argument is it?

39:49.980 --> 39:55.580
Well, let's look at the doorway.

39:55.580 --> 40:00.180
Is there a possible fat man in that doorway?

40:00.180 --> 40:01.540
Yes.

40:01.540 --> 40:05.060
OK, if we're going with this way of thinking about things, sure.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.100
Sure, right?

40:06.100 --> 40:08.900
All that is to say, there could be a fat man in that doorway.

40:08.900 --> 40:11.660
Now, presumably, it couldn't be too fat or you couldn't get into the doorway.

40:11.660 --> 40:15.420
But nevertheless, sure, there could be a fat man in that doorway.

40:15.420 --> 40:18.180
Could there be a bald man in that doorway?

40:18.180 --> 40:18.740
Sure.

40:18.820 --> 40:21.820
So there's a possible bald man in it.

40:21.820 --> 40:22.620
Are they the same?

40:26.500 --> 40:27.500
Well, good.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.940
Yeah, there are some possible men in that doorway

40:30.940 --> 40:32.780
that are both bald and fat.

40:32.780 --> 40:36.780
There's some that are bald and not fat, right?

40:36.780 --> 40:39.460
How many of them are there?

40:39.460 --> 40:40.340
What should Wyman say?

40:45.860 --> 40:48.180
Well, I think Wyman would say there was infinite, right?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.100
Infinitely many, yeah.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.940
There are infinitely many, right?

40:50.940 --> 40:54.580
Infinitely many possible bald men in the doorway.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.820
Infinitely many possible fat men in the doorway.

40:57.820 --> 41:00.260
Infinitely many that are both bald and fat.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.260
And so on.

41:01.260 --> 41:04.380
OK, so I think Wyman would actually

41:04.380 --> 41:06.420
be able to answer my questions.

41:06.420 --> 41:10.020
Now, how many of them are alike?

41:10.020 --> 41:16.060
Oh, could there be two, qualitatively, indiscernible fat bald

41:16.060 --> 41:17.300
possible men in the doorway?

41:20.980 --> 41:21.700
Sure, right?

41:21.700 --> 41:23.660
They could be identical twins.

41:23.660 --> 41:26.500
Sure, they could be alike.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.420
Is this or no two possible things alike?

41:28.420 --> 41:31.260
Well, sure, some of them are alike, right?

41:31.260 --> 41:33.300
And in fact, I could say, yeah, there

41:33.300 --> 41:36.140
could be a fat man in the doorway who goes away

41:36.140 --> 41:39.740
and then reappears, same possible fat man appearing.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.460
And so it doesn't seem as if these questions are really

41:42.460 --> 41:45.260
unanswerable if we go seriously about this and say,

41:45.260 --> 41:48.420
yeah, look, I'm talking about this domain to say

41:48.420 --> 41:50.500
there is a possible object here is to just say

41:50.500 --> 41:53.100
there could be an object such that blah, blah, blah.

41:53.100 --> 41:56.060
And I can say there could be the same object in that doorway,

41:56.060 --> 41:56.820
et cetera.

41:56.820 --> 41:59.740
So all of that can go out here would seem.

41:59.740 --> 42:03.940
And sure, I don't myself find this a very powerful argument.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.580
It seems to me easy for somebody who has Wyman's view

42:06.580 --> 42:08.420
to respond to these arguments.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.500
Now, the first one is more serious,

42:10.500 --> 42:13.500
because what do I do about things

42:13.540 --> 42:15.220
like the round square cupola?

42:15.220 --> 42:18.140
And if I'm doing it with respect to that, whatever I do,

42:18.140 --> 42:23.180
why don't I do the same thing with Pegasus and the detective

42:23.180 --> 42:26.660
in such and such a story and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

42:26.660 --> 42:30.180
So I think this is in a way a more serious problem

42:30.180 --> 42:32.020
just because of a viable way of solving it.

42:32.020 --> 42:34.500
Why can't I use it across the board?

42:34.500 --> 42:38.660
But this one seems to me a bit fishy.

42:38.660 --> 42:41.380
Anyway, whatever you think about that,

42:41.420 --> 42:43.820
Klein doesn't like this approach either.

42:43.820 --> 42:46.380
He wants to clear the slum and be done with it.

42:46.380 --> 42:48.140
So what does he do?

42:48.140 --> 42:49.540
How can we solve the problem?

42:52.540 --> 42:53.380
Russell.

42:54.780 --> 42:55.700
Russell, exactly.

42:55.700 --> 42:56.780
We rustled it.

42:56.780 --> 42:58.980
I've spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard

42:58.980 --> 43:00.500
and hinted that it's tangled.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.180
I've dwells at length on the inconveniences

43:02.180 --> 43:03.020
of putting up with it.

43:03.020 --> 43:05.300
It's time to think about taking steps.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.900
And so the answer is Russell.

43:06.900 --> 43:09.180
Now, how does Russell help us here?

43:09.180 --> 43:12.860
Well, we can think about Pegasus not existing

43:12.860 --> 43:16.060
and say, let's think about this in a slightly different way.

43:17.380 --> 43:19.740
Let's think about what we would do

43:19.740 --> 43:22.820
with something like the present king of France's ball.

43:22.820 --> 43:26.500
We don't say, aha, so there is a present king of France.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.980
But of course, he's just mythological, he's fictional.

43:28.980 --> 43:32.060
He's just an idea or he's a merely possible object.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.460
Instead, what Russell taught us

43:33.460 --> 43:35.420
is that we don't have to do any of that.

43:35.420 --> 43:38.020
We don't commit ourselves to a present king of France.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.700
We just say that saying there is one and only one king

43:40.700 --> 43:43.860
of France and that person is bald.

43:43.860 --> 43:47.460
But there isn't one and only one king of France, so false.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.220
And we're never committed there

43:49.220 --> 43:51.300
to there being a present king of France.

43:51.300 --> 43:53.500
So do the same thing with Pegasus.

43:53.500 --> 43:57.140
Now, we have to turn the name into some kind of description.

43:57.140 --> 44:00.740
And so we do have Pegasus as a name.

44:00.740 --> 44:04.300
Well, directly speaking, Russell's theory of descriptions

44:04.300 --> 44:05.460
doesn't apply to it.

44:05.460 --> 44:07.580
But even Russell thought proper names of this kind

44:07.580 --> 44:10.820
should be translated really into descriptions.

44:10.820 --> 44:15.140
And so it could be like the winged horse

44:15.140 --> 44:16.540
written by Bolairefond.

44:16.540 --> 44:19.340
It could be just the thing that Pegasizes.

44:19.340 --> 44:22.220
And so Quine says, you could just turn this into a verb.

44:22.220 --> 44:25.100
And so it could be the Pegasizer.

44:26.100 --> 44:42.980
But you can also just say the thing called Pegasus, which

44:42.980 --> 44:47.180
might seem a little bit less peculiar than the Pegasizer.

44:47.180 --> 44:49.740
In any case, what do we do if we do it that way?

44:49.740 --> 44:53.820
Then Pegasus doesn't exist to become something like this.

44:53.820 --> 44:58.580
There is, well, actually, yeah, Pegasus.

44:58.580 --> 45:00.340
Let's start with Pegasus as a horse.

45:05.300 --> 45:13.020
There is one and only one Pegasizer,

45:13.020 --> 45:19.020
or a thing called Pegasus, and it's a horse.

45:20.020 --> 45:24.020
Now, is that true or false?

45:24.020 --> 45:25.020
False.

45:25.020 --> 45:26.020
It's false, right?

45:26.020 --> 45:28.020
There is no such thing as Pegasus.

45:28.020 --> 45:31.020
There's nothing Pegasizes in the actual universe.

45:31.020 --> 45:33.020
And so we end up saying that's false.

45:33.020 --> 45:37.020
So the strategy was that Pegasus is, of course, false.

45:37.020 --> 45:40.020
What about Pegasus doesn't exist?

45:43.020 --> 45:45.020
What's going to happen there?

45:49.020 --> 46:00.020
It looks like we have to say there is one and only one Pegasizer,

46:00.020 --> 46:03.020
and it doesn't exist.

46:07.020 --> 46:10.020
But that sounds self-contradictory.

46:10.020 --> 46:13.020
That sounds like we're saying there's one and only one thing,

46:13.020 --> 46:15.020
and there is no such thing.

46:15.020 --> 46:18.020
And so it looks like that's not just false, but logically false.

46:18.020 --> 46:20.020
So this becomes logically false.

46:20.020 --> 46:24.020
So, actually, if we just try this strategy of Rossellian descriptions

46:24.020 --> 46:27.020
and apply it literally to this, we get trouble,

46:27.020 --> 46:29.020
because it looks like actually now,

46:29.020 --> 46:31.020
Mik-X can say hi-hi, don't you?

46:31.020 --> 46:37.020
It turns out this is actually contradictory.

46:37.020 --> 46:40.020
And so we're in trouble.

46:40.020 --> 46:42.020
Now, what can we do?

46:43.020 --> 46:48.020
Well, remember Rossell had this distinction

46:48.020 --> 46:52.020
between primary and secondary occurrences.

46:52.020 --> 46:54.020
So we can say, ah, wait a minute.

46:54.020 --> 46:57.020
This is the same thing as with the present king of France.

46:57.020 --> 46:59.020
That's not the way to do it.

46:59.020 --> 47:01.020
The way to do it is to say this.

47:01.020 --> 47:04.020
Not that there is one and only one thing and it doesn't exist,

47:04.020 --> 47:08.020
but to say it's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer

47:08.020 --> 47:10.020
and it exists.

47:13.020 --> 47:15.020
And then that's true.

47:15.020 --> 47:18.020
It's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer.

47:18.020 --> 47:21.020
And now it exists part is actually irrelevant.

47:21.020 --> 47:25.020
And so now we get something that's true and that occurs.

47:25.020 --> 47:27.020
But notice what this means.

47:27.020 --> 47:30.020
It means that actually something like Pegasus doesn't exist

47:30.020 --> 47:34.020
is ambiguous between a statement that's contradictory

47:34.020 --> 47:38.020
and a statement that is true.

47:38.020 --> 47:40.020
Now, why doesn't exactly bring that up?

47:40.020 --> 47:43.020
Partly because he doesn't like this as a predicate.

47:43.020 --> 47:46.020
He doesn't really want to think that it should be understood that way.

47:46.020 --> 47:50.020
But now the same thing is going to arise with attributes.

47:50.020 --> 47:53.020
We'll have to postpone until next time our talk of roundness

47:53.020 --> 47:56.020
and other sorts of attributes like redness.

47:56.020 --> 47:59.020
But what happens when we apply this strategy to it?

47:59.020 --> 48:03.020
Well, Friday we'll figure out how that all goes.
