00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
It's very hard to talk about what I want to talk about today without any logic.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
So we're going to have to actually introduce a little bit of logical terminology.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
We've been using it to some extent.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
And sometimes I think the best way to actually be introduced to logic as a philosopher is really just to see it appear

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
and start picking it up as a word without formal introduction.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
I remember telling my advisors and undergraduates that I was interested in logic.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
I thought I should take a course in logic.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
And he said, don't do it. A complete waste of time.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
If you can think or you can't.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
If you can already think, you don't need logic.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
And if you can't think, logic isn't going to help you.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
However, it seems to me that actually logic can help you a lot in thinking about certain philosophical issues.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
And so today we're going to have to actually encounter a little bit of logic

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
because Quine introduces in this paper that we're going to be discussing today

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
his famous thought that to be is to be a value of a variable.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And at first glance, that sounds absurd, right?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
And so you have to think, well, what does he mean to be a value of a variable?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
What is a variable anyway?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And how does it function in a logical system?

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
And so we're going to be led very quickly from questions about metaphysics to questions about logic.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And there's no avoiding that in a sense.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So I'm not going to do it in a very formal way,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
in a way that I would do it if I were introducing logic as logic.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
But nevertheless, we're going to have to actually confront that at certain points.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
So this paper itself, as I found out over the weekend, is really hard to track down.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
It was slated to appear in volume 9 of Her Ketnes, a journal of unified science in 1939.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Due to the outbreak of World War II, they moved the operations of the journal to Holland

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
and then the Nazis invaded Holland.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
And so this journal issue never appeared.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Hence when I said, well, yes, I forgot to scan it in from the book and it's not in quintessence.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
But hey, no problem.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm sure I can find a copy online.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
It turned out to be impossible to do that because, well, it never appeared.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
So even though it became a famous paper in this formulation that to be is to be a value of a variable,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
it became a very famous idea.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
It turns out that the paper in which it was actually articulated was not published

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
until 1966 when this collection of essays came out.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
It was circulated more informally before that.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
So let's start by taking a look at what Klein says here.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
As you can see, this is a well-loved book.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
The cover came off years ago.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I won't defile it with tapes of tape that can't go on.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
So I just keep carefully in place.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Anyway, what does it mean to ask?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
For example, whether there is such an entity as roundness?

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, we've got here thrown out a major ontological, a major metaphysical question from the medieval era,

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
at least whether we ought to recognize as components of the world things like roundness.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Well, we can't even go back before the medieval era to Plato and think,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
what is the ontological status of the forms?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Do the forms have some separate existence,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
apart from the objects that might exemplify them or might participate in them?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So we can ask about roundness.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
When we think about the ultimate constituents of the world,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
what do we do with roundness?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Is that one of the things that these Russell's phrase would have to count

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
as part of the furniture of the world?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Well, before we go into the question in some detail

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
and what Klein would have to say about it,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
let's think about that question all by itself.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
First glance, just intuitively, if I ask you what's in this room,

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
would you say, among the various things you might say, roundness?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
No.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay, no.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Klein agrees.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It's like, yeah, I would start saying,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
well, it's actually puzzling, there are two trash cans by the door.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I guess they must think people in this room generate a lot of garbage.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
There are a certain number of desks, there are people, there are blackboards,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
there's a computer, et cetera, et cetera, there's a clock.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
But I wouldn't stop to say, oh, yeah, right.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I mean, also the rectangularity of the blackboard

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
and the roundness of the clock.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And that means rectangularity, roundness.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And gosh, those lines are pretty straight, straightness,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
and curvedness, and blah, blah, blah.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I wouldn't start listing all those abstract things, right?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Now, why not?

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Why would I stop at talking about the clock and the blackboard

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
and not talk about rectangularity aroundness?

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Because they're qualities that physical objects have.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Ah, all right, there's a good Aristotelian answer.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
They're qualities that physical objects have.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So you might think, well, wait a minute.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Yes, we do talk about qualities and quantities and relations

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
and actions and affections and states and positions

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
and all the other things in Aristotle's categories.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
But in the end, it all depends on substance, right?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So the things there are in Aristotle's way of thinking

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
about the world really are the substances.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And then, yeah, so it's things like the clock.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And then the clock does have roundness,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
if we want to put it in that sort of language.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
But on the other hand, it's the clock that really exists here

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
and the qualities, the relations and so on, all of that.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
You might think if they have any sort of existence

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
at all, it's highly derivative.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
So remember we drew a distinction between metaphysics

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
and ontology.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
And ontology, we said, was the study of what there is.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
Really, we should perhaps say, well, hey, what there, gosh,

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
really is, ultimately is.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And then we said metaphysics includes that,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
but metaphysics is much broader.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Why is that true?

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
What does metaphysics include that ontology doesn't include?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
How you perceive what really is.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Ah, how you perceive what really is.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So you might think the connection between mind and world

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
is something that ought to be included here,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
not in other words just what the world ultimately consists of,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
but also something about how our minds relate to it.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
What else might be included under metaphysics?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Epistemology.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Well, usually epistemology is thought to be a separate topic,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
so that there's one question of what the world is like

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
and so on and then another, how we know that.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
So for example, if you say, well, ah, yeah, I mean,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
perception and the sense of how it is that we relate to the world.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
That is a very broad question.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
It has epistemological aspects as well as metaphysical aspects.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Sometimes those get deeply intertwined.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
And in fact, there are philosophers who think there isn't a sharp distinction

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
to be drawn between metaphysics and epistemology.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
So if you're inclined toward idealism or any variety of anti-realism,

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
you're going to think, but yeah, wait a minute, it's all tied up together.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I can't sort of have some radically non-epistemic way of thinking

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
about the way the world is, in which case it looks like epistemology

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
and metaphysics fused into this one big unit.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
But if we don't want to assume that from the start,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
we might say, well, the question of how we know the world is one thing,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
but then the question of what the world is like is another.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
That's going to include in a broad sense this connection,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
this question of the connection between mind and world,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
but might not include specifics about, well, for example,

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
how exactly we know universal statements or something like that.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
What else might be included in a metaphysical picture

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
that wouldn't be a matter of just counting the ultimate furniture in the universe?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
The relations between the pieces of furniture.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, the relations between the pieces of furniture.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Exactly.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
So you might say it's a question of identifying the structure of the world,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
of the things that ontology identifies,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
and not just those things and how they relate to one another,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
but also how various things that aren't ultimate constituents

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
are structured in terms of those.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So you might think there's a question of, actually,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I think we drew a fuzzy picture where, in a sense,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
ontology was a question of identifying these ultimate constituents.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
But then those things are structured into all sorts of complexes,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
as Russell might put it,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
and then we can talk about how those complexes relate to one another,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
and to the ultimate symbols, and so forth.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
So there are all these relations, there are all these constructions.

08:36.000 --> 08:44.000
Or if you want to think of this way, complexes and symbols.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
Now, in a sense, I can't tell you what I'm looking for here

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
without committing to some particular metaphysical theory, right?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Because the moment I say complexes and symbols,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
I'm now sort of invoking some kind of atomistic picture of the world.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And if I talk about constructions,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm already assuming these relations have a certain kind of character and so forth.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
So I'm putting things here that we've already identified

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
as going on in analytic philosophy.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
But actually, if you want to think much more broadly about this,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
you should realize, I'm just talking here about examples of a kind of relation

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
you might have in mind.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Presumably you're going to have a different way of thinking about those relationships

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
if you've got another metaphysical nature.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Are there other things that fit into metaphysics?

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
Questions about things like God that might be outside of the world,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
as we usually think of it?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, okay, so yeah, we think about various objects in the world,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
but then there are some that have special stats.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
So, you might think, look, it's one thing to talk about, let's say, atoms,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
physical atoms or minds or something like that.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
It's quite another to actually talk about God,

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
which seems to be not just one more object in the world,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
but to have some special status.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And the same thing you might think is true of personal identity,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
because after all, if you're thinking, wait a minute,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I also want to know as part of metaphysics who am I

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and what kind of thing am I?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And that's not just saying I'm an ultimate constituent or maybe I'm not.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Gosh, there's an ontological worry.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
What if you add up all the things in the world and I'm not among them?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Well, don't worry, you might say.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It's a separate metaphysical question.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Just what kind of thing am I?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Who am I?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
What am I?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And so, we might think that the nature of God,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
and for that matter of me, personal identity,

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
becomes a crucial thing to think about here.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I care not only about the tables and chairs of the world,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
the atoms and electrons and fields and so on,

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
but I also care about me and I care about whether or not there's a God.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Good.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
This is a start to thinking about metaphysics.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
It's something that includes a lot of stuff.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
And as we see here, well, as we will see,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Kline's essay starts with ontology.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
He really acts as if he's just dealing with this ontological question

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
about the ultimate constituents of the world.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, even more simply, just what it is to say that something is.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
But then, actually, he does destroy the distinction

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
between these ultimate constituents and other things.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
And so, we're going to have to think about the structuring

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
as well as just the sort of counting.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Now, so we've said, okay, for example, roundness.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Is there such an entity?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
He says, note that we can use the word roundness

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
without acknowledging any such entity as roundness.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
We can maintain that the word is in-categoromatic.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
So, there's a distinction that is, well, where does it go back to?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
It's found in, he mentions, well, actually, he doesn't mention.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
A lot of people mention William Obokam in this connection.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It goes back at least to Peter of Spain.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
And I'm not sure that Peter of Spain is the one in the 13th century

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
actually introduces this term for the first time.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
But there's a distinction from medieval logic

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
between categoromatic terms and sin-categoromatic terms.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
Now, Klein doesn't actually explain it.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
He just assumes you know this already,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
which is kind of an amazing thing because, like, who knows this?

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, I'm the sort of person who, just to brush up on my Latin,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
reads Peter of Spain in Latin because it's fun, okay?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
But I assume that I'm very, very weird for doing that.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
So, there aren't very many people who would just know what these terms mean often.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
But the idea in medieval logic is this.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
A sin-categoromatic term is one that doesn't really stand for anything.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
A categoromatic term does, okay?

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
So, to just put it very broadly, this stands for something,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
and often the medieval will say something definite.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
They're worried about problems of vagueness and things like,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
well, phrases like a man or whatever.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And a sin-categoromatic term is not like that.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
It doesn't stand for anything.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
So, if we think about items in language that we think of typically as

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
categoromatic as standing for something,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
what would those include from a grammatical point of view?

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
What do we take in language to be standard for something?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
A noun.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
A noun, typically, yeah, exactly.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
So, among both, for example, with proper names,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
but then there might be other kinds of nouns,

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
maybe common nouns,

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
or maybe noun phrases, determiner phrases.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
The details of that are going to vary with our linguistic theory.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
But now, sin-categoromatic terms, well, they don't stand for anything.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
So, what are some of the things in language we would think typically don't stand for anything?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah, good.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
So, we might think, well, adjectives are like that.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
If I say that thing is round, the clock is round,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
do I think that round names some entity?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Adverbs.

14:41.000 --> 14:49.000
Good, adverbs.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
He did it quickly.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Quickly, we don't think, stands for some object in the world.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Or I say, surprisingly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
You don't sort of think, oh, surprisingly, yeah, there's that thing again.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
He keeps talking about that.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Interesting object, surprisingly.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
No, there's no such thing that it's standing for.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And you might think, oh, not once you get going,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
there are lots of these, right?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I mean, what about the parts of speech?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Don't stand for anything.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Prepositions.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Prepositions, yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
A preposition doesn't stand for anything.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Queen of England.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, I say, oh, well, actually, there are three objects there.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
The queen, England, and of.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
But that seems silly somehow.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Numbers.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Numbers.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Ah, yeah, numbers.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Now, if that's an interesting one, because it looks as if when we say

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
1 plus 1 is 2, those look like proper names and things, right?

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
On the other hand, we can talk about five birds on the wire, for example.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
And there, five just seems to be an adjective.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
And so, numbers are weird because sometimes they act as proper names

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and sometimes they act as adjectives.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
And we're going to have to say something about how that sort of thing is possible.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
But yes, at least in the adjective version, it seems like it's hard to think of,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
oh, yeah, what was on the wire?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
There were these birds, and also the number five.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
On road trips before, I've tried, just like when I've been bored as hell,

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
I've tried to think of things like numbers that we can't live without

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
or that we need to explain the world with, but that you can't point to physically.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
What are other things that are like in that category?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I could never think of anything.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
All right, that's a great question, because in the end, this jumps us ahead a little bit.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
But good.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Quine is going to say, look, I don't actually care very much.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
What is required to make sense of your speech or my speech?

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Because he's convinced that a lot of what we say is more or less nonsense.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
And so the real question is going to be, what is required for the language of science?

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
And so you might say, yeah, this is all fine to talk about things in ordinary speech,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
parts of speech, and so on.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
But really, in the end, we're going to care about what science requires.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
And if you and I find it a little bit difficult to talk about the objects we're passing by

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
on the road trip or our own thoughts and feelings, well, who cares?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
In the end, we care about science, Quine says, and what science requires.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
So one way of looking at this is to say, you and I in our common speech,

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
we're using language for all sorts of purposes that aren't just describing the world.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
But the science, the job of science is really to focus on that question alone,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
to think what is required to describe the world.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
And so if I'm thinking about these questions of apology, what there really is,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
or metaphysics about the structure of the world,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
I mean, I care more about science than I care about ordinary language.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
You might divide the philosophers we've been talking about, in fact, into three categories.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
Depending upon their view of this, what are we really doing philosophy about?

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
In a sense, all of these early analytic philosophers think that language is key,

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
and that it's not just the language's useful tool in thinking about philosophical questions,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
but in a sense, philosophical questions are questions of language.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
But there are three types.

18:22.000 --> 18:31.000
And so you might say, we've got some of these people that we could call ideal language philosophers.

18:31.000 --> 18:39.000
Those are people like Fraga, Russell, Wittgenstein.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
What does ideal mean in this?

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Good question. What do I mean, ideal?

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
Well, yeah, what's special about the language of the Traptatus, for example?

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Or special about Russell's way of thinking about definite descriptions?

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
He thinks it's more revealing than ordinary speech, but how so?

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
Ideally, in what respect?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It's not ambiguous.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Good, it's not ambiguous, so that's one thing.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
It's got this, you know, clarity to it.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And so the clarity of the structure of this language is important.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Is there something else?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Closer to being true or accurately describing?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, closer to accurately describing the world.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So it's not only got this clear structure, but the underlying thought is,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
it really reveals the underlying structure of the world.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And so it serves almost as a mirror of the world.

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
In fact, sometimes these philosophers seem to think the ideal language would really just be a mirror of reality.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
And it leads you into funny questions.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
Borges has a story where he's talking about somebody who is deciding they need a really perfectly adequate map of the world.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
And they realized for it to be perfectly adequate, it would just have to be the world.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Because it would have to stand in one-to-one correspondence with all the things in the world.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
And if it was really drawn to scale, it would just be the world.

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
And so in a certain sense, that's kind of a vision of what this ideal language would be like.

20:12.000 --> 20:20.000
Ideal in being clear as opposed to ambiguous or vague, and also in respect to reflecting the underlying structures.

20:20.000 --> 20:29.000
Then we're going to see some philosophers who are, might call them ordinary language philosophers,

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
who think that, no, it's a cheat to sort of introduce such an ideal language.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Partly it distorts what our ordinary speech is like.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
And partly too, how can we say this is a language that mirrors the structure of the world,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
unless we already know what the structure of the world is?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
So this can't be taken as a tool for revealing the structure of the world.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
If a criterion of its being ideal is that it does reveal the structure, we must then already know the structure.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
So these people think, no, start with English or French or German or Chinese or some other natural language,

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
and think about metaphysics and so on in terms of that.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
So who are some examples of this?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Well, we've already seen one, I think, Ryle.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
J.L. Austin is a famous example.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
P.F. Strassen.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Paul Reiss.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
Let's see, oh, and of course the later Victor Stein.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
Okay, but in between, you might say, there are these scientific language philosophers.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
And they're the people we're studying right now, for the most part, have been.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
We took a detour to Ryle.

21:43.000 --> 21:52.000
And so here I have in mind the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
So figures like Carnab, Tempel, Schlick, Neuerer and so on.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
And Klein is one of those.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
Klein, in fact, went to Vienna and hung out with Vienna Circle for a while in the 1930s and studied in particular with Carnab.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
And so somebody who was very much influenced by this.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
Interestingly, Klein actually studied, got his degree at Harvard under people who were primarily pragmatists.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
And so throughout his writings, as we'll see, there's this conflict going on between logical empiricism and pragmatism.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
His teachers at Harvard were all pragmatists, but the guys he was hanging out with in Vienna were all logical empiricists.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
And so you see in his work an attempt to synthesize these.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
And actually one of our students visited Harvard and found wine in his office and said,

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
so throughout your work there are these two war intendents in psychological empiricism and pragmatism.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Suppose in the end you had to put your chips on one of them.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
So suppose in the end it was like, I don't know.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
He didn't use this phrase with Klein and Klein wouldn't have liked it.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
But it's sort of like, you die and you're there at the gates of heaven.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
And Saint Peter says so in Klein, you're kind of mixing these two strands together.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
In the end, what is it? Is it logical empiricism or is it pragmatism?

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
What you get in depends on your answer.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
And interestingly, Klein said logical empiricism.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
So we're going to see him infusing more and more pragmatist themes into logical empiricism.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
In the end, he would place himself clearly in there.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Okay, so anyway, the language of science is what he really cares about.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Now let me come back to your question, which is a key question.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
In a sense, yeah, it's all fine to think about this in English.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
But in the end, what is the language of science looked like?

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
What do we need for science?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
What does the language of science look like?

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
It doesn't really have adverbs in it, for example, does it?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
I mean, we can talk about the particle moving more swiftly.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
But in the end, we don't really use adverbs in the language of science.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
We introduce a term for that, acceleration.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
And so what do we use in science?

24:16.000 --> 24:26.000
We use symbols to represent things we can't necessarily see or perceive.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
But good, for one thing, this is highly symbolic.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
So we're going to have to understand what's going on in a symbolic language,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
like the language of science, like the language of mathematics or logic,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
as opposed to thinking about things primarily in English.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
So although Klein starts this essay thinking about English and

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
categoromatic and syn-categoromatic terms, in fact, that's not where the real

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
test lies, where the rubber beats the road.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
That's in the symbolic languages of science.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
And so in that symbolism, I mean, just think about a few simple scientific laws,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
like forces, mass times, acceleration.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
What's going on there?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, we've got identity statements.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
We've got mathematical quantities.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
So there's a huge amount of math.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
We do a lot of identification of, well, of what exactly?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
What is force?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
These aren't proper names, right?

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
What are they?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
It depends on what you're talking about.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
It depends on what we're talking about.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
And so, well, actually, let's think about mass, because maybe it's simpler.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Like right now, I have a certain mass, right?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
But that mass changes.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Actually, ever since Thanksgiving, it's been changing quite a bit in the wrong

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
direction.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
You might notice that I'm wearing like that same three pairs of pants all the time.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
It's because they're the only ones that fit me at the moment.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
So, yeah.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
Anyway, by the end of term, I promise I will start losing mass to get better at this.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
But anyway, yeah, we've talked about an object having a mass at a time, right?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And so really, this is something like a function.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
It's the mass of Dan Bonovac at time t.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
And I might say, oh, yes, I've been gaining weight.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
In other words, this function has been increasing over time.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I'm hoping to get it to decrease.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
And so that's something you might think is, well, okay, a function.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
So there are all sorts of things that are going to be expressed as functions.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
And indeed, accelerations like that, too, I may be accelerating at a time, right?

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
Or decelerating at a time, or maintaining a constant velocity at a time.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
So this, too, looks like it's an object at a time.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
And so presumably, force is going to be, the force applies to an object at a given time.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
So that's probably a function of objects at times.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
But then there are all sorts of other things that are actually, even this is way too simple, right?

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Because actually, if you think about velocity, for example, a physicist will often write

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
velocity not just as a v, but as a vector.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
And why? Because the velocity is not just a question of moving at a certain rate,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
but in a certain direction.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
And so if we think, wait a minute, if that's true, then acceleration should also be understood as that.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And the same with force, those have a direction.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Then we're going to need vectors there as well as just positions and so forth.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
So what this is a function of is actually going to be fairly complicated.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
And if you start thinking, oh yes, we're going to need vectors and derivatives and integrals

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
and functions and all of this kind of stuff, you realize there's quite a lot of mathematics we're going to need here.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
Now exactly how much depends on our physical theory and that's a complicated question.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
But at the very least, we're going to need a substantial part of mathematics.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
What else will we need?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We are going to have to have some idea.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Well, maybe the key is to just jump straight to this.

27:59.000 --> 28:08.000
We're going to need things like variables, like an object x, like a time t, maybe a position p and so forth.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
We're going to need variables that stand for the basic things that our language is going to be talking about.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
So far we've been taking physics as an example and physics is often taken as the most basic science.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
But we could also start thinking, well, what about chemistry?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Is it going to require additional things?

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
Maybe we're going to need terms for elements in physics and so forth, or in chemistry and so on.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
So it turns out to be crucial to think, well, what does this language of science really require?

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Now let's get back to the essay.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
I feel like I keep pulling this fill of brief thing.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
We've only gotten through two sentences, but let's see if we can do a little better.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
So he says, really in the end, if we go back to this distinction between the categoromatic and the syn-categoromatic,

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
one way of thinking about it is that these categoromatic expressions are names of something.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
These are not names of anything.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
So he says we can ask an important question.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Is this the name of something?

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
To ask whether there is such an entity as roundness is thus not to ask the question of the meaningfulness of roundness.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
It amounts rather to asking whether the word is a name or a syn-categoromatic expression.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Well, he says, this is a crucial point.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
Ontological questions can be transformed in this superficial way into linguistic questions

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
regarding the boundary between names and syn-categoromatic expressions.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
So we can think, aha, we can take an ontological question.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
What is there?

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
And we can say, well, that's really a way of saying, how do I draw that line?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
These are going to be names of things.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And so these are going to stand for something.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
And so that's something.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That'll be something I recognize in my ontology.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It's something that is.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Whereas here, these things don't stand for anything.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
So I don't have to worry about them from an ontological point of view.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
And so I can say, well, what is that really?

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
That's a way of saying, which expressions in my language are categorical?

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Which expressions in my language is going to stand for something?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
So notice what's happened.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
Ontology gets transformed into a question about language.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I go from the question, what is there?

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
It's the question of what's in my language stands for something.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Now, where does the boundary fall?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
Well, he says, let's turn our attention to barriers.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
If in this statement, pedals have roundness,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
where I've been using the example of the clock.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
The clock has roundness.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
The word roundness is regarded as a mirrored and categoromatic fragment of this context,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
like have or indeed bowls or mess.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
If that's true, then the truth of one doesn't entitle us to infer pebbles have something.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
So notice the inference that he's thinking about here.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
Pebbles have roundness.

30:58.000 --> 31:14.000
When I infer from that, that, therefore, there is some x such that pebbles have x.

31:14.000 --> 31:21.000
In other words, to put this in language, from pebbles have roundness to pebbles have something.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Which is really just what that logical expression means.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
So really, if you translate that, there is an x such that pebbles have x,

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
or in other words, pebbles have something.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Now, how is that an argument?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
The clock is round, so the clock has roundness, so the clock has something.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Some of you would like it, okay?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
There's a plane that's sitting right over there.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Love it there, love it.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Pebbles have things, clocks have things, okay?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Everything has things.

31:58.000 --> 32:04.000
And I don't know why I'm making a plane that sounds like a tough guy from New Jersey here,

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
but anyway, suppose you think of it, oh yeah.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah, he's from the Jersey part of Athens.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
So we've got that.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Pebbles have something.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
And others of you are shaking your heads like, wait, what do you mean pebbles have something?

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
If I said, hey, I have some pebbles, but do the pebbles have anything?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
You'd say, what do you mean do the pebbles have anything, right?

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
It'd be very odd to say, of course they do, they have roundness.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
It feels like some weird philosophy joke.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
And so Klein is sort of saying, yeah, you know, if you've drunk from the plate this Kool-Aid,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
you might like pebbles have something.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
In fact, you might think, actually, pebbles have roundness is the way to explain the fact that pebbles are round.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
What is it for something to be round?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
It's for it to have roundness.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
And so pebbles are round by virtue of the fact that they have roundness.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
This is really the revealing deep explanation.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
But if you're not somebody who's drunk from the plate this Kool-Aid,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
you might say, there's something weird.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
It just sounds weird, right?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
It sounds different.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
In fact, I'd rather say pebbles are something, namely round,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
than to say they have something like roundness.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
And so if you have that instinct, and that's Klein's instinct,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
he thinks there's something strange that's gone on here.

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
So he says, look, where have is understood in the context is have roundness,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
and roundness is understood sin categorically.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
The use of the variable x after have in pebbles have an x such that,

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
well, there is an x such that pebbles have x, or in other words, pebbles have something,

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
would be as ungrammatical as saying, you know, there is an x such that pebbles have x has roundness.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
And so there's something that seems odd about this to him.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Well, now what?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Here we get a serious argument.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
And this is something I think worth thinking very seriously, and thinking about hard.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
He says variables are pronouns.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
So what is a variable like this doing in a logical notation?

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
Or just, or something like that thing, maybe, and something?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
The idea is this.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
It's really acting as a kind of pronoun.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
And so although Klein says here in the end to be is to be a value of a variable,

34:13.000 --> 34:23.000
a way to put that in ordinary language terms is that to be is to be the kind of thing a pronoun can stand.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Variables are like pronouns in logic.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
And so what do we use pronouns for?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Well, they stand in for nouns.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
And so you might think, actually, that's a dumb way of thinking about it.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Just focus on the nouns.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
They focus on the proper names, for example.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
But Klein's worried about that because he knows you can introduce proper names for things that don't exist.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
And so he says, yeah, look, Pegasus.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
I don't want to be committed to Pegasus's existence, even if I use the term Pegasus.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
And so I know it's possible to name things that are there and have proper names in my language that denote nothing.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
So it's not wise to focus on names, but pronouns, that's something else.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
So he says, really, variables are pronouns.

35:06.000 --> 35:16.000
And now we can think pronouns are really ultimately the thing that reveals what we're talking about.

35:16.000 --> 35:24.000
The kind of thing we can refer to as, oh, that, it, those, them, et cetera.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Those are the things that we're actually committed to talking about.

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
What would Russell's response be to this?

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
Well, I think Klein thinks of himself here as, in part, giving you the moral of Russell's treatment of descriptions.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
And so overall, I think Russell would like this idea.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
He doesn't quite put it in this way himself.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
But if you start thinking, well, gosh, the present king of France is bald.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Does that involve some commitment to something?

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Yeah, it does involve a commitment to the king of France, to their being a present king of France.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
And if you wrote it out in logical terms, it would indeed be this, there was an X, such that X is king of France.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That would be the thing that causes the trouble.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
So this works well with Russell?

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I think it works really well with Russell.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
And Klein is designing it for that.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.000
He, in part, has Russell in mind, giving us a way of seeing what really matters here.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And so don't think it's a proper name.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
Among the things over here, I should have written down are things like definite descriptions.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
And Russell would be saying, I thought the moral of my story is, don't focus on this, don't focus on this.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
And in the end, although he doesn't draw the consequence,

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
Klein says, think about the moral of that story, and the end is the variable that's doing the work in Russell.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It's the X of there is an X.

36:48.000 --> 36:56.000
Okay, so we can reach this in other ways.

36:56.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah, and we can do it by thinking about a logical notation and how it functions.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
So he says, it appears suitable to describe names simply as those constant expressions,

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
which replace variables and are replaced by variables according to the usual laws of quantification.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
What are those laws of quantification?

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
What are the laws that govern things like this, there is an X?

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
At this point, I think we can get rid of our categorics and categoric distinction.

37:26.000 --> 37:34.000
So let me erase this and think about the way that those items function in logic.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Okay, so we need something like the existential quantifier.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
What does it do in logic?

37:44.000 --> 37:53.000
The existential quantifier functions like that, and it goes in front of some formula in logic.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
And typically, let's say, you might have a logical notation that requires this,

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
or it might just be the standard usage of it, that has some free variable X.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
I can tell you officially what a free variable is and a bound variable and so on,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
but I'm not going to.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
Okay, it's easy to pick up in context.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
So let's ignore some of the fine points and just think about how this functions.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
What characterizes it?

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
We might think of it in terms of rules and think about what logical rules are involved in understanding this quantifier.

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
We also might think in terms of what it means, how we understand its meaning in a logical theory.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Let's first of all think about rules.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
What rules typically go along with the existential quantifier?

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
Well, in thinking about logical rules, there are two kinds.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
We can think about what it takes to introduce such a thing into the language,

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
or I should say what it takes to infer that from some premise,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
and then what it takes to actually infer something from it.

38:57.000 --> 39:08.000
So these are usually referred to as introduction and elimination rules.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
So let's think about existential quantifier introduction, existential quantifier elimination.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
What does it take to introduce something like there is an X such that A of X?

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
In other words, something like there is an X such that Pebbles have X.

39:24.000 --> 39:38.000
We've actually got a perfect example of it right here.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
A of X.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
Yeah, we have the A of well now.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
We could follow the rule, and many people do, so it's just A of X.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
Or we could say, well, really, it's like having a name.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
Pebbles have roundness, or I have something in my hand, this piece of chalk.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
So you might say, I have a piece of chalk in my hand, so I have something in my hand.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I have this in my hand. I have something in my hand.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
So in short, there's some constant here.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
I will write A instead of X here, because usually we would set things up

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
so that this is really a name of something, a constant term rather than a variable.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
So think of A as something like the constant.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
The X is the variable.

40:25.000 --> 40:33.000
So if I've got something true of this, it's true of something.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I am standing in front of the classroom.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
Therefore, something is standing in front of the classroom.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Now, existential elimination, that's a lot harder.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
And actually, many people have different rules for this.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Quine as his own favorite, which is, in my opinion, by far the best.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
So I'll just go with Quine's way of thinking about it.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
Suppose we have, there is an X, that's A of X.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
What could we infer from that?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
You might say, I have something in my hand.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Why is it?

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
I'm sure you like your kind of partners.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I have something in my hand.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
What can you infer from that?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It's not nothing.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, it's not nothing, that's true.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
That's true.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
If I say, I've got something in my hand, they believe nothing.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Oh, he's a Heideggerian.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
That's okay.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah, I see it.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Well, I have four of you.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I have four of you, that's fine.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I've got to roll.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Okay.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Yeah, Quine's way of thinking about it is to say,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
look, you've got something in your, I've got something in my hand.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And let's say we want to talk about it.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And so I might do that by using a pronoun, right?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
By just using the variable.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
So what do you think?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Is it white?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Is it round?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Does it have roundness?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I can ask you all these questions about it.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
But suppose I don't want to use a pronoun.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
I don't like the idea of just using this variable.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
I want to introduce a name for it.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Okay.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
As I might in mathematics, I might say, for example,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
improving the mean value theorem.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
There's some point in that interval at which blah, blah, blah,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
the point is something has a property.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
And typically what I do then is what?

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
I introduce some name for that point.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
I say, so there is some number N such that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
Or suppose I've discovered that someone in the organization is leaking secrets.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
We don't know who yet.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
I could just keep talking about the person who is leaking secrets

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
to something else, but that's kind of difficult.

42:41.000 --> 42:47.000
I could just use pronoun saying he or she if we don't know who it is.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
But what else could I do?

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Give them a new name that's not used before.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Exactly.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Give them a new name.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
So I could say, yeah, let's call the leaker.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Gosh, what?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Deep throat has been taken.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
So we'll call it deep shoe.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Something like that.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
And then we can talk about deep shoe and give and effect this person a name.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So we can do the same thing here.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
There is some object that has this property A.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
Well, let's call that object something.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And so we introduce a constant.

43:22.000 --> 43:29.000
Now notice this is a constant, but actually it's very important that it be a new constant.

43:29.000 --> 43:37.000
If I say, ah, yes, the person who's been leaking these secrets.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Let's call him Bob as I look straight.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Bob.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
That's not good.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
I've got to introduce some name that doesn't expose anything.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
My daughter, by the way, has a tendency to do this.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
She won't know people's names, but she gets tired of talking to or talking about the person

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
fitting a certain description and so on.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
So she just introduces a name to that person.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
And this isn't always wise because then you get to know the person and you're constantly

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
tempted to call them by that name.

44:04.000 --> 44:11.000
Over the weekend, she, yes, there's this organist who's recently been hired.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
And anyway, she was talking to, as it happened, the organist's wife saying, oh, yeah, the

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
new organ, Billy.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And wait, I married him.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
His name was Billy.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
David.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I don't know.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Or she did that with various cats in my neighborhood.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
So there's one cat I thought had, you know, was named Figaro or something.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
And then I walked down with the circle and actually meet the owner of the cat.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
I say, oh, Figaro is such a nice cat.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
That cat's name is Tom or whatever.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
I was like, oh, that's what I thought about my daughter just introducing all these names.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
And I had thought for all these years, Jackson knew the names of these people and objects

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
instead of just making them up.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Anyway, this is what she did.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
She was just making up new constants.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
And so practicing good, quiet, and louder.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Now, it's very important that you not stop it, right?

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
That the conclusion you're ultimately aiming at and doing a proof using this rule does

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
not include this name.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
Otherwise, you know, you can get to conclusions like the new organist's name is Billy and

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
you end up in a silly place.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Yes.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
I know I don't have much time left, but I really am struggling to see how this helps

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
us talk about what there really is.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Good.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Good, good, good.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
This is all just the way of introducing it and what we mean by the rules, but now we

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
can talk about the semantics.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
So we can say, how do we interpret these darn things anyway?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Now, one is making two points here.

45:37.000 --> 45:45.000
One is that it's not that we start with the idea of a name here and then really use this,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
although it looks that way in the lot.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
He wants to say, I understand by a constant the kind of thing that will let me infer this

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
or that I can infer from something like this.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
So a constant is the kind of thing that, in other words, I've got the something.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
I'm convinced that it's something and then I'm allowed to use a name for the thing in

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
the logic.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
So I'm not allowed to actually use names that don't denote anything in this logical

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
language.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
And the semantics of this is important to understand.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
A model is going to consist of a domain of objects.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
And what's the idea?

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
These constants stand for particular objects in the domain.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
So here is, you might say, intuitively speaking, that object A, the thing that the constant

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
A stands for.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
The variables will range over the things in this domain.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
They can stand for various things in that domain.

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
And then the objects in this domain will have some properties and they will stand in

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
the relations.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
And we will understand the property in terms of the sets of objects having the property

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
and the relations in terms of n tuples of objects standing in the relation.

46:56.000 --> 47:04.000
But in the end, it's really the objects in this domain that all of this is about.

47:04.000 --> 47:11.000
And so a logic characterized in these ways where we've got quantifiers like this where

47:11.000 --> 47:22.000
they range over now objects, individuals in the domain.

47:22.000 --> 47:33.000
This is all known as first order logic.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
And what Klein is basically saying is that first order logic is the canonical language

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
of science.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
In the end, what we need here are the symbolic things, mathematics, functions, variables,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
and so on.

47:44.000 --> 47:51.000
And in short, we need first order logic.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
What is that logic like?

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
It's a logic that allows us to talk about, to quantify over a set of objects, to understand

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
them as having properties and relations.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
And so as giving us a sort of Aristotelian picture of the universe.

48:04.000 --> 48:10.000
Now, what is it going to be to be, well, it's just to be one of those things in the domain,

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
to be among the things the variables range over.

48:13.000 --> 48:25.000
Hence, to be, well, to be one of those things, to be a value of a variable, which is another

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
way of saying to be in that domain.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Now, from one point of view, you could say, I've learned nothing.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
What is it to be?

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
It's to be among the things that we're talking about.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
And it's like, gosh, you could have said that without all this logic.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
But next time, as we'll see, he thinks he's gotten something.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
Because by the end, he says, well, there are things we talk about, but then we have some

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
way of transforming that into something else.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
And in short, it becomes clear that the underlying picture really is this.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
And that what we're doing is identifying the spots we have to worry about, and then he

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
gives us a method of trying to structure that domain.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
More on that next time.
