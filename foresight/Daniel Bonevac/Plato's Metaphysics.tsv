0	9800	Hi. I want to talk to you today about Plato's metaphysics. Plato is perhaps the greatest
9800	15100	metaphysician of the Western tradition. Alfred North Whitehead once said that all Western
15100	20280	philosophy is really a series of footnotes to Plato. And it's this part of his doctrine
20280	26300	that he really had primarily in mind. Plato gives us a distinctive view, so distinctive
26300	31500	that actually this general kind of view, even today, tends to be known as Platonism. It's
31500	36460	often also called realism, but realism can mean different things. It's a specific kind
36460	41900	of realism. But Platonism is still recognized as one of the most common, one of the most
41900	47720	powerful, and even today, one of the most popular approaches to philosophy. So what
47720	53820	is Platonism, and how do we understand it? I have a separate video in which I talk about
53820	58300	the distinction between universals and particulars. But it's crucial to getting us going, so
58300	64240	I want to remind you of the general shape of that distinction. A universal is something
64240	71540	that can have multiple instances, but a particular cannot. So particulars are things that there's
71540	77820	only one of. You can't have multiple instances of them. I'm a good example. Dan Bonobat,
77820	83940	or any other person for that matter, is a particular. I'm a particular person. As you
83940	88220	could probably tell from this slide, I was talking in another course when I first made
88220	92580	it up about the beginnings of the First World War. So the other person I had in mind was
92580	97900	Gavrilo Principi, the guy who started the war by assassinating the Archduke. The Empire
97900	104860	State Building, or the Pericostinata Library, a particular beach ball, a particular watch,
104900	110860	this grain of sand, a particular city like Austin, or the state of Texas, or Sarajevo,
110860	116620	a particular date or time, an event like the assassination of the Archduke. All of those
116620	121380	are examples of particulars. You can't have a bunch of them. Even if you somehow cloned
121380	126180	me and produced a bunch of people who looked like me, they would all be copies of Dan Bonobat.
126180	130980	And you might joke and say, oh, now there are many Dan Bonobats. But actually, that would
131100	135220	turn that term into a kind term. There would still be just one of me. There would then
135220	139980	be a bunch of copies of me. So particulars, there's only one of them. They can't have
139980	145500	multiple instances. But a universal has multiple instances. You can find it all over the place.
145500	152860	So here are some examples. There are properties like red, or triangular, or large. Relations
152860	159740	like being between, being on something, or loving someone, being friends with someone.
159740	164780	Relations like tiger, or building, pencil, shortstop. Some of these are natural kinds,
164780	170300	like tiger. You find them there in nature. Others are human artifacts, or socially defined,
170300	175420	like pencil or shortstop. There can be books, books like the Bible, or the novel, Edwin
175420	181860	Mulhouse. They're musical works, Lucanbach, Texas, or Box, Takata, and Fugue, and D Minor.
181860	186860	You can find many copies of those musical works. You might find sheet music. You might
186860	192700	find them in a sort of digital form. They might be on a record album. They might be
192700	199300	on a CD. I might start humming the tune. And I could sit down at the piano, maybe, and
199300	204100	start playing the Takata, and Fugue, and D Minor. Actually, it's an organ piece. I would
204100	208460	get into trouble because I wouldn't have pedals. But in any case, those are things that there
208460	215540	can be many, many different instances of. Well, there's nobody much doubts that particulars
215540	222540	are real. You and I exist in the world, if anything does. But are universals real? Well,
222540	227540	there are different attitudes about that. The realist says yes. Not only do they exist,
227540	231140	but they're mind independent. They're really, in some sense, out there. They're not just
231140	236020	concepts. The conceptualist says, I agree with you, they really exist. But I think they are
236020	241020	just concepts. I think they are really, in the end, dependent on the mind. The nominalist
241020	245260	says, I don't think they exist at all. There are no such things. Everything that exists
245260	250500	is a particular object. There is no such thing as humanity. There are simply particular people.
250500	257740	There's no such thing as the color red. They're just a bunch of red things. And so, the realist,
257740	262780	and as we'll see, Plato is the paradigmatic realist, says yes, they really are constituents
262780	268860	of the world. And they're really out there. They're not in here. They are real mind independent
268860	271660	constituents of the world.
271660	277700	Well, as I've said, he is the paradigmatic realist. He is the first one who says yes,
277700	283660	universals are crucial to understanding anything. And he calls them forms. These forms are these
283660	290100	mind independent universals. So, in the Republic, but also in a variety of other works, he lays
290100	296940	out what is known as Plato's theory of forms, trying to explain what they're like, what
296940	302860	access we have to them, how they make possible all sorts of things about our relationship
302860	304300	to the world.
304300	309540	Now why on earth would you think these forms exist? What's the point of them? Well, here
309540	317020	is his idea. And it's, at first glance, an odd idea. He says, look, there is a sense
317020	321420	in which the mind is turned in two different directions whenever I have a thought. I see
321420	325980	something that is a triangle, like that object that I've depicted here on the slide, and
325980	332140	I think this is a triangle. So take that little stop sign looking thing as a mind and that
332140	337740	little squiggle as a thought within that mind. The content is there in the little bubble.
337740	345980	This is a triangle. When I do that, I am recognizing that object I am perceiving as a triangle.
345980	351020	And so I am partly directed toward that object and perceiving it, but partly I am directed
351020	358700	toward triangularity. I'm recognizing it as an instance of triangularity as a triangle.
358700	363980	Well that means whenever I have a thought like that about an object, about a particular,
363980	369180	yes, my mind is directed toward the particular, but it's also directed toward that universal.
369180	376460	I am directed both toward that particular triangle and also I'm thinking about triangularity.
376460	382620	In fact, I am able to recognize that object, that particular, as a triangle because my
382620	390700	mind has some contact with or awareness of triangularity, the form. So abstractions like
390700	395900	the forms, universals, make it possible for me to have thoughts about particular objects.
395900	402540	I couldn't do it. I couldn't think about that as a triangle unless I already had some
402540	408620	awareness of triangularity. That is one crucial reason we think the forms exist.
409660	415740	Why, however, more broadly should we think they exist? In addition to my ability to recognize
415740	422860	things as triangles, as red, as human beings, and so on. There are different explanations he gives,
422860	425660	and I think they fall broadly speaking under five categories.
426860	432300	The forms enable me to think general thoughts. They enable me to recognize regularities about
432300	438780	the world, to recognize and characterize universal and necessary laws that govern the world.
439420	444940	They allow me to explain how it's possible for human beings to communicate and how it's possible
444940	450620	for them to mean anything at all with their thoughts and with their words. And finally,
450620	455580	it explains, well, what philosophers like to call veridicality, something like accuracy,
455580	462620	a question of our thoughts or our statements matching the world. So it's a question of truth,
462620	468620	of objectivity, of accuracy, of faithful representation of the world. The forms he thinks
468620	473420	explain all of that. And if we don't have the forms, then he says we're not going to be able to
473420	478060	think general thoughts. We won't be able to recognize laws or regularities. We won't be
478060	482860	able to communicate, and we'll have no basis for thinking there's such a thing as truth.
482860	487180	We'll have to become skeptics, or even worse than that, we'll simply have to say,
487180	491580	there's no such thing as truth. There's no such thing as communication. Really, in the end,
491580	497580	everybody has their own ideas. We're all confined in our own little worlds, incapable of interacting
497580	504060	meaningfully with anyone else. Let's turn to that first point. The forms make it possible for us
504060	510300	to think general thoughts. Here we can say the general thought, the general principle behind
510300	516620	this general thought argument is this. There must be something all Fs have in common by virtue of
516620	523100	which they are Fs, whatever F happens to be. So I see a herd of horses. Well, there's something
523100	527660	that those animals have in common. What is it? There must be something they have in common.
527660	532460	I call them all horses. What enables me to do that? Now, the nominalist is going to say,
532460	537740	I don't need any universals around. I can just look at those particular objects. And I see
537740	542780	they're similar. And so, hey, I introduce a term for them, horse. I use it for things that are
542780	549260	similar to things like that. But Plato says, wait a minute. Why are they similar? You're recognizing
549260	553900	they have something in common, right? But take that seriously. They have something in common
553900	557900	by virtue of which they are similar. Here's what they have in common. They're horses.
558940	565340	They exemplify the general kind, horse. And so what you're doing in recognizing that they're
565340	570300	similar and that you can apply the same term to them is that you're recognizing the universal that
570300	576300	is present in all those particular animals. So that's an example of that universal and
576300	581420	a contact with the universal making us making it possible for us to think that general thought.
581420	587420	The same would be true of cats. I see a variety of cats and I think, hey, they have something
587420	592700	in common. They're similar. I'll call them cats. What are they similar in what respect?
592700	600060	They're all cats. They have something in common. This is explicit even in the early dialogues.
600060	603740	In the Lockhees, which we talked about separately, for example, about courage,
603740	607980	Socrates says to Lockhees, I was asking about courage and cowardice in general.
607980	612300	I'll begin with courage and once more ask, what is that common quality,
612300	616380	which is the same in all these cases and which is called courage? Notice he's saying,
616380	620540	I'm looking for the thing they have in common. They're courageous people. They're courageous
620620	626460	actions. What do they have in common? There must be some common quality, some form of courage that
626460	631900	is present in all these courageous people in all these courageous actions. They are considered
631900	637580	similar and we call them all courageous for a reason. It's because they exemplify courage.
637580	643660	Okay, there is some quality they all have in common. So even in the early dialogue, Socrates
643660	649340	is already saying there has to be a universal present here. Tell me about that universal.
649340	653580	Don't tell me about particular cases or instances of courage, like standing and fighting and not
653580	658700	running away. Tell me about the universal. Tell me about that common quality. Universals,
658700	663740	we can find in all sorts of different places and sometimes they are abstract things like
663740	669740	triangularity or redness or kindness or courage. Other times they may be tied in some way to a
669740	676460	particular and that's quite possible. Let's return to the theme of thinking general thoughts.
676460	682700	I see a variety of trees, for example, and I think they are similar in some way. They have
682700	687340	something in common. Now it is not trivial what they have in common by any means. It's a hard
687340	691820	biological question what they have in common and there may be vague boundaries. I may say,
691820	696780	well, is this a bush or a tree? I don't know. In fact, things have started growing in my backyard
696780	702220	and I think I don't know what this is. Is this a weed? Is this a bush? Is this a tree? I let it go
702220	707740	and in several cases it's now a 40 or 50 foot tall tree. It wasn't really planned. It was just
707740	712940	this thing that started growing and well, let's see what it is. But in any case, that's something
712940	718460	that is a hard question, what exactly the nature of this thing is, but to notice they have something
718460	724140	in common is in a way to say, yeah, what is that thing? It is being a tree. It is something like
724140	732220	the universal of being a tree. And we can apply the same principle to other cases. So I see a
732220	737900	bunch of triangles. I think, huh, look at all those. Gee, they seem to have something in common.
738460	744300	And then I think, yes, there is something they have in common. They're all triangles. I recognize
744300	749020	triangularity there and that is what enables me to think of them as triangles.
749660	755740	Here is how Plato puts it. Don't you know that though they make use, they hear people doing
755740	760700	mathematics and specifically geometry, they make use of the visible forms and reason about them.
760700	766700	But they're thinking not of these, instead of the ideals they resemble, not of the figures they draw,
766700	772540	but of the absolute square and absolute diameter and so on. The forms they draw or make and which
772540	777180	have shadows and reflections and water of their own are converted by them into images. But they're
777820	782860	really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind.
783740	787660	Perhaps you've taken a geometry course and you've done things like this.
788300	793260	Somebody has written something on the blackboard. Let's say they've said, consider this triangle
797420	799500	and they've given you some information about it.
800460	811660	And then they say, prove that the triangle ABC, let's say, is a right triangle. In other words,
811660	817660	that this is a right angle. Well, here's one way you might think of it doing it. In fact,
817660	821820	my daughter at one point, when she was first learning geometry, was I showed that this is a
821820	826780	right triangle. She took out a protractor and said, see, it's a right triangle, 90 degrees.
826780	832780	Well, that's not what geometry is about. It's not a question of this particular drawing I just made.
832780	837500	In fact, this is just a representation or an image of what we're really talking about,
837500	841580	a triangle with certain characteristics. And if I look at it carefully, I realize it's actually
841580	847820	a pretty sloppily drawn. For example, these two lines don't even meet. And this one sort of curves
847820	852140	there near the end and here they kind of crisscross. So you might say, well, actually, that's not even
852140	857820	a triangle. It's kind of close to being a triangle. But that shouldn't worry us, right? If the geometry
857820	862380	teacher writes this down and you say, I'm sorry, those two lines don't exactly meet. So it's not
862380	867580	a triangle. That's not an answer. We're not talking about this particular drawing. We're talking about
867580	873180	the abstract form. And so Plato says, if you doubt any of the rest of it, think about what
873180	878140	people are doing in mathematics in geometry, in other areas where they're talking about numbers,
878140	884620	let's say, or sets or functions or any kind of mathematical object. They are talking about
884620	890140	things that are abstract. They're not talking about something that is particular. You know,
890140	894780	if I'm talking about the number two, and I hold up my fingers like this, I'm not talking about
894780	900460	these two fingers in particular. I'm talking about the number two. And the same thing with this
900460	905820	triangle. I'm talking about something abstract, something that isn't just written down, but
905820	911340	instead is that form that can only be seen with the eye of the mind. Now, I think that's
911340	916300	an intriguing phrase, the eye of the mind. We're not talking here about what we see,
916300	922860	the individual people, or trees, or diagrams. We're talking about what we can only see with
922860	929740	the eye of the mind, the general kind, or the general property of being a tree, or being red,
929740	935980	or being a triangle of a certain kind. That's what's really at issue. We're thinking about
935980	940780	universals, in other words, not just particular drawings, or particular plants, or particular
940780	946060	colors, or instances of colored objects, or other things like that. We're not discussing
946060	952140	particulars. We're talking about something that lies behind them. His second argument is based
952140	958140	on regularities. We notice all sorts of regularities in the world, and we do it on the basis of
958140	964700	particulars, but we then abstract from those particulars to universals. It might be that the
964700	969980	world just looks like one thing after another to us, and it's all a jumbled mess, but eventually
969980	975580	we start making sense of it. Maybe we're children who are experiencing a severe thunderstorm for
975580	980620	the first time, lots of lightning, lots of thunder, and to us it's just chaos, lightning,
980620	985820	thunder going on, and it's just scary. But eventually we start noticing a pattern,
986460	994620	and we start thinking, wait, I think I can predict the next bout of thunder. I watch for the
994620	1001020	lightning, and so I start realizing, wait, those flashes, that's lightning, those booms, that's
1001020	1006860	thunder, and hey, the thunder tends to follow the lightning, and so I recognize a regularity
1006860	1012140	that the lightning tends to produce the thunder, and so suddenly the storm starts having a pattern,
1012220	1017980	and recognizing that pattern, recognizing those regularities is possible because I can categorize
1017980	1025500	those flashes as a kind, as being reflections of a certain more universal type of thing,
1025500	1032700	lightning, and those booms as thunder, and then seeing a general connection between those universals.
1032700	1039900	So any regularity, any pattern is made possible by those abstract forms, those universals.
1039900	1045340	The same thing is true of laws. When I formulate a scientific law of any kind, I'm not talking
1045340	1050700	about this particular electrical circuit, for example, I'm talking about any circuit of that
1050700	1056860	kind. I'm talking about the universal pattern. If I'm thinking about Newton's laws and focusing on
1056860	1062380	F equals ma, for example, or looking at a mathematical law like the quadratic formula,
1062380	1067900	or thinking about something involving the reflection of light, or any other scientific law,
1067900	1073660	I'm thinking about the general universals here. I'm thinking about the relation between mass and
1074220	1080140	acceleration and force, for example, and it's not a question of that particular force and that
1080140	1085420	particular mass. It's not a question of, ah, yes, this chalk and the force I apply to it,
1085420	1091340	and it's rolling and accelerating away. No, I'm talking about the general kinds here.
1091340	1097180	I'm talking about something universal, and that's what gives it its universality and necessity.
1097180	1101740	If it weren't for that, it would just be life being one thing after another,
1101740	1104620	and the scientists would just say, yeah, a lot of stuff happens, I don't know.
1105500	1111340	We wouldn't be able to formulate regularities or laws. Communication is the same way.
1112220	1117020	What makes it possible for me to mean anything with my words, for my thoughts to have meaning,
1117020	1122860	for me to be able to communicate them to anyone else? Well, at first glance, this is hard, right?
1122860	1127820	I have some idea, and I'm trying to communicate it to you, but why should I think that's even
1127820	1132940	possible? Why should I think the words I'm using mean anything at all and will mean anything like
1132940	1138860	the same thing to you? Well, Plato says, look, without anything universal, I have no reason
1138860	1143180	to expect that. There are just particular thoughts in my head, particular sounds I make,
1143180	1148300	particular thoughts then in your head. Who knows? They don't really have anything in common,
1148300	1153820	so there's no way to talk about communication or meaning or that kind of transfer of knowledge
1153820	1161020	or information being possible. However, it is possible for two people to mean the same thing,
1161020	1166940	to think the same thought. Here's a silly example. He said it, meet us here at recess at the monkey
1166940	1174620	bar. Yeah, well, anyway, it is possible for people to misunderstand. We don't want to rule that out.
1174620	1179180	Sometimes we latch on to the wrong universal and grasp the wrong meaning, and it can happen even
1179180	1184540	with me myself. Me, earlier in the day, me later in the day, I might think, oh, I had a thought
1184540	1190380	about that this morning. What was it? And I might have trouble remembering or maybe I misremember.
1190380	1195900	So those problems of meaning and communication can happen within me at different times or in
1195900	1201980	different situations, maybe in one situation. I say something. Does it mean the same thing?
1201980	1206700	And do I remember it? Does it have the same significance? Can I communicate when I'm in a
1206700	1211180	different situation? Well, intuitively, we want to say, yeah, there can be problems here, but
1211180	1215820	overall, yes, I can mean the same thing that I meant this morning. I can remember and think
1215820	1220700	the same thought I thought this morning. I would think the same thought and give you the same
1220700	1225900	lecture on Play-Doh, even if it were a different day of the week. And so I might say, look, it
1225900	1229740	should be independent of all that, or at least it's possible for it to be independent of all that.
1230380	1236940	But if so, then meaning isn't tied to particular objects. Neither is the possibility of communication.
1236940	1244060	They depend on something universal. How does that go? Well, I must latch on to universal. If I say
1244060	1250860	this is a triangle, then what I'm doing is linking not just to this particular diagram I've drawn,
1250860	1257100	for example, but to triangularity itself. When you understand what I mean and say, oh, yes,
1257100	1263340	that is a triangle, you are recognizing this as a triangle because you have grasp of the same
1263340	1270540	universal triangularity. And so if you want to think of it this way, here you are thinking about this.
1270540	1279820	Here I am. We've got two different thoughts going on here. And both of us are thinking, hey, triangle.
1281020	1285820	But what enables our thoughts to have that significance? And how do we know that we're
1285820	1292700	thinking anything in common? Answer is, our thoughts must be connected to something like
1292700	1299820	this universal of triangularity that ties into the contents of our thought. And without that,
1299820	1305580	he says, look, just something happens in my mind. Something happens in your mind. We have no reason
1305580	1310380	to expect them to have anything in common or to tie to anything about this particular diagram.
1311020	1317180	But if there is a universal, then it's possible for it to not only be present in this individual
1317180	1323020	diagram, but it's possible for our thoughts to latch onto it. So if it's possible for us to mean
1323020	1327980	anything at all, to communicate even with ourselves at a different time or a different situation,
1329180	1335420	not to mention other people, it must be the case that we can latch onto these universals to
1335420	1341820	something outside my mind or your mind that enables us to think the same thought, to communicate
1341820	1347740	the same thing, to mean the same thing by our words. If that's not possible, it looks like
1347740	1353500	meaning and communication aren't possible either. Finally, this explains how we can have
1354860	1361820	accurate thoughts, how things we say can be true, how they can be objective truths about the world.
1361820	1368220	It really relates to the diagram that I was just drawing. The triangularity is not only
1368220	1373180	something that is in some sense present in my thoughts and in your thoughts when we communicate
1373180	1378780	about it, and both think of this as a triangle. It's there in the diagram itself. That diagram,
1378780	1385260	as Plato puts it, participates in triangularity. So when I say something true, I'm saying something
1385260	1390700	that links to a universal that really is there in the world. That particular really is exemplifying
1390700	1397820	that universal. The diagram here is a diagram of a triangle, and you and I recognize it as a triangle,
1397820	1404300	and in getting that right, in having veridical thoughts, that is to say, and in having true
1404300	1411660	statements, this is a triangle, then what's going on here is, well, we are tied into the very form
1411660	1417980	that is in some sense present in that drawing. This is the relationship sometimes described as
1417980	1426140	participation or exemplification. That diagram is a triangle. It exhibits triangularity. It
1426140	1432460	participates in triangularity, and it's that participation, that link between the particular
1432460	1438220	and the universal that makes it possible for me to have knowledge, makes it possible for you and I
1438220	1443340	to think the same thought, makes it possible for us to get things right about the world.
1443340	1447820	Otherwise, I have no reason to think my thoughts have anything to do with the world,
1447820	1453580	and that anything like accuracy, truth, objectivity are possible. But if those same universals
1454140	1460780	can be present in my thoughts and in a different sense in the world, then I can explain this.
1462060	1468620	So Plato's philosophy of mind gives us this picture of the mind as directed in two ways,
1468620	1474940	toward the object, in particular, through perception, for example, and also toward the form.
1475900	1481100	The content of my thought is linked to the form, my perception, and that representation in my mind
1481100	1485980	is linked to the form, but the object is linked to it too. And when they link to the same form,
1485980	1490860	that's when I've got accuracy. That's when I say something true, it's when my thoughts
1490860	1496140	are veridical or correct representations of the world. But of course, there is a problem here.
1497020	1501980	We don't perceive the forms. We don't directly see triangularity, for example,
1501980	1507020	or humanity. We see particular people in particular triangles. If that's true,
1507020	1512140	how do we know anything about them? Aristotle's answer is we abstract the universals and our
1512140	1517500	knowledge of universals from the particulars. But Plato says that won't do at all. I recognize that
1517500	1523100	as a triangle because I already understand triangularity. I can't in some way see a bunch
1523100	1527260	of triangles and then abstract the idea of triangularity. I've got to first recognize
1527260	1533500	they have something in common, namely being triangles. So he gives us two answers in different
1533500	1539340	dialogues. One answer is I recall it. And he tells us a sort of beautiful mythical story
1539340	1543420	about the soul being in contact with the realm of forms before we were even born.
1544860	1549100	We forget about that at birth, but we can be reminded by contact with particulars.
1549580	1556220	The other story is about the form of the good. He ends up saying that I am impelled toward the good
1557660	1563420	by, well, what exactly? I'm not sure, but in some way the form of the good
1563420	1570060	illumines the entire realm of forms for me. And so once that happens, the good somehow shines a
1570060	1576140	light on my mind and makes it possible for me to recognize these forms through recollection,
1576220	1579100	or in some other way with what he calls the eye of the mind.
1580940	1588700	Now, is that a plausible account? Well, maybe. There is a problem here. We seem to be limited
1588700	1594300	in our causal contact to the realm of the senses. So how is it possible for us to have
1594300	1598940	knowledge of something that lies beyond the senses of this realm of universals of forms
1598940	1604460	that are not directly present to the senses? It looks as if I can't make sense of the world
1604460	1608620	and my own thinking about the world and my own communicating about it, unless I assume there are
1608620	1613980	such universals. But how do I know anything about them? How does that solve the problem exactly?
1613980	1619340	Surely then I must have some special faculty of knowledge. So it looks as if Plato has to
1619340	1625820	postulate some special faculty of knowledge, saying I really do have not only my physical eyes
1625820	1630460	that can perceive things through the senses, I have something like an eye of the mind
1630540	1637020	that can think about triangularity or humanity or being a tree or something else that is strictly
1637020	1644140	universal and not directly tied to particular objects. In fact, I can then make up new universals
1644140	1648860	that I've never seen exemplified in a particular once I've mastered a certain number of these
1648860	1655020	universals. But how is that possible? That becomes a difficult philosophical question
1655020	1663580	and occupies plateness for centuries to come.
