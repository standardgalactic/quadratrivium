00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Hi, I want to talk to you today about Immanuel Kant's Copernican Revolution in philosophy.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,480
Kant sees himself as doing for philosophy, just what Copernicus did to astronomy and

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,000
to our general perspective on the universe.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Kant thinks he's switching our perspective on the entire philosophical universe.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,360
And in some sense, he did.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,440
Richard Rorty has said that Kant is the person who turned philosophy into a profession,

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,680
basically because his thinking was so difficult that you had to be a professional to understand

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
it.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,080
And Kant is difficult.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,880
Nevertheless, he transformed the philosophical world in a fundamental way, everyone writing

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,440
after Kant, whether they approve of his revolution or not.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,080
Nevertheless, he is in some sense responding to Kant and seeing things in the light of

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,000
what Kant argued and what Kant accomplished.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
What did Kant accomplish?

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
I think there's a sense in which he was right that he did fundamentally transform the way

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,840
we think about certain philosophical problems.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,240
But there's another sense in which he was doing the reverse of what he claimed.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,820
He really wasn't like Copernicus, as I'll argue.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,680
He is somebody who was like the inverse of Copernicus, somebody who switched our perspective

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,920
but away from something like Copernicus's perspective toward something much more ancient.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,600
At any event, let's take a look at the view that Kant describes as transcendental idealism.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,000
It is, from one point of view, a kind of idealism.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,320
Nevertheless, it's not exactly a traditional kind of idealism, and in fact, in his greatest

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,640
work, The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues against idealism.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,200
He has a section entitled The Refutation of Idealism.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,520
So if transcendental idealism is an idealism at all, it's a very odd kind of idealism,

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
as we'll see.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,880
That phrase, Critique of Pure Reason, should be understood as ambiguous.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,920
In part, he is critiquing pure reason and pointing out that it has severe limits.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,160
On the other hand, it is also a critique conducted by pure reason.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,120
It is pure reason's critique.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,360
And so in that way, it is really something like pure reason critiquing itself.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Well, what did Copernicus do?

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,960
Copernicus transformed our understanding of the universe and transformed the science

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,960
of astronomy by reversing our perspective on our position in the universe.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,680
He did it by saying, look, according to an older conception, we are at the center of

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
the universe.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,000
The Earth is at the center.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,760
Everything revolves around us.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,600
However, he said that's not right.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Instead something else is at the center, at least, of the solar system.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,760
We revolve around it.

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,880
So here is an earlier Ptolemaic conception of the universe.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,080
There in the center is the Earth.

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,120
The Sun revolves around the Earth.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,040
And then other things revolve around the Earth as well, including the outer spheres containing

47
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,920
the stars.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,240
Copernicus, on the other hand, said, no, no, it's not like that at all.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,600
In fact, the Sun is at the center of the solar system.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
The Earth and the other planets revolve around it.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,640
Well, Kant sees himself as doing something like that.

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
Now exactly why?

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,720
Why does he think he's transforming our perspective in this?

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,480
Well, he sees himself as responding to the contrast between rationalism and empiricism,

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,760
a contrast that dominated early modern philosophy.

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,960
Kant himself was brought up in the rationalist tradition.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,760
He was a student of Christian Wolf, who was a student of Leibniz.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,880
And so he thought of things very much as Leibniz had.

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,760
He sees himself as part of that rationalist tradition.

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,080
However, he says that then he read David Hume, and Hume awoke him from his dogmatic slumber.

61
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,720
At that point, he changed his perspective and realized that he had to do something to

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,480
try to combine the insights of both the empiricist and the rationalist tradition.

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,800
How did he do it?

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,440
Well, the rationalists, people like Galvesena, Descartes, and Leibniz, had held that universality

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,600
and necessity, the kind you find in scientific laws, for example, but also in mathematics,

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,880
required synthetic a priori knowledge, knowledge of the world that was independent of experience.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,440
We weren't gaining a knowledge of universality from our particular experiences.

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,160
We weren't gaining knowledge of necessity from our contingent experiences.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
Instead, they were being supplied from some other source, something that was not from

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
experience at all, not a posteriori, so it had to be a priori.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
But it was really telling us something about the world, not just about language or concepts,

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,760
and so it had to be synthetic as well.

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,800
Well, Hume said, I think you've got the problem right, but the solution wrong.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,560
You're right that universality and necessity, causation, and a variety of other things aren't

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,680
coming from your contingent and particular experiences of the world.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,080
However, they aren't coming from reason at all.

77
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,040
There is no synthetic a priori savior waiting in the background to say, I have the cause

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,920
and the concepts you need, I have the principles you need, I'm going to allow you to get to

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
those conclusions.

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,400
Instead, Hume says, look, here's what's going on.

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,240
You see something happen a bunch of times, you get a feeling of expectation that it will

82
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
happen again.

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,720
It's that feeling, it's that sentiment inside you.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,240
It's not something rational.

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,920
There is no bit of knowledge underlying it.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,080
Instead, it is simply a passion.

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
It is custom or habit, but here, not a kind of cultural custom, instead a custom or habit

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
of the mind.

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,520
The mind does this, but why does it do it?

90
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Because it has this feeling inside.

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,080
So it's all based on something internal, these internal impressions to use his language.

92
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,100
Kant says, I think Hume is right that the source is in us.

93
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,000
But he's wrong to say it's something outside of reason.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,880
It's just a feeling, it's just sentiment.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,960
Kant says instead, no, it is something inside us.

96
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,600
In that respect, he's right.

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
But it's really part of reason itself.

98
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,520
So in that sense, he remains in the rationalist tradition.

99
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,560
He says Descartes, Leibniz, other rationalists basically had it right, in that there are

100
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,800
synthetic a priori bits of knowledge that supply the gaps here that take us from contingent

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,240
particular experience to universal and necessary conclusions.

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,160
But it's not as if they are things that are sort of automatic.

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,120
And once we realize their character, we realize they're very limited in what they can do

104
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,160
for us, they can apply to the appearances, the things we actually perceive in experience,

105
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,960
but they have no further application.

106
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,280
Well, how does he get there?

107
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,680
Here's the question Kant asks, and it's a disturbing but very fundamental question.

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,600
Do our concepts revolve around objects, as realists, for example, think, or do the objects

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,280
revolve around our concepts?

110
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,520
We've talked about the possible gap between mind and world.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,200
And now we can say, well, you might think the problem is that the world is what it is,

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,520
and mind has the job of conforming itself to the world.

113
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,040
Kant says, what if it's the reverse?

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,000
What if the mind is what it is, and the world has to conform to it?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,560
That's his revolution.

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,120
There isn't that serious a gap between mind and world, not because mind is adapted to

117
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,040
understanding the world, but because the world is adapted to being understood by mind.

118
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,440
Here's how he puts it.

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,760
It is hitherto been assumed that our knowledge must conform to the objects, but all attempts

120
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,080
to ascertain anything about these objects a priori by means of concepts, and thus to

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,080
extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption.

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,280
Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics

123
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,720
if we assume that the objects must conform to our knowledge.

124
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,480
Well, that is his remarkable revolution.

125
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,000
He says, the problem isn't getting our ideas to conform to the objects in the world.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,480
Instead, it's the objects problem to conform to our mind.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,000
Now, that's a bit surprising, right?

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,040
I mean, you might think, look, it's my job to investigate, to find out about the world.

129
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
Kant says, relax.

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,600
It's the world's job to conform itself to you.

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Now, at first glance, that seems bizarre.

132
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,720
You might say, no, I don't think it's really like that.

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
It's a little harder than that, right?

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,600
Why would I have to go to school if it's the world's job to conform itself to my mind?

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
It looks like I don't have to learn anything.

136
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,040
I don't have to exert any effort.

137
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,400
It's the world's job to match me.

138
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,600
But of course, that's not quite what he means.

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:45,440
What he means is that our minds are constituted in such a way that they can only process the

140
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,800
information that our bodies and our minds are receiving from the world in certain ways.

141
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,880
And they form out of that information they're receiving, a conception of objects.

142
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,560
Those objects, as we understand them, are constructed by the mind.

143
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
He was right about that.

144
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Objects are being constructed by us.

145
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,560
But he's saying to that extent, the objects have to conform to the mind because the mind

146
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,200
is building them.

147
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,280
But the world is giving us this information.

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not as if that's a bizarre idea.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No, the world is somehow transmitting information to us.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,920
But then we are processing that information.

151
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,760
And what we do with it forces it to conform to the structures of our mind.

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,480
So the objects, as we understand them, are part of the output of that process.

153
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,440
So of course, they conform to the mind.

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,120
It's not the mind's job to conform to those objects.

155
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Those objects are constructed in such a way that they do conform to the basic structures

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
of my mind.

157
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,120
That's how it's possible for me to know something a priori about them.

158
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,080
Let's take a look at how Caught compares himself to Copernicus.

159
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,600
He says, we may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects.

160
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,800
If the intuition, and here he means intuition in the sense in which Avicenna used the term,

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,760
it's something like sensation or perception, not just sort of what we mean by intuition

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
where I can't really explain it but I have this feeling.

163
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
It's not feeling.

164
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,320
It's really a matter of sensation or sensibility.

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,880
Anyway, if the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects, I don't see how we

166
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
could know anything of them a priori.

167
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,920
If on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition,

168
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,640
that is to say our faculties of sensation and of understanding, I can then easily conceive

169
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,200
the possibility of such an a priori knowledge.

170
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,280
So if it's my job to match the world, I have no reason to think that my mind is built in

171
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,200
such a way that I could have a priori knowledge of the way that world is.

172
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,760
That world is independent of my mind.

173
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
It's far into my mind.

174
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,440
I have no reason to believe that my mind matches it and certainly no guarantee that it will.

175
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,760
So it looks as if I can't know anything about an a priori independently of experience of

176
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,440
it, but if the world is something that has to conform to me, or let's be more precise

177
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,120
really, if the objects have to conform themselves to me because I'm the one constructing out

178
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:19,360
of all this information I encounter, then I can know something about them a priori.

179
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
So Kant says, we here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,240
celestial movements.

181
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,880
When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved

182
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,880
around the spectator, he reversed the process and tried the experiment of assuming that

183
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,960
the spectator revolved while the stars remained at rest.

184
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:46,080
So earlier people thought the heavenly bodies are revolving around us, but instead Copernicus

185
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,880
said, what if we're revolving around this particular heavenly body, the sun?

186
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
That changes the perspective.

187
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
We're revolving it's stationary.

188
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,800
It's not the case that we're stationary and everything's revolving around us.

189
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,560
Now I mentioned that I think Kant is in a sense doing the reverse.

190
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Why?

191
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,680
Because realism would say our concepts have to revolve around an external world, a world

192
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,000
that is external, a world of objects that are independent of our minds.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,360
But Kant says, no, no, no, the world of objects revolves around us.

194
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,560
The world of objects has to revolve around our concepts.

195
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,320
Our concepts aren't revolving around those objects.

196
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,560
So I think there's a sense in which this is really a Ptolemaic revolution.

197
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,880
That is really taking us back to a picture where we're at the center of the world.

198
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,920
We're at the center in the sense that our minds are constructing the objects in the

199
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
world.

200
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,480
And so the structure of the world is the result of the structure of my mind.

201
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,720
Think of it this way.

202
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Earlier philosophers thought of, let's say, a window on the world, or a mirror.

203
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,360
In fact, a common image was the mind is the mirror of the world.

204
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,120
And so the mirror might get cloudy, it might get dusty, it might get broken.

205
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,520
But the understanding was, look, it's essentially a mirror of the world, at least when it's

206
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
working well.

207
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,920
That's the ideal.

208
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,520
Kant's saying, what if it's more like a projector?

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,080
The world is something like what's displayed on a screen.

210
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,040
And the world is the projector, projecting it onto that screen.

211
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,520
Now, of course, there's some input into the projector.

212
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,400
I mean, it's receiving some information from something.

213
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,800
It has a film strip or a digital file.

214
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,840
It's doing something that it's processing and producing that projection.

215
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,880
Nevertheless, you might say, if I know something about that projector, then I can know something

216
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,640
before I even see the images projected about what they're going to be like.

217
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,720
I might know, OK, the projector is like this.

218
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,120
Suppose I know, for example, it just produces black and white images.

219
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
Then I'll know that what I'm about to see is in black and white.

220
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,920
It's not going to be in color.

221
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,680
And I can know that before I even see what's on the screen, because I understand the structure

222
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
of the projector.

223
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,200
Now, if this is something like a mirror, you might say, look, I don't know what's going

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
to be on the mirror.

225
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,080
I have to know what it's reflecting.

226
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,280
That's the more traditional perspective.

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,520
But if the mind is like a projector, then if I understand the nature of the projector,

228
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,440
I'll understand something about the nature of what's going to be projected before I

229
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,560
even have any experience of what is actually projected.

230
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,280
In just the same sense, if the mind is like a projector, if it's the mind that is giving

231
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,200
structure to the objects of the world, then it is possible for me to know something about

232
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,760
those objects a priori, independently of experience of them, because I can understand something

233
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,680
of the nature of the projector.

234
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,600
So there is a sense in which Kant is really saying, look, the mind doesn't have to revolve

235
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
around the world.

236
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,720
The world revolves around the mind.

237
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,600
And by putting ourselves at the center, that's the sense in which I think he's really doing

238
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,840
something like the reverse of the Copernican Revolution.

239
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,280
So here is how he describes it.

240
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,200
And you'll see here how he gets to rationalist conclusions.

241
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,560
He says, before objects are given to me, that is, a priori, I must presuppose in myself

242
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,920
laws of the understanding, which are expressed in concepts a priori.

243
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,320
To these concepts, then, all the objects of experience must necessarily conform.

244
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,040
So in order for me to be able to understand anything about objects, a priori, independently

245
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,600
of experience, there must be certain laws of the understanding.

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,120
In other words, before I know anything independently of experience about what's going to be projected

247
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,320
on that screen, I have to know something of the laws by which that projector operates.

248
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,200
And there better be concepts I have a priori, concepts, ways, in other words, I have of

249
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,120
understanding things that are independent of what I'm getting off the images on the screen.

250
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,480
So I have to have some innate ideas, I have to have some synthetic a priori knowledge,

251
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,840
these laws of the understanding.

252
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,520
So Kant does turn out to be a rationalist in something like the traditional sense.

253
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,400
There are innate ideas, these pure concepts of the understanding, something that he calls

254
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,240
the categories, and we'll talk about those separately.

255
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,000
There also have to be synthetic a priori truths, which he calls the laws of the understanding.

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,560
If there are these categories built into the mind, these a priori concepts or innate ideas,

257
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,520
and there are also synthetic a priori truths or laws of the understanding, understanding

258
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,760
those is going to enable me to understand the nature of this projector.

259
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,080
And that will enable me to understand something universal and necessary about what is about

260
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,600
to be projected in experience, even independently of and prior to experience.

261
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,680
However, something important is, you might say, a byproduct of this way of understanding

262
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
things.

263
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,280
These things apply only within the realm of experience.

264
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,240
I can say something universal and necessary about what's going to appear on that screen.

265
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,160
I can say, okay, it's going to be black and white, and it's going to be of a certain

266
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,960
kind of resolution, because I know something about the nature of the projector.

267
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:13,280
But now if you say, okay, fine, tell me something about the input that projector is receiving.

268
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I have to say, I don't really know.

269
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Or maybe I do.

270
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,080
Maybe I know enough about the projector to say a little bit about it, to say, well, it

271
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,600
only understands digital files.

272
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,960
Or it's an old-fashioned one.

273
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,160
It only takes a film strip.

274
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,920
You can't take a flash drive and do anything, and it won't play a DVD and so forth.

275
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,200
So I might know something very general about the input, but I'm not going to know much

276
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
about it.

277
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,800
If you want to say, yeah, I want to know what's in these digital files.

278
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,800
For example, if that's the input, I can tell you, here's what it's capable of doing with

279
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,560
them, and so I can tell you it's going to be of this resolution, and it's all going to

280
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,560
be in black and white, and it's going to be a projection on this screen of that size.

281
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
But that's all I can say.

282
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,120
I can't tell you anything about what is actually going to be in the input.

283
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,400
And so I can only say something about things as I'm going to experience them.

284
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,600
I can tell you something about what will be on the screen.

285
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,880
I can't tell you anything about the world beyond what's on the screen.

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,240
So I can't tell you anything about the inputs.

287
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,760
And just so, Cart will say, I can come up with universal and necessary knowledge, independently

288
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,960
of experience now, and that's a beautiful thing.

289
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,600
But it applies only to the realm of experience.

290
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,960
If you then say, well, I'm interested in things going beyond experience, like I'm interested

291
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,320
in the nature of God.

292
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,560
I'm interested in the nature of the will and whether the will is free.

293
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,840
I want to know whether we have a soul and whether that soul is mortal or immoral, if

294
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
it exists.

295
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,120
Kant says, I can't tell you any of that, okay?

296
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
That's not something that's covered here.

297
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,400
I can't say a word about any of that.

298
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,440
I can tell you something about what kinds of experiences you're capable of having.

299
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
But that's all.

300
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
I can't tell you about anything.

301
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,840
And in fact, it will turn out I actually can't tell you anything about things as they are

302
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,440
in themselves.

303
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,520
I can tell you something about the appearances, something about the way they're going to look

304
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,200
to us and experience.

305
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,480
I can't tell you what they really are independently of that experience.

306
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,080
Kant gives us a kind of transcendental argument.

307
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,360
We've seen this in Descartes, but Kant is the one who makes this form of argument really

308
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,860
famous.

309
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,520
Here's the general structure of it.

310
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Q is a necessary condition for the possibility of P. In other words, P would not even be possible

311
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,520
if it weren't the case that Q.

312
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,320
But P is the case.

313
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,000
P is not only possible, it really is actual.

314
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Therefore, Q.

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,120
Well, in the form Kant uses it, it takes on this structure.

316
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,880
Descartes had talked about clear and distinct ideas using this form of argument.

317
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,360
Kant says this, a priori concepts and laws of the understanding are necessary conditions

318
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,520
for the possibility of experience.

319
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,040
Experience would not even be possible unless we had some of these a priori concepts and

320
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,760
laws of the understanding.

321
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,360
To put it in terms of my metaphor, it's as if he's saying, look, nothing would be on

322
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,080
that screen if we didn't have a projector.

323
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,920
And that seems possible.

324
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,200
It's like, look, in order for anything to appear on the screen of experience, something

325
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,440
has to be projecting it if we don't have a projector.

326
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,040
And if it doesn't work, if it doesn't have any structure and it won't do anything, nothing

327
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,120
will appear on the screen.

328
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
Experience wouldn't even be possible.

329
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
But experience is possible.

330
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,000
We're having an experience right now.

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,560
So he says there have to be a priori concepts, there have to be laws of the understanding.

332
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,800
But what results is, well, we only know in things a priori what we ourselves place in

333
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
them.

334
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,720
We know nothing about what they are in themselves.

335
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
We only know what we put into them.

336
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,840
So the laws that govern the realm of experience are in us.

337
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,480
Those are those laws of the understanding.

338
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,080
But that does mean that we can know things only as they're experienced by us, not as

339
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,320
they are in themselves.

340
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,920
So I mentioned at the outset that Kant does end up being a rationalist, but an odd kind

341
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,140
of rationalist.

342
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,240
He ends up being, well, kind of an idealist, but an odd kind of idealist.

343
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,920
Something of a realist, you could argue, but an odd kind of realist.

344
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,240
Here are the questions on which he agrees with either Descartes or Hume.

345
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,160
Descartes here being the paradigm of a rationalist of the early modern period, and Hume being

346
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,360
the paradigm of an empiricist of the early modern period.

347
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
Is there synthetic a priori knowledge?

348
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Descartes, the rationalist, says yes.

349
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
Hume, the empiricist, says no.

350
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Kant says yes.

351
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
It's based on those laws of the understanding.

352
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,920
It applies only within the realm of experience, but we do have synthetic a priori knowledge.

353
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,240
So there he's agreeing with Descartes and Leibniz and the other rationalists.

354
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,840
Does that knowledge extend beyond experience?

355
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Descartes says yes.

356
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,000
I can prove the existence of God, for example.

357
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,960
I can talk about primary qualities, matching our ideas, that is to say, of primary qualities,

358
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,920
matching the qualities that are really in the thing.

359
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
Hume says no.

360
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000
We don't have any knowledge beyond experience.

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,480
All of our knowledge that is not purely verbal is merely a posteriori.

362
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,240
Kant says no.

363
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,160
He agrees with Hume about that.

364
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,040
We can have synthetic a priori knowledge, but it does not extend beyond the realm of experience.

365
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,640
Can we know the world as it is?

366
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,840
Not just as it appears to us, but as it really is, independently of us.

367
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,440
Descartes, Leibniz and the other rationalists say yes.

368
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Hume says no.

369
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,120
In fact, I'm not even sure what you mean, Hume would say, about this world as it is beyond

370
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,680
the realm of experience.

371
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
What's that?

372
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,760
You're talking about substances?

373
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,000
You're talking about actual, ah, none of that makes any sense.

374
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Kant agrees with Hume here.

375
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
He says no.

376
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
You can't have any knowledge of the world as it is.

377
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
And so we can't know anything beyond experience.

378
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
We can't know the world as it is.

379
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,280
We can only know something about it as it appears on the screen of experience.

380
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:26,400
But of the things that we ordinarily think of as objects, that he calls objects of experience

381
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,160
or appearances, well, we can know lots of things about those.

382
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,240
Let me show you what Kant is really doing.

383
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,800
Kant is transforming our way of understanding how the mind relates to objects.

384
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,480
So let's start with Plato in the little picture we've drawn.

385
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,560
Here is a mind and a thought of an object.

386
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,480
Let's say a triangle since I've been talking about those all semester.

387
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,200
What's going on there according to Plato?

388
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,400
Well in part it's that triangle affecting the mind, causally in some way through perception.

389
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:09,200
We recognize that thing as a triangle, so I'm able to think of this thing as a triangle

390
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,840
only by virtue of having access somehow to a form, an abstract universal triangularity.

391
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,520
And so the mind is also turned toward that form of triangularity.

392
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,760
That's the form.

393
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,360
And the object participates in the form.

394
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,560
So I'm actually capable of knowing that's a triangle because my mind manages to relate

395
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,800
itself to the form that actually is in the object.

396
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,480
So this constitutes not only thinking that this object is a triangle, but also if it

397
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,920
really is a triangle then getting it right and having knowledge that it's a triangle.

398
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:55,360
The first thing that Kant does is to say, hmm, these forms and these innate ideas really

399
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
along the way.

400
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,760
I have something like an idea of triangularity that relates to that form.

401
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,880
This particular thought that that thing is a triangle is mobilizing that general concept

402
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,280
or idea and according to Plato then that would be an idea of triangularity, would relate

403
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,800
to this directly.

404
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,040
But Kant says, really, I don't think there's anything out here.

405
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,280
I'm talking about pure concepts of the understanding.

406
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,000
So actually, let's think of the mind as extending to include that form.

407
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,120
That is to say, the forms could really be understood as identified with the concepts

408
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
now.

409
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,080
I don't even have to draw that distinction.

410
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:45,640
I can just say, this is now a pure concept, one of these a priori concepts.

411
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,400
And then I can say, aha, what's going on here?

412
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,120
The object participates in that?

413
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,620
Actually the object is formed by my conceptual activity.

414
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,040
So this arrow goes in one direction.

415
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:11,920
This is something like a relationship, not just a participation, but a projection.

416
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,000
So the mind is projecting this object of experience.

417
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,480
Well, wait, that object of experience was causing me to have this thought.

418
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
That's a triangle, right?

419
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,360
Kant says, well, not exactly, not exactly.

420
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,800
This is really a creature of the mind.

421
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Now something is, my mind is presumably getting some kind of input here through perception.

422
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,160
So I've got a faculty of sensibility here.

423
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,920
I'll say, this is like my eye.

424
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,940
And something is giving me this.

425
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:53,820
This is the thing in itself, the thing as it is independently of my mind.

426
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:59,460
But this thing, the thing that is being projected by my mind, that's an object of experience

427
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,100
or an appearance.

428
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:08,820
So he does talk about these in several different ways, an object of experience, which is the

429
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,520
same thing in his language as an appearance.

430
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,140
And he then introduces a technical term for that, drawing from ancient Greek sources and

431
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:27,460
says, objects like this are phenomena, phenomenon for one of them.

432
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,900
But I'll make them all plural here, since I made that one plural.

433
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,180
The phenomena are the appearances, they're the objects of experience.

434
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,620
And now we can say, oh, wait, I see what's going on here.

435
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,940
Something, it's something like, look, the projector is getting some kind of information,

436
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
right?

437
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,140
It's some kind of input.

438
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,540
It's projecting this stuff on the screen.

439
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,520
So this is something like the image on the screen being projected by the projector.

440
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,060
This is whatever the projector is using to generate what it's doing and doing the projection.

441
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,420
Well, what is that exactly?

442
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,020
I don't have direct experience of that.

443
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,380
Or at least let's put it this way.

444
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,580
It does seem like I do in the sense that it's, I guess, having some effect on me.

445
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,820
In the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, he's happy to say, yes, I'm gathering

446
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,220
information and this thing in itself is in some way causing my mind to start this process,

447
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,660
causing me to have this perception and so on.

448
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,740
But as we'll see later, cause turns out to be one of these categories that applies only

449
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,660
within the realm of experience.

450
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,860
And by the realm of experience, he means the kinds of things that are projected on that

451
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,480
screen.

452
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,140
So these aren't projected.

453
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:46,100
So well, or in a certain sense they are, but they don't appear there as anything like

454
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,980
this form.

455
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,740
So in the end, he says, I can't actually officially save it.

456
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,980
This is causal.

457
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,740
So really, I'm going to take this arrow and kind of make it dotted to indicate there's

458
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,700
something happening here, right?

459
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,180
Something is going into the projector, I guess, if I can even say going in, but what

460
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,620
the relationship is between my mind sensibility and the thing in itself I can't really quite

461
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
say.

462
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,820
Now, once we've got something like this picture, and by the way, this is something that is

463
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,580
already in a sense in Barkley, even in a sense in Descartes and Locke, because now the question

464
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,140
is, this thing is what we've referred to as the cause.

465
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,820
Here I'm going to put cause in scare quotes.

466
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,380
We can't officially say that in constant.

467
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Not really a cause.

468
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,880
It's not clear what it is.

469
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,380
Over here, we've got something like what actually appears.

470
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,100
And now the question is, what's the relationship between these two?

471
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:50,300
What's the relationship between that triangle as it appears in experience and the thing

472
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:57,500
in itself, whatever is affecting the mind ultimately to lead it to experience that triangle

473
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,260
as we experience it?

474
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,780
There are different approaches we might take.

475
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,580
So for example, Aristotle would say, well, I'll tell you what this relationship is,

476
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,420
it's identity.

477
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:17,020
The cause of perception is represented in the perception and is represented in the way

478
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,140
that these objects of experience are.

479
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,580
So actually the object of experience, the appearance, that is just the thing in itself.

480
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,060
That is the cause of perception.

481
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,060
Well, that's one answer.

482
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,020
Descartes and Locke say, well, that's a little too simple.

483
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,340
Because after all, it's really the atoms.

484
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,060
It is something described by physics that is having an effect on our bodies and that

485
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,660
our minds project something, but it includes primary qualities as well as secondary qualities.

486
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,460
And the primary qualities are really in the thing itself, but the secondary qualities

487
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
aren't.

488
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,260
So the shape, the motion, yeah, that's in the thing itself.

489
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,900
However, the color, the texture, the taste, the smell, that's something being supplied

490
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
by the mind.

491
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,820
That's only part of the phenomenon.

492
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,060
So if you're Descartes or Locke, you're going to say this isn't exactly identity, but there

493
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,100
is a relation of similarity between them.

494
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,020
They're going to share primary qualities, but they won't share secondary qualities.

495
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,500
In fact, the secondary qualities won't be down here at all.

496
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,460
What else could we say?

497
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,420
Well, Barclay looks at this picture and says, I don't like this at all, because once we

498
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,260
get rid of the identity, now the skeptic can come in and say, aha, there's this unbridgeable

499
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,820
gulf between the objects of experience and the things themselves.

500
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,580
How can we ever know anything about the world we can't?

501
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,980
And so, indeed, this is the point of the argument from comparison in Philo and in Sextus.

502
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,700
We can never get across that gap.

503
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:56,220
We have no idea whether our objects, as constructed, whether the appearances match anything in

504
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
reality.

505
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,740
And so we'd end up in skepticism.

506
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,420
Barclay says, well, it'd be great if we could identify these.

507
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,260
As Aristotle does, it would be great if we could say the primary qualities at least match

508
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,260
as Descartes and Locke do, but he says, since I can't experience these, I got no way to

509
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
do that.

510
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,060
So what does Barclay do?

511
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,100
He says, get rid of those, OK?

512
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,860
Get rid of the things in themselves.

513
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,300
Then no problem.

514
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,460
You're an idealist.

515
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,020
And so idealism is usually construed, does exactly that.

516
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,660
Get rid of the thing in itself.

517
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,740
And we're going to look at the philosophy of Hegel.

518
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,620
That is one of the main criticisms that Hegel makes of Kant.

519
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,460
He says, you don't need the thing in itself.

520
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Get rid of it.

521
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,220
And then we've got idealism in its traditional form.

522
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,300
Well, what is Kant doing?

523
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,980
He doesn't identify them.

524
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,380
He doesn't say they're similar, and I'll tell you in what respects they're similar,

525
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,100
as Descartes and Locke do.

526
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,380
He doesn't get rid of the thing in itself entirely, as Barclay and Hegel do.

527
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:58,180
So what does he do?

528
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,780
He leaves it a question.

529
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,860
Now, when it first comes out, well, that's just great, Kant.

530
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,740
But I think that is precisely the way it gets left.

531
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,220
In the end, he says, there are the objects of experience, the appearances, the phenomena.

532
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,860
We can know about those.

533
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,220
We can know things about them in a synthetic, a priori fashion.

534
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,780
I can really know about the world, not just verbal truths about these, not just logic,

535
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,320
not just math even.

536
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,900
But I can know all sorts of things about these because I can know something about what's

537
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,440
going to be projected on the screen by understanding the projector.

538
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,500
So I can know something about these in a synthetic, a priori fashion.

539
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,020
I can't know anything about these.

540
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,100
I can't know anything about them synthetic, a priori, but actually, he's going to say,

541
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,500
I can't know anything about this relation.

542
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,620
Now he will argue, in that section I referred to, the refutation of idealism.

543
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,380
They have to be here.

544
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
Don't get rid of them.

545
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,140
They're doing something.

546
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,020
But I can't tell you what they're doing.

547
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,260
And in principle, I can't tell you what they're doing.

548
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,980
They lie beyond the realm of experience.

549
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,380
They're not on the screen.

550
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,780
And I can only base my knowledge on what's in my mind and what's on that screen.

551
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,580
So I can't know what the relationship is.

552
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,300
In fact, I can't officially even say they exist because existence is something I use

553
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,180
for the things that are on the screen.

554
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,340
But look, I can't get rid of them.

555
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:26,820
If you say, but they don't exist, no, it won't work if we do that.

556
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,540
And so we'll see why later.

557
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,220
But that, as I see it, is where it leaves us.

558
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,620
We're in a picture where something like the forms, these abstract universals,

559
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,260
they're in the head as these a priori concepts of the understanding.

560
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,940
We project the objects of experience.

561
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,580
So we can know something about the objects of experience before we even

562
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,140
encounter the inexperience.

563
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,700
We can know this a priori because we can understand the nature of this projection.

564
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,860
But can we know anything about the inputs to the process and

565
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,220
how they relate to what appears on the screen of experience?

566
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,260
No, in the end, we can't know anything about that at all.
