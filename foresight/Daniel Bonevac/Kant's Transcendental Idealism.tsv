0	12160	Hi, I want to talk to you today about Immanuel Kant's Copernican Revolution in philosophy.
12160	17480	Kant sees himself as doing for philosophy, just what Copernicus did to astronomy and
17480	20000	to our general perspective on the universe.
20000	23840	Kant thinks he's switching our perspective on the entire philosophical universe.
23840	25360	And in some sense, he did.
25360	30440	Richard Rorty has said that Kant is the person who turned philosophy into a profession,
30440	34680	basically because his thinking was so difficult that you had to be a professional to understand
34680	35680	it.
35680	37080	And Kant is difficult.
37080	41880	Nevertheless, he transformed the philosophical world in a fundamental way, everyone writing
41880	45440	after Kant, whether they approve of his revolution or not.
45440	51080	Nevertheless, he is in some sense responding to Kant and seeing things in the light of
51080	55000	what Kant argued and what Kant accomplished.
55000	56480	What did Kant accomplish?
56480	61480	I think there's a sense in which he was right that he did fundamentally transform the way
61480	64840	we think about certain philosophical problems.
64840	68240	But there's another sense in which he was doing the reverse of what he claimed.
68240	70820	He really wasn't like Copernicus, as I'll argue.
70820	75680	He is somebody who was like the inverse of Copernicus, somebody who switched our perspective
75680	80920	but away from something like Copernicus's perspective toward something much more ancient.
80920	87600	At any event, let's take a look at the view that Kant describes as transcendental idealism.
87600	91000	It is, from one point of view, a kind of idealism.
91000	96320	Nevertheless, it's not exactly a traditional kind of idealism, and in fact, in his greatest
96320	101640	work, The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues against idealism.
101640	105200	He has a section entitled The Refutation of Idealism.
105200	110520	So if transcendental idealism is an idealism at all, it's a very odd kind of idealism,
110520	111880	as we'll see.
111880	115880	That phrase, Critique of Pure Reason, should be understood as ambiguous.
115880	120920	In part, he is critiquing pure reason and pointing out that it has severe limits.
120920	125160	On the other hand, it is also a critique conducted by pure reason.
125160	127120	It is pure reason's critique.
127120	132360	And so in that way, it is really something like pure reason critiquing itself.
132360	135200	Well, what did Copernicus do?
135200	139960	Copernicus transformed our understanding of the universe and transformed the science
139960	146960	of astronomy by reversing our perspective on our position in the universe.
146960	151680	He did it by saying, look, according to an older conception, we are at the center of
151680	152680	the universe.
152680	154000	The Earth is at the center.
154000	155760	Everything revolves around us.
155760	158600	However, he said that's not right.
158600	162800	Instead something else is at the center, at least, of the solar system.
162800	164760	We revolve around it.
164760	168880	So here is an earlier Ptolemaic conception of the universe.
168880	171080	There in the center is the Earth.
171080	173120	The Sun revolves around the Earth.
173120	179040	And then other things revolve around the Earth as well, including the outer spheres containing
179040	180920	the stars.
180920	185240	Copernicus, on the other hand, said, no, no, it's not like that at all.
185240	187600	In fact, the Sun is at the center of the solar system.
187600	190960	The Earth and the other planets revolve around it.
191960	195640	Well, Kant sees himself as doing something like that.
195640	197320	Now exactly why?
197320	200720	Why does he think he's transforming our perspective in this?
200720	207480	Well, he sees himself as responding to the contrast between rationalism and empiricism,
207480	210760	a contrast that dominated early modern philosophy.
210760	213960	Kant himself was brought up in the rationalist tradition.
213960	217760	He was a student of Christian Wolf, who was a student of Leibniz.
217760	220880	And so he thought of things very much as Leibniz had.
220880	223760	He sees himself as part of that rationalist tradition.
223760	230080	However, he says that then he read David Hume, and Hume awoke him from his dogmatic slumber.
230080	234720	At that point, he changed his perspective and realized that he had to do something to
234720	239480	try to combine the insights of both the empiricist and the rationalist tradition.
239480	240800	How did he do it?
240800	247440	Well, the rationalists, people like Galvesena, Descartes, and Leibniz, had held that universality
247440	252600	and necessity, the kind you find in scientific laws, for example, but also in mathematics,
252600	258880	required synthetic a priori knowledge, knowledge of the world that was independent of experience.
258880	263440	We weren't gaining a knowledge of universality from our particular experiences.
263440	267160	We weren't gaining knowledge of necessity from our contingent experiences.
267160	271600	Instead, they were being supplied from some other source, something that was not from
271600	276080	experience at all, not a posteriori, so it had to be a priori.
276080	280240	But it was really telling us something about the world, not just about language or concepts,
280240	282760	and so it had to be synthetic as well.
282760	288800	Well, Hume said, I think you've got the problem right, but the solution wrong.
288800	293560	You're right that universality and necessity, causation, and a variety of other things aren't
293560	297680	coming from your contingent and particular experiences of the world.
297680	301080	However, they aren't coming from reason at all.
301080	306040	There is no synthetic a priori savior waiting in the background to say, I have the cause
306040	309920	and the concepts you need, I have the principles you need, I'm going to allow you to get to
309920	310920	those conclusions.
310920	314400	Instead, Hume says, look, here's what's going on.
314400	318240	You see something happen a bunch of times, you get a feeling of expectation that it will
318240	319240	happen again.
319240	321720	It's that feeling, it's that sentiment inside you.
321720	323240	It's not something rational.
323240	325920	There is no bit of knowledge underlying it.
325920	328080	Instead, it is simply a passion.
328080	333120	It is custom or habit, but here, not a kind of cultural custom, instead a custom or habit
333120	334120	of the mind.
334120	336520	The mind does this, but why does it do it?
336520	338520	Because it has this feeling inside.
338520	344080	So it's all based on something internal, these internal impressions to use his language.
344080	348100	Kant says, I think Hume is right that the source is in us.
348100	351000	But he's wrong to say it's something outside of reason.
351000	353880	It's just a feeling, it's just sentiment.
353880	356960	Kant says instead, no, it is something inside us.
356960	358600	In that respect, he's right.
358600	361200	But it's really part of reason itself.
361200	364520	So in that sense, he remains in the rationalist tradition.
364520	371560	He says Descartes, Leibniz, other rationalists basically had it right, in that there are
371560	378800	synthetic a priori bits of knowledge that supply the gaps here that take us from contingent
378800	383240	particular experience to universal and necessary conclusions.
383240	387160	But it's not as if they are things that are sort of automatic.
387160	392120	And once we realize their character, we realize they're very limited in what they can do
392120	398160	for us, they can apply to the appearances, the things we actually perceive in experience,
398160	399960	but they have no further application.
399960	403280	Well, how does he get there?
403280	408680	Here's the question Kant asks, and it's a disturbing but very fundamental question.
408680	415600	Do our concepts revolve around objects, as realists, for example, think, or do the objects
415600	418280	revolve around our concepts?
418280	421520	We've talked about the possible gap between mind and world.
421520	428200	And now we can say, well, you might think the problem is that the world is what it is,
428200	431520	and mind has the job of conforming itself to the world.
431520	433040	Kant says, what if it's the reverse?
433040	438000	What if the mind is what it is, and the world has to conform to it?
438000	439560	That's his revolution.
439560	445120	There isn't that serious a gap between mind and world, not because mind is adapted to
445120	451040	understanding the world, but because the world is adapted to being understood by mind.
451040	452440	Here's how he puts it.
452440	457760	It is hitherto been assumed that our knowledge must conform to the objects, but all attempts
457760	462080	to ascertain anything about these objects a priori by means of concepts, and thus to
462080	467080	extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption.
467080	471280	Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics
471320	475720	if we assume that the objects must conform to our knowledge.
475720	478480	Well, that is his remarkable revolution.
478480	483000	He says, the problem isn't getting our ideas to conform to the objects in the world.
483000	486480	Instead, it's the objects problem to conform to our mind.
486480	489000	Now, that's a bit surprising, right?
489000	493040	I mean, you might think, look, it's my job to investigate, to find out about the world.
493040	494240	Kant says, relax.
494240	497600	It's the world's job to conform itself to you.
497600	500400	Now, at first glance, that seems bizarre.
500400	502720	You might say, no, I don't think it's really like that.
502720	504280	It's a little harder than that, right?
504280	508600	Why would I have to go to school if it's the world's job to conform itself to my mind?
508600	510200	It looks like I don't have to learn anything.
510200	512040	I don't have to exert any effort.
512040	515400	It's the world's job to match me.
515400	517600	But of course, that's not quite what he means.
517600	525440	What he means is that our minds are constituted in such a way that they can only process the
525480	531800	information that our bodies and our minds are receiving from the world in certain ways.
531800	536880	And they form out of that information they're receiving, a conception of objects.
536880	541560	Those objects, as we understand them, are constructed by the mind.
541560	542880	He was right about that.
542880	545960	Objects are being constructed by us.
545960	550560	But he's saying to that extent, the objects have to conform to the mind because the mind
550560	552200	is building them.
552200	554280	But the world is giving us this information.
554320	556000	It's not as if that's a bizarre idea.
556000	560000	No, the world is somehow transmitting information to us.
560000	562920	But then we are processing that information.
562920	568760	And what we do with it forces it to conform to the structures of our mind.
568760	573480	So the objects, as we understand them, are part of the output of that process.
573480	575440	So of course, they conform to the mind.
575440	578120	It's not the mind's job to conform to those objects.
578120	582320	Those objects are constructed in such a way that they do conform to the basic structures
582320	583680	of my mind.
583680	589120	That's how it's possible for me to know something a priori about them.
589120	593080	Let's take a look at how Caught compares himself to Copernicus.
593080	597600	He says, we may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects.
597600	602800	If the intuition, and here he means intuition in the sense in which Avicenna used the term,
602800	607760	it's something like sensation or perception, not just sort of what we mean by intuition
607760	610560	where I can't really explain it but I have this feeling.
610560	611560	It's not feeling.
611560	614320	It's really a matter of sensation or sensibility.
614320	618880	Anyway, if the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects, I don't see how we
618880	621600	could know anything of them a priori.
621600	626920	If on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition,
626920	633640	that is to say our faculties of sensation and of understanding, I can then easily conceive
633640	637200	the possibility of such an a priori knowledge.
637200	642280	So if it's my job to match the world, I have no reason to think that my mind is built in
642280	646200	such a way that I could have a priori knowledge of the way that world is.
646200	647760	That world is independent of my mind.
647760	648760	It's far into my mind.
648760	654440	I have no reason to believe that my mind matches it and certainly no guarantee that it will.
654440	658760	So it looks as if I can't know anything about an a priori independently of experience of
658760	665440	it, but if the world is something that has to conform to me, or let's be more precise
665800	671120	really, if the objects have to conform themselves to me because I'm the one constructing out
671120	679360	of all this information I encounter, then I can know something about them a priori.
679360	683600	So Kant says, we here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the
683600	685240	celestial movements.
685240	688880	When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved
688880	693880	around the spectator, he reversed the process and tried the experiment of assuming that
693880	697960	the spectator revolved while the stars remained at rest.
697960	706080	So earlier people thought the heavenly bodies are revolving around us, but instead Copernicus
706080	711880	said, what if we're revolving around this particular heavenly body, the sun?
711880	713240	That changes the perspective.
713240	715240	We're revolving it's stationary.
715240	719800	It's not the case that we're stationary and everything's revolving around us.
719800	723560	Now I mentioned that I think Kant is in a sense doing the reverse.
723600	724600	Why?
724600	730680	Because realism would say our concepts have to revolve around an external world, a world
730680	736000	that is external, a world of objects that are independent of our minds.
736000	741360	But Kant says, no, no, no, the world of objects revolves around us.
741360	745560	The world of objects has to revolve around our concepts.
745560	748320	Our concepts aren't revolving around those objects.
748320	752560	So I think there's a sense in which this is really a Ptolemaic revolution.
752560	756880	That is really taking us back to a picture where we're at the center of the world.
756880	759920	We're at the center in the sense that our minds are constructing the objects in the
759920	760920	world.
760920	765480	And so the structure of the world is the result of the structure of my mind.
765480	767720	Think of it this way.
767720	772240	Earlier philosophers thought of, let's say, a window on the world, or a mirror.
772240	776360	In fact, a common image was the mind is the mirror of the world.
776360	780120	And so the mirror might get cloudy, it might get dusty, it might get broken.
780120	783520	But the understanding was, look, it's essentially a mirror of the world, at least when it's
783520	784520	working well.
784520	786920	That's the ideal.
786920	789520	Kant's saying, what if it's more like a projector?
789520	793080	The world is something like what's displayed on a screen.
793080	796040	And the world is the projector, projecting it onto that screen.
796040	798520	Now, of course, there's some input into the projector.
798520	801400	I mean, it's receiving some information from something.
801400	804800	It has a film strip or a digital file.
804800	808840	It's doing something that it's processing and producing that projection.
808840	814880	Nevertheless, you might say, if I know something about that projector, then I can know something
814880	818640	before I even see the images projected about what they're going to be like.
818640	821720	I might know, OK, the projector is like this.
821720	825120	Suppose I know, for example, it just produces black and white images.
825120	828880	Then I'll know that what I'm about to see is in black and white.
828880	830920	It's not going to be in color.
830920	834680	And I can know that before I even see what's on the screen, because I understand the structure
834680	836680	of the projector.
836680	840200	Now, if this is something like a mirror, you might say, look, I don't know what's going
840200	841200	to be on the mirror.
841200	843080	I have to know what it's reflecting.
843080	845280	That's the more traditional perspective.
845280	849520	But if the mind is like a projector, then if I understand the nature of the projector,
849520	853440	I'll understand something about the nature of what's going to be projected before I
853440	858560	even have any experience of what is actually projected.
858560	863280	In just the same sense, if the mind is like a projector, if it's the mind that is giving
863280	868200	structure to the objects of the world, then it is possible for me to know something about
868200	872760	those objects a priori, independently of experience of them, because I can understand something
872760	875680	of the nature of the projector.
875680	880600	So there is a sense in which Kant is really saying, look, the mind doesn't have to revolve
880600	881600	around the world.
881600	883720	The world revolves around the mind.
883720	887600	And by putting ourselves at the center, that's the sense in which I think he's really doing
887600	892840	something like the reverse of the Copernican Revolution.
892840	895280	So here is how he describes it.
895280	900200	And you'll see here how he gets to rationalist conclusions.
900200	906560	He says, before objects are given to me, that is, a priori, I must presuppose in myself
906560	911920	laws of the understanding, which are expressed in concepts a priori.
911920	917320	To these concepts, then, all the objects of experience must necessarily conform.
917320	923040	So in order for me to be able to understand anything about objects, a priori, independently
923040	926600	of experience, there must be certain laws of the understanding.
926600	931120	In other words, before I know anything independently of experience about what's going to be projected
931120	937320	on that screen, I have to know something of the laws by which that projector operates.
937320	942200	And there better be concepts I have a priori, concepts, ways, in other words, I have of
942200	947120	understanding things that are independent of what I'm getting off the images on the screen.
947120	952480	So I have to have some innate ideas, I have to have some synthetic a priori knowledge,
952480	954840	these laws of the understanding.
954840	959520	So Kant does turn out to be a rationalist in something like the traditional sense.
959520	964400	There are innate ideas, these pure concepts of the understanding, something that he calls
964400	968240	the categories, and we'll talk about those separately.
968240	974000	There also have to be synthetic a priori truths, which he calls the laws of the understanding.
974000	980560	If there are these categories built into the mind, these a priori concepts or innate ideas,
980560	985520	and there are also synthetic a priori truths or laws of the understanding, understanding
985520	989760	those is going to enable me to understand the nature of this projector.
989760	995080	And that will enable me to understand something universal and necessary about what is about
995080	1000600	to be projected in experience, even independently of and prior to experience.
1000880	1006680	However, something important is, you might say, a byproduct of this way of understanding
1006680	1007680	things.
1007680	1010280	These things apply only within the realm of experience.
1010280	1015240	I can say something universal and necessary about what's going to appear on that screen.
1015240	1020160	I can say, okay, it's going to be black and white, and it's going to be of a certain
1020160	1025960	kind of resolution, because I know something about the nature of the projector.
1025960	1033280	But now if you say, okay, fine, tell me something about the input that projector is receiving.
1033280	1036280	I have to say, I don't really know.
1036280	1037280	Or maybe I do.
1037280	1042080	Maybe I know enough about the projector to say a little bit about it, to say, well, it
1042080	1045600	only understands digital files.
1045600	1046960	Or it's an old-fashioned one.
1046960	1048160	It only takes a film strip.
1048160	1053920	You can't take a flash drive and do anything, and it won't play a DVD and so forth.
1053920	1059200	So I might know something very general about the input, but I'm not going to know much
1059200	1060200	about it.
1060200	1064800	If you want to say, yeah, I want to know what's in these digital files.
1064800	1071800	For example, if that's the input, I can tell you, here's what it's capable of doing with
1071800	1075560	them, and so I can tell you it's going to be of this resolution, and it's all going to
1075560	1080560	be in black and white, and it's going to be a projection on this screen of that size.
1080560	1081800	But that's all I can say.
1081800	1086120	I can't tell you anything about what is actually going to be in the input.
1086120	1093400	And so I can only say something about things as I'm going to experience them.
1093400	1095600	I can tell you something about what will be on the screen.
1095600	1099880	I can't tell you anything about the world beyond what's on the screen.
1099880	1102240	So I can't tell you anything about the inputs.
1102240	1107760	And just so, Cart will say, I can come up with universal and necessary knowledge, independently
1107760	1110960	of experience now, and that's a beautiful thing.
1110960	1113600	But it applies only to the realm of experience.
1113600	1117960	If you then say, well, I'm interested in things going beyond experience, like I'm interested
1117960	1119320	in the nature of God.
1119320	1122560	I'm interested in the nature of the will and whether the will is free.
1122560	1127840	I want to know whether we have a soul and whether that soul is mortal or immoral, if
1127840	1128840	it exists.
1128840	1135120	Kant says, I can't tell you any of that, okay?
1135120	1136880	That's not something that's covered here.
1136880	1139400	I can't say a word about any of that.
1139400	1143440	I can tell you something about what kinds of experiences you're capable of having.
1143440	1144440	But that's all.
1144440	1146440	I can't tell you about anything.
1146440	1150840	And in fact, it will turn out I actually can't tell you anything about things as they are
1150840	1152440	in themselves.
1152440	1156520	I can tell you something about the appearances, something about the way they're going to look
1156520	1158200	to us and experience.
1158200	1163480	I can't tell you what they really are independently of that experience.
1163480	1166080	Kant gives us a kind of transcendental argument.
1166080	1170360	We've seen this in Descartes, but Kant is the one who makes this form of argument really
1170360	1171860	famous.
1171860	1173520	Here's the general structure of it.
1173520	1180320	Q is a necessary condition for the possibility of P. In other words, P would not even be possible
1180320	1182520	if it weren't the case that Q.
1182520	1184320	But P is the case.
1184320	1188000	P is not only possible, it really is actual.
1188000	1189000	Therefore, Q.
1189000	1195120	Well, in the form Kant uses it, it takes on this structure.
1195160	1199880	Descartes had talked about clear and distinct ideas using this form of argument.
1199880	1205360	Kant says this, a priori concepts and laws of the understanding are necessary conditions
1205360	1208520	for the possibility of experience.
1208520	1214040	Experience would not even be possible unless we had some of these a priori concepts and
1214040	1215760	laws of the understanding.
1215760	1220360	To put it in terms of my metaphor, it's as if he's saying, look, nothing would be on
1220360	1223080	that screen if we didn't have a projector.
1223080	1225920	And that seems possible.
1225920	1229200	It's like, look, in order for anything to appear on the screen of experience, something
1229200	1232440	has to be projecting it if we don't have a projector.
1232440	1237040	And if it doesn't work, if it doesn't have any structure and it won't do anything, nothing
1237040	1239120	will appear on the screen.
1239120	1240720	Experience wouldn't even be possible.
1240720	1242720	But experience is possible.
1242720	1245000	We're having an experience right now.
1245000	1251560	So he says there have to be a priori concepts, there have to be laws of the understanding.
1251560	1257800	But what results is, well, we only know in things a priori what we ourselves place in
1257800	1258800	them.
1258800	1260720	We know nothing about what they are in themselves.
1260720	1263200	We only know what we put into them.
1263200	1266840	So the laws that govern the realm of experience are in us.
1266840	1269480	Those are those laws of the understanding.
1269480	1275080	But that does mean that we can know things only as they're experienced by us, not as
1275080	1277320	they are in themselves.
1277320	1281920	So I mentioned at the outset that Kant does end up being a rationalist, but an odd kind
1281920	1283140	of rationalist.
1283140	1288240	He ends up being, well, kind of an idealist, but an odd kind of idealist.
1288240	1291920	Something of a realist, you could argue, but an odd kind of realist.
1291920	1296240	Here are the questions on which he agrees with either Descartes or Hume.
1296240	1302160	Descartes here being the paradigm of a rationalist of the early modern period, and Hume being
1302160	1306360	the paradigm of an empiricist of the early modern period.
1306400	1308720	Is there synthetic a priori knowledge?
1308720	1310720	Descartes, the rationalist, says yes.
1310720	1313200	Hume, the empiricist, says no.
1313200	1314200	Kant says yes.
1314200	1317200	It's based on those laws of the understanding.
1317200	1321920	It applies only within the realm of experience, but we do have synthetic a priori knowledge.
1321920	1326240	So there he's agreeing with Descartes and Leibniz and the other rationalists.
1326240	1329840	Does that knowledge extend beyond experience?
1329840	1330840	Descartes says yes.
1330840	1333000	I can prove the existence of God, for example.
1333080	1337960	I can talk about primary qualities, matching our ideas, that is to say, of primary qualities,
1337960	1340920	matching the qualities that are really in the thing.
1340920	1342200	Hume says no.
1342200	1344000	We don't have any knowledge beyond experience.
1344000	1349480	All of our knowledge that is not purely verbal is merely a posteriori.
1349480	1351240	Kant says no.
1351240	1353160	He agrees with Hume about that.
1353160	1359040	We can have synthetic a priori knowledge, but it does not extend beyond the realm of experience.
1359040	1361640	Can we know the world as it is?
1361760	1365840	Not just as it appears to us, but as it really is, independently of us.
1365840	1369440	Descartes, Leibniz and the other rationalists say yes.
1369440	1370440	Hume says no.
1370440	1375120	In fact, I'm not even sure what you mean, Hume would say, about this world as it is beyond
1375120	1376680	the realm of experience.
1376680	1377680	What's that?
1377680	1378760	You're talking about substances?
1378760	1383000	You're talking about actual, ah, none of that makes any sense.
1383000	1385200	Kant agrees with Hume here.
1385200	1386320	He says no.
1386320	1388880	You can't have any knowledge of the world as it is.
1388880	1390880	And so we can't know anything beyond experience.
1390880	1392960	We can't know the world as it is.
1392960	1399280	We can only know something about it as it appears on the screen of experience.
1399280	1406400	But of the things that we ordinarily think of as objects, that he calls objects of experience
1406400	1411160	or appearances, well, we can know lots of things about those.
1411160	1414240	Let me show you what Kant is really doing.
1414240	1421800	Kant is transforming our way of understanding how the mind relates to objects.
1421800	1425480	So let's start with Plato in the little picture we've drawn.
1425480	1429560	Here is a mind and a thought of an object.
1429560	1434480	Let's say a triangle since I've been talking about those all semester.
1434480	1436200	What's going on there according to Plato?
1436200	1441400	Well in part it's that triangle affecting the mind, causally in some way through perception.
1441400	1449200	We recognize that thing as a triangle, so I'm able to think of this thing as a triangle
1449200	1456840	only by virtue of having access somehow to a form, an abstract universal triangularity.
1456840	1462520	And so the mind is also turned toward that form of triangularity.
1462520	1464760	That's the form.
1464760	1468360	And the object participates in the form.
1468360	1473560	So I'm actually capable of knowing that's a triangle because my mind manages to relate
1473560	1476800	itself to the form that actually is in the object.
1476800	1482480	So this constitutes not only thinking that this object is a triangle, but also if it
1482480	1487920	really is a triangle then getting it right and having knowledge that it's a triangle.
1487920	1495360	The first thing that Kant does is to say, hmm, these forms and these innate ideas really
1495360	1496360	along the way.
1496360	1499760	I have something like an idea of triangularity that relates to that form.
1499760	1504880	This particular thought that that thing is a triangle is mobilizing that general concept
1504880	1511280	or idea and according to Plato then that would be an idea of triangularity, would relate
1511280	1513800	to this directly.
1513800	1519040	But Kant says, really, I don't think there's anything out here.
1519040	1522280	I'm talking about pure concepts of the understanding.
1522280	1527000	So actually, let's think of the mind as extending to include that form.
1527000	1531120	That is to say, the forms could really be understood as identified with the concepts
1531120	1532120	now.
1532120	1534080	I don't even have to draw that distinction.
1534080	1545640	I can just say, this is now a pure concept, one of these a priori concepts.
1545640	1550400	And then I can say, aha, what's going on here?
1550440	1553120	The object participates in that?
1553120	1558620	Actually the object is formed by my conceptual activity.
1558620	1564040	So this arrow goes in one direction.
1564040	1571920	This is something like a relationship, not just a participation, but a projection.
1571920	1576000	So the mind is projecting this object of experience.
1576000	1580480	Well, wait, that object of experience was causing me to have this thought.
1580480	1581680	That's a triangle, right?
1581680	1586360	Kant says, well, not exactly, not exactly.
1586360	1587800	This is really a creature of the mind.
1587800	1593800	Now something is, my mind is presumably getting some kind of input here through perception.
1593800	1596160	So I've got a faculty of sensibility here.
1596160	1601920	I'll say, this is like my eye.
1601920	1603940	And something is giving me this.
1603940	1613820	This is the thing in itself, the thing as it is independently of my mind.
1613820	1619460	But this thing, the thing that is being projected by my mind, that's an object of experience
1619460	1621100	or an appearance.
1621100	1628820	So he does talk about these in several different ways, an object of experience, which is the
1628820	1634520	same thing in his language as an appearance.
1634520	1640140	And he then introduces a technical term for that, drawing from ancient Greek sources and
1640140	1647460	says, objects like this are phenomena, phenomenon for one of them.
1647460	1651900	But I'll make them all plural here, since I made that one plural.
1651900	1656180	The phenomena are the appearances, they're the objects of experience.
1656180	1662620	And now we can say, oh, wait, I see what's going on here.
1662620	1666940	Something, it's something like, look, the projector is getting some kind of information,
1666940	1667940	right?
1667940	1669140	It's some kind of input.
1669140	1671540	It's projecting this stuff on the screen.
1671540	1676520	So this is something like the image on the screen being projected by the projector.
1676520	1682060	This is whatever the projector is using to generate what it's doing and doing the projection.
1682060	1684420	Well, what is that exactly?
1684420	1687020	I don't have direct experience of that.
1687020	1689380	Or at least let's put it this way.
1689380	1693580	It does seem like I do in the sense that it's, I guess, having some effect on me.
1693580	1697820	In the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, he's happy to say, yes, I'm gathering
1697820	1704220	information and this thing in itself is in some way causing my mind to start this process,
1704220	1706660	causing me to have this perception and so on.
1706660	1710740	But as we'll see later, cause turns out to be one of these categories that applies only
1710740	1712660	within the realm of experience.
1712660	1715860	And by the realm of experience, he means the kinds of things that are projected on that
1715860	1717480	screen.
1717480	1719140	So these aren't projected.
1719140	1726100	So well, or in a certain sense they are, but they don't appear there as anything like
1726100	1727980	this form.
1727980	1730740	So in the end, he says, I can't actually officially save it.
1730740	1731980	This is causal.
1731980	1738740	So really, I'm going to take this arrow and kind of make it dotted to indicate there's
1738740	1741700	something happening here, right?
1741700	1746180	Something is going into the projector, I guess, if I can even say going in, but what
1746180	1750620	the relationship is between my mind sensibility and the thing in itself I can't really quite
1750620	1751620	say.
1751620	1756820	Now, once we've got something like this picture, and by the way, this is something that is
1756820	1762580	already in a sense in Barkley, even in a sense in Descartes and Locke, because now the question
1762580	1767140	is, this thing is what we've referred to as the cause.
1767140	1770820	Here I'm going to put cause in scare quotes.
1770900	1773380	We can't officially say that in constant.
1773380	1774380	Not really a cause.
1774380	1775880	It's not clear what it is.
1775880	1780380	Over here, we've got something like what actually appears.
1780380	1783100	And now the question is, what's the relationship between these two?
1783100	1790300	What's the relationship between that triangle as it appears in experience and the thing
1790300	1797500	in itself, whatever is affecting the mind ultimately to lead it to experience that triangle
1797500	1800260	as we experience it?
1800260	1802780	There are different approaches we might take.
1802780	1807580	So for example, Aristotle would say, well, I'll tell you what this relationship is,
1807580	1809420	it's identity.
1809420	1817020	The cause of perception is represented in the perception and is represented in the way
1817020	1819140	that these objects of experience are.
1819140	1824580	So actually the object of experience, the appearance, that is just the thing in itself.
1824580	1827060	That is the cause of perception.
1828060	1831060	Well, that's one answer.
1831060	1835020	Descartes and Locke say, well, that's a little too simple.
1835020	1837340	Because after all, it's really the atoms.
1837340	1842060	It is something described by physics that is having an effect on our bodies and that
1842060	1847660	our minds project something, but it includes primary qualities as well as secondary qualities.
1847660	1851460	And the primary qualities are really in the thing itself, but the secondary qualities
1851460	1852460	aren't.
1852460	1855260	So the shape, the motion, yeah, that's in the thing itself.
1855460	1859900	However, the color, the texture, the taste, the smell, that's something being supplied
1859900	1860900	by the mind.
1860900	1862820	That's only part of the phenomenon.
1862820	1867060	So if you're Descartes or Locke, you're going to say this isn't exactly identity, but there
1867060	1870100	is a relation of similarity between them.
1870100	1875020	They're going to share primary qualities, but they won't share secondary qualities.
1875020	1879500	In fact, the secondary qualities won't be down here at all.
1879500	1881460	What else could we say?
1881460	1887420	Well, Barclay looks at this picture and says, I don't like this at all, because once we
1887420	1894260	get rid of the identity, now the skeptic can come in and say, aha, there's this unbridgeable
1894260	1899820	gulf between the objects of experience and the things themselves.
1899820	1902580	How can we ever know anything about the world we can't?
1902580	1907980	And so, indeed, this is the point of the argument from comparison in Philo and in Sextus.
1907980	1909700	We can never get across that gap.
1909700	1916220	We have no idea whether our objects, as constructed, whether the appearances match anything in
1916220	1917220	reality.
1917220	1919740	And so we'd end up in skepticism.
1919740	1922420	Barclay says, well, it'd be great if we could identify these.
1922420	1926260	As Aristotle does, it would be great if we could say the primary qualities at least match
1926260	1930260	as Descartes and Locke do, but he says, since I can't experience these, I got no way to
1930260	1931260	do that.
1931260	1933060	So what does Barclay do?
1933060	1937100	He says, get rid of those, OK?
1937100	1938860	Get rid of the things in themselves.
1938900	1940300	Then no problem.
1940300	1941460	You're an idealist.
1941460	1945020	And so idealism is usually construed, does exactly that.
1945020	1946660	Get rid of the thing in itself.
1946660	1948740	And we're going to look at the philosophy of Hegel.
1948740	1951620	That is one of the main criticisms that Hegel makes of Kant.
1951620	1953460	He says, you don't need the thing in itself.
1953460	1954460	Get rid of it.
1954460	1957220	And then we've got idealism in its traditional form.
1957220	1960300	Well, what is Kant doing?
1960300	1961980	He doesn't identify them.
1961980	1965380	He doesn't say they're similar, and I'll tell you in what respects they're similar,
1965380	1967100	as Descartes and Locke do.
1967100	1971380	He doesn't get rid of the thing in itself entirely, as Barclay and Hegel do.
1971380	1978180	So what does he do?
1978180	1979780	He leaves it a question.
1979780	1984860	Now, when it first comes out, well, that's just great, Kant.
1984860	1987740	But I think that is precisely the way it gets left.
1987740	1994220	In the end, he says, there are the objects of experience, the appearances, the phenomena.
1994220	1995860	We can know about those.
1995860	2000220	We can know things about them in a synthetic, a priori fashion.
2000220	2003780	I can really know about the world, not just verbal truths about these, not just logic,
2003780	2005320	not just math even.
2005320	2008900	But I can know all sorts of things about these because I can know something about what's
2008900	2012440	going to be projected on the screen by understanding the projector.
2012440	2016500	So I can know something about these in a synthetic, a priori fashion.
2016500	2018020	I can't know anything about these.
2018020	2022100	I can't know anything about them synthetic, a priori, but actually, he's going to say,
2022100	2024500	I can't know anything about this relation.
2024500	2028620	Now he will argue, in that section I referred to, the refutation of idealism.
2028620	2030380	They have to be here.
2030380	2031380	Don't get rid of them.
2031380	2033140	They're doing something.
2033140	2035020	But I can't tell you what they're doing.
2035020	2037260	And in principle, I can't tell you what they're doing.
2037260	2038980	They lie beyond the realm of experience.
2038980	2040380	They're not on the screen.
2040380	2045780	And I can only base my knowledge on what's in my mind and what's on that screen.
2045780	2048580	So I can't know what the relationship is.
2048580	2054300	In fact, I can't officially even say they exist because existence is something I use
2054300	2057180	for the things that are on the screen.
2057180	2060340	But look, I can't get rid of them.
2060340	2066820	If you say, but they don't exist, no, it won't work if we do that.
2066820	2069540	And so we'll see why later.
2069540	2073220	But that, as I see it, is where it leaves us.
2073220	2077620	We're in a picture where something like the forms, these abstract universals,
2077620	2081260	they're in the head as these a priori concepts of the understanding.
2081260	2083940	We project the objects of experience.
2083980	2087580	So we can know something about the objects of experience before we even
2087580	2089140	encounter the inexperience.
2089140	2094700	We can know this a priori because we can understand the nature of this projection.
2094700	2097860	But can we know anything about the inputs to the process and
2097860	2102220	how they relate to what appears on the screen of experience?
2102220	2105260	No, in the end, we can't know anything about that at all.
