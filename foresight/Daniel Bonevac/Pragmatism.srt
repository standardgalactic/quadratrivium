1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Today, we're going to talk about pragmatism.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,600
Pragmatism is one philosophical view that is thoroughly American in its orientation.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,240
In fact, most people think of American philosophy and immediately think of pragmatism.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
And there was a period in the late 19th century and early 20th century when the pragmatists

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
really dominated American philosophy.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,280
There were other groups to be sure.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
There were some realists.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,640
There were some personalists, some monists, and so on.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,480
But the pragmatists had a strong lock on most very good American philosophy departments.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,000
And that really became a symbol of American philosophy.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,680
These days, pragmatism is in a little bit of a retreat in the sense that figures like

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,400
Perse, James, and Dewey, who were the key figures in that early movement, no longer

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,960
have quite the same level of respect.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,120
But nevertheless, their attitudes and their perspective continues to be highly influential,

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,680
not just in the United States, but throughout the English-speaking world at least, and increasingly

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,840
has an impact on French and German philosophy, too.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,200
So pragmatism remains a very appealing philosophy to many people, a very powerful philosophy

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,240
that whatever one ends up thinking about it needs to be addressed and dealt with.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,400
In the United States, it was formulated, at first, by Charles Sandler's Perse.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,660
Perse had an odd academic career.

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,200
He hung around Harvard for much of his academic life, though he never really was hired there

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
as a professor.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,440
He had various subsidiary positions.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,720
He was himself trained as a scientist at Johns Hopkins and ended up living most of his life

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,280
in a large house in rural Pennsylvania, not too far from the Delaware River, and in other

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,960
words, just across the river from New Jersey.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,120
Well, he developed something known as the Pragmatic Theory of Truth.

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,400
He didn't like the fact that his principle of pragmatism became so popular that other

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,160
thinkers began to use it, and actually, in his view, misuse it.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,680
He changed the name of his view to pragmatism because he thought it was ugly enough that

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,480
no one would try to copy it.

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,960
Luckily for us, that did not really stick, and so his view is still known as pragmatism.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,640
Here is the key idea behind it.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,240
The principle of pragmatism says there is no difference in meaning without a difference

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,720
in practice.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,040
So what really matters is what difference it makes.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Indeed, we sometimes talk about things and think about a discussion that somebody's having

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,200
and say, well, what difference does it make?

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,320
And that's exactly Perse's question.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,480
He says we should be asking that about everything.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,380
Let's say two people are debating a question in theology about the nature of God.

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,220
One person says, I think God is absolutely simple.

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,780
All the properties of God end up being identical.

44
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,980
The other person says, I don't think that's true.

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,100
I don't think this idea of the simplicity of God makes any sense.

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,980
Perse says, what difference does it make?

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,900
What difference does it make to your actual practice?

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,620
In this case, the way you live your life or the way you live your religious life, does

49
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,260
it make a difference in how you worship?

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,140
Does it make a difference in what you do in any respect?

51
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,580
If not, there's no difference.

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Ignore it.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,140
It's a meaningless dispute.

54
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,820
Don't waste your time.

55
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,140
And some pragmatists put it in a very strong form, saying, look, then there is no difference

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,780
in meaning.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,140
The issue is utterly meaningless.

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,100
You're not talking about anything at all.

59
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,260
Others say, well, maybe you are.

60
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,540
You're wasting your time, though.

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,900
There's no point in discussing it.

62
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
It makes no difference.

63
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,060
And so as he means it, it really is the stronger version.

64
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,300
There is no difference in meaning.

65
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,220
Of course, it doesn't just happen in theology.

66
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,300
It can happen all over the place in philosophy and politics.

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,820
You can say, well, in the end, what does it matter?

68
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,460
What do we do differently if this is true?

69
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,820
And if the answer is nothing, stop fighting about it.

70
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,780
This dispute doesn't really mean anything.

71
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,020
It's not really about anything.

72
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,980
So his idea is that meaning depends entirely on practice.

73
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,980
And pragmatists are fond of using the phrase, the cash value of something.

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,660
What he means by talking about the cash value of a view or the cash value of a proposition

75
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,860
is simply this, the difference it would make in practice.

76
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,220
To get clear about the meanings of our terms and our thoughts,

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,620
we need to be clear about the practical antecedents and their practical effects.

78
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,460
What would, practically speaking, make somebody say that?

79
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,940
And what difference would it make if they were true?

80
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,260
What would the effect of that view be?

81
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,900
All too often, he says, we look around and we find out nothing.

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
People are fighting about nothing.

83
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,020
They're arguing about an issue.

84
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,820
And in the end, you say, I don't understand why it makes a difference.

85
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,940
Now, we've got to be careful here because sometimes it makes a difference of a kind,

86
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,740
but no difference to what we might do now.

87
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,380
Suppose two people are historians and they're fighting about the details

88
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,660
of what happened during the 14th century.

89
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,900
Well, are they really involved in a meaningless discussion?

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,060
Presumably not, even though you and I would say,

91
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,540
well, I'm not going to live any differently,

92
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,260
depending on what exactly you decide happened in the 1340s.

93
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,660
But there is a difference about what they're going to teach,

94
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
for example, what they're going to write.

95
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,940
And so we don't want to say about all of history.

96
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,420
Forget it, it doesn't make any difference.

97
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,860
Or at least, if it's not immediately relevant to our present situation,

98
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,460
doesn't make any difference, so history is meaningless.

99
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,260
We certainly don't want to say that.

100
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,180
So we've got to be cautious here and understand difference in practice

101
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,740
in a very broad sense.

102
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,620
But there are still issues that you might say I don't see how even the historian

103
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,300
or even the astronomer or whatever is going to really do anything differently

104
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,860
as a result of all of this.

105
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,180
And he thinks that happens fairly frequently.

106
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,220
Much more frequent, however, is the idea that we're fighting about something,

107
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,780
arguing about something, and we aren't identifying the real issue.

108
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,180
We think the issue is this, but really when you analyze it and say,

109
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,980
what difference would it make in practice, you realize, oh, it's really this.

110
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,300
And that kind of thing does happen all the time in everyday life,

111
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,500
as well as in academic contexts or political contexts or religious contexts.

112
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,100
We're fighting about a certain issue, and really when you come right down to it

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,380
and analyze the practical difference it would make, that's not really the issue.

114
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,260
The issue is this other thing.

115
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,660
And so that, he thinks, is very common.

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,460
The pragmatist principle can help you identify what the real issue is

117
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,060
that you ought to be talking about.

118
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,100
Well, Peirce starts out as a follower of Hegel.

119
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220
And indeed, throughout the 19th century, all over the United States,

120
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,620
in large cities in small towns, Hegel society sprang up,

121
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,540
and people began reading the works of Hegel and discussing them in these small social groups.

122
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,700
These book clubs basically devoted to the works of Hegel.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,340
Now, from our point of view today, that seems like a bizarre thing.

124
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,380
For one thing, we have book clubs, but they don't tend to address philosophical works,

125
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,660
especially long, serious philosophical works like the phenomenology of spirit.

126
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,140
But also, Hegel is a notoriously difficult philosopher.

127
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,100
So why were people so devoted to this?

128
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,740
And how did that turn into pragmatism?

129
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,220
Well, Hegel had, in a way, a dramatically new idea.

130
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,460
This new idea was that absolute truth isn't there before us to be discovered in the world right now.

131
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,340
It is the end of a long dynamic process.

132
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,380
And so there are these higher level dynamic laws,

133
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,740
like the thesis antithesis synthesis law, but also like other laws,

134
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,100
that are going to operate on the development of thought.

135
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,100
And that we are on a ride toward the achievement of absolute knowledge.

136
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,180
We're geist, we're the spirit, we're mind, ultimately and fully realizes itself.

137
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,340
It's an inspiring picture.

138
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,660
It fits in with the 19th century's conception of itself as an age of progress.

139
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,460
Hegel is essentially saying, yes, the entire history of the human race,

140
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,780
the human species is a story of progress,

141
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,780
thought getting closer and closer to absolute knowledge and the absolute truth.

142
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,140
And so there's a way in which it had a strong appeal for the American spirit.

143
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,100
It also was something that seemed to promise a new way of thinking about

144
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,620
philosophical problems and practical problems together.

145
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,700
Because they were all bound up together.

146
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,860
The way we think about everything is something that is part of the development of this spirit.

147
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,700
And then how we act, that's all a result of the way we're thinking about things.

148
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,540
And so it's all driven by these dynamic processes.

149
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,820
The idea of progress, of dynamics, of moving forward in this way,

150
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,260
was tremendously exciting to people.

151
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,140
Perse is deeply influenced by all of this, but he makes two major changes to Hegel's scheme.

152
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,540
First of all, he replaces these perhaps mysterious dynamic principles,

153
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,740
like that one involving thesis, antithesis, synthesis,

154
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,340
with an empirically grounded account of scientific inquiry.

155
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,140
So he says, wait a minute, how does thought progress?

156
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,540
Well, insofar as it's rational, I'll tell you how it progresses.

157
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,940
It's not through mystical laws that have to be discovered through this very complicated process.

158
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,540
It's scientific method.

159
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,180
Scientific method is the way we have of actually advancing knowledge.

160
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,660
So we don't have to do our own independent philosophizing.

161
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,540
We can look at what scientists do.

162
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,980
Remember, he was trained as a scientist.

163
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,180
Secondly, he says, we use the idea of the limit of inquiry.

164
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,380
Not just as a hope and something we believe we're progressing toward,

165
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,780
is a definition of truth itself.

166
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,860
Those are important changes, and they make pragmatism quite distinctive.

167
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,020
It remains a version of idealism, but a really distinctive version of idealism.

168
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,420
So here's how we think about it.

169
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,940
Thought, as we ordinarily conceive it, aims at truth.

170
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,380
Now, not all thinking does.

171
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,980
Sometimes we're just musing, contemplating.

172
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,180
Sometimes we're telling stories, imagining things.

173
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,780
But when we're serious, in a scientific spirit or in the spirit of inquiry in general,

174
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,820
we want to find out what's true.

175
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,180
So truth is the goal of thinking, at least thinking of that kind.

176
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Well, the same thing is true of practice.

177
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,500
We want to base what we do on a real conception of the world.

178
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,060
We want to get things right.

179
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,740
If I am walking over to the edge of a cliff, I want to be sure I know where it is.

180
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,140
I don't want to fall off.

181
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:19,260
So I want that action to be based on thinking that is actually accurate about the world.

182
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,860
Well, what kind of thought and practice aims at the truth?

183
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,900
Not all thought and practice does, but some does.

184
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,340
And the paradigm of doing that is science.

185
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,260
Scientific inquiry aims at truth.

186
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,380
In particular, scientific inquiry aims at what we might call stable belief.

187
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,260
That is to say, belief we're not going to have to give up in the face of further information.

188
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,140
Our reasoning is typically what computer scientists today call non-monotomic.

189
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,700
That is to say, it doesn't always progress in the same direction.

190
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,380
It is not always a question of progressing, getting more and more theorems derived from our axioms.

191
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,620
If you think about Euclid's geometry or something like that as the model of knowledge,

192
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,780
which is something that philosophers did for centuries, Aristotle has something like that conception.

193
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,460
So does Descartes, so does Spinoza.

194
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,660
And if you think of knowledges like that, well, it really is like you identify the correct starting points

195
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,500
and then you just keep building truths on those and the realm of truth just gets bigger and bigger.

196
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,900
But Peirce says, well, that's not the way science goes.

197
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,740
In science, we frame hypotheses.

198
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,620
Then we experiment.

199
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,500
We test those hypotheses.

200
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,300
And sometimes they're confirmed.

201
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,260
Sometimes they're rejected.

202
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,860
Sometimes we have to make adjustments and try again with a new and better hypothesis.

203
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,660
And so we often give up beliefs in science in the face of further information.

204
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,660
In fact, these days it's popular for some people to say, well, the science is settled about x, y, or z.

205
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,820
Peirce would say, the science is never settled.

206
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,340
Science, no matter how well supported something is, is always open to the possibility that we're wrong about it.

207
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,700
It's our best hypothesis.

208
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,980
At the moment, our evidence seems to support it.

209
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,220
But even in such a case, he says, there is a real possibility

210
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,180
that it will have to be given up in the face of further information.

211
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,460
Our goal, of course, is to come to belief that as it happens, though they in principle could be overcome by further evidence,

212
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,060
they never really will be.

213
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,580
All the subsequent evidence will either support them or at least not contradict them.

214
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,740
So what we're doing in science is proposing hypotheses, testing them, developing them,

215
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,260
and trying to get them into a form where we no longer have to keep revising them or getting rid of them and replacing them.

216
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,540
Where we can instead say, well, this was our hypothesis, so far it's worked and it seems to keep working.

217
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,140
And our hope is it'll keep working on into the future.

218
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,940
So call a belief stable when it really will, when it will continue.

219
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,620
In principle, yes, it could be overturned, but in practice, in fact, it won't be.

220
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,500
That makes it a stable belief.

221
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Well, that's the goal of science.

222
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,660
So what is special about science and about scientific method?

223
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,780
It's self-correcting.

224
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,660
We make these observations.

225
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,460
We formulate hypotheses.

226
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,260
We test their consequences by experiment.

227
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,460
Then we revise the hypotheses in light of new evidence.

228
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,020
We're looking for stable ones that we won't have to revise anymore.

229
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:19,140
But hey, along the way, how do we have any confidence in the hypotheses we're making and in what survived tests so far?

230
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,580
Because we've been doing this.

231
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,100
We've been making hypotheses.

232
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,740
We've been making observations.

233
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,940
We test consequences by experiment.

234
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,060
We revise our hypotheses.

235
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,380
We keep going.

236
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,820
And so science is self-correcting.

237
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,060
Now, sometimes the correction happens quickly.

238
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,940
Sometimes it can take centuries before people realize, yes, this idea is wrong-headed.

239
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,780
We have to formulate a new hypothesis.

240
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:51,300
But that's partly because as science improves, it gets harder and harder to actually find cases that are really going to divide some scientific theories from others.

241
00:13:51,300 --> 00:14:13,700
And so often people are in a position where they say, look, we can't solve this without tremendous technological improvements, like building a supercollider, or sending an explorer beyond the solar system, or doing a variety of other things that are going to give us new kinds of evidence that will enable us to test theories in new ways.

242
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,940
So what gives us confidence in the scientific method is that it's self-correcting.

243
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,580
And Purr says, look, that's really a very special and very important quality to scientific method.

244
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,260
It's not something you find in other inquiries.

245
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,180
Is art self-correcting?

246
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:37,940
You might hope so, in that art that's really bad doesn't sell, and so people can't make a living at it, and they go out, you know, they have to do something else, and so on.

247
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,140
But really, there's nothing like this process in the art world, or in the world of literature, or the world of music, or other things.

248
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,900
There's something maybe kind of approximating it.

249
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:56,780
But science is unique in that it does make these observations, formulate the hypotheses, and then keep revising them whenever problems are encountered.

250
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,380
So here we see some examples of experiments.

251
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:05,980
Here a very disturbing one of seeing what happens to a bird when we pump all the air out of a chamber containing it.

252
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,660
As you can tell by the worried faces of the children, it's not going to be good.

253
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,740
Or here a dramatic experiment.

254
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:21,820
The man who is being shot at right there invented the bulletproof vest, and here is how he tested it.

255
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:41,220
He was so confident that it would work that his way of publicizing it was to get photographers there, get, yes, the police there, but also get various people who were journalists there to watch him being shot in the chest while he wore the bulletproof vest to prove that it worked and that he would survive.

256
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
He did.

257
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,700
People have admired Albert Einstein, partly because of his attitude about science.

258
00:15:51,700 --> 00:16:02,900
Lots of scientists get pretty attached to their theories, and sometimes it takes somebody else to actually test a hypothesis and find the experimental evidence that needs to be revised or rejected.

259
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,100
But Einstein was open to that from the very beginning.

260
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,980
Our goal, Perce would say, is to formulate laws and theories that survive experimental tests.

261
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,660
And that's the way Einstein thought of his own theories.

262
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,300
He said, look, there's this puzzle about the nature of time, about the speed of light.

263
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:29,700
I don't know how to make sense of the Michelson-Morley experiment and a variety of other phenomena that, by the turn of the century, physicists were aware of but had no explanation of.

264
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,660
So he formulated, first, the special theory of relativity, and then the general theory of relativity to try to solve those problems.

265
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,220
But his reaction to that wasn't to say, so here's the truth.

266
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,420
It was instead to say, these are hypotheses.

267
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:50,500
And where exactly is my theory going to differ from Newtonian theory or maybe other competing theories?

268
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,860
Well, he proposed some experimental tests and he said, here is what's going to test.

269
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:01,660
If I don't turn out to have the right predictions about these cases, get rid of my theory and replace it with something better.

270
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,260
So in 1905, he published the special theory of relativity.

271
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,180
According to that theory, length, velocity, simultaneity, and so on are relative to an inertial frame.

272
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,500
They're not absolute or primary qualities, as philosophers had tended to think.

273
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,140
They're relative to the perceiver.

274
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,500
And then in 1915, he proposed the general theory of relativity.

275
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,660
According to that, space-time curves around masses.

276
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,340
There is no action at a distance.

277
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,820
There is no force like the force of gravitation.

278
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:40,540
As in Newtonian theory, instead, space-time itself gets curved around massive objects and that gives the effect of a gravitational force.

279
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,580
So in Newton's theory, gravity works something like this.

280
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:50,380
We've got the law of gravitation that says the gravitational force is proportional to the gravitational constant

281
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:57,100
times the product of the masses of the object divided by the square of the distance between them.

282
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,380
In Einstein's theory, we get a picture like this.

283
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,860
The actual equations are incredibly complicated, involve the tensor calculus,

284
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,700
but the effect of it is that space-time has a curvature.

285
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,620
And that's why the moon revolves around the earth, because space-time is curved around a massive object like the earth.

286
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:23,020
Well, here are the classical texts that Einstein proposed, the perihelion precession of mercenary,

287
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,500
the deflection of light by the sun, and gravitational redshift of light.

288
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,220
He says, let's find out if we can observe these.

289
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,660
My theory predicts them.

290
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,020
Newton's doesn't.

291
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,460
Here's a good test case.

292
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,740
Let's measure carefully and see if we predict this.

293
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,940
And of course, there's a possibility.

294
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,700
Maybe Newton will turn out to be right.

295
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,780
Maybe Einstein's prediction will be right.

296
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,140
Maybe neither will be right, and we'll have to say we need yet another theory.

297
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,140
Well, people did that.

298
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,540
And in 1919, they came back with the report that Einstein's theory was correct.

299
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,140
So you can see here some things in the popular press.

300
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,540
It really took the public imagination.

301
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,060
Is there a fourth dimension?

302
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,900
Einstein's theory has given a tremendous jolt to the world of science.

303
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,940
Here is the key paper by Arthur Eddington of Two Tables fame,

304
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,700
who went to the Indian Ocean to do the measurements

305
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,660
and came back reporting on the results of the expedition,

306
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,580
which were to confirm Einstein's theory about the deflection of light

307
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,340
in the sun's gravitational field.

308
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,140
By observing the total eclipse of May 29, 1919,

309
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,340
that again revolutionized the scientific world.

310
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,300
And Paul Johnson, the historian in his book Modern Time,

311
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,820
says this is really the beginning of the 20th century.

312
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,300
Here, another newspaper headline,

313
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,900
how Dr. Einstein has modified our ideas of nature.

314
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,300
To the general public, it is startling to learn

315
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,700
that life doesn't travel in a straight line.

316
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,740
And then, Einstein theory causes scientific war.

317
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,420
The little highlighted passage there,

318
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,140
which you probably can't read on your screen, says this.

319
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,540
This should have ended a pleasant evening.

320
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,980
But after the meeting, a number of students chased Professor Einstein home

321
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,340
and threatened to cut his throat.

322
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,220
Well, yes.

323
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,700
It was something that stirred a great deal of passion, positive and negative.

324
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,620
It was something that did revolutionize people's conceptions of the universe

325
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,140
and their place in the universe.

326
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,940
And so the theory of relativity was something that was profoundly shocking to people,

327
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,180
making major newspaper headlines,

328
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,420
causing students to riot and chase him threatening to cut his throat

329
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,860
in a way that is a little hard for us to imagine these days.

330
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,500
One doesn't think anybody's going to read something in physics letters A,

331
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,940
for example, and suddenly start charging through the streets writing

332
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,780
or writing massive newspaper articles about it for the popular press.

333
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,580
In any case, the pragmatist says,

334
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,820
Einstein's attitude is exactly the scientific ideal.

335
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,580
We formulate these hypotheses and then we subject them to test.

336
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,340
We hope they'll survive the test,

337
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,660
but we face the fact they very well may not.

338
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,940
Well, this leads to a revision in our conception of the relationship

339
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,620
between science and truth, or at least so argues the pragmatist.

340
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,300
The correspondence theorist defines scientific activity

341
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,380
as the activity that aims at the truth.

342
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,180
And so far, I've been talking about it in that kind of common sense.

343
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,300
He way away popular among realists in philosophy

344
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,100
that says truth is correspondence with the facts.

345
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,340
Perce turns that around.

346
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:31,660
He says, let's instead define truth as that at which scientific activity aims.

347
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,540
So instead of saying what makes something science, it's it's aiming at truth.

348
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,220
Instead, we say, what is truth?

349
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,340
It's not correspondence with reality as if we could somehow step outside of science,

350
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,420
step outside of our own minds, our own language,

351
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,100
our own conceptual scheme, and grasp reality and judge a correspondence

352
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,260
between our statement and the fact.

353
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,860
He says, no, truth is defined as what science aims at, namely stable belief.

354
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,180
So truth becomes a belief that is not going to be overturned

355
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,180
in the face of further information, further experimentation, further testing.

356
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,860
So Perce puts it this way, the opinion that is fated to be ultimately agreed to

357
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,460
by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth.

358
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,820
And the object represented in this opinion is the real.

359
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,500
Reality is just being something that is part of and claimed,

360
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,100
has its existence claimed by our ultimate theory that people agree on.

361
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,300
And the opinion that's fated to be agreed to by everyone,

362
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,100
because it is stable belief it will never be overturned,

363
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,020
that is simply the truth.

364
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,540
That is what truth is.

365
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,260
So truth, according to Perce, is a kind of coherence.

366
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,420
He calls it a concordance with not just what we know now,

367
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,700
but with the ideal limit of scientific inquiry.

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,780
Not what even scientists will know tomorrow or the day after,

369
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,060
but the ultimate limit.

370
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,380
If we were able to carry out all experiments,

371
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,860
subject all of the hypotheses to that test, we'd end up believing this.

372
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,220
He says, that's the truth.

373
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,380
That's what it is for something to be true.

374
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,900
The truth is simply what we're all eventually bound to agree on.

375
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,620
Well, as I've stressed throughout,

376
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,820
Perce thinks that anything in principle could be overturned.

377
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,100
He's a fallibilist.

378
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,300
He thinks any of our beliefs might turn out to be mistaken.

379
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,780
Any of our hypotheses might turn out to get contrary evidence when we inquire.

380
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,300
So further inquiry is always something that could lead us to give up any of our beliefs.

381
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,380
Beliefs can be justified and kind of rise from a reliable process,

382
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,060
but still be fallible.

383
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,500
That means new evidence, new arguments, counter examples,

384
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,860
and so on might end up undercutting those beliefs.

385
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,500
So he says, we can have knowledge in the sense that we can form beliefs

386
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,580
that have good evidence behind them,

387
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,940
for which we have justification,

388
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,500
that have arisen from a reliable process,

389
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,460
that so far have not been overturned by any further evidence.

390
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,420
But we can never have certainty.

391
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,260
We can never have certainty about anything,

392
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,460
because it is always possible that further inquiry

393
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,660
will develop something that surprises us.

394
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,340
And so we will face new evidence that forces us to give up that belief.

395
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Well, that allows Purse to undermine some of Leibniz's arguments for rationalism.

396
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,460
Remember, Leibniz argued that contingent experience doesn't entail any necessary truths,

397
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,660
and particular experience doesn't entail any universal truths.

398
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
Purse is going to say, well, that's okay.

399
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,900
Nothing has to be entailed.

400
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,980
It doesn't have to be forced to be true on the basis of our experience.

401
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,460
It just has to be supported by our experience.

402
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,940
It has to be something that can explain our experience,

403
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,460
and it hasn't yet been overturned.

404
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,420
So he says, look, evidence never conclusively establishes a conclusion.

405
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,180
Leibniz wants too much.

406
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,380
He wants something that can serve as a universal and necessary

407
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,780
synthetic a priori principle to get us

408
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,780
from the contingent particular experiences

409
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,980
to these universal necessary law-like conclusions.

410
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,740
He says, that's not how it works.

411
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,500
We propose those necessary universal law-like things

412
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,660
as a way of explaining our experience,

413
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,260
but there's always a gap.

414
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,940
There's always fallibility.

415
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,380
These are never guaranteed.

416
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,860
We're in a position where we always might have to give them up.

417
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,260
The best we get up for is stability,

418
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,420
that we won't, in fact, have to give them up,

419
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,220
that further evidence is going to end up confirming them,

420
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,300
supporting them, rather than undermining them.

421
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,780
Well, here's how we should think of science then,

422
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,860
and in general, human inquiry.

423
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,420
It's a process of rational belief revision.

424
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,340
We encounter new information.

425
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,780
We update our beliefs.

426
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,740
We keep some of them.

427
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,700
We reject others.

428
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,500
We add new ones.

429
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,860
We revise some.

430
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,420
Truth is what works in the context

431
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,660
of that rational belief revision.

432
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,580
Sometimes people summarize pragmatism

433
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,260
by saying the truth is just what works.

434
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,220
Well, yes, but in this very special sense,

435
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,700
what continues to work in the context

436
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,740
of our attempt to revise our beliefs rationally.

437
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,620
It's not like, hey, I wasn't sure what to do

438
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,700
about that fence that's falling down in the backyard,

439
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,900
but I did this and it seemed to work.

440
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,660
So I guess everything I thought about it was true.

441
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,660
No, it's not like that.

442
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,980
It's like, look, we're doing the process of science.

443
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,580
We're engaged in this self-correcting form of inquiry.

444
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,460
And what works in the context of that, that we can call the truth.

445
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,580
So truth is what our process of rational belief revision

446
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,260
stabilizes on.

447
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,500
Truth is something that we end up agreeing to, he says,

448
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,740
when we engage in this self-correcting process

449
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,420
of rational belief revision.

450
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,500
We end up with some stable beliefs.

451
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,980
And that's what counts as the truth.
