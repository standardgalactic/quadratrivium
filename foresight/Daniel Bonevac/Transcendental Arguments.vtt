00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
Today, our topic is transcendental arguments.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.860
It's a very special kind of argument.

00:09.860 --> 00:14.800
It's one first found in the work of Immanuel Kant, who writes the critique of pure reason

00:14.800 --> 00:19.920
and includes within it a big section called the transcendental deduction.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.280
In the first edition it takes one form, it takes a second form in the second edition,

00:24.280 --> 00:28.840
he almost completely rewrites the argument there, and it is the critical argument of

00:28.840 --> 00:29.840
the work.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.160
Also the one that people most associate with Kant.

00:33.160 --> 00:37.400
But if we analyze the form of the argument, I think we'll see that it has a very general

00:37.400 --> 00:42.720
structure and you can find it in all sorts of places in the history of philosophy.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.800
It's a very powerful kind of argument and not only subsequently the Kant have philosophers

00:47.800 --> 00:52.840
thought a lot about it, people like Hegel and Heidegger for example, but also if you

00:52.840 --> 00:59.760
go back in time, I think you can find similar arguments in Plato, in Augustine, in Anselm,

00:59.760 --> 01:06.520
in a variety of other thinkers, who are all contemplating this general kind of structure.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.480
Now what is a transcendental argument?

01:08.480 --> 01:13.360
Well let's start with a much simpler form of argument to which it bears a close relation.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.000
That is to say modus ponens.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.480
Modus ponens is often taken to be the fundamental form of inference, in fact in some logical

01:21.480 --> 01:27.240
systems it is the only rule of inference, and it says this, if p then q, p therefore

01:27.240 --> 01:28.240
q.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.480
So let's write that out in a more precise and more abstract form.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.120
Here's the general structure of an argument for modus ponens.

01:35.120 --> 01:46.440
We have some sentence, let's just say a, and then we have a claim, if a, then b, we

01:46.440 --> 01:51.360
include therefore b, okay?

01:51.360 --> 01:56.720
So if it's sunny out, the streets aren't wet, it is sunny out.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.800
So the streets aren't wet.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.200
Or if Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.280
Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.800
That's a very simple form of argument, familiar to most of us, anybody who's studied introductory

02:11.800 --> 02:17.520
logic knows all about modus ponens, or it's sometimes called a rule of conditional exploitation

02:17.520 --> 02:23.520
or conditional elimination, and so it's a very familiar kind of logical structure.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.360
Now then, what's a transcendental argument?

02:26.360 --> 02:32.600
It makes a few small changes in the form of modus ponens, but it does it in a way that

02:32.600 --> 02:36.000
makes that argument immensely powerful.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
So at first it's going to seem like magic, but I'll argue it isn't magic.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.440
So first of all, what's the change?

02:43.440 --> 02:50.440
Well, we take that premise, a, and we simply weaken it, actually, to possibly a.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.060
It's possible to a, in other words.

02:53.060 --> 02:57.140
And so you might think, well, gee, okay, I don't see how that's going to help me.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.660
I now have a weaker premise.

02:59.660 --> 03:04.380
Well it's going to be a huge advantage if I can get the same or even stronger conclusion

03:04.380 --> 03:06.020
out of a weaker premise.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.540
That makes it a much more powerful argument.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.580
So let's take that, possibly a.

03:11.580 --> 03:16.780
Now I simply say, well, if possibly a, then b.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.940
But I want this not only to be true, but necessarily true.

03:20.940 --> 03:25.420
So I'm going to say, necessarily, if possibly a, then b.

03:25.420 --> 03:29.180
You might think, okay, okay, I see.

03:29.180 --> 03:32.420
It's just modus ponens with, instead of a, possibly a.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.740
So if possibly a, if possibly a, then b, therefore b.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.380
Huh, that's no big deal.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.620
Indeed, that would be no big deal.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.060
But look what I'm going to write.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.700
I'm not going to write down b.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.860
I'm going to write down necessarily b.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.780
So what have I done?

03:47.780 --> 03:54.620
First of all, I've replaced a over here in the premises with possibly a.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.260
So first big change is that I've weakened what I need for those premises.

03:58.260 --> 04:00.500
At least I've weakened this premise.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.340
I don't need that a is even true anymore.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.940
I just need that it's possible.

04:04.940 --> 04:10.460
Second major change is that I've changed the antecedent of this conditional correspondingly.

04:10.460 --> 04:14.500
Well, okay, that does make this a stronger conditional.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.380
Now it's not just saying that if a is true, b follows, it's saying if a is even possible

04:18.380 --> 04:19.380
to be followed.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.100
So that's making a stronger, much more powerful claim.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.380
So if I've weakened this, I've strengthened this.

04:24.380 --> 04:29.060
But I've also strengthened it in another way, I've said necessarily.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.180
I've said that connection is necessarily true.

04:32.180 --> 04:36.220
Now a lot of the connections we talk about in ordinary life are not like that.

04:36.220 --> 04:37.540
They're contingent connections.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.380
They don't have to be necessarily true.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.460
And so if that's the case, you could say, well, this isn't going to work because the

04:44.460 --> 04:47.100
connection I have in mind is not necessary.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.740
This is a form of argument that won't work in those contingent contexts, but it will work

04:51.740 --> 04:55.740
when we're dealing with logic, when we're dealing with metaphysics, when we're dealing

04:55.740 --> 04:59.500
with things where there really are necessary connections.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.940
It may even work in natural science when we're thinking about scientific laws because there

05:03.940 --> 05:08.540
we have in mind law like necessary connections between things.

05:08.540 --> 05:13.260
And so it's quite plausible in those cases to say, look, it doesn't just so happen.

05:13.260 --> 05:16.780
For example, that if I release this, it will fall.

05:16.780 --> 05:17.780
There's a necessity to that.

05:17.780 --> 05:20.500
If I release this, it has to fall.

05:20.500 --> 05:25.420
And so whenever we've got that kind of necessity to our connection, this is a form of argument

05:25.420 --> 05:27.580
that we could apply.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.300
Now the conclusion is really the big change, though.

05:30.300 --> 05:36.060
I don't just get, it is a fact that be, I get be is necessary, it is a necessary truth

05:36.100 --> 05:39.500
that be, and that's a much more powerful conclusion.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.820
Now why does this even follow?

05:41.820 --> 05:45.820
It's something that doesn't follow in every system of modal logic.

05:45.820 --> 05:50.980
There are systems for possibility and necessity that would say this form of argument does

05:50.980 --> 05:52.220
not work.

05:52.220 --> 05:57.140
But it works in the most popular and the oldest form of modal logic, the logic of possibility

05:57.140 --> 05:58.260
and necessity.

05:58.260 --> 06:03.780
It's called S5 after the work of C.I. Lewis, who developed five systems of modal logic

06:03.780 --> 06:05.860
and S5 was the most powerful one.

06:05.860 --> 06:12.020
This is the system that is taken for granted by figures including Ansem, Aquinas, Leibniz,

06:12.020 --> 06:14.340
Kant, and so on.

06:14.340 --> 06:19.500
And here's what it says, necessity is truth in all possible worlds.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.380
Possibility is truth in some possible worlds.

06:22.380 --> 06:27.500
So we could think of it this way, imagine a class of possible worlds.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.940
These are possible circumstances, possible situations, if you will, cases to which we

06:31.940 --> 06:39.460
might apply these various claims about metaphysics, about law-like connections in science, about

06:39.460 --> 06:41.420
logic, and so forth.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.940
And so we're thinking of these as our possibilities.

06:44.940 --> 06:51.300
Now I'm going to put us here, let's let this world, W0, be the actual world.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.660
We're actually here.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.820
In this world, what do we know?

06:54.820 --> 06:58.780
Well, possibly A is true in our world here.

06:58.780 --> 07:03.020
And so I'm going to write that as logicians would, not with the word possibly, but with

07:03.020 --> 07:05.340
a diamond to represent possibility.

07:05.340 --> 07:11.780
Okay, so A is not necessarily true here, but possibly A is.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.340
What can we infer from that?

07:13.340 --> 07:19.420
Well, necessarily, if possibly A then B. So since this is a necessary truth, this connection

07:19.420 --> 07:22.100
holds in every possible world, it holds here.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.900
So if possibly A is true here, B is true here.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.700
Okay, so far so good.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.180
That would give us this conclusion.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.980
That's really just an application of modus ponens.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.600
We didn't need the necessarily at all.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.740
But now, what else can we infer?

07:35.740 --> 07:37.940
How do we get this necessarily?

07:37.940 --> 07:40.060
Well possibly A is true here.

07:40.060 --> 07:45.060
And I said that possibly A means that A is true in some possible worlds.

07:45.060 --> 07:51.460
So let's take one of those worlds, we'll call it W1, and assume that A is true in that world.

07:51.460 --> 07:59.180
So we go to that world W1, this other situation where A is true.

07:59.180 --> 08:02.340
Right now I'm wearing a yellow striped shirt.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.460
I could be wearing a blue shirt.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.300
So here it's possible for me to wear a blue shirt.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.340
In this world I'm actually wearing the blue shirt.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.540
Well good, what's true here?

08:12.540 --> 08:17.340
Well if A is true there, of course possibly A is also true at that world.

08:17.340 --> 08:24.460
But in addition, since it's a necessary truth that if possibly A then B, B is true at that world.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.820
Okay, so far so good.

08:26.820 --> 08:32.220
But we want to know whether B is true in every single world, not just in some possible world.

08:32.220 --> 08:38.140
So far all we get out of that is something we could have gotten anyway, which is possibly B.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.700
So big deal.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.500
That gives me B's truth in some possible worlds, but not in all of them.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.780
To establish that, I need to show that B is true in just some arbitrarily selected world.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.140
Any world at all that we pick out of this set.

08:50.140 --> 08:52.820
So I'm going to pick some arbitrary world over here.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.700
Let's call it W2.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.260
And I need to convince you that B is true there.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.820
Why would that be true?

08:59.820 --> 09:01.580
Well look at it this way.

09:01.580 --> 09:04.180
A is true here, right?

09:04.180 --> 09:05.900
And it's one of these possibilities.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.340
That means from the point of view of this world, well A is possible.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.060
Here's a situation where it would hold.

09:12.060 --> 09:17.940
So we can say, look, A isn't necessarily true down in this world, but possibly A is.

09:17.940 --> 09:20.580
Because A is true up there.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.780
Now I've said, hey, wait a minute.

09:22.780 --> 09:26.340
It's a necessary truth that if possibly A then B.

09:26.340 --> 09:30.180
So B has to hold good in this world.

09:30.180 --> 09:32.540
Ooh, B true here, B true here.

09:32.540 --> 09:35.620
B true in this arbitrarily selected world.

09:35.620 --> 09:37.860
Now I didn't pull any tricks there.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.700
After all, you might say, well, that works for this world.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.900
Will it work for any other world?

09:41.900 --> 09:45.300
Yeah, let's take W3.

09:45.300 --> 09:49.580
Possibly A is going to be true here because of that world.

09:49.580 --> 09:53.260
And so big surprise, B has to be true with that world.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.700
Pick any world in here that you like, B has to be true.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.140
That means B is necessarily true.

10:01.140 --> 10:06.100
Something that logicians would write with a box to indicate necessarily.

10:06.100 --> 10:10.340
B is a necessary truth, but that's exactly the conclusion we wanted.

10:10.380 --> 10:12.780
Moreover, take a look at all these other worlds.

10:12.780 --> 10:17.140
Because no matter where we pick in here, B is going to have to be true.

10:17.140 --> 10:20.860
All of these worlds will be B worlds, which means that in every single one of

10:20.860 --> 10:26.140
these worlds, we don't just get B, we get necessarily B.

10:26.140 --> 10:31.780
Now in general, that form of argument is one that assumes that all of

10:31.780 --> 10:33.900
these worlds are in it together.

10:33.900 --> 10:39.260
And what I mean is to say that all of them define a sphere of possibility.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.940
That is the sphere of possibility for all of them.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.620
Now, for certain kinds of necessity, that seems pretty reasonable.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.220
Metaphysical necessity, logical necessity.

10:49.220 --> 10:52.780
It seems like, yes, we can talk about the logically possible worlds.

10:52.780 --> 10:55.180
Or the metaphysically possible worlds.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.380
That's not something, for example, that changes over time.

10:58.380 --> 11:01.660
But on the other hand, there are lots of senses of possibility,

11:01.660 --> 11:04.940
where things do change over time and we can't go back.

11:04.940 --> 11:08.660
So for example, what can I do with the rest of my life?

11:08.660 --> 11:12.700
Well, there are lots of things I can do, but I can't change the past.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.460
And so what I've done in the past, I can't change.

11:15.460 --> 11:18.900
I can change the future, but I can't change the past.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.220
And that tells you that as we go along through time,

11:22.220 --> 11:26.500
the sphere of our options, the sphere of our possibilities tends to shrink.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.020
Of course, I might develop a new skill and

11:29.020 --> 11:31.460
all of a sudden new things become possible for me.

11:31.460 --> 11:34.700
So the range of possibilities changes over time.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.500
That is to say the real possibilities for a human life.

11:37.500 --> 11:41.020
What Heidegger would call my horizon is something that can shrink,

11:41.020 --> 11:45.340
but maybe can also expand depending on how I think about abilities,

11:45.340 --> 11:46.660
capacities, and so on.

11:47.860 --> 11:53.660
However, here in the realm of all, you might say, logically possible situations,

11:53.660 --> 11:55.700
or all physically possible situations.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.940
Maybe if I'm abstracting from where I am now in time and

11:58.940 --> 12:02.780
just thinking about all possible physical configurations of the universe.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.700
Or I'm thinking about all metaphysical possibilities.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.140
And then this principle seems quite reasonable.

12:09.140 --> 12:12.060
There is just one set of all the possibilities, and

12:12.060 --> 12:14.860
they all are relevant to all the others.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.140
And when I've got that kind of situation, this form of argument works.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.660
So far I've been talking about the logic of this situation.

12:22.660 --> 12:25.060
The logic of transcendental arguments.

12:25.060 --> 12:29.100
But you might say, well, big deal, okay, I see the logical point.

12:29.100 --> 12:33.500
You weaken an important premise, you get a much stronger conclusion, and

12:33.500 --> 12:37.060
you do it by making those two changes in the other premise.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.100
Good for you.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.660
That's very interesting, but what can you do with this?

12:41.660 --> 12:45.380
Well, I've said it was Immanuel Kant who really first gave these their name of

12:45.380 --> 12:49.020
transcendental arguments and brought people's attention to them.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.900
And here's what he does with it.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.980
This is a passage from the critique of Pure Reason.

12:53.980 --> 12:59.780
All necessity, without exception, is grounded in a transcendental condition.

12:59.780 --> 13:04.380
There must therefore be a transcendental ground of the unity of consciousness in

13:04.380 --> 13:07.420
the synthesis of the manifold of all our intuitions.

13:07.420 --> 13:12.020
This must consequently also be a transcendental ground of the concept of objects in general.

13:12.020 --> 13:16.780
And so of all objects of experience, a ground without which it would be impossible to think

13:16.780 --> 13:18.900
any object for our intuitions.

13:18.900 --> 13:24.180
For this object is no more than that something, the concept of which expresses such a necessity

13:24.180 --> 13:25.700
of synthesis.

13:25.700 --> 13:30.500
At one other point, he says it even more directly and clearly, this original and transcendental

13:30.500 --> 13:35.100
condition is no other than transcendental aperception.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.940
But what is Kant doing here?

13:36.940 --> 13:43.340
He's saying, in order for me to have, not just if I have experience, then I have, for

13:43.340 --> 13:48.740
example, a unity of consciousness, a transcendental aperception, or something of that kind.

13:48.740 --> 13:49.980
So I do.

13:49.980 --> 13:55.380
He is saying, experience of the world is possible, experience of objects is possible, experience

13:55.380 --> 13:58.060
of myself is possible.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.660
What makes those possible?

13:59.660 --> 14:03.220
What are the necessary conditions for the possibility of something?

14:03.220 --> 14:09.720
A transcendental argument is an argument about the necessary conditions for the possibility

14:09.720 --> 14:11.220
of something.

14:11.220 --> 14:13.780
So let's take a look at this premise.

14:13.780 --> 14:20.820
If possibly a, then b, I'm asking about the necessary conditions of the possibility of

14:20.820 --> 14:25.300
something, the things that are necessary conditions for something, not just to be true, but even

14:25.300 --> 14:27.180
to be possible.

14:27.180 --> 14:29.900
That's what a transcendental argument is all about.

14:29.900 --> 14:33.500
And so Kant is saying, how could I have experience of the world?

14:33.500 --> 14:36.780
How could I have experience of objects in the world?

14:36.780 --> 14:41.980
You convinced him that actually my experience is highly varied.

14:41.980 --> 14:46.780
It's a manifold of intuition, as he puts it, that is to say, my senses give me just this

14:46.780 --> 14:49.580
huge flux of information.

14:49.580 --> 14:53.140
It's not just experience as if it's one thing, actually.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.540
It's a matter of thoughts and feelings and perceptions.

14:55.540 --> 15:02.180
And the perceptions are combinations of, well, visual elements, auditory elements.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.180
I can smell.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.180
I can taste.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.180
I can touch.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.480
I may have a sense of motion.

15:06.480 --> 15:13.180
There are all these things that go into my senses, and somehow they all get put together

15:13.180 --> 15:16.180
into a unified perception.

15:16.180 --> 15:21.300
And then I combine those perceptions into an object.

15:21.300 --> 15:28.360
And then I categorize that object as, for example, a hand or a marker or a whiteboard

15:28.360 --> 15:29.860
or a camera.

15:29.860 --> 15:37.660
And what I'm doing when I do that is a multi-stage process of combining sensations into sensations

15:37.660 --> 15:43.900
of an object, and then thinking in terms of the category of that object, that object

15:43.900 --> 15:46.260
I recognize as a something.

15:46.260 --> 15:51.100
It's this such, as Aristotle would have put it, a substance, this hand.

15:51.100 --> 15:55.660
And so what's happening here is I've got some perceptions, then across time I have

15:55.660 --> 16:00.660
other perceptions of the hand, and I end up saying that's a hand, and I group all those

16:00.660 --> 16:03.420
together as one object.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.860
How do I do that?

16:04.860 --> 16:07.740
There must be something that enables me to do it.

16:07.740 --> 16:11.580
There must be a unity in consciousness where I put all this stuff together and it gets

16:11.580 --> 16:13.380
unified somewhere.

16:13.380 --> 16:17.900
His objection to Hume is that Hume just has a bundle here, but there's nothing that can

16:17.900 --> 16:19.160
do the bundling.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.900
There is nothing that can put them all together.

16:20.900 --> 16:26.020
There's no place where all of those perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and so forth can be combined

16:26.020 --> 16:28.620
into one thing.

16:28.620 --> 16:34.220
For that combination to be possible, he says, it is a necessary truth that I have to have

16:34.220 --> 16:37.980
a unity of consciousness, the transcendental unity of our perception.

16:37.980 --> 16:44.540
Moreover, I must have innate concepts, things that he considers the categories, the logical

16:44.540 --> 16:49.940
functions of judgment give us the clue to the categories, their necessary conditions

16:50.060 --> 16:56.000
for the possibility of that last stage of my grouping these perceptions under the heading

16:56.000 --> 17:01.740
of some concept or other, and then sometimes connecting those concepts, connecting those

17:01.740 --> 17:05.860
things, seeing the links between objects, the relations between them.

17:05.860 --> 17:12.740
Well, that general form of argument is something that then has this structure in mind.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.460
Experience of objects is possible.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.260
I'm doing it right now.

17:16.260 --> 17:22.300
Necessarily, if it's possible, then there must be a unity in consciousness.

17:22.300 --> 17:27.100
So necessarily there is a unity in consciousness, the thing that he calls the transcendental

17:27.100 --> 17:29.220
unity of our perception.

17:29.220 --> 17:32.340
This form of argument had been found earlier in Descartes.

17:32.340 --> 17:39.460
In fact, it's how Descartes tries to break out of just having the I think I am as things

17:39.460 --> 17:41.820
of which he can be certain.

17:41.820 --> 17:47.700
Many readers have said, wait, he goes from I think I am, I can be sure of that, to suddenly

17:47.700 --> 17:51.020
I can trust my clear and distinct ideas.

17:51.020 --> 17:55.940
And they say, well, wait, that you can trust one or two clear and distinct ideas that I

17:55.940 --> 17:58.260
don't see why you get to trust all of them.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.300
That seems like a bad inference.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.060
And so they've accused him of committing a fallacy.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.180
But from this point of view, it's not fallacy.

18:05.180 --> 18:11.580
What he's saying is, I have complete faith that I am, I have complete faith that I think

18:11.580 --> 18:14.860
if I doubt either one of those, well, doubting is thinking.

18:14.860 --> 18:19.260
First of all, it's actually I'm doubting, so there must be a me to do the doubting.

18:19.260 --> 18:24.580
Consequently, he ends up saying, look, it is possible for me to be certain of something.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.700
But what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of certainty?

18:27.700 --> 18:32.540
Well, I have a clear and distinct perception that the I think could not be false.

18:32.540 --> 18:37.060
I have a clear and distinct perception that I am could not be false as long as I'm here

18:37.060 --> 18:39.260
to think it or say it.

18:39.260 --> 18:45.820
So now I look at I say, aha, so it is possible for me to be certain of some things.

18:45.820 --> 18:49.480
But necessarily if I'm certain of something, then I've got to be able to trust my clear

18:49.480 --> 18:50.980
and distinct perceptions.

18:50.980 --> 19:05.700
So necessarily I can trust my clear and distinct perceptions.

19:05.700 --> 19:09.780
We find a similar form of argument in a lot of other thinkers.

19:09.780 --> 19:14.260
In later thinkers, for example, in Heidegger, he begins to ask, well, Caught, you did a

19:14.260 --> 19:15.460
great job.

19:15.460 --> 19:19.980
You've said it is a necessary condition for the possibility of experience of objects that

19:19.980 --> 19:24.620
I have a unity of consciousness, your transcendental unity of that perception.

19:24.620 --> 19:28.860
But now what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of that?

19:28.860 --> 19:33.780
And in fact, what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of existence, of being,

19:33.780 --> 19:40.020
not just of the I think I am, but of anything being at all.

19:40.020 --> 19:44.100
And those are questions that lead Heidegger into very deep metaphysics.

19:44.100 --> 19:49.700
And by the end of his thinking, really, into saying, whatever the answer is, it's inexpressible.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.140
Language cannot take me there.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.380
Conceptual thinking cannot take me there.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.340
But we can back up in time.

19:55.340 --> 20:01.020
I think a similar form of argument takes place even in Plato, where Plato is thinking, look,

20:01.020 --> 20:06.900
it is possible for me to categorize things, for me to recognize something as a triangle,

20:06.900 --> 20:07.900
for example.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.820
But what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of the recognition of something

20:11.820 --> 20:13.300
as a triangle?

20:13.300 --> 20:20.140
Well, if it's possible for me to see that thing as a triangle, I must be able to apprehend

20:20.140 --> 20:22.180
the concept of triangularity.

20:22.180 --> 20:27.220
I must have the concept of triangularity, and I can have it only by apprehending triangularity.

20:27.220 --> 20:31.780
So necessarily, I apprehend the form of triangularity.

20:31.780 --> 20:35.500
We see this in Anselm in the ontological argument.

20:35.500 --> 20:40.100
And here I think there's a brilliant twist, because Anselm notices, actually, what if

20:40.100 --> 20:42.900
A and B are the same thing?

20:42.900 --> 20:45.300
So what would we get then?

20:45.300 --> 20:51.940
We would get, well, possibly, and here I'll just use G for God exists.

20:51.940 --> 20:56.340
And to simplify the writing, I'll just put the diamond and the box for possibly and

20:56.340 --> 20:57.620
necessarily.

20:57.620 --> 21:02.340
He says, look, it is possible that God exists.

21:02.340 --> 21:05.460
God is that the greater than which cannot be conceived?

21:05.460 --> 21:07.900
And I have the idea of that.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.500
It's certainly conceivable.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.780
I think that what is conceivable is possible.

21:12.780 --> 21:17.060
Now, potentially, big jump, big place you could object right there.

21:17.060 --> 21:21.460
Maybe we should read this as it's conceivable that G to be faithful to what he says, but

21:21.460 --> 21:24.140
for the moment, just go with me, okay?

21:24.140 --> 21:25.900
Possibly God exists.

21:25.900 --> 21:32.340
But wait a minute, if it's possible that God exists, then God exists.

21:32.340 --> 21:35.180
And I'm going to say that whole thing is necessary.

21:35.180 --> 21:38.620
Conclusion, necessarily God exists.

21:38.620 --> 21:39.620
Notice what I've done.

21:39.620 --> 21:44.540
I've just replaced A and B with G. God exists here.

21:44.540 --> 21:49.500
And I get, if it's even possible for God to exist, then God does exist.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.700
In other words, God's existence can't be contingent.

21:53.700 --> 21:58.140
It would be equivalent to say, if God exists, then God exists necessarily.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.180
Maybe we can turn this around and you would find it more plausible.

22:01.180 --> 22:04.540
If I simply say, well, yeah, that seems kind of like cheating.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.980
But let's do it this way.

22:05.980 --> 22:10.220
If God exists, then necessarily God exists.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.660
Conclusion, necessarily God exists.

22:13.660 --> 22:17.660
That more clearly says God's existence can't just be contingent.

22:17.660 --> 22:22.020
If God exists at all, God is necessarily existent.

22:22.020 --> 22:26.300
So I think Anson's ontological argument has the same logical structure.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.460
It too is a transcendental argument.

22:29.460 --> 22:36.260
It's saying God's existence is a necessary condition for the possibility of God's existence,

22:36.260 --> 22:38.860
for in effect God's conceivability.

22:38.860 --> 22:43.420
And then once we see that, we can recognize the argument that Descartes uses in the Third

22:43.420 --> 22:46.260
Meditation has the same basic structure.

22:46.260 --> 22:50.180
It looks like a causal argument and it goes into complexities about formal and objective

22:50.180 --> 22:55.060
reality, and so almost no other philosopher has said that argument is worth really trying

22:55.060 --> 22:58.260
to resuscitate or take seriously.

22:58.260 --> 23:01.180
But from this point of view, it's not so strange.

23:01.180 --> 23:04.740
What we're really saying there is, well, something closely related to Anson, but not

23:04.740 --> 23:09.980
quite the same, he's saying here, it's possible for me to have a concept of God.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.980
I do have the idea of God, he says.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.800
I have an idea of a perfect being.

23:14.800 --> 23:20.020
But necessarily, if it's even possible for me to have such a concept, then God must

23:20.060 --> 23:21.060
exist.

23:21.060 --> 23:24.580
And here's the causal part of the argument, where else could I have gotten the concept?

23:24.580 --> 23:29.620
So he argues, since I can't explain any acquisition of that concept from experience, it must be

23:29.620 --> 23:34.100
a priori, but how could it be a priori unless God put it there?

23:34.100 --> 23:36.060
In any case, I'll leave that part out.

23:36.060 --> 23:41.540
But I think that's part of how he supports this claim, that God's existence is a necessary

23:41.540 --> 23:46.140
condition for the possibility of me even thinking of God.

23:46.140 --> 23:50.580
So it's possible for me to think of God, but a necessary condition for the possibility

23:50.580 --> 23:55.380
of thinking about God is the existence of God, so necessarily God exists.

23:55.380 --> 23:59.940
That in a nutshell is the third meditation argument for God's existence.

23:59.940 --> 24:06.220
Well all of these arguments, from Plato, from Anselm, from Descartes, from Kant, from Heidegger,

24:06.220 --> 24:08.300
have this same basic structure.

24:08.300 --> 24:12.660
It's a very powerful sort of structure, and it's a structure that I think you need to

24:12.660 --> 24:18.220
take seriously and think hard about, because you're going to find this popping up in philosopher

24:18.220 --> 24:19.780
after philosopher.

24:19.780 --> 24:24.540
Not only philosophers of historical significance, but on the contemporary scene as well.

24:24.540 --> 24:29.900
So the critical question behind any transcendental argument is simply this, what are the necessary

24:29.900 --> 24:33.780
conditions for the possibility of something?

24:33.780 --> 24:39.980
And if that thing is even possible, then those necessary conditions aren't just conditions

24:39.980 --> 24:42.260
that hold, they hold necessarily.
