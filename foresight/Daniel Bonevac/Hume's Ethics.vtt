00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
I want to talk in this video about David Hume's ethical thinking.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.960
Hume here is not only developing a line of thinking about ethics that has been very influential

00:14.960 --> 00:19.680
and very important in its own right, but also really defines a problem.

00:19.680 --> 00:25.440
A problem that philosophers now call the problem of normativity that I take to be fundamental.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.320
It's a fundamental problem not only in philosophy, but in our culture.

00:29.320 --> 00:35.000
I teach an entire course called Ideas of the 20th Century, which takes this as its starting point.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.040
And I see the 20th Century as driven, maybe more than any other single issue, by the problem of normativity.

00:43.040 --> 00:49.120
Not only in philosophy, but in art, in literature, in music, and in politics.

00:49.120 --> 00:56.960
It's something that it seems to me our culture is still grappling with, and our civilization has not yet solved.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.320
So we need to understand what this problem is supposed to be.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.720
More important than Hume's ultimate ethical theory, I think, is actually his definition of the problem,

01:05.720 --> 01:10.560
and his phrasing it in terms that have made it something that, ever since the Enlightenment,

01:10.560 --> 01:14.000
has been an absolutely central intellectual problem.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.320
Not only a central problem in ethics, but a problem in every intellectual field.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.120
Well, what is that problem? What's the issue?

01:22.120 --> 01:30.960
Before I get to his version of it, I want to think more generally about a kind of problem we face in making decisions.

01:30.960 --> 01:40.200
I've sketched out here for another video a general problem of, well, practical action that we might face.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.960
And here I am. I survey my options for my decision.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.960
I think about the various goals I have and the motives those give me.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.640
And then I have to make a decision.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.520
Well, that decision is going to issue in an intention to act in a certain way.

01:55.520 --> 02:00.400
If all goes well, I will act in that way, then that action will have certain consequences.

02:00.400 --> 02:07.600
Of course, I'm framing this decision in a certain kind of setting, in a certain kind of context in the world,

02:07.600 --> 02:14.600
given my character and my own character traits, my virtues and vices, the things I know, the things I don't know.

02:14.600 --> 02:21.160
I do it in a framework that includes institutions, that includes an entire civilization that I'm part of.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.720
I end up ranking those options from better to worse, perhaps.

02:24.720 --> 02:30.200
But whatever I do, I'm doing that and making a judgment of evaluation.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.840
However, what am I doing when I describe these various options?

02:33.840 --> 02:35.600
I am describing them.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.160
And yet what I want to come out of this is a prescription.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.240
I should do this.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.600
I am coming up with something that is an evaluation.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.520
This is better.

02:45.520 --> 02:53.320
This is worse on the basis of a description of the various possible actions open to me.

02:53.320 --> 03:00.000
And so I'm somehow going from a pure description of the world to something that is an evaluation of the world.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.560
Philosophers have talked about the distinction between description and prescription,

03:05.560 --> 03:12.600
between description and evaluation, roughly speaking, between is and ought.

03:12.600 --> 03:17.000
And the question is really how you could possibly get from one to the other.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.480
How can you make room in a world that we think is fully described, for example, by science,

03:22.480 --> 03:26.920
but even if you don't think necessarily by science, by science, by history,

03:26.920 --> 03:33.880
by our common sense experience of the world, by whatever it is, right, we describe what the world is like.

03:33.880 --> 03:40.960
But then we try to draw conclusions for action about what we ought to do, about what the world ought to be like,

03:40.960 --> 03:46.040
about what consequence would be better than what other possible consequence.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.760
We're making evaluations.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.080
We're going to ought or right or wrong or better or worse.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.400
How on earth can we get there if all we have is description?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.480
That's the problem of normativity.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.320
Normativity because we're dealing with norms.

04:00.320 --> 04:05.080
Norms for action, norms for character, norms of all sorts of kinds,

04:05.080 --> 04:07.960
where we're saying this is right, this is wrong.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.880
This is correct, this is incorrect.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.120
You ought to do this, you shouldn't do that.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.680
This is permissible, this is not permissible.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.360
This is better than that.

04:16.360 --> 04:22.280
All of those are making evaluative judgments, stemming from or relating to some kind of norm,

04:22.280 --> 04:26.800
some kind of standard for evaluating things for making such judgments.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.800
But where do those norms, those standards of evaluation come from?

04:30.800 --> 04:36.040
If all we've got in descriptions of the world, on whatever basis, are pure descriptions.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.520
It looks like we're describing the world.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.800
Then we evaluate it.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.720
Where's that evaluation coming from?

04:41.720 --> 04:47.080
It doesn't look like it's coming from anything in our description of the world.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.240
Well, that in a nutshell is not just the problem of normativity.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.080
It is the problem that Hume is pointing out.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.680
It is the key to what we're going to look at.

04:58.680 --> 05:03.760
Hume tells us that morality is not a matter of reason.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.160
And here's his argument in a nutshell.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.240
Morals, he says, have an influence on actions and affections.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.960
Morals are the kind of thing that does evaluate things as better or worse,

05:14.960 --> 05:19.120
that tells me to do or not do something, that draws me towards something,

05:19.120 --> 05:21.320
or that pushes me away from something.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.960
Okay, so morality is supposed to have an influence on my actions.

05:24.960 --> 05:30.600
The whole reason I'm interested in evaluating when I'm deliberating is that I wanted to affect my action.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.440
I'm thinking, what should I do?

05:32.440 --> 05:35.600
And so I evaluate certain options as better or worse options.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.720
I choose one.

05:36.720 --> 05:42.640
The whole point of going through that exercise and doing the evaluation is to affect my action.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.720
It also affects my feelings, my affections, as he puts it.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.920
If I think this is better, I'm going to prefer that one.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.240
I'm not going to like this one as well.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.320
I'm going to think, yes, I approve of that action.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.640
I don't approve of this one.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.480
That's going to get me into trouble.

05:57.480 --> 06:02.680
And so it is something that is done as, well, its main point, you might say.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.320
It's not incidental to morality and to thinking about norms,

06:06.320 --> 06:08.800
that it has an influence on actions and affections.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.280
That's the whole point of it.

06:10.280 --> 06:16.240
They're norms for action or norms for feeling or norms for thinking or norms for speaking.

06:16.240 --> 06:22.400
But the whole point is to govern action and to have some effect on what we do.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.440
Well, he says reason alone can have no such influence.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.560
Reason can just take me from descriptions of the world to more descriptions of the world.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.440
It can't draw me toward anything.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.280
It can't push me away from anything.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.760
It can't give me a reason to act.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.720
It can't affect my feelings.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.480
It's just a description.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.800
And so he says morality is not a conclusion of reason.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.760
Reason cannot affect my actions, can't affect my affections.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.000
But morality does.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.760
Norms do.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.600
So morality cannot be a matter of reason.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.120
It consists of no matter of fact.

06:59.120 --> 07:03.960
If it were a matter of fact that this is wrong, for example, or that this is better than this,

07:03.960 --> 07:06.920
I could do some research and discover that fact.

07:06.920 --> 07:14.880
But in fact, when I take out my options, describe them, and then try to choose and decide what's better than what,

07:14.880 --> 07:17.160
I'm not merely describing anymore.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.000
I'm not finding some additional matter of fact.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.720
Instead, what I'm doing is making an evaluation that is not ultimately based on reason.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.800
Here is how Hume puts it, very famously and most dramatically.

07:32.800 --> 07:37.680
In every system of morality I've met with, I've noticed that the author proceeds for some time,

07:37.680 --> 07:43.800
reasoning in the ordinary way to establish the existence of a god or making points about human affairs,

07:43.800 --> 07:49.880
and then he suddenly surprises me by moving from propositions with the usual copula, is or is not,

07:49.880 --> 07:53.640
to ones that are connected by ought or ought not.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.120
This seems like a very small change, but it's highly important,

07:57.120 --> 08:01.560
for as this ought or ought not expresses some new relation or affirmation,

08:01.560 --> 08:03.960
it needs to be pointed out and explained,

08:03.960 --> 08:09.720
and a reason should be given for how this new relation can be inconceivably a deduction from others

08:09.720 --> 08:12.400
that are entirely different from it.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.360
From merely is, I can never get to ought, okay?

08:16.360 --> 08:20.280
So he says moral, well, reasoning, quote unquote,

08:20.280 --> 08:25.800
what people call moral reasoning seems to go from is and is not to ought and ought not.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.520
It goes from this is this and that's that, to this is better than this.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.360
Where is it getting that? How could we possibly go from is to ought?

08:34.360 --> 08:36.520
How could we go from is not to ought not?

08:36.520 --> 08:41.560
How could we go from this is this and that is that, to this is better than that?

08:41.560 --> 08:44.800
Reason doesn't do that, reason supplies no connection.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.000
So he's saying, look, we can describe the world and do that in rational terms.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.960
Good, good thing that we do that, important to understand matters of fact.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.720
We can relate ideas, that's important too.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.040
That's the other main way in which we obtain knowledge.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.320
We relate ideas, we gain knowledge of matters of fact through experience.

09:02.320 --> 09:07.000
But now, we come with conclusions like you ought to do this,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.080
or this is better than that, or that's virtuous, that's vicious.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.960
Where is that coming from?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.920
It's not in our description, there's no matter of fact.

09:15.920 --> 09:21.120
If somebody says, yeah, look, he killed that guy, that's wrong, murder is wrong.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.000
I can't go out and say, well, let me go back to the crime scene.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.440
I found the blood stains and I found the murder weapon, but I didn't find this wrongness.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.840
Let me go do another search of the crime scene.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.200
That's not going to help, right?

09:33.200 --> 09:36.320
It's not like there's some additional matter of fact I need to discover.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.120
It's not something else about the crime scene that's going to tell me that it's wrong.

09:40.120 --> 09:44.280
And so, neither is it some additional matter of reasoning.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.160
He's saying, look, it's not like you can take the existing facts and say, well, all right,

09:48.160 --> 09:53.120
let me analyze those more carefully and try to see what rational and deductive conclusions

09:53.120 --> 09:55.320
I can get out of those matters of fact.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.160
You're never going to get to the is or is not.

09:57.160 --> 10:02.080
You're never going to get to the murder is wrong or this murder is wrong from any of that.

10:02.080 --> 10:07.000
And so, it's not a question of an additional matter of fact or some new deduction from

10:07.000 --> 10:09.320
some set of matters of fact.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.520
That's not what's going on.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.320
Something of a very different kind is happening.

10:13.320 --> 10:18.160
When I invoke norms and move to an is or is not, ought, ought not.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.960
When I move from, sorry, an is or is not to an ought or ought not, this is better than that.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.360
This is virtuous, this is vicious, and so on.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.680
Here, in short, assumes problem.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.880
Once again, I appeal to the underpants gnomes.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.480
I've got a description.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.640
This is this way.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.120
The world is like this.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.680
It's all in terms of is.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.200
I've described things.

10:41.320 --> 10:45.440
And now, phase two, oh, hocus pocus.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.600
And now, phase three, something that involves norms.

10:48.600 --> 10:56.240
Now I get normativity, ought, ought not, good, bad, evil, better than that, worse than that.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.720
Where did any of that come from?

10:57.720 --> 11:01.360
How could I possibly go from those descriptions to an evaluation?

11:01.360 --> 11:05.400
How could I go from those prescriptions to a prescriptions?

11:05.400 --> 11:06.920
There is no way to do it.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.000
It looks like it's completely mysterious.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.160
I'm going from that to profits.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.600
How do I do that?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.200
Where's phase two?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.760
That, in effect, assumes problem.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.280
I don't see how it's possible for anyone to go from is to ought.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.600
So what on earth is going on here?

11:22.600 --> 11:26.920
Whatever it is, I'm pretty sure it's not a matter of reason.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.200
Well, Hume says, let's take a couple of cases.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.120
We think that cruelty is wrong.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.480
We think that generosity is good.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.400
But why?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.120
Why is cruelty wrong?

11:36.120 --> 11:38.040
Why is generosity good?

11:38.080 --> 11:41.200
There's no fact of the matter to be found in them, he says.

11:41.200 --> 11:47.160
It's not as if you take a case of cruelty and you say, OK, I see what happened here.

11:47.160 --> 11:51.240
In this, there are two, let's take two really similar cases.

11:51.240 --> 11:55.320
In both of these cases, there are two children playing in the park.

11:55.320 --> 12:01.880
And the first child pushes the second one into the pond.

12:01.880 --> 12:06.640
And you think, well, OK, huh, I describe this.

12:06.680 --> 12:10.440
Child A pushes child B into the pond.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.080
Looks like same description in both cases.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.440
But now in the first case, here's what was going on.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.000
It was a case of cruelty.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.040
That child was just saying, oh, man, look at this.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.600
Beautiful pond, isn't it?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.840
And the other one says, yeah, look at the duck swimming.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.880
That kid says, you know, I wish I could swim out there with the ducks,

12:28.880 --> 12:30.440
but I'm really afraid of water.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.000
I'm afraid of swimming.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.080
And so that's when the other child says, you're afraid of swimming, huh?

12:35.080 --> 12:35.800
Can't swim?

12:35.800 --> 12:36.880
Afraid of the water?

12:36.880 --> 12:38.200
Boom!

12:38.200 --> 12:39.440
That's an act of cruelty.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.080
That seems wrong.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.720
But now here's case two.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.360
Again, description in the same way.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.600
These two children are there by the pond.

12:46.600 --> 12:51.000
Child A pushes child B into the pond.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.600
But what was happening there?

12:53.600 --> 12:56.560
The one child said to the other, I feel so hot.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.920
I feel so hot and so thirsty.

12:58.920 --> 13:04.880
This would really, maybe we should get you some water.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.480
Think I could drink that water?

13:06.480 --> 13:10.680
No, I don't think you should drink that water, but, you know, let me look at you.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.320
You're, wait, your skin is cold and clammy.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.080
I don't think you're doing well.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.520
You've got to cool down.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
Well, what do I do?

13:18.520 --> 13:20.320
What do I do?

13:20.320 --> 13:21.280
Get in the water.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.040
It'll cool you down.

13:24.040 --> 13:24.640
I'm afraid.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.280
I don't know what's in there.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.360
There are ducks in there.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.320
I'm scared of ducks.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.920
Look, you should get in the water right now.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.400
And child C, I want to push in the water.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.520
Okay, in one case, this is an act of generosity.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.080
The child is saying, look, I think you've got heat stroke.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.000
I think you really need to cool your body down.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.440
I'm pushing you in the water, whether you want to go or not, because I think you need

13:48.440 --> 13:49.680
to be in that water.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.560
In the other case, the child is saying, you're afraid of the water.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.880
And so those are really different.

13:55.880 --> 14:01.240
But the description, if we ignore that history anyway, looks like it's just the same.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.000
Now, you might say, Hume's cheating here.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
I gave you the history to tell you why one of these is a case of generosity, and you

14:07.000 --> 14:11.080
say that's good, and the other is a case of cruelty, and you say that's wrong.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.200
But the action itself seems the same.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.480
And Hume says, there's no matter of fact to be found in the action.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.000
Now, what did we do there?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.600
I went into the background, and I gave you some additional facts about the background.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.800
It didn't affect the actual act, which was the pushing of one child into another,

14:28.800 --> 14:31.240
or of another into a pond.

14:31.240 --> 14:37.320
But what happened, you might say, is, well, something we morally evaluate on the basis

14:37.320 --> 14:41.040
of, in this case, finding out a few additional facts, true.

14:41.040 --> 14:46.840
But even given the additional facts, what leads us from those facts to that was,

14:46.840 --> 14:49.480
for example, generous?

14:49.480 --> 14:51.400
A pushed B into the pond.

14:51.400 --> 14:57.600
I tell you, A thought B was exhibiting signs of sunstroke, heatstroke.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.360
So push.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.400
You say that was generous.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.160
I mean, actually, no, that child was OK.

15:05.160 --> 15:09.360
And this was a false panic.

15:09.360 --> 15:14.360
But still, the child was being generous in doing this, was not being cruel.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.960
But it's like, wait, wait.

15:16.960 --> 15:21.600
I mean, yes, those additional facts get us to the conclusion that, in this case, it

15:21.600 --> 15:23.120
was generous and good.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.240
And in that case, it was not generous.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.240
It was cruel and bad.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.960
But exactly how is it doing that?

15:29.960 --> 15:33.240
Hume says, I don't see how reason is actually getting us there.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.560
You're just supplying more facts.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.360
You just supplied some conversation.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.880
Maybe you told me something about motives.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.120
OK, motives.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.280
It was done from this motive or that motive.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.680
But then you're making a judgment, but that was a good motive or a bad motive.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.040
And now I was nowhere near to get that.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.560
Why is that motive bad?

15:48.560 --> 15:53.360
You did it because you thought this child had heatstroke.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.520
You did this because you thought the child was afraid of water.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.720
Why is one of those bad, the other good?

15:59.720 --> 16:00.240
They are.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.960
Hume says, look, I'm not questioning that.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.800
I'm not saying they are bad or good.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.720
I'm just saying, what reasoning did you use to get there?

16:07.720 --> 16:11.200
He ends up saying, it wasn't reasoning at all.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.840
It's the object of feeling, not of reason.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.000
It lies in yourself, not in the object.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.320
An action or sentiment or character is virtuous or vicious.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.200
Why?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.920
Because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
of a particular kind.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.840
So let's go back to that case.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.680
We think, why was that act of cruelty wrong?

16:31.680 --> 16:33.920
Well, think about that case as I described.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.200
The one child pushes the other into the pond

16:36.200 --> 16:38.600
because they thought they were afraid of water

16:38.600 --> 16:42.280
and wanted them to be terrified.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.720
That seems wrong.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.040
And why do you draw that conclusion?

16:46.040 --> 16:49.960
It's before you invoke any reasoning and you think, well, fear is not good.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.560
And the child would have got it.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.840
You just think, oh, that's bad, right?

16:54.840 --> 16:57.880
And so often it's the case where something just seems bad.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.760
And before the reasoning even kicks in,

16:59.760 --> 17:02.040
you just come to the conclusion it's wrong.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.200
If I were to bring a cat in here and I were suddenly

17:05.200 --> 17:09.280
just slap it for no reason, you'd say, that's terrible, OK?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.640
And it's not that you have some view about animal rights

17:11.640 --> 17:15.800
and so on that you think about, well, I guess, you know, gosh,

17:15.800 --> 17:18.560
I don't know if cats have rights exactly, but they have.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.040
You don't have to do any of that.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.280
That's really wrong.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.960
The feeling is there first.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.920
Then you might invoke reasons after that,

17:24.920 --> 17:27.800
but it's the feeling that pushes you from is to ought.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.520
And the same thing is true when one child thinks

17:30.520 --> 17:32.840
the other child is in trouble and so pushes them into the pond.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.280
You think that's good.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.560
Why?

17:35.560 --> 17:38.680
Because you hear the story and you think, oh, that's nice.

17:38.680 --> 17:39.760
The child was trying to help.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.720
Even if it turned out they were wrong about this,

17:41.720 --> 17:43.200
they were trying to help.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.560
And so it's feeling that takes you from one to the other.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.360
Later you might think about reasons and trying to help

17:49.360 --> 17:51.440
and the fact that there's a moral principle of trying

17:51.440 --> 17:53.280
to help people, but where does that come from?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.720
Does that come from reason?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.200
That's Hume's problem.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.000
But we could say, OK, yes.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.680
It's not a question of an additional fact of the matter.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.000
What gets me there is primarily a feeling.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.200
I have a feeling.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.040
I approve of that or disapprove of that.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.640
It makes me feel good inside or bad inside.

18:09.640 --> 18:15.120
It causes a pleasure or an uneasiness of various kinds.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.360
So here's what takes us from is to ought.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.160
How do I get there?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.800
What is phase two?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.760
Well, it's sentiment or feeling.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.600
The phase one description, it's just a description of the world.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.080
Here's the matter of fact.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.360
Here's the way the world is.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.400
Phase two feelings, I respond in a certain way.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.920
That arouses a feeling of approbation or disapprobation,

18:34.920 --> 18:36.720
as you would say.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.880
In me, I feel approval or disapproval.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.600
It makes me feel good inside or bad inside.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.640
And so it is that sentiment within me

18:45.640 --> 18:49.280
that then leads me to say, that was good, that was generous,

18:49.280 --> 18:52.240
or that was cruel, that was wrong.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.640
You ought to do this, or you shouldn't have done that.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.240
And so in those cases, what's happening

18:57.240 --> 19:00.640
is it is feeling taking me to that conclusion.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.720
Now, there are modern psychological theories,

19:03.720 --> 19:07.440
very powerful, maybe our best modern psychological theories

19:07.440 --> 19:10.240
of moral reasoning, how people actually do it.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.240
And I find it very interesting that they agree with you.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.400
They say, it's not that we don't actually

19:15.400 --> 19:18.000
talk about reasons, that we don't engage in moral reasoning,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.120
we do, but actually it comes second.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.040
See how quickly somebody forms a moral conclusion,

19:25.040 --> 19:28.720
and then see when they come up with a reason for it.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.600
It's quick.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.200
It's quick, so you really have to do

19:31.200 --> 19:33.440
psychological experiments to find out.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.280
But the conclusion comes first.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.640
Then the person supplies the reasons.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.760
And in some cases, the feeling comes,

19:41.760 --> 19:44.600
and they draw the conclusion without any reasons at all.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.120
And psychologists have constructed elaborate test cases

19:48.120 --> 19:51.040
where they basically anticipate all the possible reasons

19:51.040 --> 19:53.880
and build the case so that they don't apply.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.760
And then they say, well still, is it right or wrong?

19:56.760 --> 19:59.280
And the person says, it's wrong.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.520
I know it's wrong.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.360
I can't tell you what's wrong with it, though.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.280
And they're immediate in that it's wrong reaction.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.720
So the psychologists say, it's actually

20:07.720 --> 20:10.080
our moral feelings, our intuitions, our sentiments

20:10.080 --> 20:12.520
that come first, reasons come later.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.840
And that's precisely Hume's position.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.720
He's saying it's really feeling that takes us to the art.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.560
Then maybe we back up and come up with some mumbo-jumbo

20:21.560 --> 20:22.920
about how we got there.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.840
But the fact is, it's feeling.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.800
It's like, that made me feel bad.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.960
That was wrong.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.760
And in the end, it really is sentiment and feeling

20:31.760 --> 20:34.120
and nothing else that takes us there.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.000
So let's go back to what he said.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.720
When I call something virtuous or vicious, right or wrong,

20:39.720 --> 20:45.480
good or bad, admirable or evil, it's

20:45.480 --> 20:48.960
because I am constituted in such a way that I have a feeling.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.600
I have a response to it emotionally.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.440
That's what's really underlying that.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.600
And when I talk about it as wrong,

20:55.600 --> 20:58.240
I really just mean in the end, it makes me feel bad.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.800
It gives me an unpleasant feeling.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.280
And that's really all that's going on.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.560
So here's his conclusion, a shocking conclusion actually

21:08.560 --> 21:11.240
for someone writing at the height of the Scottish

21:11.240 --> 21:13.520
Enlightenment in the age of reason.

21:13.520 --> 21:18.480
He says, reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.560
Well, it is shocking.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.960
Wait, this is the height of the age of reason?

21:21.960 --> 21:24.240
That it ought to be the slave of the passions?

21:24.240 --> 21:26.960
But Hume says, really, that is what reason does.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.120
It follows the passions.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.480
It doesn't lead them.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.600
Now, reason is useful in describing the world.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.880
That it can do, and it can do very well.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.000
However, as we've seen in other parts of Hume's theory,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.160
actually, a lot of that, what we think of as description

21:41.160 --> 21:44.920
is really projection out of that world, causation,

21:44.920 --> 21:47.000
necessity, a variety of other things,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.960
even the notion of an object as a continuing thing.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.840
That's something we are imposing on the world.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.760
It's not there in the world itself.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.440
Well, guess what?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.280
Moral qualities are the same.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.320
That's good, that's bad, that's wrong, that's right.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.640
Those aren't found in the world.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.880
They're things we're projecting onto the world.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.800
And in all of those cases, the origin

22:05.800 --> 22:08.000
is an internal impression, something

22:08.000 --> 22:10.920
like the feeling of expectation in the case of causation

22:10.920 --> 22:12.520
or necessity.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.880
But in this case, the feeling of approval or disapproval,

22:15.880 --> 22:18.640
the feeling of discomfort, or the feeling of pleasure

22:18.640 --> 22:21.560
we get in contemplating an action of a certain kind.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.960
So he says, there is in us something

22:23.960 --> 22:26.560
that we could fairly call a moral sense.

22:26.560 --> 22:30.360
That moral sense, that ability to have those right feelings.

22:30.360 --> 22:36.000
We feel, we respond, saying, ah, I sense that that's wrong.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.280
We no more have a reason for thinking that's wrong

22:39.280 --> 22:40.800
than we have a reason for thinking

22:40.800 --> 22:44.840
that's red, or green, or white, or black, or purple.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.640
We just see it.

22:45.640 --> 22:46.880
We have a sense.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.320
He says, similarly, we have a moral sense,

22:49.320 --> 22:53.240
a capacity for these feelings that constitute the basis

22:53.240 --> 22:55.280
for our moral judgments.

22:55.280 --> 22:59.080
That moral sense gives us the right kinds of sentiments.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.360
Well, if the right kind, there's no explanation.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.200
They're just part of human nature.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.400
Morality is built on those sentiments,

23:06.400 --> 23:10.000
and those sentiments taken together constitute a moral sense.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.800
So when is something right?

23:11.800 --> 23:13.520
When our moral sense approves it?

23:13.520 --> 23:14.400
When is something wrong?

23:14.400 --> 23:16.600
When our moral sense disapproves it?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.320
There's nothing else to say.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.920
There is really no reason.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.880
It's a matter of sensation, or something like sensation,

23:24.880 --> 23:26.760
not of reasoning about the world.
