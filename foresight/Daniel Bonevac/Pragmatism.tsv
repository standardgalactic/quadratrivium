0	8800	Today, we're going to talk about pragmatism.
8800	13600	Pragmatism is one philosophical view that is thoroughly American in its orientation.
13600	18240	In fact, most people think of American philosophy and immediately think of pragmatism.
18240	22800	And there was a period in the late 19th century and early 20th century when the pragmatists
22800	25400	really dominated American philosophy.
25400	27280	There were other groups to be sure.
27280	28280	There were some realists.
28280	30640	There were some personalists, some monists, and so on.
30640	37480	But the pragmatists had a strong lock on most very good American philosophy departments.
37480	41000	And that really became a symbol of American philosophy.
41000	45680	These days, pragmatism is in a little bit of a retreat in the sense that figures like
45680	50400	Perse, James, and Dewey, who were the key figures in that early movement, no longer
50400	52960	have quite the same level of respect.
52960	59120	But nevertheless, their attitudes and their perspective continues to be highly influential,
59120	63680	not just in the United States, but throughout the English-speaking world at least, and increasingly
63680	66840	has an impact on French and German philosophy, too.
66840	74200	So pragmatism remains a very appealing philosophy to many people, a very powerful philosophy
74200	79240	that whatever one ends up thinking about it needs to be addressed and dealt with.
79240	84400	In the United States, it was formulated, at first, by Charles Sandler's Perse.
84400	86660	Perse had an odd academic career.
86660	91200	He hung around Harvard for much of his academic life, though he never really was hired there
91200	92200	as a professor.
92200	94440	He had various subsidiary positions.
94440	99720	He was himself trained as a scientist at Johns Hopkins and ended up living most of his life
99720	105280	in a large house in rural Pennsylvania, not too far from the Delaware River, and in other
105280	107960	words, just across the river from New Jersey.
108640	113120	Well, he developed something known as the Pragmatic Theory of Truth.
113120	118400	He didn't like the fact that his principle of pragmatism became so popular that other
118400	122160	thinkers began to use it, and actually, in his view, misuse it.
122160	126680	He changed the name of his view to pragmatism because he thought it was ugly enough that
126680	128480	no one would try to copy it.
128480	133960	Luckily for us, that did not really stick, and so his view is still known as pragmatism.
133960	135640	Here is the key idea behind it.
135640	140240	The principle of pragmatism says there is no difference in meaning without a difference
140240	141720	in practice.
141720	145040	So what really matters is what difference it makes.
145040	149600	Indeed, we sometimes talk about things and think about a discussion that somebody's having
149600	152200	and say, well, what difference does it make?
152200	154320	And that's exactly Perse's question.
154320	157480	He says we should be asking that about everything.
157480	162380	Let's say two people are debating a question in theology about the nature of God.
162380	165220	One person says, I think God is absolutely simple.
165220	167780	All the properties of God end up being identical.
167780	169980	The other person says, I don't think that's true.
169980	174100	I don't think this idea of the simplicity of God makes any sense.
174100	176980	Perse says, what difference does it make?
176980	179900	What difference does it make to your actual practice?
179900	183620	In this case, the way you live your life or the way you live your religious life, does
183620	185260	it make a difference in how you worship?
185260	190140	Does it make a difference in what you do in any respect?
190140	192580	If not, there's no difference.
192580	193580	Ignore it.
193580	195140	It's a meaningless dispute.
195140	196820	Don't waste your time.
196820	201140	And some pragmatists put it in a very strong form, saying, look, then there is no difference
201140	202780	in meaning.
202780	204140	The issue is utterly meaningless.
204140	206100	You're not talking about anything at all.
206100	208260	Others say, well, maybe you are.
208260	209540	You're wasting your time, though.
209540	210900	There's no point in discussing it.
210900	212900	It makes no difference.
212900	216060	And so as he means it, it really is the stronger version.
216060	217300	There is no difference in meaning.
217460	219220	Of course, it doesn't just happen in theology.
219220	222300	It can happen all over the place in philosophy and politics.
222300	224820	You can say, well, in the end, what does it matter?
224820	226460	What do we do differently if this is true?
226460	229820	And if the answer is nothing, stop fighting about it.
229820	231780	This dispute doesn't really mean anything.
231780	234020	It's not really about anything.
234020	237980	So his idea is that meaning depends entirely on practice.
237980	241980	And pragmatists are fond of using the phrase, the cash value of something.
241980	246660	What he means by talking about the cash value of a view or the cash value of a proposition
246660	249860	is simply this, the difference it would make in practice.
249860	253220	To get clear about the meanings of our terms and our thoughts,
253220	257620	we need to be clear about the practical antecedents and their practical effects.
257620	261460	What would, practically speaking, make somebody say that?
261460	263940	And what difference would it make if they were true?
263940	266260	What would the effect of that view be?
266260	268900	All too often, he says, we look around and we find out nothing.
268900	270500	People are fighting about nothing.
270500	272020	They're arguing about an issue.
272020	275820	And in the end, you say, I don't understand why it makes a difference.
275820	282940	Now, we've got to be careful here because sometimes it makes a difference of a kind,
282940	284740	but no difference to what we might do now.
284740	288380	Suppose two people are historians and they're fighting about the details
288380	290660	of what happened during the 14th century.
290660	293900	Well, are they really involved in a meaningless discussion?
293900	296060	Presumably not, even though you and I would say,
296060	297540	well, I'm not going to live any differently,
297540	302260	depending on what exactly you decide happened in the 1340s.
302380	305660	But there is a difference about what they're going to teach,
305660	307580	for example, what they're going to write.
307580	309940	And so we don't want to say about all of history.
309940	311420	Forget it, it doesn't make any difference.
311420	314860	Or at least, if it's not immediately relevant to our present situation,
314860	317460	doesn't make any difference, so history is meaningless.
317460	319260	We certainly don't want to say that.
319260	323180	So we've got to be cautious here and understand difference in practice
323180	324740	in a very broad sense.
324740	331620	But there are still issues that you might say I don't see how even the historian
331620	336300	or even the astronomer or whatever is going to really do anything differently
336300	337860	as a result of all of this.
337860	340180	And he thinks that happens fairly frequently.
340180	344220	Much more frequent, however, is the idea that we're fighting about something,
344220	347780	arguing about something, and we aren't identifying the real issue.
347780	351180	We think the issue is this, but really when you analyze it and say,
351180	355980	what difference would it make in practice, you realize, oh, it's really this.
355980	359300	And that kind of thing does happen all the time in everyday life,
359300	363500	as well as in academic contexts or political contexts or religious contexts.
363500	367100	We're fighting about a certain issue, and really when you come right down to it
367100	371380	and analyze the practical difference it would make, that's not really the issue.
371380	373260	The issue is this other thing.
373260	375660	And so that, he thinks, is very common.
375660	379460	The pragmatist principle can help you identify what the real issue is
379460	382060	that you ought to be talking about.
382060	385100	Well, Peirce starts out as a follower of Hegel.
385100	388220	And indeed, throughout the 19th century, all over the United States,
388260	391620	in large cities in small towns, Hegel society sprang up,
391620	396540	and people began reading the works of Hegel and discussing them in these small social groups.
396540	399700	These book clubs basically devoted to the works of Hegel.
399700	402340	Now, from our point of view today, that seems like a bizarre thing.
402340	406380	For one thing, we have book clubs, but they don't tend to address philosophical works,
406380	411660	especially long, serious philosophical works like the phenomenology of spirit.
411660	415140	But also, Hegel is a notoriously difficult philosopher.
415140	418100	So why were people so devoted to this?
418100	420740	And how did that turn into pragmatism?
420740	424220	Well, Hegel had, in a way, a dramatically new idea.
424220	430460	This new idea was that absolute truth isn't there before us to be discovered in the world right now.
430460	434340	It is the end of a long dynamic process.
434340	437380	And so there are these higher level dynamic laws,
437380	441740	like the thesis antithesis synthesis law, but also like other laws,
441740	446100	that are going to operate on the development of thought.
446100	451100	And that we are on a ride toward the achievement of absolute knowledge.
451100	457180	We're geist, we're the spirit, we're mind, ultimately and fully realizes itself.
457180	459340	It's an inspiring picture.
459340	463660	It fits in with the 19th century's conception of itself as an age of progress.
463660	467460	Hegel is essentially saying, yes, the entire history of the human race,
467460	470780	the human species is a story of progress,
470780	475780	thought getting closer and closer to absolute knowledge and the absolute truth.
475780	480140	And so there's a way in which it had a strong appeal for the American spirit.
480140	485100	It also was something that seemed to promise a new way of thinking about
485100	488620	philosophical problems and practical problems together.
488620	490700	Because they were all bound up together.
490700	496860	The way we think about everything is something that is part of the development of this spirit.
496860	500700	And then how we act, that's all a result of the way we're thinking about things.
500700	504540	And so it's all driven by these dynamic processes.
504540	509820	The idea of progress, of dynamics, of moving forward in this way,
509820	513260	was tremendously exciting to people.
513260	519140	Perse is deeply influenced by all of this, but he makes two major changes to Hegel's scheme.
519140	523540	First of all, he replaces these perhaps mysterious dynamic principles,
523540	526740	like that one involving thesis, antithesis, synthesis,
526740	530340	with an empirically grounded account of scientific inquiry.
530340	533140	So he says, wait a minute, how does thought progress?
533140	536540	Well, insofar as it's rational, I'll tell you how it progresses.
536540	540940	It's not through mystical laws that have to be discovered through this very complicated process.
540940	542540	It's scientific method.
542540	546180	Scientific method is the way we have of actually advancing knowledge.
546180	548660	So we don't have to do our own independent philosophizing.
548660	550540	We can look at what scientists do.
550540	552980	Remember, he was trained as a scientist.
552980	556180	Secondly, he says, we use the idea of the limit of inquiry.
556180	560380	Not just as a hope and something we believe we're progressing toward,
560380	563780	is a definition of truth itself.
563780	567860	Those are important changes, and they make pragmatism quite distinctive.
567860	573020	It remains a version of idealism, but a really distinctive version of idealism.
573020	575420	So here's how we think about it.
575420	578940	Thought, as we ordinarily conceive it, aims at truth.
578940	580380	Now, not all thinking does.
580380	582980	Sometimes we're just musing, contemplating.
582980	586180	Sometimes we're telling stories, imagining things.
586180	591780	But when we're serious, in a scientific spirit or in the spirit of inquiry in general,
591780	593820	we want to find out what's true.
593820	600180	So truth is the goal of thinking, at least thinking of that kind.
600180	602180	Well, the same thing is true of practice.
602180	605500	We want to base what we do on a real conception of the world.
605500	607060	We want to get things right.
607060	610740	If I am walking over to the edge of a cliff, I want to be sure I know where it is.
610740	612140	I don't want to fall off.
612140	619260	So I want that action to be based on thinking that is actually accurate about the world.
619260	622860	Well, what kind of thought and practice aims at the truth?
622860	626900	Not all thought and practice does, but some does.
626900	630340	And the paradigm of doing that is science.
630340	634260	Scientific inquiry aims at truth.
634260	639380	In particular, scientific inquiry aims at what we might call stable belief.
639380	644260	That is to say, belief we're not going to have to give up in the face of further information.
644260	649140	Our reasoning is typically what computer scientists today call non-monotomic.
649140	652700	That is to say, it doesn't always progress in the same direction.
652700	658380	It is not always a question of progressing, getting more and more theorems derived from our axioms.
658380	662620	If you think about Euclid's geometry or something like that as the model of knowledge,
662620	666780	which is something that philosophers did for centuries, Aristotle has something like that conception.
666780	669460	So does Descartes, so does Spinoza.
669460	674660	And if you think of knowledges like that, well, it really is like you identify the correct starting points
674660	680500	and then you just keep building truths on those and the realm of truth just gets bigger and bigger.
680500	682900	But Peirce says, well, that's not the way science goes.
682900	684740	In science, we frame hypotheses.
684740	685620	Then we experiment.
685620	687500	We test those hypotheses.
687500	689300	And sometimes they're confirmed.
689300	691260	Sometimes they're rejected.
691260	695860	Sometimes we have to make adjustments and try again with a new and better hypothesis.
695860	701660	And so we often give up beliefs in science in the face of further information.
701660	706660	In fact, these days it's popular for some people to say, well, the science is settled about x, y, or z.
706660	708820	Peirce would say, the science is never settled.
708820	715340	Science, no matter how well supported something is, is always open to the possibility that we're wrong about it.
715340	716700	It's our best hypothesis.
716700	718980	At the moment, our evidence seems to support it.
718980	723220	But even in such a case, he says, there is a real possibility
723220	726180	that it will have to be given up in the face of further information.
726180	732460	Our goal, of course, is to come to belief that as it happens, though they in principle could be overcome by further evidence,
732460	734060	they never really will be.
734060	739580	All the subsequent evidence will either support them or at least not contradict them.
739580	744740	So what we're doing in science is proposing hypotheses, testing them, developing them,
744740	751260	and trying to get them into a form where we no longer have to keep revising them or getting rid of them and replacing them.
751300	757540	Where we can instead say, well, this was our hypothesis, so far it's worked and it seems to keep working.
757540	760140	And our hope is it'll keep working on into the future.
760140	763940	So call a belief stable when it really will, when it will continue.
763940	768620	In principle, yes, it could be overturned, but in practice, in fact, it won't be.
768620	771500	That makes it a stable belief.
771500	773500	Well, that's the goal of science.
773500	776660	So what is special about science and about scientific method?
776660	778780	It's self-correcting.
778780	780660	We make these observations.
780660	782460	We formulate hypotheses.
782460	785260	We test their consequences by experiment.
785260	788460	Then we revise the hypotheses in light of new evidence.
788460	792020	We're looking for stable ones that we won't have to revise anymore.
792020	799140	But hey, along the way, how do we have any confidence in the hypotheses we're making and in what survived tests so far?
799140	800580	Because we've been doing this.
800580	802100	We've been making hypotheses.
802100	803740	We've been making observations.
803740	805940	We test consequences by experiment.
805940	808060	We revise our hypotheses.
808060	809380	We keep going.
809380	811820	And so science is self-correcting.
811820	814060	Now, sometimes the correction happens quickly.
814060	817940	Sometimes it can take centuries before people realize, yes, this idea is wrong-headed.
817940	820780	We have to formulate a new hypothesis.
820780	831300	But that's partly because as science improves, it gets harder and harder to actually find cases that are really going to divide some scientific theories from others.
831300	853700	And so often people are in a position where they say, look, we can't solve this without tremendous technological improvements, like building a supercollider, or sending an explorer beyond the solar system, or doing a variety of other things that are going to give us new kinds of evidence that will enable us to test theories in new ways.
853700	857940	So what gives us confidence in the scientific method is that it's self-correcting.
857980	863580	And Purr says, look, that's really a very special and very important quality to scientific method.
863580	867260	It's not something you find in other inquiries.
867260	869180	Is art self-correcting?
869180	877940	You might hope so, in that art that's really bad doesn't sell, and so people can't make a living at it, and they go out, you know, they have to do something else, and so on.
877940	884140	But really, there's nothing like this process in the art world, or in the world of literature, or the world of music, or other things.
884140	886900	There's something maybe kind of approximating it.
886900	896780	But science is unique in that it does make these observations, formulate the hypotheses, and then keep revising them whenever problems are encountered.
896780	899380	So here we see some examples of experiments.
899380	905980	Here a very disturbing one of seeing what happens to a bird when we pump all the air out of a chamber containing it.
905980	911660	As you can tell by the worried faces of the children, it's not going to be good.
911660	914740	Or here a dramatic experiment.
914740	921820	The man who is being shot at right there invented the bulletproof vest, and here is how he tested it.
921820	941220	He was so confident that it would work that his way of publicizing it was to get photographers there, get, yes, the police there, but also get various people who were journalists there to watch him being shot in the chest while he wore the bulletproof vest to prove that it worked and that he would survive.
941220	942220	He did.
945220	951700	People have admired Albert Einstein, partly because of his attitude about science.
951700	962900	Lots of scientists get pretty attached to their theories, and sometimes it takes somebody else to actually test a hypothesis and find the experimental evidence that needs to be revised or rejected.
962900	966100	But Einstein was open to that from the very beginning.
966100	971980	Our goal, Perce would say, is to formulate laws and theories that survive experimental tests.
972020	974660	And that's the way Einstein thought of his own theories.
974660	979300	He said, look, there's this puzzle about the nature of time, about the speed of light.
979300	989700	I don't know how to make sense of the Michelson-Morley experiment and a variety of other phenomena that, by the turn of the century, physicists were aware of but had no explanation of.
989700	996660	So he formulated, first, the special theory of relativity, and then the general theory of relativity to try to solve those problems.
996660	1000220	But his reaction to that wasn't to say, so here's the truth.
1000220	1003420	It was instead to say, these are hypotheses.
1003420	1010500	And where exactly is my theory going to differ from Newtonian theory or maybe other competing theories?
1010500	1014860	Well, he proposed some experimental tests and he said, here is what's going to test.
1014860	1021660	If I don't turn out to have the right predictions about these cases, get rid of my theory and replace it with something better.
1021660	1025260	So in 1905, he published the special theory of relativity.
1025260	1031180	According to that theory, length, velocity, simultaneity, and so on are relative to an inertial frame.
1031180	1035500	They're not absolute or primary qualities, as philosophers had tended to think.
1035500	1038140	They're relative to the perceiver.
1038140	1042500	And then in 1915, he proposed the general theory of relativity.
1042500	1045660	According to that, space-time curves around masses.
1045660	1047340	There is no action at a distance.
1047340	1049820	There is no force like the force of gravitation.
1049820	1060540	As in Newtonian theory, instead, space-time itself gets curved around massive objects and that gives the effect of a gravitational force.
1060540	1063580	So in Newton's theory, gravity works something like this.
1063580	1070380	We've got the law of gravitation that says the gravitational force is proportional to the gravitational constant
1070380	1077100	times the product of the masses of the object divided by the square of the distance between them.
1077100	1080380	In Einstein's theory, we get a picture like this.
1080380	1084860	The actual equations are incredibly complicated, involve the tensor calculus,
1084860	1088700	but the effect of it is that space-time has a curvature.
1088700	1096620	And that's why the moon revolves around the earth, because space-time is curved around a massive object like the earth.
1096620	1103020	Well, here are the classical texts that Einstein proposed, the perihelion precession of mercenary,
1103020	1107500	the deflection of light by the sun, and gravitational redshift of light.
1107500	1110220	He says, let's find out if we can observe these.
1110220	1111660	My theory predicts them.
1111660	1113020	Newton's doesn't.
1113020	1114460	Here's a good test case.
1114460	1117740	Let's measure carefully and see if we predict this.
1117740	1118940	And of course, there's a possibility.
1118940	1120700	Maybe Newton will turn out to be right.
1120700	1122780	Maybe Einstein's prediction will be right.
1122780	1126140	Maybe neither will be right, and we'll have to say we need yet another theory.
1126860	1128140	Well, people did that.
1128140	1134540	And in 1919, they came back with the report that Einstein's theory was correct.
1135180	1138140	So you can see here some things in the popular press.
1138140	1140540	It really took the public imagination.
1140540	1142060	Is there a fourth dimension?
1142060	1145900	Einstein's theory has given a tremendous jolt to the world of science.
1146620	1150940	Here is the key paper by Arthur Eddington of Two Tables fame,
1151740	1154700	who went to the Indian Ocean to do the measurements
1154700	1157660	and came back reporting on the results of the expedition,
1157660	1161580	which were to confirm Einstein's theory about the deflection of light
1161580	1163340	in the sun's gravitational field.
1163980	1168140	By observing the total eclipse of May 29, 1919,
1168140	1171340	that again revolutionized the scientific world.
1171340	1174300	And Paul Johnson, the historian in his book Modern Time,
1174300	1177820	says this is really the beginning of the 20th century.
1178780	1180300	Here, another newspaper headline,
1180300	1183900	how Dr. Einstein has modified our ideas of nature.
1183900	1186300	To the general public, it is startling to learn
1186300	1188700	that life doesn't travel in a straight line.
1189900	1193740	And then, Einstein theory causes scientific war.
1193740	1195420	The little highlighted passage there,
1195420	1198140	which you probably can't read on your screen, says this.
1198140	1200540	This should have ended a pleasant evening.
1200540	1203980	But after the meeting, a number of students chased Professor Einstein home
1203980	1205340	and threatened to cut his throat.
1205980	1208220	Well, yes.
1208220	1212700	It was something that stirred a great deal of passion, positive and negative.
1212700	1216620	It was something that did revolutionize people's conceptions of the universe
1216620	1218140	and their place in the universe.
1218140	1222940	And so the theory of relativity was something that was profoundly shocking to people,
1222940	1225180	making major newspaper headlines,
1225180	1229420	causing students to riot and chase him threatening to cut his throat
1229420	1232860	in a way that is a little hard for us to imagine these days.
1233820	1237500	One doesn't think anybody's going to read something in physics letters A,
1237500	1240940	for example, and suddenly start charging through the streets writing
1240940	1244780	or writing massive newspaper articles about it for the popular press.
1245820	1247580	In any case, the pragmatist says,
1247580	1251820	Einstein's attitude is exactly the scientific ideal.
1251820	1255580	We formulate these hypotheses and then we subject them to test.
1255580	1257340	We hope they'll survive the test,
1257340	1259660	but we face the fact they very well may not.
1260620	1264940	Well, this leads to a revision in our conception of the relationship
1264940	1268620	between science and truth, or at least so argues the pragmatist.
1268620	1272300	The correspondence theorist defines scientific activity
1272300	1274380	as the activity that aims at the truth.
1274380	1277180	And so far, I've been talking about it in that kind of common sense.
1277180	1280300	He way away popular among realists in philosophy
1280300	1283100	that says truth is correspondence with the facts.
1283660	1285340	Perce turns that around.
1285340	1291660	He says, let's instead define truth as that at which scientific activity aims.
1291660	1296540	So instead of saying what makes something science, it's it's aiming at truth.
1296540	1298220	Instead, we say, what is truth?
1299100	1303340	It's not correspondence with reality as if we could somehow step outside of science,
1303340	1305420	step outside of our own minds, our own language,
1305420	1309100	our own conceptual scheme, and grasp reality and judge a correspondence
1309100	1311260	between our statement and the fact.
1311420	1316860	He says, no, truth is defined as what science aims at, namely stable belief.
1316860	1321180	So truth becomes a belief that is not going to be overturned
1321180	1325180	in the face of further information, further experimentation, further testing.
1327020	1330860	So Perce puts it this way, the opinion that is fated to be ultimately agreed to
1330860	1334460	by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth.
1334460	1337820	And the object represented in this opinion is the real.
1338460	1343500	Reality is just being something that is part of and claimed,
1343500	1347100	has its existence claimed by our ultimate theory that people agree on.
1347100	1350300	And the opinion that's fated to be agreed to by everyone,
1350300	1353100	because it is stable belief it will never be overturned,
1353100	1355020	that is simply the truth.
1355020	1356540	That is what truth is.
1358300	1361260	So truth, according to Perce, is a kind of coherence.
1361260	1365420	He calls it a concordance with not just what we know now,
1365580	1368700	but with the ideal limit of scientific inquiry.
1368700	1372780	Not what even scientists will know tomorrow or the day after,
1372780	1374060	but the ultimate limit.
1374060	1376380	If we were able to carry out all experiments,
1376380	1380860	subject all of the hypotheses to that test, we'd end up believing this.
1380860	1382220	He says, that's the truth.
1382220	1384380	That's what it is for something to be true.
1384380	1387900	The truth is simply what we're all eventually bound to agree on.
1390300	1392620	Well, as I've stressed throughout,
1392700	1395820	Perce thinks that anything in principle could be overturned.
1395820	1397100	He's a fallibilist.
1397100	1400300	He thinks any of our beliefs might turn out to be mistaken.
1400300	1404780	Any of our hypotheses might turn out to get contrary evidence when we inquire.
1404780	1410300	So further inquiry is always something that could lead us to give up any of our beliefs.
1410300	1414380	Beliefs can be justified and kind of rise from a reliable process,
1414380	1416060	but still be fallible.
1416060	1419500	That means new evidence, new arguments, counter examples,
1420460	1422860	and so on might end up undercutting those beliefs.
1423420	1427500	So he says, we can have knowledge in the sense that we can form beliefs
1427500	1429580	that have good evidence behind them,
1429580	1430940	for which we have justification,
1430940	1433500	that have arisen from a reliable process,
1433500	1436460	that so far have not been overturned by any further evidence.
1437020	1439420	But we can never have certainty.
1439420	1441260	We can never have certainty about anything,
1441260	1444460	because it is always possible that further inquiry
1444460	1447660	will develop something that surprises us.
1447740	1451340	And so we will face new evidence that forces us to give up that belief.
1452860	1456860	Well, that allows Purse to undermine some of Leibniz's arguments for rationalism.
1457580	1462460	Remember, Leibniz argued that contingent experience doesn't entail any necessary truths,
1462460	1465660	and particular experience doesn't entail any universal truths.
1466220	1468220	Purse is going to say, well, that's okay.
1468220	1469900	Nothing has to be entailed.
1469900	1473980	It doesn't have to be forced to be true on the basis of our experience.
1473980	1476460	It just has to be supported by our experience.
1476460	1478940	It has to be something that can explain our experience,
1478940	1480460	and it hasn't yet been overturned.
1481020	1485420	So he says, look, evidence never conclusively establishes a conclusion.
1485420	1487180	Leibniz wants too much.
1487180	1490380	He wants something that can serve as a universal and necessary
1490380	1492780	synthetic a priori principle to get us
1492780	1494780	from the contingent particular experiences
1494780	1497980	to these universal necessary law-like conclusions.
1497980	1499740	He says, that's not how it works.
1499740	1503500	We propose those necessary universal law-like things
1503500	1505660	as a way of explaining our experience,
1505660	1507260	but there's always a gap.
1507260	1508940	There's always fallibility.
1508940	1510380	These are never guaranteed.
1510380	1512860	We're in a position where we always might have to give them up.
1513420	1515260	The best we get up for is stability,
1515260	1517420	that we won't, in fact, have to give them up,
1517420	1520220	that further evidence is going to end up confirming them,
1520220	1522300	supporting them, rather than undermining them.
1524140	1526780	Well, here's how we should think of science then,
1526780	1528860	and in general, human inquiry.
1528860	1531420	It's a process of rational belief revision.
1531420	1533340	We encounter new information.
1533340	1534780	We update our beliefs.
1534780	1535740	We keep some of them.
1535740	1536700	We reject others.
1536700	1537500	We add new ones.
1537500	1538860	We revise some.
1538860	1541420	Truth is what works in the context
1541420	1543660	of that rational belief revision.
1543660	1545580	Sometimes people summarize pragmatism
1545580	1547260	by saying the truth is just what works.
1547820	1550220	Well, yes, but in this very special sense,
1550220	1552700	what continues to work in the context
1552700	1555740	of our attempt to revise our beliefs rationally.
1555740	1558620	It's not like, hey, I wasn't sure what to do
1558620	1560700	about that fence that's falling down in the backyard,
1560700	1561900	but I did this and it seemed to work.
1561900	1563660	So I guess everything I thought about it was true.
1564220	1565660	No, it's not like that.
1565660	1567980	It's like, look, we're doing the process of science.
1567980	1571580	We're engaged in this self-correcting form of inquiry.
1571580	1576460	And what works in the context of that, that we can call the truth.
1577020	1581580	So truth is what our process of rational belief revision
1582140	1583260	stabilizes on.
1583900	1587500	Truth is something that we end up agreeing to, he says,
1587500	1589740	when we engage in this self-correcting process
1589740	1591420	of rational belief revision.
1591420	1593500	We end up with some stable beliefs.
1594060	1599980	And that's what counts as the truth.
