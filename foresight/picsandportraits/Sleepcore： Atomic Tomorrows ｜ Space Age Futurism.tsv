0	6220	It's a different world in Grandpa New as a boy.
6720	10380	The change has reached a way beyond the home, farm, and school.
11260	15620	Business and commerce, too, have been streamlined by electric power.
16660	22080	June, who is perhaps Grandpa's favorite, has electricity to speed her work at the bank.
24740	29100	When she goes home from work, she rides on a silent, gliding trolley bus.
29900	31500	Almost to her own door.
33740	37220	The house is much the same shape as the house as the Minutemen lived in,
37820	40540	but the door leads to a different way of life.
41580	48420	Here, light, heat, and energy to help with the housework come in by wire.
50060	53420	Electric powers performing other unseen jobs.
54380	59260	The water faucets are connected with a modern electrically operated water treatment plant,
59820	64100	the garbage disposal to an electrically operated sewage plant.
68260	73740	The amazing part of it all is the fact that the electric power they use in their home
74300	78700	costs less than it did when Bill and Ella were married back in 1920.
79660	84860	All in a man's lifetime, electric power has changed the world.
85900	91340	But what about the world that Fred Wilson's granddaughter will see, the world of tomorrow?
92300	99980	Tomorrow will bring innovations like the heat pump, which electrically heats your house in winter and cools it in summer.
101100	106780	Even in winter, there is always heat in the air, the soil, and the water below ground level.
107740	112700	During the cold months, the heat pump withdraws warmth from outside to heat your home.
113580	122780	In summer, it operates much like your electric refrigerator, withdrawing and expelling heat from the inside air to provide cooling comfort.
123980	125420	And what of atomic energy?
126060	131020	Chances are, there will never be a handy home-size atomic pile in your basement.
131900	136860	But experiments are already underway that point to atomic power plants like this.
138140	144620	The intense heat generated in an atomic pile produces steam to drive a battery of turbine generators.
145420	152620	Thus, the mysterious force of nuclear fission is converted into the familiar, flexible electric power.
153900	158620	Beyond atomic energy, there is another limitless, undeveloped source of power.
159500	172060	The energy in sunlight falling on the U.S. daily is more than enough to supply all our requirements for food, heat, and light, to power our transportation and manufacturing.
173100	182620	Today, we use sunlight stored in cold, once lush green vegetation, for the force of falling water, whose cycle is motivated by the sun.
183580	193340	But locked in every growing plant is a mysterious process known as photosynthesis, nature's way of turning light into chemical energy.
194700	207260	Science is patiently unlocking the secrets of photosynthesis, and we may well see an error wherein solar energy, like atomic energy, may be put to work as electric power.
208220	215260	But there are electrical innovations long past the experimental stage. Look! Already, it is tomorrow.
216060	223660	Welcome to an electrical home of the future, a new concept for living, whose elements are all practical possibilities now.
225260	229900	Come in. Here is a living room with no wasted space.
230700	242700	For centuries, the fireplace has been the center of attraction, so here we have incorporated the modern age point of interest, the television set.
244700	256700	This room, like the rest of the house, is light conditioned, carefully planned lighting based on research, and installed with a relay operated remote control wiring system.
257500	269500	This inexpensive system permits starting breakfast coffee by pressing a bedside switch, turning off the radio with a switch near the telephone.
271500	277500	Lights can be turned on ahead and turned off behind you as you walk through the rules.
278300	286300	Just off the living room is the electric kitchen, organized to save steps, time, and energy.
288300	296300	The combination soda fountain and snack bar adjoins the electric laundry where clothes can be washed, rinsed, dried, and ironed.
297100	303100	Incorporated in the snack bar is the electric sink with a disposal and dishwater.
304100	308100	Here is greater freedom from drudgery than ever before.
309100	313100	Intor weather of this new world home is provided by the heat pump.
314100	321100	A concept of living for the future, yes, but all components of this dream home are being manufactured today.
321900	325900	Tomorrow, they can be part of your home too.
326900	335900	But for us, the one days of tomorrow and the way of life we have achieved depend on freedom to build and grow, on the personal liberty that inspired the men of Lexington.
336900	343900	But now our freedoms are threatened by forces that would crush our liberties and tyrannize the minds of men.
343900	352900	Against these forces, we have the weapons of freedom, courage, faith, and the creative spirit.
353900	358900	And we have the tool that built our way of life, productivity.
359900	366900	America, with only 6% of the world's wealth, is the source of freedom.
366900	370900	We have built our way of life, productivity.
371900	378900	America, with only 6% of the world's population, produces over 40% of the world's goods.
379900	383900	How can such a small percentage of the world's people produce so much?
384900	386900	Here is one important reason.
387900	391900	Every worker has at his command an invisible battalion.
391900	399900	Who are they? Listen, a one-horsepower motor can do the muscle work of 17 men.
400900	410900	In 1940, the average American worker had four horsepower of electrical energy, or the equivalent of nearly 70 invisible workers at his command.
410900	416900	By 1950, ten short years later, this number had more than doubled.
417900	421900	There were on the job with him over 150 unseen workers.
422900	425900	And the ranks of these invisible battalions keep growing.
426900	431900	With this productivity, we can add to our freedoms and defend them.
431900	436900	For the future, the challenge is clear.
437900	444900	We must keep building our productivity to strengthen freedom at home and halt the tyranny abroad.
445900	456900	If we are now able to multiply the efforts of every workman 150 times with only 8 horsepower of electric power, why not still more horsepower?
457900	463900	Why not 200, 300, 500 invisible workers on the job?
468900	477900	As the minute men laid down their plows and took up their guns at the first alarm, we too must guard for ourselves and for future generations.
478900	481900	The liberties that enabled us to build and grow.
482900	486900	Today, freedom and power are woven together.
487900	493900	The invisible battalions of electric power turn out autos and airplanes.
496900	502900	Household goods and guided missiles to preserve our freedoms for the greater world to come.
505900	507900	But we are not a nation of destroyers.
507900	509900	We are builders.
511900	515900	Builders of new freedoms and more power for a new age.
518900	521900	We stand on the edge of that new age even now.
522900	530900	And the pioneering spirit, flowering in the air of freedom, will dream and build new ways to put electric power to work.
531900	537900	Then in time we may come to know that the men of Lexington set off a chain reaction,
538900	544900	burgeoning down the years to make this world a freer world for all mankind.
546900	550900	Freedom and power.
560900	564900	You're watching Sleepcore, Pleasant Dreams.
590900	595900	Sleepcore, Pleasant Dreams.
620900	640900	The present and the unborn generation of the United States and the world are heirs to one of the greatest energy discoveries of man, nuclear energy.
641900	646900	Accompanying the tremendous advantages of this discovery are certain potential risks to health and life.
647900	658900	As small as these risks are, the government has the responsibility of assuring that the health and lives of people are protected while the advantages of nuclear energy are being developed.
659900	675900	Nuclear energy has already been put to use in many ways as a source of heat or production of light and power in cities, in industry, and for the propulsion of ships.
677900	685900	It is used for experimental purposes in agriculture and to develop stronger strains of disease and weather resistant food crops.
689900	694900	Another great area of development for nuclear energy is of course medical research.
695900	700900	Radioiodine has been found to be an effective treatment for hyperthyroidism to give but one example.
701900	712900	It is used for the control or relief of some diseases and these uses will of course be greatly extended and improved in time.
716900	723900	New programs of the Atomic Energy Commission and other agencies are designed to expand the usefulness of nuclear energy.
723900	738900	Before work is begun on any of these programs, the government thoroughly evaluates the health and safety factors, often for several years, until it is assured that the project three major programs planned are,
739900	742900	one, aerospace nuclear reactor tests.
743900	748900	Two, the plowshare program for the peaceful uses of nuclear explosives.
749900	756900	And three, the seismic research program for the detection of underground nuclear detonations.
758900	769900	The first of these programs, the Aerospace Nuclear Reactor Test at the Nevada Test Site, includes the development of a nuclear engine to propel rockets into outer space.
770900	778900	And the development of a reactor for use in a nuclear ramjet engine to power a vehicle at supersonic speeds within the atmosphere.
783900	794900	The plowshare program covers several different fields. One is the development of a new source of power to supplement the rapidly diminishing supply of oil, coal and gas.
795900	807900	Today reactor plants can provide an alternate source of power from nuclear energy. However, this power is now expensive because of the initial cost of the plants.
808900	820900	In the Atomic Energy Commission's effort to find additional sources of power, one of the plowshare's experiments involves investigation of the problems in the underground storage of heat produced by nuclear explosions.
825900	831900	And the recovery of this energy to provide electrical power. Industrial expansion.
840900	848900	Other objectives of the plowshare program are to study the possibility of producing isotopes in these underground explosions.
849900	855900	To aid in the economical recovery of minerals upon which the expanding industries of the world depend.
858900	868900	And to explore safety techniques and economic feasibility of using nuclear explosions for excavation purposes in the building of harbors and canals.
869900	887900	The seismic research program is designed to improve methods of detecting and identifying underground detonations by seismic recordings and to determine the wave ray patterns in the immediate vicinity of the site and at other stations in the seismic network.
888900	899900	To differentiate between underground explosions, earthquakes or subterranean tremors of similar intensity is a major difficulty.
900900	923900	Poor informal review of nuclear radiations and their effect on humans, a sunlit pool with all the trimmings serves as a suitable launching spot, offering an approach that is sufficiently scientific and scenic.
924900	932900	A sunbather exposes herself to an assortment of radiations, some such as the solar rays or heaven sent.
932900	940900	Others are nuclear, the same as those which come from an atomic burst and they're bombarding her from all sides.
941900	953900	From the sky in the form of cosmic rays, from radon and material in the atmosphere, from radioactive uranium found in the water which she just left and in the earth on which she now lives.
953900	962900	They aren't powerful enough to bother our bather, they're less of a hazard than the rays of the sun which, if carelessly taken, can become too much of a good thing.
963900	973900	With all radiations, nuclear and otherwise, it depends on the duration and intensity of the exposure.
973900	980900	Nuclear radiations have their novel way of causing injury, but it's neither mysterious nor inescapable.
980900	989900	Radioactivity, as represented by the ball, causes electrons to be ejected from their atoms.
990900	994900	It's an offensive move based on ionization.
994900	999900	Ionization disrupts the structure of atoms of which all living matter is composed.
999900	1006900	An atom is part of a molecule and molecules are parts of the cell.
1006900	1014900	The cell is the structural and functional unit of all living matter, a tiny machine with a basic job to do.
1015900	1023900	Cells operating with thousands of other cells of various shapes and performing special chores make up tissues and organs.
1023900	1033900	Organs are departments in a complex factory, the human body, which is engaged in the manufacture of an important product, light.
1034900	1049900	An atom then seems unimportant and infinitesimal, a tiny cog on a small wheel in a miniature machine which, if multiplied millions of times, forms the going concern that is you.
1049900	1059900	But if enough of the cogs are broken through ionizing radiation, the gears grind, the machines falter and stop, the factory shuts down.
1063900	1070900	Each of the four kinds of missiles discharged by radioactive substances has its own ballistic behavior.
1070900	1079900	To observe them attacking the body, they must be symbolized far out of proportion, magnified millions of times.
1079900	1083900	Gamma rays are the most penetrating but the least ionizing.
1083900	1090900	Not so penetrating but more ionizing are neutrons, which are not rays but particles.
1090900	1097900	Neutrons and gamma rays are external dangers, able to shoot into the human body easily.
1097900	1104900	Alpha particles cannot penetrate the skin.
1104900	1112900	Beta particles can cause surface burns if the assault is sufficiently concentrated and sustained.
1113900	1122900	Both are able to gain entry through the eating and breathing of radioactive matter, or via breaks in the skin.
1122900	1131900	Once inside, this so-called hot stuff takes up residence in various parts of the body, giving off highly ionizing alpha and beta particles.
1131900	1135900	And how long does this radio rat race go on?
1135900	1141900	The body will succeed in casting off some of this material, but it is a long, slow process.
1141900	1145900	There's no effective method for dislodging the stuff.
1145900	1149900	No known way of neutralizing or destroying it.
1149900	1157900	There is no method of hastening its half-life, which is the time required for 50% of the substance to decay.
1157900	1161900	With some substances, it is a matter of less than a second.
1161900	1167900	But if you had some plutonium inside you, you wouldn't make any plans to celebrate the event.
1167900	1173900	Plutonium's half-life is 24,000 years.
1173900	1180900	The various kinds of cells which make up the parts of the body differ in their vulnerability to radiation.
1180900	1185900	Most sensitive are lymph cells, such as those found in the tonsils.
1185900	1190900	Next is bone marrow, which manufactures red and white blood cells.
1190900	1196900	Then the sex cells, followed by tendons and cartilage, as in the nose.
1196900	1202900	Muscles and nerves, the toughest of all.
1202900	1210900	In general, cells which reproduce rapidly and whose efficient functioning depends on that ability are most defective.
1210900	1217900	Radiation halts the reproduction, which is a simple process of one cell dividing into two.
1217900	1222900	This destructiveness has been harnessed and put to work in the radium treatment of cancer,
1222900	1228900	which consists of cells that have gone wild and multiplied too fast.
1228900	1235900	The manifestations of radiation in the body are many and range from slight to severe.
1235900	1246900	Loss of hair, nausea, bleeding, inability of the body to resist other ailments that make its own repairs.
1246900	1252900	These are some of them, and they may be climaxed by the ultimate symptom, death itself.
1252900	1256900	However, complete recovery is more probable.
1256900	1262900	The illness runs a course from causes to effects.
1262900	1266900	Much of the mystery surrounding it is maintained by the general public,
1266900	1273900	which is determined to regard radioactivity as potent and irresistible as the evil spirits of the Indians.
1273900	1278900	This can be partly explained by man's fear of dangers he cannot sense.
1278900	1286900	A fear fanned into widespread misunderstanding by sensational speculation on what radiations can do.
1286900	1291900	Radioactivity is dangerous, but to say that it's deadly, period,
1291900	1299900	is as misleading as giving a flat answer to the question, how high is up?
1299900	1304900	You're watching Sleepcore, Media for Insomnia.
1329900	1345900	This is an atom, as scientists simplified for us.
1345900	1350900	So incredibly small, we will never see one.
1350900	1358900	Yet the atom is mainly empty space with electrons whirling around the nucleus.
1359900	1364900	But man succeeded in smashing the tiny subatomic nucleus,
1364900	1370900	releasing enormous and unprecedented amounts of energy.
1377900	1385900	War and peace were revolutionized at the dawn of the atomic age.
1388900	1396900	Our solar system in the universe around us, also mainly empty space.
1396900	1401900	So vast, it staggers human comprehension.
1401900	1406900	Still, man is now conquering this vastness.
1406900	1412900	Strange devices float in the emptiness between our Earth and the planets.
1412900	1415900	Men walk in space.
1415900	1419900	Science fiction becomes science fact.
1419900	1427900	As more ambitious space feats take shape on the drawing boards, one need becomes imperative.
1427900	1429900	More power.
1429900	1436900	So the experts of space rendezvoused with the masters of the subatomic world.
1437900	1445900	For only the atom can satisfy some of the future power needs for space exploration.
1445900	1453900	One has to use the tiniest fragments in nature to reach into the vastness of the universe.
1453900	1459900	Nuclear energy is being developed for our space program in two basic applications.
1459900	1464900	First, for nuclear space propulsion, the nuclear rocket.
1464900	1471900	Secondly, in special power plants, which can provide the electricity essential for every spacecraft,
1471900	1475900	where solar energy is unsuitable.
1475900	1478900	First, the atomic rocket.
1478900	1488900	The fireworks invented by the Chinese and their monumental descendants used for space travel have one thing in common.
1488900	1495900	Like the motor of a car, they work by the internal combustion engine principle.
1495900	1501900	Thrust is produced by energy liberated when the chemicals burn.
1501900	1505900	They are called chemical rockets.
1505900	1511900	Gases expanding and rushing through the open end of the engine provide thrust.
1511900	1518900	The same principle holds true for both the liquid and solid fuel systems.
1518900	1528900	The performance of chemical rockets has doubled during the past two decades and their growth is now leveling off.
1528900	1539900	But the source of power that will provide performance greater than today's most advanced chemical rocket engine is the nuclear rocket engine.
1539900	1546900	An engine based on the fantastic energy of the atom, of nuclear fuel,
1546900	1553900	essential for flights of our astronauts to Mars, Venus and beyond,
1553900	1561900	essential for auxiliary power to operate a base on the moon.
1561900	1567900	The nuclear rocket does not burn fuel in the same way that chemical rockets do.
1567900	1574900	Instead, it carries the lightest of all elements, liquid hydrogen, as a propellant.
1574900	1579900	The heat source is an atomic furnace, a nuclear reactor.
1579900	1588900	It heats, vaporizes and expands the propellant and expels it from a nozzle to produce thrust.
1588900	1596900	The nuclear rocket has advantages over the chemical propulsion engine for trips into deep space.
1596900	1606900	The specific impulse or efficiency of a nuclear rocket can be two or more times greater than that of a chemical rocket.
1606900	1613900	This will result in a great reduction in the weight of the propulsion system for the same payload.
1613900	1618900	For some missions, millions of pounds less than chemical rockets,
1618900	1624900	permitting the nuclear rocket to out-distance the chemical rocket.
1624900	1631900	Today, space objectives can be accomplished by the chemical combustion rocket.
1631900	1640900	But the power requirements of some future space missions will be made possible by atomic energy.
1640900	1647900	The nuclear engine is versatile. It can shut off and restart as desired.
1647900	1652900	And the amount of its thrust can be regulated to meet mission requirements.
1652900	1660900	The heat in the nuclear reactor is produced by the action of tiny bullet-like neutrons,
1660900	1664900	the electrically neutral parts of the atomic nucleus.
1664900	1672900	When a neutron strikes an atomic nucleus, the nucleus may split, releasing at the same time radiation and heat.
1672900	1679900	In the process, additional neutrons may hit other nuclei and build up a chain reaction
1679900	1686900	that can yield tremendous amounts of usable heat out of small amounts of nuclear fuel.
1686900	1691900	Uranium is the most practical fuel for this purpose.
1691900	1697900	Since slow-moving neutrons are more likely to cause a chain reaction than fast-moving neutrons,
1697900	1702900	moderating materials are used to slow them down.
1702900	1709900	The reactor's activity is started, stopped, increased, and decreased
1709900	1716900	by the use of neutron-stopping materials such as cadmium or boron.
1716900	1726900	Reflector material such as beryllium that bounces escaping neutrons back into the active area greatly increases activity.
1727900	1734900	Now, to take advantage of the tremendous heat created by the fission process,
1734900	1739900	the propellant hydrogen is forced through the hot core.
1739900	1746900	As it absorbs heat, the gas expands to a veritable hydrogen hurricane,
1746900	1750900	exerting thrust as it is forced out of the nozzle.
1750900	1756900	Since the hydrogen expands to produce thrust and does not burn,
1756900	1761900	it is not necessary to carry oxygen to support combustion.
1761900	1766900	While the theoretical advantages of the nuclear rocket are impressive,
1766900	1770900	the practical applications offer great challenges.
1770900	1779900	The scientists and engineers of the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
1779900	1783900	combined forces to meet these challenges.
1783900	1789900	The name of the program, rover.
1789900	1794900	These nuclear rockets will be used in space as upper stage on vehicles
1794900	1798900	boosted from the earth with chemical rockets.
1798900	1803900	The men who design and build the nuclear rocket are looking ahead to the time
1803900	1809900	when our nation's space vehicles will be used for extended manned lunar operations
1809900	1816900	for manned planetary exploration and unmanned deep space probes.
1816900	1822900	From the nuclear rocket, we turn now to the atomic electrical power plants.
1822900	1829900	Spacecraft need electricity to satisfy the demands of the various subsystems.
1829900	1836900	The need for a continuous supply of electrical power is especially great in manned space vehicles
1836900	1840900	with their complex life support systems.
1840900	1847900	Radio and television receivers and transmitters, telemetry devices, computers,
1847900	1850900	and other scientific instruments.
1850900	1856900	This power may be provided by batteries with relatively brief life spans
1856900	1861900	or solar cells which have their limitations.
1861900	1868900	For example, solar cells because they can only be energized by the sun
1868900	1873900	cannot operate on the shadow side of the moon.
1873900	1880900	Or they may be damaged when the craft passes through radiation areas such as the Van Allen belt.
1880900	1887900	Also, as spacecraft become larger, they require higher capacity power sources.
1887900	1894900	At these higher power levels, atomic energy will be especially useful.
1894900	1901900	Two different types of atomic power sources have already been launched to power spacecraft.
1901900	1906900	The radioisotopic generator, known as the atomic battery,
1906900	1913900	and the atomic power reactor, the isotopic generator.
1913900	1922900	This satellite launch in 1961 made history the first use of atomic power in space.
1922900	1927900	Still operating, the satellite carries a radioisotope generator
1927900	1933900	as a supplementary source of electricity for its radio transmitters.
1933900	1941900	This first space generator, about the size and shape of a grapefruit, weighs about five pounds.
1941900	1946900	Its rated output is about 2.7 watts.
1946900	1952900	Radioisotopes of an element release energetic particles.
1952900	1957900	When they are stopped in the surrounding material, they produce heat.
1957900	1962900	Heat is converted into electricity.
1962900	1966900	This is accomplished by a series of thermocouples,
1966900	1972900	each of which converts heat directly into a small amount of electricity.
1972900	1977900	When two dissimilar metals are joined in a closed circuit
1977900	1981900	and the two junctions are kept at different temperatures,
1981900	1985900	an electric current is generated.
1985900	1990900	There are no moving parts.
1990900	1996900	Here is a series of thermocouples as used in an isotopic generator.
1996900	2004900	Ultimately, the lifetime of such a unit is limited only by the length of effectiveness of the atomic fuel.
2004900	2014900	That may last years, as in the case of this isotopic unit to operate a remote weather station.
2014900	2026900	Under most circumstances, the life of an isotopic unit is much longer than the life of a chemical battery or solar cells.
2026900	2034900	When space vehicles become larger, isotopic generators will become relatively less economical.
2034900	2040900	The larger nuclear demands can be met by an auxiliary power reactor.
2040900	2047900	The principle of creating heat is similar to the method used by the space propulsion reactor.
2047900	2054900	Only in this case, the reactor and power generator are much smaller,
2054900	2060900	such as this 970-pound SNAP 10A reactor power system.
2060900	2074900	In this case, the heat produced by nuclear reaction is converted directly into about 500 watts of electricity by 1,440 thermocouples.
2074900	2078900	April 3, 1965.
2078900	2083900	The first time a reactor was put in orbit.
2083900	2094900	During its operation in orbit, the atomic reactor produced 500,000 watt-hours of electricity.
2094900	2103900	An exact copy of this flight unit completed more than a year of successful uninterrupted testing on the ground.
2103900	2114900	Eventually, reactors of this type will produce much more power for the same weight.
2114900	2121900	Reactor systems of the future will provide housekeeping power for observation and weather satellites,
2121900	2136900	orbiting laboratories, and communication systems sending signals directly to your radios and TV sets on the ground.
2136900	2147900	In other types of space auxiliary power reactors, the conversion to electrical power will be accomplished by heat exchangers,
2147900	2154900	feeding a conventional turbo generator.
2154900	2161900	Astronauts of the future will travel in spacecraft propelled by nuclear rockets.
2161900	2166900	The huge array of instruments and controlled devices in their spacecraft,
2166900	2170900	and in those they will leave in space, on the moon,
2170900	2178900	and on other distant places in our solar system will receive electricity from nuclear power generators.
2178900	2186900	Men in space through the magic of the atom.
2201900	2215900	Music
2215900	2219900	The moon, closest neighbor to Earth.
2219900	2223900	Presently the focus of man's greatest scientific adventure.
2223900	2227900	The first celestial body that will be explored by man.
2227900	2231900	Music
2231900	2239900	Landing men on the moon will be a truly great achievement, but only the beginning of a new era in space exploration.
2239900	2245900	No one can predict the exact missions that will follow in the years and decades ahead,
2245900	2252900	but the most exciting possibilities will require the acceleration and deceleration of very heavy loads,
2252900	2260900	such as the maneuvering of large Earth-orbiting spacecraft,
2260900	2267900	the transportation of large amounts of equipment and supplies to the lunar surface,
2267900	2273900	and the sending of heavy spacecraft to the planets.
2273900	2278900	Today's missions are being accomplished with rockets that burn chemical fuels,
2278900	2286900	but chemical fuels are heavy, and the cost of putting each pound into Earth orbit is very high.
2286900	2294900	Nuclear rockets, when perfected, can provide the same propulsion energy with less overall weight.
2294900	2300900	They will expand our ability to explore space. This is the story.
2300900	2325900	Music
2325900	2331900	This is Saturn V, the most powerful launch vehicle being built by the United States,
2331900	2341900	a three-stage rocket that will place the Apollo spacecraft in the vicinity of the moon.
2341900	2345900	The total weight of Saturn V is about six million pounds.
2345900	2367900	The three stages have chemical engines that burn fuel to generate thrust.
2367900	2372900	The first and second stages provide most of the energy needed to put the third stage and the payload
2372900	2377900	about a quarter of a million pounds into Earth orbit.
2377900	2383900	At present, only chemical rockets can provide the high thrust needed to do this job.
2383900	2393900	Music
2393900	2399900	The third stage accelerates the payload to the velocity needed to get it to its destination.
2399900	2408900	Here, travel time and payload weight are determined by the efficiency with which the propellant is converted into thrust.
2408900	2417900	By substituting a nuclear third stage for Saturn V, the velocity of a given payload can be greatly increased,
2417900	2421900	cutting travel time for some missions in half.
2421900	2427900	This is particularly important in sending deep space probes to Jupiter and beyond.
2427900	2434900	Or if shortening travel time is not essential, propellant weight can be traded off for an increased payload weight.
2434900	2444900	This is important for a lunar supply mission, Earth orbital operations, and some unmanned missions to the planets.
2444900	2449900	Why is the nuclear rocket so much better than the chemical rocket?
2449900	2454900	In rocket propulsion, exhaust velocity determines propulsion efficiency.
2454900	2459900	At a given temperature, the lighter the exhaust gas, the higher the exhaust velocity,
2459900	2466900	and the higher the exhaust velocity, the more thrust is generated for each pound of propellant consumed per second.
2466900	2474900	The nuclear rocket merely heats hydrogen, the lightest element of all, and expels it at tremendous velocity.
2474900	2481900	Chemical rockets burn fuel to produce exhaust gases that contain heavier elements.
2481900	2486900	So at the same exhaust temperature, the exhaust velocity is much lower,
2486900	2490900	and each pound consumed per second produces less thrust.
2490900	2495900	Rocket efficiency is stated in seconds of specific impulse.
2495900	2501900	This refers to the time in seconds that one pound of propellant will deliver one pound of thrust.
2501900	2506900	The higher the seconds of specific impulse, the greater the propellant economy.
2507900	2513900	Our best chemical rockets of today are limited to a specific impulse of about 450 seconds,
2513900	2516900	and only slight improvement can be expected.
2516900	2521900	On the other hand, full-scale nuclear reactor tests have achieved 800 seconds,
2521900	2528900	and laboratory tests promise even more, perhaps as much as 900 seconds.
2528900	2534900	This means the nuclear rocket, with its lightweight, high-velocity exhaust,
2534900	2539900	will use propellant about twice as efficiently as chemical rockets.
2539900	2544900	This, then, is the principal advantage of nuclear propulsion.
2546900	2551900	Someday, a manned trip to Mars and return may become the mission assignment.
2551900	2555900	Exactly how it would be carried out depends upon a number of factors,
2555900	2559900	but here is one way it might be done with nuclear rocket propulsion,
2559900	2563900	using the technology developed for earlier missions.
2563900	2566900	Using several Saturn V launch vehicles,
2566900	2571900	components of the huge spacecraft would be placed into Earth orbit and assembled.
2571900	2576900	Separate nuclear stages might be provided for each major step of the mission.
2576900	2581900	The first stage might consist of three clustered rockets for departure from Earth orbit.
2581900	2589900	Two other nuclear stages consisting of one engine each would be used in the vicinity of Mars.
2589900	2594900	The first stage cluster fires to accelerate the spacecraft to the velocity needed to get to Mars
2594900	2598900	in the time that was decided upon, say 200 days.
2598900	2605900	At burnout, the first stage cluster is jettisoned and goes into orbit around the Sun.
2606900	2609900	Bid course correction is made by chemical rockets.
2616900	2620900	About 200 days later, the space vehicle approaches Mars.
2620900	2626900	There it is slowed down by a single nuclear rocket and enters an orbit around the planet.
2628900	2633900	The used second stage is put into a higher Mars orbit than the space vehicle.
2636900	2642900	A chemically powered module departs for the planet's surface.
2646900	2650900	For the first time, men from Earth will set foot on another planet.
2665900	2670900	For the return trip, the module is lifted by chemical power back into a Mars orbit
2670900	2673900	where it docks with the main space vehicle.
2675900	2681900	The men transfer to the main craft and jettison the module, leaving it in an orbit around Mars.
2683900	2687900	A third nuclear rocket accelerates the vehicle for the return trip.
2687900	2692900	And it is jettisoned.
2700900	2703900	Again, mid-course correction is made chemically.
2703900	2709900	Just before reaching the vicinity of Earth, the crew transfers to a re-entry vehicle
2709900	2712900	and jettisons the large spacecraft.
2718900	2725900	Chemical rockets slow down the vehicle to re-entry speed and they are jettisoned.
2733900	2739900	After deceleration through the atmosphere, the re-entry vehicle returns to the Earth's surface by parachute.
2740900	2747900	A trip to Mars and back for centuries a dream of Earthbound men is now much closer to reality.
2750900	2756900	Of course, there are many, many other problems to be solved before such advanced space missions can be attempted.
2756900	2761900	Life support systems for extended space journeys, more accurate space navigation,
2761900	2765900	communication systems, power supplies and so forth.
2769900	2776900	But any successful advanced mission must begin with propulsion, the power to get there and back.
2776900	2782900	Lower overall weight, larger payloads, shorter travel time.
2782900	2786900	These are the chief advantages of nuclear propulsion.
2786900	2790900	The technology needed to build a nuclear rocket is well advanced.
2790900	2796900	It will be available when this nation determines its next great objective in space.
2799900	2804900	Thank you for watching.
