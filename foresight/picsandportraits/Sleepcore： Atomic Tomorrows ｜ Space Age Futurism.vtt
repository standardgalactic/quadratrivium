00:00.000 --> 00:06.220
It's a different world in Grandpa New as a boy.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.380
The change has reached a way beyond the home, farm, and school.

00:11.260 --> 00:15.620
Business and commerce, too, have been streamlined by electric power.

00:16.660 --> 00:22.080
June, who is perhaps Grandpa's favorite, has electricity to speed her work at the bank.

00:24.740 --> 00:29.100
When she goes home from work, she rides on a silent, gliding trolley bus.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.500
Almost to her own door.

00:33.740 --> 00:37.220
The house is much the same shape as the house as the Minutemen lived in,

00:37.820 --> 00:40.540
but the door leads to a different way of life.

00:41.580 --> 00:48.420
Here, light, heat, and energy to help with the housework come in by wire.

00:50.060 --> 00:53.420
Electric powers performing other unseen jobs.

00:54.380 --> 00:59.260
The water faucets are connected with a modern electrically operated water treatment plant,

00:59.820 --> 01:04.100
the garbage disposal to an electrically operated sewage plant.

01:08.260 --> 01:13.740
The amazing part of it all is the fact that the electric power they use in their home

01:14.300 --> 01:18.700
costs less than it did when Bill and Ella were married back in 1920.

01:19.660 --> 01:24.860
All in a man's lifetime, electric power has changed the world.

01:25.900 --> 01:31.340
But what about the world that Fred Wilson's granddaughter will see, the world of tomorrow?

01:32.300 --> 01:39.980
Tomorrow will bring innovations like the heat pump, which electrically heats your house in winter and cools it in summer.

01:41.100 --> 01:46.780
Even in winter, there is always heat in the air, the soil, and the water below ground level.

01:47.740 --> 01:52.700
During the cold months, the heat pump withdraws warmth from outside to heat your home.

01:53.580 --> 02:02.780
In summer, it operates much like your electric refrigerator, withdrawing and expelling heat from the inside air to provide cooling comfort.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.420
And what of atomic energy?

02:06.060 --> 02:11.020
Chances are, there will never be a handy home-size atomic pile in your basement.

02:11.900 --> 02:16.860
But experiments are already underway that point to atomic power plants like this.

02:18.140 --> 02:24.620
The intense heat generated in an atomic pile produces steam to drive a battery of turbine generators.

02:25.420 --> 02:32.620
Thus, the mysterious force of nuclear fission is converted into the familiar, flexible electric power.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.620
Beyond atomic energy, there is another limitless, undeveloped source of power.

02:39.500 --> 02:52.060
The energy in sunlight falling on the U.S. daily is more than enough to supply all our requirements for food, heat, and light, to power our transportation and manufacturing.

02:53.100 --> 03:02.620
Today, we use sunlight stored in cold, once lush green vegetation, for the force of falling water, whose cycle is motivated by the sun.

03:03.580 --> 03:13.340
But locked in every growing plant is a mysterious process known as photosynthesis, nature's way of turning light into chemical energy.

03:14.700 --> 03:27.260
Science is patiently unlocking the secrets of photosynthesis, and we may well see an error wherein solar energy, like atomic energy, may be put to work as electric power.

03:28.220 --> 03:35.260
But there are electrical innovations long past the experimental stage. Look! Already, it is tomorrow.

03:36.060 --> 03:43.660
Welcome to an electrical home of the future, a new concept for living, whose elements are all practical possibilities now.

03:45.260 --> 03:49.900
Come in. Here is a living room with no wasted space.

03:50.700 --> 04:02.700
For centuries, the fireplace has been the center of attraction, so here we have incorporated the modern age point of interest, the television set.

04:04.700 --> 04:16.700
This room, like the rest of the house, is light conditioned, carefully planned lighting based on research, and installed with a relay operated remote control wiring system.

04:17.500 --> 04:29.500
This inexpensive system permits starting breakfast coffee by pressing a bedside switch, turning off the radio with a switch near the telephone.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.500
Lights can be turned on ahead and turned off behind you as you walk through the rules.

04:38.300 --> 04:46.300
Just off the living room is the electric kitchen, organized to save steps, time, and energy.

04:48.300 --> 04:56.300
The combination soda fountain and snack bar adjoins the electric laundry where clothes can be washed, rinsed, dried, and ironed.

04:57.100 --> 05:03.100
Incorporated in the snack bar is the electric sink with a disposal and dishwater.

05:04.100 --> 05:08.100
Here is greater freedom from drudgery than ever before.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.100
Intor weather of this new world home is provided by the heat pump.

05:14.100 --> 05:21.100
A concept of living for the future, yes, but all components of this dream home are being manufactured today.

05:21.900 --> 05:25.900
Tomorrow, they can be part of your home too.

05:26.900 --> 05:35.900
But for us, the one days of tomorrow and the way of life we have achieved depend on freedom to build and grow, on the personal liberty that inspired the men of Lexington.

05:36.900 --> 05:43.900
But now our freedoms are threatened by forces that would crush our liberties and tyrannize the minds of men.

05:43.900 --> 05:52.900
Against these forces, we have the weapons of freedom, courage, faith, and the creative spirit.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.900
And we have the tool that built our way of life, productivity.

05:59.900 --> 06:06.900
America, with only 6% of the world's wealth, is the source of freedom.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.900
We have built our way of life, productivity.

06:11.900 --> 06:18.900
America, with only 6% of the world's population, produces over 40% of the world's goods.

06:19.900 --> 06:23.900
How can such a small percentage of the world's people produce so much?

06:24.900 --> 06:26.900
Here is one important reason.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.900
Every worker has at his command an invisible battalion.

06:31.900 --> 06:39.900
Who are they? Listen, a one-horsepower motor can do the muscle work of 17 men.

06:40.900 --> 06:50.900
In 1940, the average American worker had four horsepower of electrical energy, or the equivalent of nearly 70 invisible workers at his command.

06:50.900 --> 06:56.900
By 1950, ten short years later, this number had more than doubled.

06:57.900 --> 07:01.900
There were on the job with him over 150 unseen workers.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.900
And the ranks of these invisible battalions keep growing.

07:06.900 --> 07:11.900
With this productivity, we can add to our freedoms and defend them.

07:11.900 --> 07:16.900
For the future, the challenge is clear.

07:17.900 --> 07:24.900
We must keep building our productivity to strengthen freedom at home and halt the tyranny abroad.

07:25.900 --> 07:36.900
If we are now able to multiply the efforts of every workman 150 times with only 8 horsepower of electric power, why not still more horsepower?

07:37.900 --> 07:43.900
Why not 200, 300, 500 invisible workers on the job?

07:48.900 --> 07:57.900
As the minute men laid down their plows and took up their guns at the first alarm, we too must guard for ourselves and for future generations.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.900
The liberties that enabled us to build and grow.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.900
Today, freedom and power are woven together.

08:07.900 --> 08:13.900
The invisible battalions of electric power turn out autos and airplanes.

08:16.900 --> 08:22.900
Household goods and guided missiles to preserve our freedoms for the greater world to come.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.900
But we are not a nation of destroyers.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.900
We are builders.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.900
Builders of new freedoms and more power for a new age.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.900
We stand on the edge of that new age even now.

08:42.900 --> 08:50.900
And the pioneering spirit, flowering in the air of freedom, will dream and build new ways to put electric power to work.

08:51.900 --> 08:57.900
Then in time we may come to know that the men of Lexington set off a chain reaction,

08:58.900 --> 09:04.900
burgeoning down the years to make this world a freer world for all mankind.

09:06.900 --> 09:10.900
Freedom and power.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.900
You're watching Sleepcore, Pleasant Dreams.

09:50.900 --> 09:55.900
Sleepcore, Pleasant Dreams.

10:20.900 --> 10:40.900
The present and the unborn generation of the United States and the world are heirs to one of the greatest energy discoveries of man, nuclear energy.

10:41.900 --> 10:46.900
Accompanying the tremendous advantages of this discovery are certain potential risks to health and life.

10:47.900 --> 10:58.900
As small as these risks are, the government has the responsibility of assuring that the health and lives of people are protected while the advantages of nuclear energy are being developed.

10:59.900 --> 11:15.900
Nuclear energy has already been put to use in many ways as a source of heat or production of light and power in cities, in industry, and for the propulsion of ships.

11:17.900 --> 11:25.900
It is used for experimental purposes in agriculture and to develop stronger strains of disease and weather resistant food crops.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.900
Another great area of development for nuclear energy is of course medical research.

11:35.900 --> 11:40.900
Radioiodine has been found to be an effective treatment for hyperthyroidism to give but one example.

11:41.900 --> 11:52.900
It is used for the control or relief of some diseases and these uses will of course be greatly extended and improved in time.

11:56.900 --> 12:03.900
New programs of the Atomic Energy Commission and other agencies are designed to expand the usefulness of nuclear energy.

12:03.900 --> 12:18.900
Before work is begun on any of these programs, the government thoroughly evaluates the health and safety factors, often for several years, until it is assured that the project three major programs planned are,

12:19.900 --> 12:22.900
one, aerospace nuclear reactor tests.

12:23.900 --> 12:28.900
Two, the plowshare program for the peaceful uses of nuclear explosives.

12:29.900 --> 12:36.900
And three, the seismic research program for the detection of underground nuclear detonations.

12:38.900 --> 12:49.900
The first of these programs, the Aerospace Nuclear Reactor Test at the Nevada Test Site, includes the development of a nuclear engine to propel rockets into outer space.

12:50.900 --> 12:58.900
And the development of a reactor for use in a nuclear ramjet engine to power a vehicle at supersonic speeds within the atmosphere.

13:03.900 --> 13:14.900
The plowshare program covers several different fields. One is the development of a new source of power to supplement the rapidly diminishing supply of oil, coal and gas.

13:15.900 --> 13:27.900
Today reactor plants can provide an alternate source of power from nuclear energy. However, this power is now expensive because of the initial cost of the plants.

13:28.900 --> 13:40.900
In the Atomic Energy Commission's effort to find additional sources of power, one of the plowshare's experiments involves investigation of the problems in the underground storage of heat produced by nuclear explosions.

13:45.900 --> 13:51.900
And the recovery of this energy to provide electrical power. Industrial expansion.

14:00.900 --> 14:08.900
Other objectives of the plowshare program are to study the possibility of producing isotopes in these underground explosions.

14:09.900 --> 14:15.900
To aid in the economical recovery of minerals upon which the expanding industries of the world depend.

14:18.900 --> 14:28.900
And to explore safety techniques and economic feasibility of using nuclear explosions for excavation purposes in the building of harbors and canals.

14:29.900 --> 14:47.900
The seismic research program is designed to improve methods of detecting and identifying underground detonations by seismic recordings and to determine the wave ray patterns in the immediate vicinity of the site and at other stations in the seismic network.

14:48.900 --> 14:59.900
To differentiate between underground explosions, earthquakes or subterranean tremors of similar intensity is a major difficulty.

15:00.900 --> 15:23.900
Poor informal review of nuclear radiations and their effect on humans, a sunlit pool with all the trimmings serves as a suitable launching spot, offering an approach that is sufficiently scientific and scenic.

15:24.900 --> 15:32.900
A sunbather exposes herself to an assortment of radiations, some such as the solar rays or heaven sent.

15:32.900 --> 15:40.900
Others are nuclear, the same as those which come from an atomic burst and they're bombarding her from all sides.

15:41.900 --> 15:53.900
From the sky in the form of cosmic rays, from radon and material in the atmosphere, from radioactive uranium found in the water which she just left and in the earth on which she now lives.

15:53.900 --> 16:02.900
They aren't powerful enough to bother our bather, they're less of a hazard than the rays of the sun which, if carelessly taken, can become too much of a good thing.

16:03.900 --> 16:13.900
With all radiations, nuclear and otherwise, it depends on the duration and intensity of the exposure.

16:13.900 --> 16:20.900
Nuclear radiations have their novel way of causing injury, but it's neither mysterious nor inescapable.

16:20.900 --> 16:29.900
Radioactivity, as represented by the ball, causes electrons to be ejected from their atoms.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.900
It's an offensive move based on ionization.

16:34.900 --> 16:39.900
Ionization disrupts the structure of atoms of which all living matter is composed.

16:39.900 --> 16:46.900
An atom is part of a molecule and molecules are parts of the cell.

16:46.900 --> 16:54.900
The cell is the structural and functional unit of all living matter, a tiny machine with a basic job to do.

16:55.900 --> 17:03.900
Cells operating with thousands of other cells of various shapes and performing special chores make up tissues and organs.

17:03.900 --> 17:13.900
Organs are departments in a complex factory, the human body, which is engaged in the manufacture of an important product, light.

17:14.900 --> 17:29.900
An atom then seems unimportant and infinitesimal, a tiny cog on a small wheel in a miniature machine which, if multiplied millions of times, forms the going concern that is you.

17:29.900 --> 17:39.900
But if enough of the cogs are broken through ionizing radiation, the gears grind, the machines falter and stop, the factory shuts down.

17:43.900 --> 17:50.900
Each of the four kinds of missiles discharged by radioactive substances has its own ballistic behavior.

17:50.900 --> 17:59.900
To observe them attacking the body, they must be symbolized far out of proportion, magnified millions of times.

17:59.900 --> 18:03.900
Gamma rays are the most penetrating but the least ionizing.

18:03.900 --> 18:10.900
Not so penetrating but more ionizing are neutrons, which are not rays but particles.

18:10.900 --> 18:17.900
Neutrons and gamma rays are external dangers, able to shoot into the human body easily.

18:17.900 --> 18:24.900
Alpha particles cannot penetrate the skin.

18:24.900 --> 18:32.900
Beta particles can cause surface burns if the assault is sufficiently concentrated and sustained.

18:33.900 --> 18:42.900
Both are able to gain entry through the eating and breathing of radioactive matter, or via breaks in the skin.

18:42.900 --> 18:51.900
Once inside, this so-called hot stuff takes up residence in various parts of the body, giving off highly ionizing alpha and beta particles.

18:51.900 --> 18:55.900
And how long does this radio rat race go on?

18:55.900 --> 19:01.900
The body will succeed in casting off some of this material, but it is a long, slow process.

19:01.900 --> 19:05.900
There's no effective method for dislodging the stuff.

19:05.900 --> 19:09.900
No known way of neutralizing or destroying it.

19:09.900 --> 19:17.900
There is no method of hastening its half-life, which is the time required for 50% of the substance to decay.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.900
With some substances, it is a matter of less than a second.

19:21.900 --> 19:27.900
But if you had some plutonium inside you, you wouldn't make any plans to celebrate the event.

19:27.900 --> 19:33.900
Plutonium's half-life is 24,000 years.

19:33.900 --> 19:40.900
The various kinds of cells which make up the parts of the body differ in their vulnerability to radiation.

19:40.900 --> 19:45.900
Most sensitive are lymph cells, such as those found in the tonsils.

19:45.900 --> 19:50.900
Next is bone marrow, which manufactures red and white blood cells.

19:50.900 --> 19:56.900
Then the sex cells, followed by tendons and cartilage, as in the nose.

19:56.900 --> 20:02.900
Muscles and nerves, the toughest of all.

20:02.900 --> 20:10.900
In general, cells which reproduce rapidly and whose efficient functioning depends on that ability are most defective.

20:10.900 --> 20:17.900
Radiation halts the reproduction, which is a simple process of one cell dividing into two.

20:17.900 --> 20:22.900
This destructiveness has been harnessed and put to work in the radium treatment of cancer,

20:22.900 --> 20:28.900
which consists of cells that have gone wild and multiplied too fast.

20:28.900 --> 20:35.900
The manifestations of radiation in the body are many and range from slight to severe.

20:35.900 --> 20:46.900
Loss of hair, nausea, bleeding, inability of the body to resist other ailments that make its own repairs.

20:46.900 --> 20:52.900
These are some of them, and they may be climaxed by the ultimate symptom, death itself.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.900
However, complete recovery is more probable.

20:56.900 --> 21:02.900
The illness runs a course from causes to effects.

21:02.900 --> 21:06.900
Much of the mystery surrounding it is maintained by the general public,

21:06.900 --> 21:13.900
which is determined to regard radioactivity as potent and irresistible as the evil spirits of the Indians.

21:13.900 --> 21:18.900
This can be partly explained by man's fear of dangers he cannot sense.

21:18.900 --> 21:26.900
A fear fanned into widespread misunderstanding by sensational speculation on what radiations can do.

21:26.900 --> 21:31.900
Radioactivity is dangerous, but to say that it's deadly, period,

21:31.900 --> 21:39.900
is as misleading as giving a flat answer to the question, how high is up?

21:39.900 --> 21:44.900
You're watching Sleepcore, Media for Insomnia.

22:09.900 --> 22:25.900
This is an atom, as scientists simplified for us.

22:25.900 --> 22:30.900
So incredibly small, we will never see one.

22:30.900 --> 22:38.900
Yet the atom is mainly empty space with electrons whirling around the nucleus.

22:39.900 --> 22:44.900
But man succeeded in smashing the tiny subatomic nucleus,

22:44.900 --> 22:50.900
releasing enormous and unprecedented amounts of energy.

22:57.900 --> 23:05.900
War and peace were revolutionized at the dawn of the atomic age.

23:08.900 --> 23:16.900
Our solar system in the universe around us, also mainly empty space.

23:16.900 --> 23:21.900
So vast, it staggers human comprehension.

23:21.900 --> 23:26.900
Still, man is now conquering this vastness.

23:26.900 --> 23:32.900
Strange devices float in the emptiness between our Earth and the planets.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.900
Men walk in space.

23:35.900 --> 23:39.900
Science fiction becomes science fact.

23:39.900 --> 23:47.900
As more ambitious space feats take shape on the drawing boards, one need becomes imperative.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.900
More power.

23:49.900 --> 23:56.900
So the experts of space rendezvoused with the masters of the subatomic world.

23:57.900 --> 24:05.900
For only the atom can satisfy some of the future power needs for space exploration.

24:05.900 --> 24:13.900
One has to use the tiniest fragments in nature to reach into the vastness of the universe.

24:13.900 --> 24:19.900
Nuclear energy is being developed for our space program in two basic applications.

24:19.900 --> 24:24.900
First, for nuclear space propulsion, the nuclear rocket.

24:24.900 --> 24:31.900
Secondly, in special power plants, which can provide the electricity essential for every spacecraft,

24:31.900 --> 24:35.900
where solar energy is unsuitable.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.900
First, the atomic rocket.

24:38.900 --> 24:48.900
The fireworks invented by the Chinese and their monumental descendants used for space travel have one thing in common.

24:48.900 --> 24:55.900
Like the motor of a car, they work by the internal combustion engine principle.

24:55.900 --> 25:01.900
Thrust is produced by energy liberated when the chemicals burn.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.900
They are called chemical rockets.

25:05.900 --> 25:11.900
Gases expanding and rushing through the open end of the engine provide thrust.

25:11.900 --> 25:18.900
The same principle holds true for both the liquid and solid fuel systems.

25:18.900 --> 25:28.900
The performance of chemical rockets has doubled during the past two decades and their growth is now leveling off.

25:28.900 --> 25:39.900
But the source of power that will provide performance greater than today's most advanced chemical rocket engine is the nuclear rocket engine.

25:39.900 --> 25:46.900
An engine based on the fantastic energy of the atom, of nuclear fuel,

25:46.900 --> 25:53.900
essential for flights of our astronauts to Mars, Venus and beyond,

25:53.900 --> 26:01.900
essential for auxiliary power to operate a base on the moon.

26:01.900 --> 26:07.900
The nuclear rocket does not burn fuel in the same way that chemical rockets do.

26:07.900 --> 26:14.900
Instead, it carries the lightest of all elements, liquid hydrogen, as a propellant.

26:14.900 --> 26:19.900
The heat source is an atomic furnace, a nuclear reactor.

26:19.900 --> 26:28.900
It heats, vaporizes and expands the propellant and expels it from a nozzle to produce thrust.

26:28.900 --> 26:36.900
The nuclear rocket has advantages over the chemical propulsion engine for trips into deep space.

26:36.900 --> 26:46.900
The specific impulse or efficiency of a nuclear rocket can be two or more times greater than that of a chemical rocket.

26:46.900 --> 26:53.900
This will result in a great reduction in the weight of the propulsion system for the same payload.

26:53.900 --> 26:58.900
For some missions, millions of pounds less than chemical rockets,

26:58.900 --> 27:04.900
permitting the nuclear rocket to out-distance the chemical rocket.

27:04.900 --> 27:11.900
Today, space objectives can be accomplished by the chemical combustion rocket.

27:11.900 --> 27:20.900
But the power requirements of some future space missions will be made possible by atomic energy.

27:20.900 --> 27:27.900
The nuclear engine is versatile. It can shut off and restart as desired.

27:27.900 --> 27:32.900
And the amount of its thrust can be regulated to meet mission requirements.

27:32.900 --> 27:40.900
The heat in the nuclear reactor is produced by the action of tiny bullet-like neutrons,

27:40.900 --> 27:44.900
the electrically neutral parts of the atomic nucleus.

27:44.900 --> 27:52.900
When a neutron strikes an atomic nucleus, the nucleus may split, releasing at the same time radiation and heat.

27:52.900 --> 27:59.900
In the process, additional neutrons may hit other nuclei and build up a chain reaction

27:59.900 --> 28:06.900
that can yield tremendous amounts of usable heat out of small amounts of nuclear fuel.

28:06.900 --> 28:11.900
Uranium is the most practical fuel for this purpose.

28:11.900 --> 28:17.900
Since slow-moving neutrons are more likely to cause a chain reaction than fast-moving neutrons,

28:17.900 --> 28:22.900
moderating materials are used to slow them down.

28:22.900 --> 28:29.900
The reactor's activity is started, stopped, increased, and decreased

28:29.900 --> 28:36.900
by the use of neutron-stopping materials such as cadmium or boron.

28:36.900 --> 28:46.900
Reflector material such as beryllium that bounces escaping neutrons back into the active area greatly increases activity.

28:47.900 --> 28:54.900
Now, to take advantage of the tremendous heat created by the fission process,

28:54.900 --> 28:59.900
the propellant hydrogen is forced through the hot core.

28:59.900 --> 29:06.900
As it absorbs heat, the gas expands to a veritable hydrogen hurricane,

29:06.900 --> 29:10.900
exerting thrust as it is forced out of the nozzle.

29:10.900 --> 29:16.900
Since the hydrogen expands to produce thrust and does not burn,

29:16.900 --> 29:21.900
it is not necessary to carry oxygen to support combustion.

29:21.900 --> 29:26.900
While the theoretical advantages of the nuclear rocket are impressive,

29:26.900 --> 29:30.900
the practical applications offer great challenges.

29:30.900 --> 29:39.900
The scientists and engineers of the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

29:39.900 --> 29:43.900
combined forces to meet these challenges.

29:43.900 --> 29:49.900
The name of the program, rover.

29:49.900 --> 29:54.900
These nuclear rockets will be used in space as upper stage on vehicles

29:54.900 --> 29:58.900
boosted from the earth with chemical rockets.

29:58.900 --> 30:03.900
The men who design and build the nuclear rocket are looking ahead to the time

30:03.900 --> 30:09.900
when our nation's space vehicles will be used for extended manned lunar operations

30:09.900 --> 30:16.900
for manned planetary exploration and unmanned deep space probes.

30:16.900 --> 30:22.900
From the nuclear rocket, we turn now to the atomic electrical power plants.

30:22.900 --> 30:29.900
Spacecraft need electricity to satisfy the demands of the various subsystems.

30:29.900 --> 30:36.900
The need for a continuous supply of electrical power is especially great in manned space vehicles

30:36.900 --> 30:40.900
with their complex life support systems.

30:40.900 --> 30:47.900
Radio and television receivers and transmitters, telemetry devices, computers,

30:47.900 --> 30:50.900
and other scientific instruments.

30:50.900 --> 30:56.900
This power may be provided by batteries with relatively brief life spans

30:56.900 --> 31:01.900
or solar cells which have their limitations.

31:01.900 --> 31:08.900
For example, solar cells because they can only be energized by the sun

31:08.900 --> 31:13.900
cannot operate on the shadow side of the moon.

31:13.900 --> 31:20.900
Or they may be damaged when the craft passes through radiation areas such as the Van Allen belt.

31:20.900 --> 31:27.900
Also, as spacecraft become larger, they require higher capacity power sources.

31:27.900 --> 31:34.900
At these higher power levels, atomic energy will be especially useful.

31:34.900 --> 31:41.900
Two different types of atomic power sources have already been launched to power spacecraft.

31:41.900 --> 31:46.900
The radioisotopic generator, known as the atomic battery,

31:46.900 --> 31:53.900
and the atomic power reactor, the isotopic generator.

31:53.900 --> 32:02.900
This satellite launch in 1961 made history the first use of atomic power in space.

32:02.900 --> 32:07.900
Still operating, the satellite carries a radioisotope generator

32:07.900 --> 32:13.900
as a supplementary source of electricity for its radio transmitters.

32:13.900 --> 32:21.900
This first space generator, about the size and shape of a grapefruit, weighs about five pounds.

32:21.900 --> 32:26.900
Its rated output is about 2.7 watts.

32:26.900 --> 32:32.900
Radioisotopes of an element release energetic particles.

32:32.900 --> 32:37.900
When they are stopped in the surrounding material, they produce heat.

32:37.900 --> 32:42.900
Heat is converted into electricity.

32:42.900 --> 32:46.900
This is accomplished by a series of thermocouples,

32:46.900 --> 32:52.900
each of which converts heat directly into a small amount of electricity.

32:52.900 --> 32:57.900
When two dissimilar metals are joined in a closed circuit

32:57.900 --> 33:01.900
and the two junctions are kept at different temperatures,

33:01.900 --> 33:05.900
an electric current is generated.

33:05.900 --> 33:10.900
There are no moving parts.

33:10.900 --> 33:16.900
Here is a series of thermocouples as used in an isotopic generator.

33:16.900 --> 33:24.900
Ultimately, the lifetime of such a unit is limited only by the length of effectiveness of the atomic fuel.

33:24.900 --> 33:34.900
That may last years, as in the case of this isotopic unit to operate a remote weather station.

33:34.900 --> 33:46.900
Under most circumstances, the life of an isotopic unit is much longer than the life of a chemical battery or solar cells.

33:46.900 --> 33:54.900
When space vehicles become larger, isotopic generators will become relatively less economical.

33:54.900 --> 34:00.900
The larger nuclear demands can be met by an auxiliary power reactor.

34:00.900 --> 34:07.900
The principle of creating heat is similar to the method used by the space propulsion reactor.

34:07.900 --> 34:14.900
Only in this case, the reactor and power generator are much smaller,

34:14.900 --> 34:20.900
such as this 970-pound SNAP 10A reactor power system.

34:20.900 --> 34:34.900
In this case, the heat produced by nuclear reaction is converted directly into about 500 watts of electricity by 1,440 thermocouples.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.900
April 3, 1965.

34:38.900 --> 34:43.900
The first time a reactor was put in orbit.

34:43.900 --> 34:54.900
During its operation in orbit, the atomic reactor produced 500,000 watt-hours of electricity.

34:54.900 --> 35:03.900
An exact copy of this flight unit completed more than a year of successful uninterrupted testing on the ground.

35:03.900 --> 35:14.900
Eventually, reactors of this type will produce much more power for the same weight.

35:14.900 --> 35:21.900
Reactor systems of the future will provide housekeeping power for observation and weather satellites,

35:21.900 --> 35:36.900
orbiting laboratories, and communication systems sending signals directly to your radios and TV sets on the ground.

35:36.900 --> 35:47.900
In other types of space auxiliary power reactors, the conversion to electrical power will be accomplished by heat exchangers,

35:47.900 --> 35:54.900
feeding a conventional turbo generator.

35:54.900 --> 36:01.900
Astronauts of the future will travel in spacecraft propelled by nuclear rockets.

36:01.900 --> 36:06.900
The huge array of instruments and controlled devices in their spacecraft,

36:06.900 --> 36:10.900
and in those they will leave in space, on the moon,

36:10.900 --> 36:18.900
and on other distant places in our solar system will receive electricity from nuclear power generators.

36:18.900 --> 36:26.900
Men in space through the magic of the atom.

36:41.900 --> 36:55.900
Music

36:55.900 --> 36:59.900
The moon, closest neighbor to Earth.

36:59.900 --> 37:03.900
Presently the focus of man's greatest scientific adventure.

37:03.900 --> 37:07.900
The first celestial body that will be explored by man.

37:07.900 --> 37:11.900
Music

37:11.900 --> 37:19.900
Landing men on the moon will be a truly great achievement, but only the beginning of a new era in space exploration.

37:19.900 --> 37:25.900
No one can predict the exact missions that will follow in the years and decades ahead,

37:25.900 --> 37:32.900
but the most exciting possibilities will require the acceleration and deceleration of very heavy loads,

37:32.900 --> 37:40.900
such as the maneuvering of large Earth-orbiting spacecraft,

37:40.900 --> 37:47.900
the transportation of large amounts of equipment and supplies to the lunar surface,

37:47.900 --> 37:53.900
and the sending of heavy spacecraft to the planets.

37:53.900 --> 37:58.900
Today's missions are being accomplished with rockets that burn chemical fuels,

37:58.900 --> 38:06.900
but chemical fuels are heavy, and the cost of putting each pound into Earth orbit is very high.

38:06.900 --> 38:14.900
Nuclear rockets, when perfected, can provide the same propulsion energy with less overall weight.

38:14.900 --> 38:20.900
They will expand our ability to explore space. This is the story.

38:20.900 --> 38:45.900
Music

38:45.900 --> 38:51.900
This is Saturn V, the most powerful launch vehicle being built by the United States,

38:51.900 --> 39:01.900
a three-stage rocket that will place the Apollo spacecraft in the vicinity of the moon.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.900
The total weight of Saturn V is about six million pounds.

39:05.900 --> 39:27.900
The three stages have chemical engines that burn fuel to generate thrust.

39:27.900 --> 39:32.900
The first and second stages provide most of the energy needed to put the third stage and the payload

39:32.900 --> 39:37.900
about a quarter of a million pounds into Earth orbit.

39:37.900 --> 39:43.900
At present, only chemical rockets can provide the high thrust needed to do this job.

39:43.900 --> 39:53.900
Music

39:53.900 --> 39:59.900
The third stage accelerates the payload to the velocity needed to get it to its destination.

39:59.900 --> 40:08.900
Here, travel time and payload weight are determined by the efficiency with which the propellant is converted into thrust.

40:08.900 --> 40:17.900
By substituting a nuclear third stage for Saturn V, the velocity of a given payload can be greatly increased,

40:17.900 --> 40:21.900
cutting travel time for some missions in half.

40:21.900 --> 40:27.900
This is particularly important in sending deep space probes to Jupiter and beyond.

40:27.900 --> 40:34.900
Or if shortening travel time is not essential, propellant weight can be traded off for an increased payload weight.

40:34.900 --> 40:44.900
This is important for a lunar supply mission, Earth orbital operations, and some unmanned missions to the planets.

40:44.900 --> 40:49.900
Why is the nuclear rocket so much better than the chemical rocket?

40:49.900 --> 40:54.900
In rocket propulsion, exhaust velocity determines propulsion efficiency.

40:54.900 --> 40:59.900
At a given temperature, the lighter the exhaust gas, the higher the exhaust velocity,

40:59.900 --> 41:06.900
and the higher the exhaust velocity, the more thrust is generated for each pound of propellant consumed per second.

41:06.900 --> 41:14.900
The nuclear rocket merely heats hydrogen, the lightest element of all, and expels it at tremendous velocity.

41:14.900 --> 41:21.900
Chemical rockets burn fuel to produce exhaust gases that contain heavier elements.

41:21.900 --> 41:26.900
So at the same exhaust temperature, the exhaust velocity is much lower,

41:26.900 --> 41:30.900
and each pound consumed per second produces less thrust.

41:30.900 --> 41:35.900
Rocket efficiency is stated in seconds of specific impulse.

41:35.900 --> 41:41.900
This refers to the time in seconds that one pound of propellant will deliver one pound of thrust.

41:41.900 --> 41:46.900
The higher the seconds of specific impulse, the greater the propellant economy.

41:47.900 --> 41:53.900
Our best chemical rockets of today are limited to a specific impulse of about 450 seconds,

41:53.900 --> 41:56.900
and only slight improvement can be expected.

41:56.900 --> 42:01.900
On the other hand, full-scale nuclear reactor tests have achieved 800 seconds,

42:01.900 --> 42:08.900
and laboratory tests promise even more, perhaps as much as 900 seconds.

42:08.900 --> 42:14.900
This means the nuclear rocket, with its lightweight, high-velocity exhaust,

42:14.900 --> 42:19.900
will use propellant about twice as efficiently as chemical rockets.

42:19.900 --> 42:24.900
This, then, is the principal advantage of nuclear propulsion.

42:26.900 --> 42:31.900
Someday, a manned trip to Mars and return may become the mission assignment.

42:31.900 --> 42:35.900
Exactly how it would be carried out depends upon a number of factors,

42:35.900 --> 42:39.900
but here is one way it might be done with nuclear rocket propulsion,

42:39.900 --> 42:43.900
using the technology developed for earlier missions.

42:43.900 --> 42:46.900
Using several Saturn V launch vehicles,

42:46.900 --> 42:51.900
components of the huge spacecraft would be placed into Earth orbit and assembled.

42:51.900 --> 42:56.900
Separate nuclear stages might be provided for each major step of the mission.

42:56.900 --> 43:01.900
The first stage might consist of three clustered rockets for departure from Earth orbit.

43:01.900 --> 43:09.900
Two other nuclear stages consisting of one engine each would be used in the vicinity of Mars.

43:09.900 --> 43:14.900
The first stage cluster fires to accelerate the spacecraft to the velocity needed to get to Mars

43:14.900 --> 43:18.900
in the time that was decided upon, say 200 days.

43:18.900 --> 43:25.900
At burnout, the first stage cluster is jettisoned and goes into orbit around the Sun.

43:26.900 --> 43:29.900
Bid course correction is made by chemical rockets.

43:36.900 --> 43:40.900
About 200 days later, the space vehicle approaches Mars.

43:40.900 --> 43:46.900
There it is slowed down by a single nuclear rocket and enters an orbit around the planet.

43:48.900 --> 43:53.900
The used second stage is put into a higher Mars orbit than the space vehicle.

43:56.900 --> 44:02.900
A chemically powered module departs for the planet's surface.

44:06.900 --> 44:10.900
For the first time, men from Earth will set foot on another planet.

44:25.900 --> 44:30.900
For the return trip, the module is lifted by chemical power back into a Mars orbit

44:30.900 --> 44:33.900
where it docks with the main space vehicle.

44:35.900 --> 44:41.900
The men transfer to the main craft and jettison the module, leaving it in an orbit around Mars.

44:43.900 --> 44:47.900
A third nuclear rocket accelerates the vehicle for the return trip.

44:47.900 --> 44:52.900
And it is jettisoned.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.900
Again, mid-course correction is made chemically.

45:03.900 --> 45:09.900
Just before reaching the vicinity of Earth, the crew transfers to a re-entry vehicle

45:09.900 --> 45:12.900
and jettisons the large spacecraft.

45:18.900 --> 45:25.900
Chemical rockets slow down the vehicle to re-entry speed and they are jettisoned.

45:33.900 --> 45:39.900
After deceleration through the atmosphere, the re-entry vehicle returns to the Earth's surface by parachute.

45:40.900 --> 45:47.900
A trip to Mars and back for centuries a dream of Earthbound men is now much closer to reality.

45:50.900 --> 45:56.900
Of course, there are many, many other problems to be solved before such advanced space missions can be attempted.

45:56.900 --> 46:01.900
Life support systems for extended space journeys, more accurate space navigation,

46:01.900 --> 46:05.900
communication systems, power supplies and so forth.

46:09.900 --> 46:16.900
But any successful advanced mission must begin with propulsion, the power to get there and back.

46:16.900 --> 46:22.900
Lower overall weight, larger payloads, shorter travel time.

46:22.900 --> 46:26.900
These are the chief advantages of nuclear propulsion.

46:26.900 --> 46:30.900
The technology needed to build a nuclear rocket is well advanced.

46:30.900 --> 46:36.900
It will be available when this nation determines its next great objective in space.

46:39.900 --> 46:44.900
Thank you for watching.
