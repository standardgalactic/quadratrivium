00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,780
Hello everybody, this is Pascal from Neutrality Studies and yesterday my dear friends from

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,620
Austria uploaded a video interview that they did live in Austria in Vienna with Jeffrey

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:26,760
Sachs and it is part of this big peace conference that was organized there, was done in conjunction

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,020
with my colleague Fritz Edlinger, who is the editor-in-chief of the Austrian magazine

5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,260
International. A wonderful magazine, if you read German I highly recommend subscribing

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,020
to them and also subscribe to their YouTube channel, they do a fantastic job. The interview

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,000
with Dr. Sachs was done by my friend and colleague with whom I have published books together

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,660
Dr. Professor Heinz Gertner and I would just recommend you watch this one hour long

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,180
discussion between the two and all the explanation that Jeffrey Sachs gives. He's a fantastic

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:11,860
speaker and he views world politics and US politics very very clearly. Please enjoy.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:20,140
So I wrote the war, Professor Sachs. We have several explanations here out there, so starting

12
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:32,940
from Putin's personality to imperial conquest, to more structural explanations like hegemonic

13
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:41,220
competition. So we have this range of explanations, so where would you stand? Is it personality

14
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,580
is it imperialism, is it more hegemonic competition, of Kate Barr competition, as we say, so that's

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,980
the first question. Great, thank you very much and I'm told to be very brief so that we can discuss

16
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,220
a lot, so I'll give somewhat brief answers because if I get going it's going to be a long evening for

17
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:15,660
you. I believe the war started nine years ago, not last year. I think it started in February 2014,

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:24,740
it started with the violent overthrow of President Yanukovych, which I attribute to a

19
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:34,220
significant extent to US participation in a regime change operation in Ukraine. And to my mind that

20
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:45,140
really was the trigger of this war, meaning that we are basically seeing a proxy war between the

21
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:56,100
United States and Russia, plus both sides of playing on the very aggravated ethnic divisions

22
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:06,420
within Ukraine. So Ukraine is a divided country, ethnically, historically, but that meant that

23
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:15,300
there was competition between the United States and Russia for control, for influence, even for

24
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:26,340
putting military bases and the US NATO alliance. And I view the lack of prudence by both sides, but

25
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,140
since I'm an American, I will focus on the lack of American prudence as being absolutely central

26
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:41,060
to this. If the United States had sense, and by the United States I don't mean the American people,

27
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,580
they're never asked about any of these things. This has nothing to do with the American people.

28
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:56,100
This is to do with a small group in Washington in power. You could call it the military industrial

29
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:04,980
complex, it's a fair name for it. They don't have prudence, and we are at war because of that lack

30
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,620
of prudence in my view. I don't think anything specific about Putin's personality plays any

31
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:20,820
important role in this. I don't think that this is some idea of recreating the Russian Empire.

32
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,420
By the way, we hear lots of things in the mainstream media, which to my mind are completely

33
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:36,740
unrecognizable regarding the truth. And just one more small point. I was advisor, economic advisor,

34
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,620
to President Gorbachev. I was economic advisor to President Yeltsin, and I was an economic advisor

35
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,380
to President Kuchma, the first president of independent Ukraine. I didn't choose sides,

36
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:01,060
I liked them both. There's no reason why this war needed to happen, but I'll focus because of being

37
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:09,540
an American on the lack of sense of the military industrial complex in the United States. And I

38
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:18,580
think that that was a major, major cause of this war. You said personality doesn't really play that

39
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:26,100
role. You mentioned NATO and probably its structural causes and such a monarchy competition.

40
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:36,100
And of course, Russia's perception is that Russia wanted to wall off NATO. So he was not really

41
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:45,300
successful because now NATO is everywhere. So NATO, Finland and Sweden are training NATO and

42
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,300
NATO troops are permanently deployed in Poland and the Baltic States. Right now we have a huge

43
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:02,580
military, NATO military maneuver in Germany and also Putin wanted to demilitarize Ukraine. And now

44
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:12,260
Ukraine is the most militarized country in Europe. Was Putin's decision a big geopolitical plunder?

45
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:22,020
Well, it's a big geopolitical tragedy. What happens from now still remains to be seen.

46
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:32,420
And let me be clear about the NATO issues. It's my, well, it's without doubt

47
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:44,820
the American plan to expand NATO to Ukraine already in the mid 1990s, well before there was Putin

48
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,180
as president. It is my understanding from a discussion with one of our leading historians

49
00:06:52,820 --> 00:07:02,980
recently that the plan to expand NATO to Ukraine was made in 1992. Basically within weeks or months

50
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:11,620
of having promised Gorbachev that NATO would not move one inch eastward. So this is not something

51
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,500
new. It's not something about Putin. It's something that predates Putin. There's a fascinating

52
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,540
article by Zbigniew Brzezinski in Foreign Affairs magazine, which is our establishment foreign policy

53
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:34,740
magazine in 1997, where he spells out the timeline to NATO enlargement to Central Europe, Eastern

54
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:45,300
Europe, the Baltic States, and Ukraine almost precisely in 1997, because this was a U.S. plan

55
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,100
at the top levels. When an article was written like that, that's not just an opinion of an

56
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,700
author that's informing the elite opinion in the United States what the real plan is. So this was

57
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:09,780
in the works for decades, and the specific idea about NATO spelled out by Brzezinski, both in

58
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,860
Foreign Affairs and in a book called the Global Chess Board that he wrote in 1997,

59
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:27,780
is to surround Russia in the Black Sea region. This is out of the playbook of Britain and France

60
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:37,060
in 1853 to 1856. It's almost reliving the Crimean War. The idea of the Crimean War was that

61
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:47,780
Palmerston wanted to kick Russia out of the Black Sea. Brzezinski had a similar idea in the mid-1990s.

62
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:57,380
The U.S. Neoconservatives had a similar idea back to 1992. If Ukraine and Georgia become NATO members,

63
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:06,340
if you look at the map, you see that Russia is surrounded by Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey,

64
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:14,020
and Georgia. Even the idea of expanding NATO to Georgia, to me, is the giveaway.

65
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,420
Last time I checked, Georgia is not a North Atlantic country. It's in the Caucasus.

66
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:35,700
What in heaven's name is NATO doing in Georgia? This is where things really went awry.

67
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,940
It is official U.S. doctrine. It's surprisingly official, by the way, because you can find it

68
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:51,220
in many, many documents, that the U.S. goal is to be the dominant power in all parts of the world.

69
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:59,300
To my mind, no thanks. It doesn't make me feel any safer. It just means endless wars,

70
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,660
when 4.1 percent of the world population presumes that it's going to dominate the world.

71
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,100
But this, I believe, was part of U.S. foreign policy at the core already for decades.

72
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,180
And NATO enlargement is part of this. There's something particular about Ukraine.

73
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:28,420
It is 2,000 kilometers of border with Russia. It is, from Russia's point of view,

74
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:37,780
a direct security risk to Russia. I would take the same view as a Russian. I would take the

75
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,260
same view as an American vis-a-vis Russia. I actually don't want Mexico to have a military

76
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,380
alliance with China. I don't want Mexico to have a military alliance with Russia.

77
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,060
And I don't want the United States to have a military alliance with Ukraine for the same

78
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:04,820
reasons. It doesn't make the world safer. If NATO expansion was one of the main

79
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:13,380
causes for the decision by Russia to invade Ukraine, because, of course, of the

80
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,860
fear that it might be a similar situation as we had with the Cuban Missile Crisis in

81
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:29,380
1962, that NATO missiles would be deployed there. However, there have been several

82
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:39,380
proposals since 2008. There was the Bucharest Summit when NATO promised

83
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:50,180
Ukraine and Georgia would become NATO members, but not later than 2014 for a neutrality

84
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,540
of Ukraine. So neutrality defined no NATO membership, but at the same time,

85
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:08,740
the withdrawal of Russian-supported militias in the east. So it could have a neutral Ukraine

86
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:18,660
avoided the war. Why was it discarded? Of course, since 2019, we know that Ukraine has

87
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,780
the NATO membership in its constitution. Before 2008, there was some fourth and back

88
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:32,820
independence neutrality NATO membership, but not later than 2005 NATO membership was an

89
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:43,620
aspiration by Ukraine. So if Ukraine would have defended or presented a credible neutrality,

90
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:51,860
could the war have been avoided? Of course, it could have. And Austria's history is

91
00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:00,420
a glorious demonstration of the success of neutrality. Austria was not threatened

92
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:09,300
in the years from 1955 onward by being a non-NATO neutral country. Austria regained its sovereignty

93
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:18,660
and the Soviet Union went home. And incidentally, the Soviet Union went home in 1955 because

94
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:26,820
not only was the state treaty signed in the Belvedere agreed and the neutrality

95
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:34,740
declared by the parliament of this country, but also the Soviet Union was saying to the United

96
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:43,620
States, do this for Germany and the Cold War ends. Make Germany neutral. What is this NATO

97
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,340
business? This is a threat to us. Germany claimed 20 million lives of our citizens.

98
00:13:50,340 --> 00:14:00,900
Why are you re-arming Germany? And our greatest statesman practitioner of the day, one of our

99
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:09,460
great historian diplomats in modern history, George Kennan, said at that moment, use the Austrian

100
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:17,220
example, have a neutral Germany, and tell the Soviet Union, go home out of Central Europe,

101
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:24,740
out of Eastern Europe. Now you don't need that buffer zone because Germany is neutral. The United

102
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,780
States would have nothing of it. The United States has never believed in it. You were lucky,

103
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:39,140
they weren't paying attention. But for Germany, no way. We were going to have NATO.

104
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:48,020
The end of the 1950s, Eisenhower even said, give them nuclear weapons. That's okay. And that is why

105
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,420
in a series of horrible events, we nearly arrived at nuclear armageddon with the Cuban

106
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:02,740
missile crisis, the United States has a very hard time thinking through the eyes of anyone else.

107
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:11,140
And when I say U.S., I'm meaning literally a small group of a few hundred people. I'm not

108
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:19,940
speaking about the American people. They're not told anything about this. And just as a footnote,

109
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:32,580
I've tried to explain the role of NATO in this to the New York Times. And they will not print

110
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:44,020
anything on this. They've written 26 editorials since February 24, 2022, that this is an unprovoked

111
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:50,740
war. I called them. I wrote to them. I said, I've advised all these leaders, these countries. I've

112
00:15:50,740 --> 00:16:00,580
been through this for three decades. Can you give me 700 words? The answer is no. There's a complete

113
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,460
unwillingness to have any discussion about this. Because if you do, you're put on Ukraine's Black

114
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:17,780
list and you're put on America's no show list in the mainstream media. It's really quite something.

115
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,340
One more thing that's worth everybody understanding. This is not about Democrats and Republicans.

116
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:37,460
This is not at all about partisan politics. Biden is no different from so many other presidents.

117
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,780
It's not this one's crazy. This one's not crazy. They're all a little bit.

118
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:53,540
But this is about really state policy in the deepest structure in Washington.

119
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:01,300
And it's the Armed Services Committees. It's the very 900 billion dollar military budgets.

120
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:08,100
You have to test your weapons. Believe me, you need wars not so infrequently. You have to be ready.

121
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:15,140
You have to teach China a lesson in the in the minds of this small group. This war is as much

122
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:23,620
about China as it is about anything else. Isn't that surprising? It's hard to think the way they think.

123
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:32,100
But you cannot actually discuss this in the United States right now, in the mainstream.

124
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Of course, there are a thousand outlets to discuss things, but not in the Washington Post,

125
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,660
the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, MSNBC, CNN. Forget it.

126
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Let's do a step, Professor. You mentioned Austria and compared it to Germany.

127
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:03,060
Austria was lucky, maybe prudent, as you say, to get its permanent neutrality. Germany was

128
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:12,020
permanently divided for several decades. So we know this from history that wars

129
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,660
and where the armies stand. So and then you always have a division of territory.

130
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:27,940
So we know this from the end of the Cold War. In Tehran, 1943, they decided to build the blocks

131
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,180
where basically the armies after the Second World War were deployed. Now we have a situation

132
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:44,660
in a little bit and sort of Iron Curtain, a little bit more east. So we have an Iron Curtain from the

133
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:54,500
Arctic. Finland, Sweden is joining NATO. And this Iron Curtain is going right through Ukraine

134
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:03,540
down to the Black Sea. Do you see for Ukraine now a permanent division like for Germany or for

135
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:12,100
Korea? Or do we see a permanent war since I guess permanent neutrality is not the option anymore

136
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:22,260
for Ukraine? I would say we don't know what the options are because there has been no diplomacy

137
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:30,260
between the United States and Russia since this war began. As far as I know, President Biden

138
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:39,620
and President Putin have not spoken one time since February 24, 2022. I find that worse than

139
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,300
school children, by the way. It's hard for me to understand how the world can be at the brink of

140
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:52,900
nuclear war. And I could send them a link if they want so they could get on Zoom. I could even give

141
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:02,580
them a phone call. I'd lend them my phone. It's not so hard. But they don't talk. This is somehow

142
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:11,220
sophisticated. This is absolutely mind-boggling. Of course, you need to talk. You need to understand

143
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:20,900
the other side. Maybe you won't agree. More likely you'll find a modus vivendi or modus operandi to

144
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:30,900
get beyond this. It could be, in the end, many things could be. So I don't have a prediction.

145
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,500
Ukraine could be divided. We could have nuclear war. We could have Ukraine be neutral.

146
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,980
And Russia go home from most of Ukraine, though I don't think it's going to leave Crimea

147
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:53,380
for a lot of reasons now. But lots of things could happen. We should understand that in December

148
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:05,300
2021, the idea that Russia would annex the Donbas wasn't mentioned once. What Russia wanted

149
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:12,980
was that the Minsk-2 agreements would be honored. Now, that's quite interesting. The Minsk-2 agreements

150
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:24,900
declared that there would be autonomy for the Lugansk and Donetsk, for Eastern Ukraine,

151
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:34,820
the Russian dominant ethnic group, signed by Ukraine, and voted 15 to nothing by the U.N.

152
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:43,220
Security Council and guaranteed by France and Germany. Do you know what my Ukrainian friends,

153
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:50,660
they don't regard me as a friend anymore. But what they tell me, of course we'd never honor that

154
00:21:52,340 --> 00:22:00,500
as if it's a joke. And then when Russia says, well, this was not honored, we say, ah,

155
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,180
what difference? Russia doesn't believe in diplomacy. And now the sentence that I just uttered

156
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:13,460
proves that I'm a Putin lover. You know, in other words, we're in a cycle of bizarre arguments.

157
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:21,460
The truth is actually rather straightforward. The United States participated in the overthrow

158
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:30,100
of Yanukovych. A Russophobic government came to power. They immediately declared the intention,

159
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:38,900
immediately means within 2014 to join NATO. Arms shipments from the United States accelerated.

160
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:50,500
The Minsk agreements were signed. The Ukrainian government ignored them. Chancellor Merkel

161
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,100
explained afterwards, she explained to us last year, that she ignored them completely.

162
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:07,540
In 2021, December 17, President Putin put on the table a draft U.S.-Russia

163
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:18,500
security agreement, which had two major points that Putin was emphasizing. One is that the

164
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,620
Minsk agreement should be carried out. And the second was that NATO would not enlarge.

165
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,580
And the United States said, we don't negotiate with you over those things.

166
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:40,660
And it's NATO doctrine. What we do is no third country's business.

167
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:53,540
As if Castro said, what business is it of you, United States, just before we invaded in the Bay

168
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:00,980
of Pigs and also nearly had the world blown up over the Cuban Missile Crisis. If the tables

169
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,540
are turned just a little bit, believe me, the explosion that you would hear of any of the

170
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:15,700
claims that the United States makes. So that kind of hypocrisy and arrogance also is very grating

171
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:23,860
on most of the rest of the world. We make wars when we want. We can invade Afghanistan. We can

172
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:31,940
invade Iraq. We can try to overthrow Assad and have no doubt that was not a civil war. That was a

173
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,860
U.S. regime change operation signed by the President of the United States to the CIA called

174
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Operation Timber Sycamore. We can overthrow Gaddafi with the NATO in the end of 2011. We

175
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,700
can overthrow Yanukovych. We can do what we want. Why are you complaining? We are a peace-loving

176
00:24:51,700 --> 00:25:00,980
defensive alliance. And so this doesn't work. And this is why we don't know what can happen,

177
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:10,260
because I keep claiming, I'll claim it again, President Biden did what a U.S. president should

178
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:21,380
do, first picked up the phone or hit the Zoom button and talked to his counterpart and said,

179
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,940
you go home and we won't fill in the void with NATO.

180
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:37,940
Lots of good things could happen. So I don't rule out anything, but it takes two to make a

181
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:48,020
negotiation. Incidentally, one more point, sorry to run on, in March 2022, Russia and Ukraine

182
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:58,660
negotiated an end to the war. Did you know that? They negotiated. What happened? What happened?

183
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,460
Excuse me? No, that's not what happened. Okay. Butcha may or may not have happened,

184
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,620
but that's not what happened at the negotiating table. What happened at the negotiating table

185
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,420
was the United States told them, don't negotiate. That's what the United States told them.

186
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:22,500
This is now from multiple directions clear. And if you want to hear a very interesting

187
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,220
description of this that shows how bizarre this is, Naftali Bennett, who was then Prime

188
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:37,140
Minister of Israel and an informal mediator, said we were in the seventh draft and they were just

189
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:43,460
about reaching an agreement. And then the United States stopped it. And he said, I don't think

190
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,820
they should have stopped it, but they thought it was important about China. Are you kidding?

191
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:59,060
It takes a certain imagination to think that way. But that's what happened. And I've heard that from

192
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:08,660
all sides. So this is really not beyond our reach to have a negotiated outcome to this,

193
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:17,220
not at all beyond our reach. Let me push a little bit on this. On the one hand, you're saying

194
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,580
all options are possible. So you don't know what. But on the other hand, you're saying,

195
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:33,940
diplomacy does not really work now anymore. So what are the real end result here? So

196
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:42,900
Karl of Klausowitz, he said, war always pushes to the extremes unless there's a peace agreement

197
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:51,140
or a total defeat of the adversary. Neither of these options are inside at the moment.

198
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:59,620
So fighting continues. What are these extremes when it comes on? No diplomacy decision made on

199
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:09,140
the battlefield. Would it creep to an open, all out war? Is this a possibility, including maybe

200
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:19,140
nuclear weapons? There are many theories of what's going to happen on the battlefield. But before I

201
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:31,380
get to them, just to say that Klausowitz's most famous observation I think applies here perfectly,

202
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:38,340
which is that war is the continuation of politics with other means. This is political issues that

203
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:46,100
we're talking about here, which means that there is a way to resolve these issues politically,

204
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:54,260
not militarily. That's key. If this was the delusions of a madman, this would be different.

205
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:01,220
But this is politics. It's politics about Ukraine and it's politics about NATO. And so this is

206
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:10,420
susceptible of a negotiated outcome. I would not give up on that at all. Now, what could happen,

207
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,540
many things could happen. The one thing that cannot happen, in my opinion, is that Russia is

208
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:27,700
defeated. And the reason is that if Russia were to lose in a conventional sense, I believe Russia

209
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:36,020
would likely escalate to nuclear war. Because my understanding of this issue is that Russia views

210
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:45,300
this issue as existential for Russia, not as haphazard and not as a flight of fancy, not as a

211
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:52,740
dream world of Peter the Great, not as recreating the Russian Empire, but as an existential threat

212
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:04,500
to Russia. Whether it is or is not, it's viewed that way. And Putin is hardly the hardest of the

213
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:12,900
hardliners in Russia, by the way. There are many who resent the fact that he has not escalated

214
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:23,780
much harder and much faster, which is within Russia's means. So one possibility is that Russia

215
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:30,740
wins on the battlefield in the next months. This could really happen, incidentally, because

216
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:42,260
in a war of attrition, a much, much larger and powerful country has a propensity to win. And

217
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:50,500
because apparently, although I'm no expert on this, it is said that NATO stockpiles, including U.S.

218
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:59,620
stockpiles, are running very low. That scaling up of U.S. military production will take years. And

219
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:08,260
that even an article in Politico, which is a kind of right wing daily in the United States,

220
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:15,460
said the Pentagon is freaking out over the depleted reserves because our real war is with China,

221
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:24,260
they say. So it's really possible that Russia has a significant victory on the battlefield.

222
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:32,500
Okay, that could mean all sorts of things. It could mean NATO escalation in which we ratchet

223
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:40,980
things further. Or it could mean that there's some negotiation or frozen lines or armistice or

224
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,140
Ukraine divided in two or something else. Okay, that's one possibility. Another possibility is that

225
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:54,340
Ukraine wins significantly in this counteroffensive. Although, actually, I won't say, although

226
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:03,060
suppose that it did, is Russia going to say, oh, we made a mistake, we go home? I doubt it.

227
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:12,020
I think Russia would escalate further. And Russia has 1,600 deployed nuclear weapons,

228
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:20,740
including tactical nuclear weapons. I'm told every day, oh, don't be blackmailed

229
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:30,740
by nuclear weapons. People who say that have no idea of the history of the nuclear age. If you're

230
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:40,580
not terrified of gambling with that, you don't know the history. I'm terrified of it. So if Russia

231
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:51,380
were to be losing in a conventional war, I'd be, I would be terrified right now of what would come

232
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:58,900
next. And the idea that we had a story last week in the Washington Post, by the way, which said,

233
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:09,300
Biden, I don't, I'm paraphrasing, has decided he can ignore more and more of Putin's red lines.

234
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:19,700
Because so far, it's all been bluff. My God, the best book about the Cuban missile crisis ever

235
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:27,540
written was a book called Gambling with Armageddon. That's what they're doing. And I know the people

236
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:35,540
doing the gambling. You wouldn't want to bet the world on them, by the way. I know them personally.

237
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:46,180
Don't bet the world on them. So this is where we are. Lots of things are possible. But one thing

238
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:53,780
that is absolutely possible is that Biden picks up the phone and says, you know, we should consider

239
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:01,300
a way to end this thing without blowing up the world with you going home and with NATO not

240
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:08,820
enlarging. That's what I would like to see. You said nuclear weapons. Of course, Russia might

241
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:16,980
use or might threaten with nuclear weapons. But at the moment, it doesn't really seem that Russia

242
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:24,980
will have a decisive victory on the battlefield. So wasn't the Russian miscalculation in the first

243
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:31,540
place? So he did not, Russia did not increase military spending decisively before the war.

244
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:40,340
All other imperial powers did in the history. Russia did not. He invaded Ukraine with 180,000

245
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:52,500
soldiers. Compared to the US, the US deployed 800,000 soldiers in 1992 in Kuwait, to liberate

246
00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:03,540
Kuwait. Kuwait is 40 times smaller than Ukraine. So wasn't it a military miscalculation by Putin

247
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,060
in the first place? And now the last option, what remains are the nuclear weapons. Was this not

248
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:17,380
a dangerous gambling on the side of Putin as well? Aren't we just witnessing a game of chicken

249
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,300
on both sides? Isn't that what we're doing? That each side thinks they can bluff the other,

250
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:30,420
and each side calls the bluff of the other. The United States thought that they could get rid of

251
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:41,220
Yanukovych. No consequence. That's what the US thought. It's had, the US has overthrown dozens

252
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:49,940
of governments. It's really a bad habit. They forgot diplomacy. What they learned, they think,

253
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,980
learned it from the British, by the way, that if you don't like your counterpart, overthrow them.

254
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,500
So you forget that there's diplomacy. You don't have to deal with them. You have to subvert them.

255
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,980
So they thought that they could overthrow Yanukovych. No consequence. Putin grabbed Crimea,

256
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:19,140
like he told George Bush, he would. And the Russian parts of the Ukrainian army broke away

257
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:26,500
in eastern Ukraine, took the weapons with them, and started the People's Republics of

258
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:34,180
Donetsk and Lugansk. And by the way, OSCE observers and NATO observers say this was not

259
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:40,420
Russian weapons coming in. I wasn't there. It said this was Ukrainian weapons taken from within

260
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:56,100
the Ukrainian army to create these two breakaway regions. That led to the Minsk agreements. Putin

261
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:03,460
thought maybe that will be the way that this will stop. There will be autonomy for these two regions,

262
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:14,020
Crimea will be ours. That would have probably stopped this war. But Minsk wasn't honored.

263
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:23,540
When President Biden came in, Putin said, stop. Stop. And Biden said, no, why stop?

264
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,340
Ukraine's going to become a member of NATO. And during 2021, the United States three times signed

265
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:39,060
very high-level documents committing the U.S. to NATO enlargement to Ukraine.

266
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:46,420
On December, and then Putin masked troops on the border and put forward this draft document on

267
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:53,140
December 17th. He thought I think that would lead to negotiations. I called the White House

268
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,860
a week, two weeks after that, spoke to senior official at length. I said, negotiate. Avoid a war.

269
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:10,100
Negotiate. It's not even a concession not to expand NATO. It's common sense not to expand NATO.

270
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,740
And I was told, no, no, no, we'll never negotiate over that. So Putin thought that that would work.

271
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:26,900
It failed. So he launched the invasion on February 24th. What was he expecting then?

272
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:35,300
My view is he was expecting a quick negotiation. Why do I surmise that? Because three weeks later,

273
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:42,020
there was a quick negotiation. Three weeks later, Zelensky said, we don't have to be part of NATO.

274
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:51,860
We can be neutral. Go look it up, ladies and gentlemen. That was Putin's idea. Okay. We've shown

275
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:59,780
we need business. Now we'll have a negotiated outcome based on neutrality. But the U.S. called

276
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:07,460
that bluff, said no way we tell our client you don't negotiate, which is exactly what happened.

277
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:15,540
So they called the bluff. And that with sanctions and us doubling down, Putin will back off.

278
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:23,140
No, Putin mobilized in the summer of 2021. 300,000 more people. He called the bluff.

279
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:34,740
Okay, we'll send tanks and F-16s. We'll call the bluff. Come on. All of us have been in sixth grade.

280
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,500
That's what we're witnessing, except they're playing with nuclear weapons.

281
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:51,940
This is clear. By the way, not only clear, at least to me, I said exactly this to U.S. officials

282
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,300
all through this process, because for a while they would even talk to me.

283
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:09,220
Because I know them. I've been around. And I said, this is deep for Russia.

284
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,740
And by the way, all of our best diplomats have said the same thing for 30 years.

285
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:28,020
William Burns, who's very bright and now CIA director in 2008 was the U.S. ambassador to Russia.

286
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:39,460
He sent a famous memo. The memo is called, NET means NET. He explained that the entire Russian

287
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:48,660
political class is dead set against NATO enlargement to Ukraine. NET means NET. And he said it's no joke.

288
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,740
But of course, American politicians don't listen to this.

289
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:06,740
Bill Perry, our defense secretary, said don't expand NATO. George Kennan said in 2007,

290
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:17,700
no, excuse me, 1997, that this is going to lead to disaster. You can look it up in the

291
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:25,460
New York Times. It's on the website. This is all predictable. They behave like kids,

292
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Raytheon lobbies for more sales. All the think tanks in Washington are gung-ho for

293
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:45,380
U.S. unilateral prerogatives. Every article in Foreign Affairs magazine is about what they call

294
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:52,180
U.S. primacy. So it's all about how can we stay number one? As an economist, it's not even a

295
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,780
question I ask. By the way, a question an economist asks is how can we have a win-win

296
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,860
economy of trade? But if you're a strategist, it's who's on top. That's what counts.

297
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:13,860
To me, it's back to sixth grade. But for them, each side's calling each other's bluff.

298
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:24,100
So where's the miscalculation? Both sides. The only absolute disastrous loser is Ukraine in this.

299
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:32,500
And Ukraine had one president who was trying delicately to avoid being engulfed in a proxy war,

300
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,380
and that was Yanukovych, and he was overthrown.

301
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:44,740
I have a couple of more questions before we move on to the current A. Three more questions about.

302
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:53,300
Just to respond, of course, the Western perception is different. So the Western perception is that

303
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:02,980
Putin abroad wore block-sinking and arms race back to Europe. But it seems that the rest is

304
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:09,620
more than willing to accept this Putin's reality as a new norm. We have this key word,

305
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:19,620
zeitnwende. So it seems to be an agreement that they meet on a much lower level. The higher

306
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:28,340
values like multilateralism, interdependence, arms control, they all give them up also by the best.

307
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:37,460
So it seems that Putin won this narrative. Now we're in a different world. Whoever is responsible,

308
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,940
but everybody plays the same game.

309
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:55,380
The very sad thing for me in watching this is how Europe lost its identity as a political union

310
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:07,460
to become part of NATO. It's something ununderstandable for me, the equation of the EU and NATO.

311
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:16,100
And the fact that President von der Leyen is campaigning to leave the presidency

312
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:24,260
of the European Commission to become head of NATO is an example of how utterly bizarre

313
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:40,500
the situation is. So I'm a professor of sustainable development, and that means that I study

314
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:51,380
not only income levels, but quality of life, health, and many other dimensions of life.

315
00:44:51,700 --> 00:45:02,100
I also publish as a co-editor, founding co-editor of an annual report called the World Happiness

316
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:11,220
Report, which uses data collected by Gallup International to assess the subjective assessment

317
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:19,140
of life in more than 150 countries. The reason I mention all of this is Europe has by far

318
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:26,820
the highest living standards on the planet, by far, the highest quality of life, by far,

319
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:37,860
and is most attuned of any region in the world to reducing inequalities, to green transformation,

320
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:45,940
to doing the things we should be doing in the 21st century. That's Europe's vocation,

321
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:56,660
a continent of peace, sustainable development, social equity. That's the genius of the OSCE,

322
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:06,580
that that Europe extends all the way to the Urals. I was advisor to President Gorbachev,

323
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:13,540
I knew President Gorbachev. He believed in a common European home, not as some pernicious

324
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,700
gimmick, because he really believed in it. And he was a great man of peace,

325
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,900
probably the greatest statesman of our age. And the United States could not understand him.

326
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:36,740
They could not take yes for an answer. He's offering peace. What's the trick? He's offering

327
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:45,460
peace. Oh, I get it, will be the unipolar world. He's offering to disband the militaries. I get it,

328
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:53,940
will extend NATO all the way to the Caucasus. That's the U.S. reaction to the greatest opportunity

329
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:11,700
we had for peace. Europe is losing its greatest achievements in this. Europe is not the junior

330
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:19,060
partner of the global hegemon. Europe doesn't even have the same values as the United States.

331
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:31,220
That's, by the way, literally, objectively, so. We're part of the crazy Anglo-Saxon world.

332
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:40,420
We're still with John Locke's libertarianism. We're still with, you don't have to help the poor,

333
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:48,980
there are burden on society. We have ideas that go back to 17th century Britain. And then we learned

334
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,220
what 19th century Britain, what global empire means and decided that that's what our vocation was.

335
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:08,580
Europe is so much better than what it is signing up for right now. This is extremely sad and extremely

336
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:19,940
dangerous. By the way, I understand Poland's sentiments. I was their main economic advisor.

337
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:29,780
I helped them cancel their debts in 1990 and 1991. I helped them stabilize their economy.

338
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,540
I was their biggest champion for becoming members of the European Union. By the way,

339
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,220
it wasn't even the Union then. It was the European community when I started the campaign.

340
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:49,460
I wrote their first reform program and I was told that the theme is the return to Europe.

341
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:56,340
That's the instruction I was given by Lech Volens' team. You write a plan for the economic return

342
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:05,780
to Europe. So I've seen all of this. I can understand their Russophobia. I don't accept it

343
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:13,540
as geopolitics or as clever or as an answer. I certainly understand it.

344
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:24,340
My wife was born in communist Czechoslovakia. I have no illusions about the hard attitudes,

345
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:34,260
but we have to think about how we're actually going to have a safe planet. This isn't about

346
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:42,980
sentiment only. It's about some knowledge of history, some ability to see the other point of

347
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:49,220
view, to understand the history, even to understand the history of the Cold War.

348
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:58,500
This country, as I emphasized, is a great lesson that is completely ignored, by the way,

349
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:05,300
as all the neutral states other than Austria abandon their neutrality with such enthusiasm.

350
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:16,100
Big mistake, but my point is, please, Europe is not NATO. Europe is not NATO.

351
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,100
And if you knew how crazy it is on the other side of the Atlantic, I'm trying to tell you.

352
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:30,500
They think that their biggest, important calling in the world is confrontation with China.

353
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:40,420
Is that what you want to sign up for right now? Don't. Don't do it. You have the best living

354
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:49,540
standards and the best values, I would say. Social democratic values, which even for the

355
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:55,300
non-social democratic parties permeate the idea that people shouldn't be taken care of,

356
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:01,140
that there should be social housing, that there should be public. We don't have universal health

357
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:09,860
coverage. You sign up for those values. I wouldn't recommend it. We don't have public values.

358
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:18,020
We have British, laissez-faire, Lockean, libertarian values. I don't recommend it,

359
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,700
by the way. It doesn't work very well. I live in an expensive neighborhood in New York

360
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:32,420
that is absolutely filled with beggars, filled with garbage that is not taken care of because

361
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:42,260
the public spaces don't work and now filled with shootings. Don't do it. And that is an approach

362
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,980
that is part of this, even as we're falling apart internally because we have a mass shooting

363
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:56,420
almost every day, it seems. Sometimes more. Even as this is happening, we're all about war.

364
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:06,980
And when we just had our debt negotiations, you know what the bipartisan agreement was?

365
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:13,300
That the social spending is capped, but the military spending is allowed to rise,

366
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:22,580
even though we're spending three times more than China. And even though we are spending

367
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:30,820
more than the next 10 countries in the world combined, and even though we have 800 military

368
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:39,300
bases overseas around the world, don't sign up for that. Europe is different from NATO.

369
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:52,100
But at the moment, it doesn't seem like that because, of course, you said Europe's vocation,

370
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,980
Europe's vocation is, of course, effective multilateralism. But what we are moving towards,

371
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:02,580
it's a polarization. So some call it a multi-polar world, but the multi-polar world

372
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:07,860
without multilateralism is very dangerous. We had multi-polar worlds before the first

373
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:18,420
and the second world war. So my question would be, how could multilateralism be regained?

374
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:24,340
So to combine it, should a European security system be constructed

375
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:32,820
with Russia, without Russia, or against Russia? Should Russia be integrated in a multilateral

376
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:41,060
world? And how would we do it? So you mentioned the OSCE, with the CEC of 75 being an example.

377
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:48,500
So how could a multilateral world without polarization or without too much polarization

378
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,260
look like? Do we have any models, ideas?

379
00:53:52,980 --> 00:54:04,740
I was very keen on the European Union enlargement and played a major role in it in the early years,

380
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:14,580
because I believe that neighbors should cooperate with each other. And so I really like the OSCE

381
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:22,420
framework. I think it's right, and I think it is proper for Europe to have a European

382
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:34,180
security arrangement. All over the world, the regions are divided internally. Typically cold

383
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:46,980
war divisions, often on a strategy, imperial U.S. strategy of impera et divide. So we want

384
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:55,060
division. The U.S. is stoking divisions in Northeast Asia. China, Japan is on our side.

385
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:02,980
I'm sorry, Japan and Korea are on our side. China is on the other side. We're forging a new

386
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:14,660
military alliance. AUKUS, as you know, which is Australia, U.S., U.K. for nuclear submarines

387
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:21,380
in Australia, just what we need, just what Australia needs.

388
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:33,700
What the solution is, each region should cooperate, and African Union should cooperate

389
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:41,060
internally. Europe should, of course, aim to include Russia. Of course, are you kidding?

390
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:47,380
How could it not be other than to fall under the nuclear threat day by day again?

391
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:57,300
So all of this cancel culture is mind-boggling in how wrong-headed it is. By the way, even

392
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:06,420
the New York Philharmonic canceled a Rachmaninov concert for May.

393
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:18,500
You can't even imagine how... I mean, I could never imagine how crude this is. This is high

394
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:26,740
culture. They can't figure out to play Rachmaninov and that that's okay. Or there were protests about

395
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:33,940
Tchaikovsky, about don't play Sleeping Beauty at Christmas time. Even here, it was an issue.

396
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:47,860
Please, what is more beautiful than Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty? Maybe a few Strauss-Waltzes also.

397
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:56,180
Okay, I would say that they're right up there, but we should not be behaving this way.

398
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:06,020
And the demonization makes nobody safe. It solves no problems. It puts everybody on a hair trigger,

399
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:18,100
and we are on a nuclear age. And so this is my basic idea is UN Charter and regional cooperation

400
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:26,340
and globally agreed goals, sustainable development goals, Paris Climate Agreement,

401
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:34,020
UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, the High Seas Treaty, the Kunming Montreal Biodiversity

402
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:40,340
Framework. In other words, let's actually take care of people and the planet.

403
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:49,620
Instead of the $2.2 trillion spent last year on military armaments, if we could get a bit of

404
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:56,900
that to get kids in school, we'd make a much better world for the hundreds of millions of

405
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:02,100
children who are not in school because their governments are too broke to be able to afford

406
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:10,420
high schools for them. So this is what we should be doing. We actually have globally agreed goals,

407
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:20,340
we have the OSCE, we have the means to do this. US politicians should not fly to Taiwan

408
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,940
and declare that we're going to defend Taiwan at all costs.

409
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:36,180
We had agreed 50 years ago to a one China policy, and that's the right policy. And China

410
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:45,380
believes in that because starting in 1839, the Western imperialist powers, followed by Japan,

411
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:54,180
tried to destroy China on several occasions, or to conquer China. So they're not too keen on that

412
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:02,900
happening again. I understand that. We should have some prudence. So we're not so far away from a

413
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:11,220
peaceful world because the vast majority of people in the world want it. And we don't really have,

414
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:20,420
China, by the way, is not aiming to take over the world. That's another long evening. I have gone

415
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:30,180
to China for 42 years, many times a year on many cases. It's the last thing in the world that I'm

416
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:40,500
worried about is China taking over the world. It's not even a category. In 2000 years of Chinese

417
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:50,340
statecraft, China has not launched one overseas war. 2000 years. The one that you could count is

418
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:59,060
when the Mongols controlled Beijing and launched an invasion of Japan in, I think, 1274, though I

419
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:06,020
may have the day wrong, and the Kamikaze wins, the typhoon defeated the Mongol fleet. Other than that,

420
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:13,140
never. You know, Britain and France fought with each other almost every year for a thousand years,

421
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:21,940
one way or another. But Japan and China never accept Japan invading China on three occasions,

422
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:29,300
never China invading Japan. So don't worry so much about China. Really don't.

423
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:36,020
Nice place, good food, fascinating culture. Go have a visit.

424
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:47,860
Before I ask you the very last question, I just want to add to your observation that was

425
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:54,740
China at the one and the last survey of the European Council on Foreign Relations,

426
01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:04,100
which is a transatlantic think tank. There was a poll asking citizens, not government,

427
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:12,500
citizens of the European Union, if it comes to a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan,

428
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:21,540
65% of Europeans would say 60 to 65% would say that other would stay neutral

429
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:29,380
instead of siding with China or even siding with the US. So European citizens might think

430
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:36,420
differently than the governments. But I cannot avoid asking this very last question now,

431
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:43,300
because we are sitting here as an American, and you also wrote a piece about the link between

432
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:54,660
war and debt. And debt is accumulating in the US, and in the US there will be elections next year.

433
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:05,940
So will the debt crisis have an impact on the decision to support Ukraine by the next government?

434
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:27,860
US politics is basically a plutocratic state where public policy has been taken over by

435
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:37,620
several powerful lobbies, each one devoted to its specific area. And they keep the control over

436
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:46,260
US policy through campaign contributions, because our election campaigns are funded by

437
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:53,300
billionaires and by corporate lobbies. And they cost about $15 billion now for an election cycle.

438
01:02:54,100 --> 01:03:02,580
And you may have seen George Soros yesterday said, I give my empire to my son. And the son said,

439
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:09,380
I'm going to fund the Democratic Party. Well, that's the billionaires that

440
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:16,580
he'll put in hundreds of millions of dollars, a billion dollars would not be surprising

441
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:23,860
in the 2024 election. And then there are other billionaires. And so what are the lobbies?

442
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:29,780
Wall Street controls financial policy. And our health lobby controls

443
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:41,940
our unbelievably expensive private so-called health system. And our ad lobby controls the

444
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:49,860
food industry with about 60% obesity or overweight in the United States.

445
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:58,180
Another huge, very serious public health crisis. And the military industrial complex

446
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:07,140
controls foreign policy, not just military policy, foreign policy. So we have perpetual war

447
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:17,700
and trillion dollar military budgets, 900 billion in the Pentagon budget, but there's a lot more.

448
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:22,420
There's the CIA, and there's Homeland Security, and there are many other categories,

449
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:29,620
Department of Energy with nuclear weapons and so on. It's maybe $1.2 trillion a year.

450
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:37,860
So that's on the spending side. On the revenue side, we have unanimous agreement among the

451
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:47,060
billionaires. Don't tax us. Very simple. So we have a low tax collection in the United States.

452
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:58,660
And this spending on the military, for example, which has cost about $6 trillion in the wars in

453
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:06,260
Iraq and Afghanistan and some of the other wars, $6 trillion. It's a lot, by the way,

454
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:16,980
starts to add up a little bit. And so our debt crisis comes from a broken political system.

455
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:24,660
It's not so interesting Democrats and Republicans, by the way. That's a little bit a children's game.

456
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:37,140
The oligarchy is, the plutocracy is both parties. And I lost interest in the

457
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:43,780
because it's basically a game that is below our intelligence.

458
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:50,100
And this is our problem. Now, we will have rising debt in the future.

459
01:05:51,780 --> 01:06:00,580
It's a big country, big economy. We can spend a lot on wars. There's been no public debate

460
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:08,980
for a moment on the $120 billion that has been spent so far. This has all been just bits and

461
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:15,540
pieces inside omnibus legislation. So we can't get a debate on anything because there is no debate.

462
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:22,820
There'll have to be another appropriation for Ukraine. They'll try to put it in a must pass

463
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:31,620
bill so that it's not really debated and can just be snuck in because there's no interest in asking

464
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:39,940
the American people anything about any of this. There's no attempt at deliberative democracy at all.

465
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:48,180
No debate at all. So the answer to the question is I'm not sure because there probably has to be

466
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:55,220
another vote, but they will try to make the vote so that nobody notices. And it's just part of some

467
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:01,220
omnibus legislation that funds social security, something or other. It's not won't be social

468
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:07,700
security, but it'll be something that has to pass and it'll just get through. That's how it's done

469
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:16,900
in general. If it came to an actual vote, it would probably be defeated. If there was actually a debate

470
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:23,540
in Congress, do we really want to spend another $50 or $100 billion on this,

471
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:31,220
it would probably lose. They know that, but they have the convenience of avoiding any kind of public debate.
