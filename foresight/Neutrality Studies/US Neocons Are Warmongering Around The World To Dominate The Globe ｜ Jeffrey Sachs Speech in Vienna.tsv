0	11780	Hello everybody, this is Pascal from Neutrality Studies and yesterday my dear friends from
11780	18620	Austria uploaded a video interview that they did live in Austria in Vienna with Jeffrey
18620	26760	Sachs and it is part of this big peace conference that was organized there, was done in conjunction
26760	34020	with my colleague Fritz Edlinger, who is the editor-in-chief of the Austrian magazine
34020	39260	International. A wonderful magazine, if you read German I highly recommend subscribing
39260	44020	to them and also subscribe to their YouTube channel, they do a fantastic job. The interview
44020	50000	with Dr. Sachs was done by my friend and colleague with whom I have published books together
51000	57660	Dr. Professor Heinz Gertner and I would just recommend you watch this one hour long
57660	63180	discussion between the two and all the explanation that Jeffrey Sachs gives. He's a fantastic
63180	71860	speaker and he views world politics and US politics very very clearly. Please enjoy.
71860	80140	So I wrote the war, Professor Sachs. We have several explanations here out there, so starting
80140	92940	from Putin's personality to imperial conquest, to more structural explanations like hegemonic
92940	101220	competition. So we have this range of explanations, so where would you stand? Is it personality
102180	110580	is it imperialism, is it more hegemonic competition, of Kate Barr competition, as we say, so that's
110580	116980	the first question. Great, thank you very much and I'm told to be very brief so that we can discuss
116980	123220	a lot, so I'll give somewhat brief answers because if I get going it's going to be a long evening for
123220	135660	you. I believe the war started nine years ago, not last year. I think it started in February 2014,
135660	144740	it started with the violent overthrow of President Yanukovych, which I attribute to a
144820	154220	significant extent to US participation in a regime change operation in Ukraine. And to my mind that
154220	165140	really was the trigger of this war, meaning that we are basically seeing a proxy war between the
165140	176100	United States and Russia, plus both sides of playing on the very aggravated ethnic divisions
176100	186420	within Ukraine. So Ukraine is a divided country, ethnically, historically, but that meant that
186420	195300	there was competition between the United States and Russia for control, for influence, even for
195300	206340	putting military bases and the US NATO alliance. And I view the lack of prudence by both sides, but
206340	213140	since I'm an American, I will focus on the lack of American prudence as being absolutely central
213140	221060	to this. If the United States had sense, and by the United States I don't mean the American people,
221060	226580	they're never asked about any of these things. This has nothing to do with the American people.
226580	236100	This is to do with a small group in Washington in power. You could call it the military industrial
236100	244980	complex, it's a fair name for it. They don't have prudence, and we are at war because of that lack
244980	251620	of prudence in my view. I don't think anything specific about Putin's personality plays any
252260	260820	important role in this. I don't think that this is some idea of recreating the Russian Empire.
260820	266420	By the way, we hear lots of things in the mainstream media, which to my mind are completely
266420	276740	unrecognizable regarding the truth. And just one more small point. I was advisor, economic advisor,
276740	283620	to President Gorbachev. I was economic advisor to President Yeltsin, and I was an economic advisor
283620	289380	to President Kuchma, the first president of independent Ukraine. I didn't choose sides,
290100	301060	I liked them both. There's no reason why this war needed to happen, but I'll focus because of being
301060	309540	an American on the lack of sense of the military industrial complex in the United States. And I
309540	318580	think that that was a major, major cause of this war. You said personality doesn't really play that
318580	326100	role. You mentioned NATO and probably its structural causes and such a monarchy competition.
326820	336100	And of course, Russia's perception is that Russia wanted to wall off NATO. So he was not really
337060	345300	successful because now NATO is everywhere. So NATO, Finland and Sweden are training NATO and
346580	353300	NATO troops are permanently deployed in Poland and the Baltic States. Right now we have a huge
353300	362580	military, NATO military maneuver in Germany and also Putin wanted to demilitarize Ukraine. And now
363540	372260	Ukraine is the most militarized country in Europe. Was Putin's decision a big geopolitical plunder?
374340	382020	Well, it's a big geopolitical tragedy. What happens from now still remains to be seen.
382740	392420	And let me be clear about the NATO issues. It's my, well, it's without doubt
395060	404820	the American plan to expand NATO to Ukraine already in the mid 1990s, well before there was Putin
405780	412180	as president. It is my understanding from a discussion with one of our leading historians
412820	422980	recently that the plan to expand NATO to Ukraine was made in 1992. Basically within weeks or months
422980	431620	of having promised Gorbachev that NATO would not move one inch eastward. So this is not something
431620	438500	new. It's not something about Putin. It's something that predates Putin. There's a fascinating
438500	445540	article by Zbigniew Brzezinski in Foreign Affairs magazine, which is our establishment foreign policy
445540	454740	magazine in 1997, where he spells out the timeline to NATO enlargement to Central Europe, Eastern
454740	465300	Europe, the Baltic States, and Ukraine almost precisely in 1997, because this was a U.S. plan
465300	472100	at the top levels. When an article was written like that, that's not just an opinion of an
472100	479700	author that's informing the elite opinion in the United States what the real plan is. So this was
479700	489780	in the works for decades, and the specific idea about NATO spelled out by Brzezinski, both in
490420	495860	Foreign Affairs and in a book called the Global Chess Board that he wrote in 1997,
496900	507780	is to surround Russia in the Black Sea region. This is out of the playbook of Britain and France
507780	517060	in 1853 to 1856. It's almost reliving the Crimean War. The idea of the Crimean War was that
517060	527780	Palmerston wanted to kick Russia out of the Black Sea. Brzezinski had a similar idea in the mid-1990s.
527780	537380	The U.S. Neoconservatives had a similar idea back to 1992. If Ukraine and Georgia become NATO members,
537780	546340	if you look at the map, you see that Russia is surrounded by Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey,
546340	554020	and Georgia. Even the idea of expanding NATO to Georgia, to me, is the giveaway.
555700	562420	Last time I checked, Georgia is not a North Atlantic country. It's in the Caucasus.
563380	575700	What in heaven's name is NATO doing in Georgia? This is where things really went awry.
577220	583940	It is official U.S. doctrine. It's surprisingly official, by the way, because you can find it
583940	591220	in many, many documents, that the U.S. goal is to be the dominant power in all parts of the world.
592420	599300	To my mind, no thanks. It doesn't make me feel any safer. It just means endless wars,
599940	606660	when 4.1 percent of the world population presumes that it's going to dominate the world.
607220	614100	But this, I believe, was part of U.S. foreign policy at the core already for decades.
614660	620180	And NATO enlargement is part of this. There's something particular about Ukraine.
620180	628420	It is 2,000 kilometers of border with Russia. It is, from Russia's point of view,
628980	637780	a direct security risk to Russia. I would take the same view as a Russian. I would take the
637780	644260	same view as an American vis-a-vis Russia. I actually don't want Mexico to have a military
644340	649380	alliance with China. I don't want Mexico to have a military alliance with Russia.
649940	655060	And I don't want the United States to have a military alliance with Ukraine for the same
655060	664820	reasons. It doesn't make the world safer. If NATO expansion was one of the main
665700	673380	causes for the decision by Russia to invade Ukraine, because, of course, of the
674500	679860	fear that it might be a similar situation as we had with the Cuban Missile Crisis in
680980	689380	1962, that NATO missiles would be deployed there. However, there have been several
690100	699380	proposals since 2008. There was the Bucharest Summit when NATO promised
701540	710180	Ukraine and Georgia would become NATO members, but not later than 2014 for a neutrality
711460	717540	of Ukraine. So neutrality defined no NATO membership, but at the same time,
717540	728740	the withdrawal of Russian-supported militias in the east. So it could have a neutral Ukraine
730020	738660	avoided the war. Why was it discarded? Of course, since 2019, we know that Ukraine has
739380	745780	the NATO membership in its constitution. Before 2008, there was some fourth and back
745780	752820	independence neutrality NATO membership, but not later than 2005 NATO membership was an
752820	763620	aspiration by Ukraine. So if Ukraine would have defended or presented a credible neutrality,
763620	771860	could the war have been avoided? Of course, it could have. And Austria's history is
772660	780420	a glorious demonstration of the success of neutrality. Austria was not threatened
781140	789300	in the years from 1955 onward by being a non-NATO neutral country. Austria regained its sovereignty
789300	798660	and the Soviet Union went home. And incidentally, the Soviet Union went home in 1955 because
799620	806820	not only was the state treaty signed in the Belvedere agreed and the neutrality
807780	814740	declared by the parliament of this country, but also the Soviet Union was saying to the United
814740	823620	States, do this for Germany and the Cold War ends. Make Germany neutral. What is this NATO
823700	830340	business? This is a threat to us. Germany claimed 20 million lives of our citizens.
830340	840900	Why are you re-arming Germany? And our greatest statesman practitioner of the day, one of our
840900	849460	great historian diplomats in modern history, George Kennan, said at that moment, use the Austrian
849460	857220	example, have a neutral Germany, and tell the Soviet Union, go home out of Central Europe,
857220	864740	out of Eastern Europe. Now you don't need that buffer zone because Germany is neutral. The United
864740	871780	States would have nothing of it. The United States has never believed in it. You were lucky,
871780	879140	they weren't paying attention. But for Germany, no way. We were going to have NATO.
879940	888020	The end of the 1950s, Eisenhower even said, give them nuclear weapons. That's okay. And that is why
888900	894420	in a series of horrible events, we nearly arrived at nuclear armageddon with the Cuban
894420	902740	missile crisis, the United States has a very hard time thinking through the eyes of anyone else.
903300	911140	And when I say U.S., I'm meaning literally a small group of a few hundred people. I'm not
911140	919940	speaking about the American people. They're not told anything about this. And just as a footnote,
919940	932580	I've tried to explain the role of NATO in this to the New York Times. And they will not print
932580	944020	anything on this. They've written 26 editorials since February 24, 2022, that this is an unprovoked
944020	950740	war. I called them. I wrote to them. I said, I've advised all these leaders, these countries. I've
950740	960580	been through this for three decades. Can you give me 700 words? The answer is no. There's a complete
961940	969460	unwillingness to have any discussion about this. Because if you do, you're put on Ukraine's Black
969460	977780	list and you're put on America's no show list in the mainstream media. It's really quite something.
979620	986340	One more thing that's worth everybody understanding. This is not about Democrats and Republicans.
986980	997460	This is not at all about partisan politics. Biden is no different from so many other presidents.
997460	1001780	It's not this one's crazy. This one's not crazy. They're all a little bit.
1003540	1013540	But this is about really state policy in the deepest structure in Washington.
1014100	1021300	And it's the Armed Services Committees. It's the very 900 billion dollar military budgets.
1021300	1028100	You have to test your weapons. Believe me, you need wars not so infrequently. You have to be ready.
1028100	1035140	You have to teach China a lesson in the in the minds of this small group. This war is as much
1035140	1043620	about China as it is about anything else. Isn't that surprising? It's hard to think the way they think.
1043940	1052100	But you cannot actually discuss this in the United States right now, in the mainstream.
1052100	1058100	Of course, there are a thousand outlets to discuss things, but not in the Washington Post,
1058100	1064660	the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, MSNBC, CNN. Forget it.
1064740	1074740	Let's do a step, Professor. You mentioned Austria and compared it to Germany.
1074740	1083060	Austria was lucky, maybe prudent, as you say, to get its permanent neutrality. Germany was
1083060	1092020	permanently divided for several decades. So we know this from history that wars
1092020	1098660	and where the armies stand. So and then you always have a division of territory.
1098660	1107940	So we know this from the end of the Cold War. In Tehran, 1943, they decided to build the blocks
1107940	1114180	where basically the armies after the Second World War were deployed. Now we have a situation
1114980	1124660	in a little bit and sort of Iron Curtain, a little bit more east. So we have an Iron Curtain from the
1124660	1134500	Arctic. Finland, Sweden is joining NATO. And this Iron Curtain is going right through Ukraine
1134500	1143540	down to the Black Sea. Do you see for Ukraine now a permanent division like for Germany or for
1143540	1152100	Korea? Or do we see a permanent war since I guess permanent neutrality is not the option anymore
1152820	1162260	for Ukraine? I would say we don't know what the options are because there has been no diplomacy
1162260	1170260	between the United States and Russia since this war began. As far as I know, President Biden
1170820	1179620	and President Putin have not spoken one time since February 24, 2022. I find that worse than
1179620	1185300	school children, by the way. It's hard for me to understand how the world can be at the brink of
1185300	1192900	nuclear war. And I could send them a link if they want so they could get on Zoom. I could even give
1192980	1202580	them a phone call. I'd lend them my phone. It's not so hard. But they don't talk. This is somehow
1202580	1211220	sophisticated. This is absolutely mind-boggling. Of course, you need to talk. You need to understand
1211220	1220900	the other side. Maybe you won't agree. More likely you'll find a modus vivendi or modus operandi to
1221860	1230900	get beyond this. It could be, in the end, many things could be. So I don't have a prediction.
1231540	1238500	Ukraine could be divided. We could have nuclear war. We could have Ukraine be neutral.
1239300	1244980	And Russia go home from most of Ukraine, though I don't think it's going to leave Crimea
1245620	1253380	for a lot of reasons now. But lots of things could happen. We should understand that in December
1253380	1265300	2021, the idea that Russia would annex the Donbas wasn't mentioned once. What Russia wanted
1265300	1272980	was that the Minsk-2 agreements would be honored. Now, that's quite interesting. The Minsk-2 agreements
1275780	1284900	declared that there would be autonomy for the Lugansk and Donetsk, for Eastern Ukraine,
1284900	1294820	the Russian dominant ethnic group, signed by Ukraine, and voted 15 to nothing by the U.N.
1294820	1303220	Security Council and guaranteed by France and Germany. Do you know what my Ukrainian friends,
1303940	1310660	they don't regard me as a friend anymore. But what they tell me, of course we'd never honor that
1312340	1320500	as if it's a joke. And then when Russia says, well, this was not honored, we say, ah,
1320500	1326180	what difference? Russia doesn't believe in diplomacy. And now the sentence that I just uttered
1326180	1333460	proves that I'm a Putin lover. You know, in other words, we're in a cycle of bizarre arguments.
1334180	1341460	The truth is actually rather straightforward. The United States participated in the overthrow
1341460	1350100	of Yanukovych. A Russophobic government came to power. They immediately declared the intention,
1350100	1358900	immediately means within 2014 to join NATO. Arms shipments from the United States accelerated.
1359700	1370500	The Minsk agreements were signed. The Ukrainian government ignored them. Chancellor Merkel
1370500	1376100	explained afterwards, she explained to us last year, that she ignored them completely.
1377060	1387540	In 2021, December 17, President Putin put on the table a draft U.S.-Russia
1388100	1398500	security agreement, which had two major points that Putin was emphasizing. One is that the
1398500	1405620	Minsk agreement should be carried out. And the second was that NATO would not enlarge.
1406980	1412580	And the United States said, we don't negotiate with you over those things.
1414180	1420660	And it's NATO doctrine. What we do is no third country's business.
1421300	1433540	As if Castro said, what business is it of you, United States, just before we invaded in the Bay
1433540	1440980	of Pigs and also nearly had the world blown up over the Cuban Missile Crisis. If the tables
1440980	1447540	are turned just a little bit, believe me, the explosion that you would hear of any of the
1447540	1455700	claims that the United States makes. So that kind of hypocrisy and arrogance also is very grating
1456420	1463860	on most of the rest of the world. We make wars when we want. We can invade Afghanistan. We can
1463860	1471940	invade Iraq. We can try to overthrow Assad and have no doubt that was not a civil war. That was a
1471940	1477860	U.S. regime change operation signed by the President of the United States to the CIA called
1477860	1485860	Operation Timber Sycamore. We can overthrow Gaddafi with the NATO in the end of 2011. We
1485860	1491700	can overthrow Yanukovych. We can do what we want. Why are you complaining? We are a peace-loving
1491700	1500980	defensive alliance. And so this doesn't work. And this is why we don't know what can happen,
1500980	1510260	because I keep claiming, I'll claim it again, President Biden did what a U.S. president should
1510260	1521380	do, first picked up the phone or hit the Zoom button and talked to his counterpart and said,
1521380	1525940	you go home and we won't fill in the void with NATO.
1529220	1537940	Lots of good things could happen. So I don't rule out anything, but it takes two to make a
1537940	1548020	negotiation. Incidentally, one more point, sorry to run on, in March 2022, Russia and Ukraine
1548020	1558660	negotiated an end to the war. Did you know that? They negotiated. What happened? What happened?
1559860	1565460	Excuse me? No, that's not what happened. Okay. Butcha may or may not have happened,
1565460	1569620	but that's not what happened at the negotiating table. What happened at the negotiating table
1569620	1574420	was the United States told them, don't negotiate. That's what the United States told them.
1575220	1582500	This is now from multiple directions clear. And if you want to hear a very interesting
1582500	1589220	description of this that shows how bizarre this is, Naftali Bennett, who was then Prime
1589220	1597140	Minister of Israel and an informal mediator, said we were in the seventh draft and they were just
1597140	1603460	about reaching an agreement. And then the United States stopped it. And he said, I don't think
1603460	1610820	they should have stopped it, but they thought it was important about China. Are you kidding?
1611460	1619060	It takes a certain imagination to think that way. But that's what happened. And I've heard that from
1619060	1628660	all sides. So this is really not beyond our reach to have a negotiated outcome to this,
1629620	1637220	not at all beyond our reach. Let me push a little bit on this. On the one hand, you're saying
1639140	1644580	all options are possible. So you don't know what. But on the other hand, you're saying,
1645540	1653940	diplomacy does not really work now anymore. So what are the real end result here? So
1654020	1662900	Karl of Klausowitz, he said, war always pushes to the extremes unless there's a peace agreement
1663460	1671140	or a total defeat of the adversary. Neither of these options are inside at the moment.
1671700	1679620	So fighting continues. What are these extremes when it comes on? No diplomacy decision made on
1679700	1689140	the battlefield. Would it creep to an open, all out war? Is this a possibility, including maybe
1689140	1699140	nuclear weapons? There are many theories of what's going to happen on the battlefield. But before I
1699140	1711380	get to them, just to say that Klausowitz's most famous observation I think applies here perfectly,
1712020	1718340	which is that war is the continuation of politics with other means. This is political issues that
1718340	1726100	we're talking about here, which means that there is a way to resolve these issues politically,
1726100	1734260	not militarily. That's key. If this was the delusions of a madman, this would be different.
1734260	1741220	But this is politics. It's politics about Ukraine and it's politics about NATO. And so this is
1741220	1750420	susceptible of a negotiated outcome. I would not give up on that at all. Now, what could happen,
1751060	1757540	many things could happen. The one thing that cannot happen, in my opinion, is that Russia is
1757540	1767700	defeated. And the reason is that if Russia were to lose in a conventional sense, I believe Russia
1767700	1776020	would likely escalate to nuclear war. Because my understanding of this issue is that Russia views
1776020	1785300	this issue as existential for Russia, not as haphazard and not as a flight of fancy, not as a
1785300	1792740	dream world of Peter the Great, not as recreating the Russian Empire, but as an existential threat
1792740	1804500	to Russia. Whether it is or is not, it's viewed that way. And Putin is hardly the hardest of the
1804500	1812900	hardliners in Russia, by the way. There are many who resent the fact that he has not escalated
1813540	1823780	much harder and much faster, which is within Russia's means. So one possibility is that Russia
1823780	1830740	wins on the battlefield in the next months. This could really happen, incidentally, because
1830980	1842260	in a war of attrition, a much, much larger and powerful country has a propensity to win. And
1842980	1850500	because apparently, although I'm no expert on this, it is said that NATO stockpiles, including U.S.
1850500	1859620	stockpiles, are running very low. That scaling up of U.S. military production will take years. And
1859620	1868260	that even an article in Politico, which is a kind of right wing daily in the United States,
1868260	1875460	said the Pentagon is freaking out over the depleted reserves because our real war is with China,
1875460	1884260	they say. So it's really possible that Russia has a significant victory on the battlefield.
1884980	1892500	Okay, that could mean all sorts of things. It could mean NATO escalation in which we ratchet
1892500	1900980	things further. Or it could mean that there's some negotiation or frozen lines or armistice or
1900980	1907140	Ukraine divided in two or something else. Okay, that's one possibility. Another possibility is that
1907140	1914340	Ukraine wins significantly in this counteroffensive. Although, actually, I won't say, although
1915060	1923060	suppose that it did, is Russia going to say, oh, we made a mistake, we go home? I doubt it.
1923620	1932020	I think Russia would escalate further. And Russia has 1,600 deployed nuclear weapons,
1932020	1940740	including tactical nuclear weapons. I'm told every day, oh, don't be blackmailed
1941780	1950740	by nuclear weapons. People who say that have no idea of the history of the nuclear age. If you're
1950740	1960580	not terrified of gambling with that, you don't know the history. I'm terrified of it. So if Russia
1960580	1971380	were to be losing in a conventional war, I'd be, I would be terrified right now of what would come
1971380	1978900	next. And the idea that we had a story last week in the Washington Post, by the way, which said,
1979620	1989300	Biden, I don't, I'm paraphrasing, has decided he can ignore more and more of Putin's red lines.
1990580	1999700	Because so far, it's all been bluff. My God, the best book about the Cuban missile crisis ever
1999700	2007540	written was a book called Gambling with Armageddon. That's what they're doing. And I know the people
2007540	2015540	doing the gambling. You wouldn't want to bet the world on them, by the way. I know them personally.
2016500	2026180	Don't bet the world on them. So this is where we are. Lots of things are possible. But one thing
2026180	2033780	that is absolutely possible is that Biden picks up the phone and says, you know, we should consider
2034500	2041300	a way to end this thing without blowing up the world with you going home and with NATO not
2041300	2048820	enlarging. That's what I would like to see. You said nuclear weapons. Of course, Russia might
2049860	2056980	use or might threaten with nuclear weapons. But at the moment, it doesn't really seem that Russia
2056980	2064980	will have a decisive victory on the battlefield. So wasn't the Russian miscalculation in the first
2065460	2071540	place? So he did not, Russia did not increase military spending decisively before the war.
2072180	2080340	All other imperial powers did in the history. Russia did not. He invaded Ukraine with 180,000
2080340	2092500	soldiers. Compared to the US, the US deployed 800,000 soldiers in 1992 in Kuwait, to liberate
2092500	2103540	Kuwait. Kuwait is 40 times smaller than Ukraine. So wasn't it a military miscalculation by Putin
2103540	2109060	in the first place? And now the last option, what remains are the nuclear weapons. Was this not
2109700	2117380	a dangerous gambling on the side of Putin as well? Aren't we just witnessing a game of chicken
2117380	2123300	on both sides? Isn't that what we're doing? That each side thinks they can bluff the other,
2123860	2130420	and each side calls the bluff of the other. The United States thought that they could get rid of
2130420	2141220	Yanukovych. No consequence. That's what the US thought. It's had, the US has overthrown dozens
2141220	2149940	of governments. It's really a bad habit. They forgot diplomacy. What they learned, they think,
2149940	2154980	learned it from the British, by the way, that if you don't like your counterpart, overthrow them.
2155940	2160500	So you forget that there's diplomacy. You don't have to deal with them. You have to subvert them.
2161220	2166980	So they thought that they could overthrow Yanukovych. No consequence. Putin grabbed Crimea,
2166980	2179140	like he told George Bush, he would. And the Russian parts of the Ukrainian army broke away
2179140	2186500	in eastern Ukraine, took the weapons with them, and started the People's Republics of
2187300	2194180	Donetsk and Lugansk. And by the way, OSCE observers and NATO observers say this was not
2194180	2200420	Russian weapons coming in. I wasn't there. It said this was Ukrainian weapons taken from within
2200420	2216100	the Ukrainian army to create these two breakaway regions. That led to the Minsk agreements. Putin
2216100	2223460	thought maybe that will be the way that this will stop. There will be autonomy for these two regions,
2223540	2234020	Crimea will be ours. That would have probably stopped this war. But Minsk wasn't honored.
2234900	2243540	When President Biden came in, Putin said, stop. Stop. And Biden said, no, why stop?
2245300	2252340	Ukraine's going to become a member of NATO. And during 2021, the United States three times signed
2252980	2259060	very high-level documents committing the U.S. to NATO enlargement to Ukraine.
2259940	2266420	On December, and then Putin masked troops on the border and put forward this draft document on
2266420	2273140	December 17th. He thought I think that would lead to negotiations. I called the White House
2274580	2281860	a week, two weeks after that, spoke to senior official at length. I said, negotiate. Avoid a war.
2281860	2290100	Negotiate. It's not even a concession not to expand NATO. It's common sense not to expand NATO.
2290900	2296740	And I was told, no, no, no, we'll never negotiate over that. So Putin thought that that would work.
2297860	2306900	It failed. So he launched the invasion on February 24th. What was he expecting then?
2307620	2315300	My view is he was expecting a quick negotiation. Why do I surmise that? Because three weeks later,
2315300	2322020	there was a quick negotiation. Three weeks later, Zelensky said, we don't have to be part of NATO.
2322900	2331860	We can be neutral. Go look it up, ladies and gentlemen. That was Putin's idea. Okay. We've shown
2332580	2339780	we need business. Now we'll have a negotiated outcome based on neutrality. But the U.S. called
2339780	2347460	that bluff, said no way we tell our client you don't negotiate, which is exactly what happened.
2348020	2355540	So they called the bluff. And that with sanctions and us doubling down, Putin will back off.
2355540	2363140	No, Putin mobilized in the summer of 2021. 300,000 more people. He called the bluff.
2365620	2374740	Okay, we'll send tanks and F-16s. We'll call the bluff. Come on. All of us have been in sixth grade.
2376100	2380500	That's what we're witnessing, except they're playing with nuclear weapons.
2380500	2391940	This is clear. By the way, not only clear, at least to me, I said exactly this to U.S. officials
2393700	2399300	all through this process, because for a while they would even talk to me.
2400500	2409220	Because I know them. I've been around. And I said, this is deep for Russia.
2410500	2416740	And by the way, all of our best diplomats have said the same thing for 30 years.
2417860	2428020	William Burns, who's very bright and now CIA director in 2008 was the U.S. ambassador to Russia.
2428900	2439460	He sent a famous memo. The memo is called, NET means NET. He explained that the entire Russian
2439540	2448660	political class is dead set against NATO enlargement to Ukraine. NET means NET. And he said it's no joke.
2450500	2454740	But of course, American politicians don't listen to this.
2457140	2466740	Bill Perry, our defense secretary, said don't expand NATO. George Kennan said in 2007,
2467700	2477700	no, excuse me, 1997, that this is going to lead to disaster. You can look it up in the
2477700	2485460	New York Times. It's on the website. This is all predictable. They behave like kids,
2486420	2494260	Raytheon lobbies for more sales. All the think tanks in Washington are gung-ho for
2497220	2505380	U.S. unilateral prerogatives. Every article in Foreign Affairs magazine is about what they call
2505380	2512180	U.S. primacy. So it's all about how can we stay number one? As an economist, it's not even a
2512180	2517780	question I ask. By the way, a question an economist asks is how can we have a win-win
2518420	2523860	economy of trade? But if you're a strategist, it's who's on top. That's what counts.
2525220	2533860	To me, it's back to sixth grade. But for them, each side's calling each other's bluff.
2534660	2544100	So where's the miscalculation? Both sides. The only absolute disastrous loser is Ukraine in this.
2544980	2552500	And Ukraine had one president who was trying delicately to avoid being engulfed in a proxy war,
2552500	2555380	and that was Yanukovych, and he was overthrown.
2555860	2564740	I have a couple of more questions before we move on to the current A. Three more questions about.
2566420	2573300	Just to respond, of course, the Western perception is different. So the Western perception is that
2573300	2582980	Putin abroad wore block-sinking and arms race back to Europe. But it seems that the rest is
2582980	2589620	more than willing to accept this Putin's reality as a new norm. We have this key word,
2589620	2599620	zeitnwende. So it seems to be an agreement that they meet on a much lower level. The higher
2599620	2608340	values like multilateralism, interdependence, arms control, they all give them up also by the best.
2608340	2617460	So it seems that Putin won this narrative. Now we're in a different world. Whoever is responsible,
2618020	2619940	but everybody plays the same game.
2623860	2635380	The very sad thing for me in watching this is how Europe lost its identity as a political union
2635940	2647460	to become part of NATO. It's something ununderstandable for me, the equation of the EU and NATO.
2648340	2656100	And the fact that President von der Leyen is campaigning to leave the presidency
2656740	2664260	of the European Commission to become head of NATO is an example of how utterly bizarre
2665460	2680500	the situation is. So I'm a professor of sustainable development, and that means that I study
2682180	2691380	not only income levels, but quality of life, health, and many other dimensions of life.
2691700	2702100	I also publish as a co-editor, founding co-editor of an annual report called the World Happiness
2702100	2711220	Report, which uses data collected by Gallup International to assess the subjective assessment
2711220	2719140	of life in more than 150 countries. The reason I mention all of this is Europe has by far
2719860	2726820	the highest living standards on the planet, by far, the highest quality of life, by far,
2727860	2737860	and is most attuned of any region in the world to reducing inequalities, to green transformation,
2738740	2745940	to doing the things we should be doing in the 21st century. That's Europe's vocation,
2746020	2756660	a continent of peace, sustainable development, social equity. That's the genius of the OSCE,
2758100	2766580	that that Europe extends all the way to the Urals. I was advisor to President Gorbachev,
2766580	2773540	I knew President Gorbachev. He believed in a common European home, not as some pernicious
2773700	2779700	gimmick, because he really believed in it. And he was a great man of peace,
2781780	2788900	probably the greatest statesman of our age. And the United States could not understand him.
2789860	2796740	They could not take yes for an answer. He's offering peace. What's the trick? He's offering
2796820	2805460	peace. Oh, I get it, will be the unipolar world. He's offering to disband the militaries. I get it,
2805460	2813940	will extend NATO all the way to the Caucasus. That's the U.S. reaction to the greatest opportunity
2813940	2831700	we had for peace. Europe is losing its greatest achievements in this. Europe is not the junior
2831700	2839060	partner of the global hegemon. Europe doesn't even have the same values as the United States.
2839940	2851220	That's, by the way, literally, objectively, so. We're part of the crazy Anglo-Saxon world.
2852580	2860420	We're still with John Locke's libertarianism. We're still with, you don't have to help the poor,
2860420	2868980	there are burden on society. We have ideas that go back to 17th century Britain. And then we learned
2869700	2875220	what 19th century Britain, what global empire means and decided that that's what our vocation was.
2876180	2888580	Europe is so much better than what it is signing up for right now. This is extremely sad and extremely
2888580	2899940	dangerous. By the way, I understand Poland's sentiments. I was their main economic advisor.
2901300	2909780	I helped them cancel their debts in 1990 and 1991. I helped them stabilize their economy.
2909780	2915540	I was their biggest champion for becoming members of the European Union. By the way,
2915540	2921220	it wasn't even the Union then. It was the European community when I started the campaign.
2922420	2929460	I wrote their first reform program and I was told that the theme is the return to Europe.
2929460	2936340	That's the instruction I was given by Lech Volens' team. You write a plan for the economic return
2936340	2945780	to Europe. So I've seen all of this. I can understand their Russophobia. I don't accept it
2946420	2953540	as geopolitics or as clever or as an answer. I certainly understand it.
2955060	2964340	My wife was born in communist Czechoslovakia. I have no illusions about the hard attitudes,
2965060	2974260	but we have to think about how we're actually going to have a safe planet. This isn't about
2974820	2982980	sentiment only. It's about some knowledge of history, some ability to see the other point of
2982980	2989220	view, to understand the history, even to understand the history of the Cold War.
2990100	2998500	This country, as I emphasized, is a great lesson that is completely ignored, by the way,
2998500	3005300	as all the neutral states other than Austria abandon their neutrality with such enthusiasm.
3006740	3016100	Big mistake, but my point is, please, Europe is not NATO. Europe is not NATO.
3016500	3022100	And if you knew how crazy it is on the other side of the Atlantic, I'm trying to tell you.
3024260	3030500	They think that their biggest, important calling in the world is confrontation with China.
3030500	3040420	Is that what you want to sign up for right now? Don't. Don't do it. You have the best living
3041300	3049540	standards and the best values, I would say. Social democratic values, which even for the
3049540	3055300	non-social democratic parties permeate the idea that people shouldn't be taken care of,
3055300	3061140	that there should be social housing, that there should be public. We don't have universal health
3061140	3069860	coverage. You sign up for those values. I wouldn't recommend it. We don't have public values.
3069860	3078020	We have British, laissez-faire, Lockean, libertarian values. I don't recommend it,
3078020	3083700	by the way. It doesn't work very well. I live in an expensive neighborhood in New York
3084580	3092420	that is absolutely filled with beggars, filled with garbage that is not taken care of because
3092500	3102260	the public spaces don't work and now filled with shootings. Don't do it. And that is an approach
3102980	3108980	that is part of this, even as we're falling apart internally because we have a mass shooting
3108980	3116420	almost every day, it seems. Sometimes more. Even as this is happening, we're all about war.
3116660	3126980	And when we just had our debt negotiations, you know what the bipartisan agreement was?
3127860	3133300	That the social spending is capped, but the military spending is allowed to rise,
3134580	3142580	even though we're spending three times more than China. And even though we are spending
3142580	3150820	more than the next 10 countries in the world combined, and even though we have 800 military
3150820	3159300	bases overseas around the world, don't sign up for that. Europe is different from NATO.
3160100	3172100	But at the moment, it doesn't seem like that because, of course, you said Europe's vocation,
3172100	3176980	Europe's vocation is, of course, effective multilateralism. But what we are moving towards,
3176980	3182580	it's a polarization. So some call it a multi-polar world, but the multi-polar world
3182580	3187860	without multilateralism is very dangerous. We had multi-polar worlds before the first
3188740	3198420	and the second world war. So my question would be, how could multilateralism be regained?
3198980	3204340	So to combine it, should a European security system be constructed
3205860	3212820	with Russia, without Russia, or against Russia? Should Russia be integrated in a multilateral
3213460	3221060	world? And how would we do it? So you mentioned the OSCE, with the CEC of 75 being an example.
3221060	3228500	So how could a multilateral world without polarization or without too much polarization
3229460	3232260	look like? Do we have any models, ideas?
3232980	3244740	I was very keen on the European Union enlargement and played a major role in it in the early years,
3244740	3254580	because I believe that neighbors should cooperate with each other. And so I really like the OSCE
3255060	3262420	framework. I think it's right, and I think it is proper for Europe to have a European
3262420	3274180	security arrangement. All over the world, the regions are divided internally. Typically cold
3274180	3286980	war divisions, often on a strategy, imperial U.S. strategy of impera et divide. So we want
3286980	3295060	division. The U.S. is stoking divisions in Northeast Asia. China, Japan is on our side.
3295700	3302980	I'm sorry, Japan and Korea are on our side. China is on the other side. We're forging a new
3304900	3314660	military alliance. AUKUS, as you know, which is Australia, U.S., U.K. for nuclear submarines
3315380	3321380	in Australia, just what we need, just what Australia needs.
3324100	3333700	What the solution is, each region should cooperate, and African Union should cooperate
3333700	3341060	internally. Europe should, of course, aim to include Russia. Of course, are you kidding?
3341060	3347380	How could it not be other than to fall under the nuclear threat day by day again?
3348260	3357300	So all of this cancel culture is mind-boggling in how wrong-headed it is. By the way, even
3357300	3366420	the New York Philharmonic canceled a Rachmaninov concert for May.
3370100	3378500	You can't even imagine how... I mean, I could never imagine how crude this is. This is high
3378500	3386740	culture. They can't figure out to play Rachmaninov and that that's okay. Or there were protests about
3386740	3393940	Tchaikovsky, about don't play Sleeping Beauty at Christmas time. Even here, it was an issue.
3397780	3407860	Please, what is more beautiful than Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty? Maybe a few Strauss-Waltzes also.
3408580	3416180	Okay, I would say that they're right up there, but we should not be behaving this way.
3417300	3426020	And the demonization makes nobody safe. It solves no problems. It puts everybody on a hair trigger,
3426020	3438100	and we are on a nuclear age. And so this is my basic idea is UN Charter and regional cooperation
3439140	3446340	and globally agreed goals, sustainable development goals, Paris Climate Agreement,
3447060	3454020	UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, the High Seas Treaty, the Kunming Montreal Biodiversity
3454020	3460340	Framework. In other words, let's actually take care of people and the planet.
3461620	3469620	Instead of the $2.2 trillion spent last year on military armaments, if we could get a bit of
3469620	3476900	that to get kids in school, we'd make a much better world for the hundreds of millions of
3476900	3482100	children who are not in school because their governments are too broke to be able to afford
3482100	3490420	high schools for them. So this is what we should be doing. We actually have globally agreed goals,
3490420	3500340	we have the OSCE, we have the means to do this. US politicians should not fly to Taiwan
3501860	3505940	and declare that we're going to defend Taiwan at all costs.
3506740	3516180	We had agreed 50 years ago to a one China policy, and that's the right policy. And China
3516180	3525380	believes in that because starting in 1839, the Western imperialist powers, followed by Japan,
3525380	3534180	tried to destroy China on several occasions, or to conquer China. So they're not too keen on that
3535140	3542900	happening again. I understand that. We should have some prudence. So we're not so far away from a
3542900	3551220	peaceful world because the vast majority of people in the world want it. And we don't really have,
3551860	3560420	China, by the way, is not aiming to take over the world. That's another long evening. I have gone
3560500	3570180	to China for 42 years, many times a year on many cases. It's the last thing in the world that I'm
3570180	3580500	worried about is China taking over the world. It's not even a category. In 2000 years of Chinese
3580500	3590340	statecraft, China has not launched one overseas war. 2000 years. The one that you could count is
3590340	3599060	when the Mongols controlled Beijing and launched an invasion of Japan in, I think, 1274, though I
3599060	3606020	may have the day wrong, and the Kamikaze wins, the typhoon defeated the Mongol fleet. Other than that,
3606660	3613140	never. You know, Britain and France fought with each other almost every year for a thousand years,
3613140	3621940	one way or another. But Japan and China never accept Japan invading China on three occasions,
3622900	3629300	never China invading Japan. So don't worry so much about China. Really don't.
3629540	3636020	Nice place, good food, fascinating culture. Go have a visit.
3641060	3647860	Before I ask you the very last question, I just want to add to your observation that was
3648580	3654740	China at the one and the last survey of the European Council on Foreign Relations,
3654740	3664100	which is a transatlantic think tank. There was a poll asking citizens, not government,
3664100	3672500	citizens of the European Union, if it comes to a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan,
3674820	3681540	65% of Europeans would say 60 to 65% would say that other would stay neutral
3682340	3689380	instead of siding with China or even siding with the US. So European citizens might think
3689380	3696420	differently than the governments. But I cannot avoid asking this very last question now,
3696420	3703300	because we are sitting here as an American, and you also wrote a piece about the link between
3704100	3714660	war and debt. And debt is accumulating in the US, and in the US there will be elections next year.
3715460	3725940	So will the debt crisis have an impact on the decision to support Ukraine by the next government?
3733620	3747860	US politics is basically a plutocratic state where public policy has been taken over by
3749380	3757620	several powerful lobbies, each one devoted to its specific area. And they keep the control over
3757620	3766260	US policy through campaign contributions, because our election campaigns are funded by
3766260	3773300	billionaires and by corporate lobbies. And they cost about $15 billion now for an election cycle.
3774100	3782580	And you may have seen George Soros yesterday said, I give my empire to my son. And the son said,
3782580	3789380	I'm going to fund the Democratic Party. Well, that's the billionaires that
3790740	3796580	he'll put in hundreds of millions of dollars, a billion dollars would not be surprising
3797540	3803860	in the 2024 election. And then there are other billionaires. And so what are the lobbies?
3803860	3809780	Wall Street controls financial policy. And our health lobby controls
3812500	3821940	our unbelievably expensive private so-called health system. And our ad lobby controls the
3822740	3829860	food industry with about 60% obesity or overweight in the United States.
3830660	3838180	Another huge, very serious public health crisis. And the military industrial complex
3838180	3847140	controls foreign policy, not just military policy, foreign policy. So we have perpetual war
3847940	3857700	and trillion dollar military budgets, 900 billion in the Pentagon budget, but there's a lot more.
3857700	3862420	There's the CIA, and there's Homeland Security, and there are many other categories,
3862420	3869620	Department of Energy with nuclear weapons and so on. It's maybe $1.2 trillion a year.
3869620	3877860	So that's on the spending side. On the revenue side, we have unanimous agreement among the
3877860	3887060	billionaires. Don't tax us. Very simple. So we have a low tax collection in the United States.
3887780	3898660	And this spending on the military, for example, which has cost about $6 trillion in the wars in
3898660	3906260	Iraq and Afghanistan and some of the other wars, $6 trillion. It's a lot, by the way,
3907700	3916980	starts to add up a little bit. And so our debt crisis comes from a broken political system.
3918660	3924660	It's not so interesting Democrats and Republicans, by the way. That's a little bit a children's game.
3925940	3937140	The oligarchy is, the plutocracy is both parties. And I lost interest in the
3939940	3943780	because it's basically a game that is below our intelligence.
3944260	3950100	And this is our problem. Now, we will have rising debt in the future.
3951780	3960580	It's a big country, big economy. We can spend a lot on wars. There's been no public debate
3961620	3968980	for a moment on the $120 billion that has been spent so far. This has all been just bits and
3968980	3975540	pieces inside omnibus legislation. So we can't get a debate on anything because there is no debate.
3976660	3982820	There'll have to be another appropriation for Ukraine. They'll try to put it in a must pass
3982820	3991620	bill so that it's not really debated and can just be snuck in because there's no interest in asking
3991620	3999940	the American people anything about any of this. There's no attempt at deliberative democracy at all.
4000980	4008180	No debate at all. So the answer to the question is I'm not sure because there probably has to be
4008180	4015220	another vote, but they will try to make the vote so that nobody notices. And it's just part of some
4015300	4021220	omnibus legislation that funds social security, something or other. It's not won't be social
4021220	4027700	security, but it'll be something that has to pass and it'll just get through. That's how it's done
4027700	4036900	in general. If it came to an actual vote, it would probably be defeated. If there was actually a debate
4037700	4043540	in Congress, do we really want to spend another $50 or $100 billion on this,
4043540	4051220	it would probably lose. They know that, but they have the convenience of avoiding any kind of public debate.
