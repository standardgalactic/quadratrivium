Hello everybody, this is Pascal from Neutrality Studies and yesterday my dear friends from

00:11.780 --> 00:18.620
Austria uploaded a video interview that they did live in Austria in Vienna with Jeffrey

00:18.620 --> 00:26.760
Sachs and it is part of this big peace conference that was organized there, was done in conjunction

00:26.760 --> 00:34.020
with my colleague Fritz Edlinger, who is the editor-in-chief of the Austrian magazine

00:34.020 --> 00:39.260
International. A wonderful magazine, if you read German I highly recommend subscribing

00:39.260 --> 00:44.020
to them and also subscribe to their YouTube channel, they do a fantastic job. The interview

00:44.020 --> 00:50.000
with Dr. Sachs was done by my friend and colleague with whom I have published books together

00:51.000 --> 00:57.660
Dr. Professor Heinz Gertner and I would just recommend you watch this one hour long

00:57.660 --> 01:03.180
discussion between the two and all the explanation that Jeffrey Sachs gives. He's a fantastic

01:03.180 --> 01:11.860
speaker and he views world politics and US politics very very clearly. Please enjoy.

01:11.860 --> 01:20.140
So I wrote the war, Professor Sachs. We have several explanations here out there, so starting

01:20.140 --> 01:32.940
from Putin's personality to imperial conquest, to more structural explanations like hegemonic

01:32.940 --> 01:41.220
competition. So we have this range of explanations, so where would you stand? Is it personality

01:42.180 --> 01:50.580
is it imperialism, is it more hegemonic competition, of Kate Barr competition, as we say, so that's

01:50.580 --> 01:56.980
the first question. Great, thank you very much and I'm told to be very brief so that we can discuss

01:56.980 --> 02:03.220
a lot, so I'll give somewhat brief answers because if I get going it's going to be a long evening for

02:03.220 --> 02:15.660
you. I believe the war started nine years ago, not last year. I think it started in February 2014,

02:15.660 --> 02:24.740
it started with the violent overthrow of President Yanukovych, which I attribute to a

02:24.820 --> 02:34.220
significant extent to US participation in a regime change operation in Ukraine. And to my mind that

02:34.220 --> 02:45.140
really was the trigger of this war, meaning that we are basically seeing a proxy war between the

02:45.140 --> 02:56.100
United States and Russia, plus both sides of playing on the very aggravated ethnic divisions

02:56.100 --> 03:06.420
within Ukraine. So Ukraine is a divided country, ethnically, historically, but that meant that

03:06.420 --> 03:15.300
there was competition between the United States and Russia for control, for influence, even for

03:15.300 --> 03:26.340
putting military bases and the US NATO alliance. And I view the lack of prudence by both sides, but

03:26.340 --> 03:33.140
since I'm an American, I will focus on the lack of American prudence as being absolutely central

03:33.140 --> 03:41.060
to this. If the United States had sense, and by the United States I don't mean the American people,

03:41.060 --> 03:46.580
they're never asked about any of these things. This has nothing to do with the American people.

03:46.580 --> 03:56.100
This is to do with a small group in Washington in power. You could call it the military industrial

03:56.100 --> 04:04.980
complex, it's a fair name for it. They don't have prudence, and we are at war because of that lack

04:04.980 --> 04:11.620
of prudence in my view. I don't think anything specific about Putin's personality plays any

04:12.260 --> 04:20.820
important role in this. I don't think that this is some idea of recreating the Russian Empire.

04:20.820 --> 04:26.420
By the way, we hear lots of things in the mainstream media, which to my mind are completely

04:26.420 --> 04:36.740
unrecognizable regarding the truth. And just one more small point. I was advisor, economic advisor,

04:36.740 --> 04:43.620
to President Gorbachev. I was economic advisor to President Yeltsin, and I was an economic advisor

04:43.620 --> 04:49.380
to President Kuchma, the first president of independent Ukraine. I didn't choose sides,

04:50.100 --> 05:01.060
I liked them both. There's no reason why this war needed to happen, but I'll focus because of being

05:01.060 --> 05:09.540
an American on the lack of sense of the military industrial complex in the United States. And I

05:09.540 --> 05:18.580
think that that was a major, major cause of this war. You said personality doesn't really play that

05:18.580 --> 05:26.100
role. You mentioned NATO and probably its structural causes and such a monarchy competition.

05:26.820 --> 05:36.100
And of course, Russia's perception is that Russia wanted to wall off NATO. So he was not really

05:37.060 --> 05:45.300
successful because now NATO is everywhere. So NATO, Finland and Sweden are training NATO and

05:46.580 --> 05:53.300
NATO troops are permanently deployed in Poland and the Baltic States. Right now we have a huge

05:53.300 --> 06:02.580
military, NATO military maneuver in Germany and also Putin wanted to demilitarize Ukraine. And now

06:03.540 --> 06:12.260
Ukraine is the most militarized country in Europe. Was Putin's decision a big geopolitical plunder?

06:14.340 --> 06:22.020
Well, it's a big geopolitical tragedy. What happens from now still remains to be seen.

06:22.740 --> 06:32.420
And let me be clear about the NATO issues. It's my, well, it's without doubt

06:35.060 --> 06:44.820
the American plan to expand NATO to Ukraine already in the mid 1990s, well before there was Putin

06:45.780 --> 06:52.180
as president. It is my understanding from a discussion with one of our leading historians

06:52.820 --> 07:02.980
recently that the plan to expand NATO to Ukraine was made in 1992. Basically within weeks or months

07:02.980 --> 07:11.620
of having promised Gorbachev that NATO would not move one inch eastward. So this is not something

07:11.620 --> 07:18.500
new. It's not something about Putin. It's something that predates Putin. There's a fascinating

07:18.500 --> 07:25.540
article by Zbigniew Brzezinski in Foreign Affairs magazine, which is our establishment foreign policy

07:25.540 --> 07:34.740
magazine in 1997, where he spells out the timeline to NATO enlargement to Central Europe, Eastern

07:34.740 --> 07:45.300
Europe, the Baltic States, and Ukraine almost precisely in 1997, because this was a U.S. plan

07:45.300 --> 07:52.100
at the top levels. When an article was written like that, that's not just an opinion of an

07:52.100 --> 07:59.700
author that's informing the elite opinion in the United States what the real plan is. So this was

07:59.700 --> 08:09.780
in the works for decades, and the specific idea about NATO spelled out by Brzezinski, both in

08:10.420 --> 08:15.860
Foreign Affairs and in a book called the Global Chess Board that he wrote in 1997,

08:16.900 --> 08:27.780
is to surround Russia in the Black Sea region. This is out of the playbook of Britain and France

08:27.780 --> 08:37.060
in 1853 to 1856. It's almost reliving the Crimean War. The idea of the Crimean War was that

08:37.060 --> 08:47.780
Palmerston wanted to kick Russia out of the Black Sea. Brzezinski had a similar idea in the mid-1990s.

08:47.780 --> 08:57.380
The U.S. Neoconservatives had a similar idea back to 1992. If Ukraine and Georgia become NATO members,

08:57.780 --> 09:06.340
if you look at the map, you see that Russia is surrounded by Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey,

09:06.340 --> 09:14.020
and Georgia. Even the idea of expanding NATO to Georgia, to me, is the giveaway.

09:15.700 --> 09:22.420
Last time I checked, Georgia is not a North Atlantic country. It's in the Caucasus.

09:23.380 --> 09:35.700
What in heaven's name is NATO doing in Georgia? This is where things really went awry.

09:37.220 --> 09:43.940
It is official U.S. doctrine. It's surprisingly official, by the way, because you can find it

09:43.940 --> 09:51.220
in many, many documents, that the U.S. goal is to be the dominant power in all parts of the world.

09:52.420 --> 09:59.300
To my mind, no thanks. It doesn't make me feel any safer. It just means endless wars,

09:59.940 --> 10:06.660
when 4.1 percent of the world population presumes that it's going to dominate the world.

10:07.220 --> 10:14.100
But this, I believe, was part of U.S. foreign policy at the core already for decades.

10:14.660 --> 10:20.180
And NATO enlargement is part of this. There's something particular about Ukraine.

10:20.180 --> 10:28.420
It is 2,000 kilometers of border with Russia. It is, from Russia's point of view,

10:28.980 --> 10:37.780
a direct security risk to Russia. I would take the same view as a Russian. I would take the

10:37.780 --> 10:44.260
same view as an American vis-a-vis Russia. I actually don't want Mexico to have a military

10:44.340 --> 10:49.380
alliance with China. I don't want Mexico to have a military alliance with Russia.

10:49.940 --> 10:55.060
And I don't want the United States to have a military alliance with Ukraine for the same

10:55.060 --> 11:04.820
reasons. It doesn't make the world safer. If NATO expansion was one of the main

11:05.700 --> 11:13.380
causes for the decision by Russia to invade Ukraine, because, of course, of the

11:14.500 --> 11:19.860
fear that it might be a similar situation as we had with the Cuban Missile Crisis in

11:20.980 --> 11:29.380
1962, that NATO missiles would be deployed there. However, there have been several

11:30.100 --> 11:39.380
proposals since 2008. There was the Bucharest Summit when NATO promised

11:41.540 --> 11:50.180
Ukraine and Georgia would become NATO members, but not later than 2014 for a neutrality

11:51.460 --> 11:57.540
of Ukraine. So neutrality defined no NATO membership, but at the same time,

11:57.540 --> 12:08.740
the withdrawal of Russian-supported militias in the east. So it could have a neutral Ukraine

12:10.020 --> 12:18.660
avoided the war. Why was it discarded? Of course, since 2019, we know that Ukraine has

12:19.380 --> 12:25.780
the NATO membership in its constitution. Before 2008, there was some fourth and back

12:25.780 --> 12:32.820
independence neutrality NATO membership, but not later than 2005 NATO membership was an

12:32.820 --> 12:43.620
aspiration by Ukraine. So if Ukraine would have defended or presented a credible neutrality,

12:43.620 --> 12:51.860
could the war have been avoided? Of course, it could have. And Austria's history is

12:52.660 --> 13:00.420
a glorious demonstration of the success of neutrality. Austria was not threatened

13:01.140 --> 13:09.300
in the years from 1955 onward by being a non-NATO neutral country. Austria regained its sovereignty

13:09.300 --> 13:18.660
and the Soviet Union went home. And incidentally, the Soviet Union went home in 1955 because

13:19.620 --> 13:26.820
not only was the state treaty signed in the Belvedere agreed and the neutrality

13:27.780 --> 13:34.740
declared by the parliament of this country, but also the Soviet Union was saying to the United

13:34.740 --> 13:43.620
States, do this for Germany and the Cold War ends. Make Germany neutral. What is this NATO

13:43.700 --> 13:50.340
business? This is a threat to us. Germany claimed 20 million lives of our citizens.

13:50.340 --> 14:00.900
Why are you re-arming Germany? And our greatest statesman practitioner of the day, one of our

14:00.900 --> 14:09.460
great historian diplomats in modern history, George Kennan, said at that moment, use the Austrian

14:09.460 --> 14:17.220
example, have a neutral Germany, and tell the Soviet Union, go home out of Central Europe,

14:17.220 --> 14:24.740
out of Eastern Europe. Now you don't need that buffer zone because Germany is neutral. The United

14:24.740 --> 14:31.780
States would have nothing of it. The United States has never believed in it. You were lucky,

14:31.780 --> 14:39.140
they weren't paying attention. But for Germany, no way. We were going to have NATO.

14:39.940 --> 14:48.020
The end of the 1950s, Eisenhower even said, give them nuclear weapons. That's okay. And that is why

14:48.900 --> 14:54.420
in a series of horrible events, we nearly arrived at nuclear armageddon with the Cuban

14:54.420 --> 15:02.740
missile crisis, the United States has a very hard time thinking through the eyes of anyone else.

15:03.300 --> 15:11.140
And when I say U.S., I'm meaning literally a small group of a few hundred people. I'm not

15:11.140 --> 15:19.940
speaking about the American people. They're not told anything about this. And just as a footnote,

15:19.940 --> 15:32.580
I've tried to explain the role of NATO in this to the New York Times. And they will not print

15:32.580 --> 15:44.020
anything on this. They've written 26 editorials since February 24, 2022, that this is an unprovoked

15:44.020 --> 15:50.740
war. I called them. I wrote to them. I said, I've advised all these leaders, these countries. I've

15:50.740 --> 16:00.580
been through this for three decades. Can you give me 700 words? The answer is no. There's a complete

16:01.940 --> 16:09.460
unwillingness to have any discussion about this. Because if you do, you're put on Ukraine's Black

16:09.460 --> 16:17.780
list and you're put on America's no show list in the mainstream media. It's really quite something.

16:19.620 --> 16:26.340
One more thing that's worth everybody understanding. This is not about Democrats and Republicans.

16:26.980 --> 16:37.460
This is not at all about partisan politics. Biden is no different from so many other presidents.

16:37.460 --> 16:41.780
It's not this one's crazy. This one's not crazy. They're all a little bit.

16:43.540 --> 16:53.540
But this is about really state policy in the deepest structure in Washington.

16:54.100 --> 17:01.300
And it's the Armed Services Committees. It's the very 900 billion dollar military budgets.

17:01.300 --> 17:08.100
You have to test your weapons. Believe me, you need wars not so infrequently. You have to be ready.

17:08.100 --> 17:15.140
You have to teach China a lesson in the in the minds of this small group. This war is as much

17:15.140 --> 17:23.620
about China as it is about anything else. Isn't that surprising? It's hard to think the way they think.

17:23.940 --> 17:32.100
But you cannot actually discuss this in the United States right now, in the mainstream.

17:32.100 --> 17:38.100
Of course, there are a thousand outlets to discuss things, but not in the Washington Post,

17:38.100 --> 17:44.660
the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, MSNBC, CNN. Forget it.

17:44.740 --> 17:54.740
Let's do a step, Professor. You mentioned Austria and compared it to Germany.

17:54.740 --> 18:03.060
Austria was lucky, maybe prudent, as you say, to get its permanent neutrality. Germany was

18:03.060 --> 18:12.020
permanently divided for several decades. So we know this from history that wars

18:12.020 --> 18:18.660
and where the armies stand. So and then you always have a division of territory.

18:18.660 --> 18:27.940
So we know this from the end of the Cold War. In Tehran, 1943, they decided to build the blocks

18:27.940 --> 18:34.180
where basically the armies after the Second World War were deployed. Now we have a situation

18:34.980 --> 18:44.660
in a little bit and sort of Iron Curtain, a little bit more east. So we have an Iron Curtain from the

18:44.660 --> 18:54.500
Arctic. Finland, Sweden is joining NATO. And this Iron Curtain is going right through Ukraine

18:54.500 --> 19:03.540
down to the Black Sea. Do you see for Ukraine now a permanent division like for Germany or for

19:03.540 --> 19:12.100
Korea? Or do we see a permanent war since I guess permanent neutrality is not the option anymore

19:12.820 --> 19:22.260
for Ukraine? I would say we don't know what the options are because there has been no diplomacy

19:22.260 --> 19:30.260
between the United States and Russia since this war began. As far as I know, President Biden

19:30.820 --> 19:39.620
and President Putin have not spoken one time since February 24, 2022. I find that worse than

19:39.620 --> 19:45.300
school children, by the way. It's hard for me to understand how the world can be at the brink of

19:45.300 --> 19:52.900
nuclear war. And I could send them a link if they want so they could get on Zoom. I could even give

19:52.980 --> 20:02.580
them a phone call. I'd lend them my phone. It's not so hard. But they don't talk. This is somehow

20:02.580 --> 20:11.220
sophisticated. This is absolutely mind-boggling. Of course, you need to talk. You need to understand

20:11.220 --> 20:20.900
the other side. Maybe you won't agree. More likely you'll find a modus vivendi or modus operandi to

20:21.860 --> 20:30.900
get beyond this. It could be, in the end, many things could be. So I don't have a prediction.

20:31.540 --> 20:38.500
Ukraine could be divided. We could have nuclear war. We could have Ukraine be neutral.

20:39.300 --> 20:44.980
And Russia go home from most of Ukraine, though I don't think it's going to leave Crimea

20:45.620 --> 20:53.380
for a lot of reasons now. But lots of things could happen. We should understand that in December

20:53.380 --> 21:05.300
2021, the idea that Russia would annex the Donbas wasn't mentioned once. What Russia wanted

21:05.300 --> 21:12.980
was that the Minsk-2 agreements would be honored. Now, that's quite interesting. The Minsk-2 agreements

21:15.780 --> 21:24.900
declared that there would be autonomy for the Lugansk and Donetsk, for Eastern Ukraine,

21:24.900 --> 21:34.820
the Russian dominant ethnic group, signed by Ukraine, and voted 15 to nothing by the U.N.

21:34.820 --> 21:43.220
Security Council and guaranteed by France and Germany. Do you know what my Ukrainian friends,

21:43.940 --> 21:50.660
they don't regard me as a friend anymore. But what they tell me, of course we'd never honor that

21:52.340 --> 22:00.500
as if it's a joke. And then when Russia says, well, this was not honored, we say, ah,

22:00.500 --> 22:06.180
what difference? Russia doesn't believe in diplomacy. And now the sentence that I just uttered

22:06.180 --> 22:13.460
proves that I'm a Putin lover. You know, in other words, we're in a cycle of bizarre arguments.

22:14.180 --> 22:21.460
The truth is actually rather straightforward. The United States participated in the overthrow

22:21.460 --> 22:30.100
of Yanukovych. A Russophobic government came to power. They immediately declared the intention,

22:30.100 --> 22:38.900
immediately means within 2014 to join NATO. Arms shipments from the United States accelerated.

22:39.700 --> 22:50.500
The Minsk agreements were signed. The Ukrainian government ignored them. Chancellor Merkel

22:50.500 --> 22:56.100
explained afterwards, she explained to us last year, that she ignored them completely.

22:57.060 --> 23:07.540
In 2021, December 17, President Putin put on the table a draft U.S.-Russia

23:08.100 --> 23:18.500
security agreement, which had two major points that Putin was emphasizing. One is that the

23:18.500 --> 23:25.620
Minsk agreement should be carried out. And the second was that NATO would not enlarge.

23:26.980 --> 23:32.580
And the United States said, we don't negotiate with you over those things.

23:34.180 --> 23:40.660
And it's NATO doctrine. What we do is no third country's business.

23:41.300 --> 23:53.540
As if Castro said, what business is it of you, United States, just before we invaded in the Bay

23:53.540 --> 24:00.980
of Pigs and also nearly had the world blown up over the Cuban Missile Crisis. If the tables

24:00.980 --> 24:07.540
are turned just a little bit, believe me, the explosion that you would hear of any of the

24:07.540 --> 24:15.700
claims that the United States makes. So that kind of hypocrisy and arrogance also is very grating

24:16.420 --> 24:23.860
on most of the rest of the world. We make wars when we want. We can invade Afghanistan. We can

24:23.860 --> 24:31.940
invade Iraq. We can try to overthrow Assad and have no doubt that was not a civil war. That was a

24:31.940 --> 24:37.860
U.S. regime change operation signed by the President of the United States to the CIA called

24:37.860 --> 24:45.860
Operation Timber Sycamore. We can overthrow Gaddafi with the NATO in the end of 2011. We

24:45.860 --> 24:51.700
can overthrow Yanukovych. We can do what we want. Why are you complaining? We are a peace-loving

24:51.700 --> 25:00.980
defensive alliance. And so this doesn't work. And this is why we don't know what can happen,

25:00.980 --> 25:10.260
because I keep claiming, I'll claim it again, President Biden did what a U.S. president should

25:10.260 --> 25:21.380
do, first picked up the phone or hit the Zoom button and talked to his counterpart and said,

25:21.380 --> 25:25.940
you go home and we won't fill in the void with NATO.

25:29.220 --> 25:37.940
Lots of good things could happen. So I don't rule out anything, but it takes two to make a

25:37.940 --> 25:48.020
negotiation. Incidentally, one more point, sorry to run on, in March 2022, Russia and Ukraine

25:48.020 --> 25:58.660
negotiated an end to the war. Did you know that? They negotiated. What happened? What happened?

25:59.860 --> 26:05.460
Excuse me? No, that's not what happened. Okay. Butcha may or may not have happened,

26:05.460 --> 26:09.620
but that's not what happened at the negotiating table. What happened at the negotiating table

26:09.620 --> 26:14.420
was the United States told them, don't negotiate. That's what the United States told them.

26:15.220 --> 26:22.500
This is now from multiple directions clear. And if you want to hear a very interesting

26:22.500 --> 26:29.220
description of this that shows how bizarre this is, Naftali Bennett, who was then Prime

26:29.220 --> 26:37.140
Minister of Israel and an informal mediator, said we were in the seventh draft and they were just

26:37.140 --> 26:43.460
about reaching an agreement. And then the United States stopped it. And he said, I don't think

26:43.460 --> 26:50.820
they should have stopped it, but they thought it was important about China. Are you kidding?

26:51.460 --> 26:59.060
It takes a certain imagination to think that way. But that's what happened. And I've heard that from

26:59.060 --> 27:08.660
all sides. So this is really not beyond our reach to have a negotiated outcome to this,

27:09.620 --> 27:17.220
not at all beyond our reach. Let me push a little bit on this. On the one hand, you're saying

27:19.140 --> 27:24.580
all options are possible. So you don't know what. But on the other hand, you're saying,

27:25.540 --> 27:33.940
diplomacy does not really work now anymore. So what are the real end result here? So

27:34.020 --> 27:42.900
Karl of Klausowitz, he said, war always pushes to the extremes unless there's a peace agreement

27:43.460 --> 27:51.140
or a total defeat of the adversary. Neither of these options are inside at the moment.

27:51.700 --> 27:59.620
So fighting continues. What are these extremes when it comes on? No diplomacy decision made on

27:59.700 --> 28:09.140
the battlefield. Would it creep to an open, all out war? Is this a possibility, including maybe

28:09.140 --> 28:19.140
nuclear weapons? There are many theories of what's going to happen on the battlefield. But before I

28:19.140 --> 28:31.380
get to them, just to say that Klausowitz's most famous observation I think applies here perfectly,

28:32.020 --> 28:38.340
which is that war is the continuation of politics with other means. This is political issues that

28:38.340 --> 28:46.100
we're talking about here, which means that there is a way to resolve these issues politically,

28:46.100 --> 28:54.260
not militarily. That's key. If this was the delusions of a madman, this would be different.

28:54.260 --> 29:01.220
But this is politics. It's politics about Ukraine and it's politics about NATO. And so this is

29:01.220 --> 29:10.420
susceptible of a negotiated outcome. I would not give up on that at all. Now, what could happen,

29:11.060 --> 29:17.540
many things could happen. The one thing that cannot happen, in my opinion, is that Russia is

29:17.540 --> 29:27.700
defeated. And the reason is that if Russia were to lose in a conventional sense, I believe Russia

29:27.700 --> 29:36.020
would likely escalate to nuclear war. Because my understanding of this issue is that Russia views

29:36.020 --> 29:45.300
this issue as existential for Russia, not as haphazard and not as a flight of fancy, not as a

29:45.300 --> 29:52.740
dream world of Peter the Great, not as recreating the Russian Empire, but as an existential threat

29:52.740 --> 30:04.500
to Russia. Whether it is or is not, it's viewed that way. And Putin is hardly the hardest of the

30:04.500 --> 30:12.900
hardliners in Russia, by the way. There are many who resent the fact that he has not escalated

30:13.540 --> 30:23.780
much harder and much faster, which is within Russia's means. So one possibility is that Russia

30:23.780 --> 30:30.740
wins on the battlefield in the next months. This could really happen, incidentally, because

30:30.980 --> 30:42.260
in a war of attrition, a much, much larger and powerful country has a propensity to win. And

30:42.980 --> 30:50.500
because apparently, although I'm no expert on this, it is said that NATO stockpiles, including U.S.

30:50.500 --> 30:59.620
stockpiles, are running very low. That scaling up of U.S. military production will take years. And

30:59.620 --> 31:08.260
that even an article in Politico, which is a kind of right wing daily in the United States,

31:08.260 --> 31:15.460
said the Pentagon is freaking out over the depleted reserves because our real war is with China,

31:15.460 --> 31:24.260
they say. So it's really possible that Russia has a significant victory on the battlefield.

31:24.980 --> 31:32.500
Okay, that could mean all sorts of things. It could mean NATO escalation in which we ratchet

31:32.500 --> 31:40.980
things further. Or it could mean that there's some negotiation or frozen lines or armistice or

31:40.980 --> 31:47.140
Ukraine divided in two or something else. Okay, that's one possibility. Another possibility is that

31:47.140 --> 31:54.340
Ukraine wins significantly in this counteroffensive. Although, actually, I won't say, although

31:55.060 --> 32:03.060
suppose that it did, is Russia going to say, oh, we made a mistake, we go home? I doubt it.

32:03.620 --> 32:12.020
I think Russia would escalate further. And Russia has 1,600 deployed nuclear weapons,

32:12.020 --> 32:20.740
including tactical nuclear weapons. I'm told every day, oh, don't be blackmailed

32:21.780 --> 32:30.740
by nuclear weapons. People who say that have no idea of the history of the nuclear age. If you're

32:30.740 --> 32:40.580
not terrified of gambling with that, you don't know the history. I'm terrified of it. So if Russia

32:40.580 --> 32:51.380
were to be losing in a conventional war, I'd be, I would be terrified right now of what would come

32:51.380 --> 32:58.900
next. And the idea that we had a story last week in the Washington Post, by the way, which said,

32:59.620 --> 33:09.300
Biden, I don't, I'm paraphrasing, has decided he can ignore more and more of Putin's red lines.

33:10.580 --> 33:19.700
Because so far, it's all been bluff. My God, the best book about the Cuban missile crisis ever

33:19.700 --> 33:27.540
written was a book called Gambling with Armageddon. That's what they're doing. And I know the people

33:27.540 --> 33:35.540
doing the gambling. You wouldn't want to bet the world on them, by the way. I know them personally.

33:36.500 --> 33:46.180
Don't bet the world on them. So this is where we are. Lots of things are possible. But one thing

33:46.180 --> 33:53.780
that is absolutely possible is that Biden picks up the phone and says, you know, we should consider

33:54.500 --> 34:01.300
a way to end this thing without blowing up the world with you going home and with NATO not

34:01.300 --> 34:08.820
enlarging. That's what I would like to see. You said nuclear weapons. Of course, Russia might

34:09.860 --> 34:16.980
use or might threaten with nuclear weapons. But at the moment, it doesn't really seem that Russia

34:16.980 --> 34:24.980
will have a decisive victory on the battlefield. So wasn't the Russian miscalculation in the first

34:25.460 --> 34:31.540
place? So he did not, Russia did not increase military spending decisively before the war.

34:32.180 --> 34:40.340
All other imperial powers did in the history. Russia did not. He invaded Ukraine with 180,000

34:40.340 --> 34:52.500
soldiers. Compared to the US, the US deployed 800,000 soldiers in 1992 in Kuwait, to liberate

34:52.500 --> 35:03.540
Kuwait. Kuwait is 40 times smaller than Ukraine. So wasn't it a military miscalculation by Putin

35:03.540 --> 35:09.060
in the first place? And now the last option, what remains are the nuclear weapons. Was this not

35:09.700 --> 35:17.380
a dangerous gambling on the side of Putin as well? Aren't we just witnessing a game of chicken

35:17.380 --> 35:23.300
on both sides? Isn't that what we're doing? That each side thinks they can bluff the other,

35:23.860 --> 35:30.420
and each side calls the bluff of the other. The United States thought that they could get rid of

35:30.420 --> 35:41.220
Yanukovych. No consequence. That's what the US thought. It's had, the US has overthrown dozens

35:41.220 --> 35:49.940
of governments. It's really a bad habit. They forgot diplomacy. What they learned, they think,

35:49.940 --> 35:54.980
learned it from the British, by the way, that if you don't like your counterpart, overthrow them.

35:55.940 --> 36:00.500
So you forget that there's diplomacy. You don't have to deal with them. You have to subvert them.

36:01.220 --> 36:06.980
So they thought that they could overthrow Yanukovych. No consequence. Putin grabbed Crimea,

36:06.980 --> 36:19.140
like he told George Bush, he would. And the Russian parts of the Ukrainian army broke away

36:19.140 --> 36:26.500
in eastern Ukraine, took the weapons with them, and started the People's Republics of

36:27.300 --> 36:34.180
Donetsk and Lugansk. And by the way, OSCE observers and NATO observers say this was not

36:34.180 --> 36:40.420
Russian weapons coming in. I wasn't there. It said this was Ukrainian weapons taken from within

36:40.420 --> 36:56.100
the Ukrainian army to create these two breakaway regions. That led to the Minsk agreements. Putin

36:56.100 --> 37:03.460
thought maybe that will be the way that this will stop. There will be autonomy for these two regions,

37:03.540 --> 37:14.020
Crimea will be ours. That would have probably stopped this war. But Minsk wasn't honored.

37:14.900 --> 37:23.540
When President Biden came in, Putin said, stop. Stop. And Biden said, no, why stop?

37:25.300 --> 37:32.340
Ukraine's going to become a member of NATO. And during 2021, the United States three times signed

37:32.980 --> 37:39.060
very high-level documents committing the U.S. to NATO enlargement to Ukraine.

37:39.940 --> 37:46.420
On December, and then Putin masked troops on the border and put forward this draft document on

37:46.420 --> 37:53.140
December 17th. He thought I think that would lead to negotiations. I called the White House

37:54.580 --> 38:01.860
a week, two weeks after that, spoke to senior official at length. I said, negotiate. Avoid a war.

38:01.860 --> 38:10.100
Negotiate. It's not even a concession not to expand NATO. It's common sense not to expand NATO.

38:10.900 --> 38:16.740
And I was told, no, no, no, we'll never negotiate over that. So Putin thought that that would work.

38:17.860 --> 38:26.900
It failed. So he launched the invasion on February 24th. What was he expecting then?

38:27.620 --> 38:35.300
My view is he was expecting a quick negotiation. Why do I surmise that? Because three weeks later,

38:35.300 --> 38:42.020
there was a quick negotiation. Three weeks later, Zelensky said, we don't have to be part of NATO.

38:42.900 --> 38:51.860
We can be neutral. Go look it up, ladies and gentlemen. That was Putin's idea. Okay. We've shown

38:52.580 --> 38:59.780
we need business. Now we'll have a negotiated outcome based on neutrality. But the U.S. called

38:59.780 --> 39:07.460
that bluff, said no way we tell our client you don't negotiate, which is exactly what happened.

39:08.020 --> 39:15.540
So they called the bluff. And that with sanctions and us doubling down, Putin will back off.

39:15.540 --> 39:23.140
No, Putin mobilized in the summer of 2021. 300,000 more people. He called the bluff.

39:25.620 --> 39:34.740
Okay, we'll send tanks and F-16s. We'll call the bluff. Come on. All of us have been in sixth grade.

39:36.100 --> 39:40.500
That's what we're witnessing, except they're playing with nuclear weapons.

39:40.500 --> 39:51.940
This is clear. By the way, not only clear, at least to me, I said exactly this to U.S. officials

39:53.700 --> 39:59.300
all through this process, because for a while they would even talk to me.

40:00.500 --> 40:09.220
Because I know them. I've been around. And I said, this is deep for Russia.

40:10.500 --> 40:16.740
And by the way, all of our best diplomats have said the same thing for 30 years.

40:17.860 --> 40:28.020
William Burns, who's very bright and now CIA director in 2008 was the U.S. ambassador to Russia.

40:28.900 --> 40:39.460
He sent a famous memo. The memo is called, NET means NET. He explained that the entire Russian

40:39.540 --> 40:48.660
political class is dead set against NATO enlargement to Ukraine. NET means NET. And he said it's no joke.

40:50.500 --> 40:54.740
But of course, American politicians don't listen to this.

40:57.140 --> 41:06.740
Bill Perry, our defense secretary, said don't expand NATO. George Kennan said in 2007,

41:07.700 --> 41:17.700
no, excuse me, 1997, that this is going to lead to disaster. You can look it up in the

41:17.700 --> 41:25.460
New York Times. It's on the website. This is all predictable. They behave like kids,

41:26.420 --> 41:34.260
Raytheon lobbies for more sales. All the think tanks in Washington are gung-ho for

41:37.220 --> 41:45.380
U.S. unilateral prerogatives. Every article in Foreign Affairs magazine is about what they call

41:45.380 --> 41:52.180
U.S. primacy. So it's all about how can we stay number one? As an economist, it's not even a

41:52.180 --> 41:57.780
question I ask. By the way, a question an economist asks is how can we have a win-win

41:58.420 --> 42:03.860
economy of trade? But if you're a strategist, it's who's on top. That's what counts.

42:05.220 --> 42:13.860
To me, it's back to sixth grade. But for them, each side's calling each other's bluff.

42:14.660 --> 42:24.100
So where's the miscalculation? Both sides. The only absolute disastrous loser is Ukraine in this.

42:24.980 --> 42:32.500
And Ukraine had one president who was trying delicately to avoid being engulfed in a proxy war,

42:32.500 --> 42:35.380
and that was Yanukovych, and he was overthrown.

42:35.860 --> 42:44.740
I have a couple of more questions before we move on to the current A. Three more questions about.

42:46.420 --> 42:53.300
Just to respond, of course, the Western perception is different. So the Western perception is that

42:53.300 --> 43:02.980
Putin abroad wore block-sinking and arms race back to Europe. But it seems that the rest is

43:02.980 --> 43:09.620
more than willing to accept this Putin's reality as a new norm. We have this key word,

43:09.620 --> 43:19.620
zeitnwende. So it seems to be an agreement that they meet on a much lower level. The higher

43:19.620 --> 43:28.340
values like multilateralism, interdependence, arms control, they all give them up also by the best.

43:28.340 --> 43:37.460
So it seems that Putin won this narrative. Now we're in a different world. Whoever is responsible,

43:38.020 --> 43:39.940
but everybody plays the same game.

43:43.860 --> 43:55.380
The very sad thing for me in watching this is how Europe lost its identity as a political union

43:55.940 --> 44:07.460
to become part of NATO. It's something ununderstandable for me, the equation of the EU and NATO.

44:08.340 --> 44:16.100
And the fact that President von der Leyen is campaigning to leave the presidency

44:16.740 --> 44:24.260
of the European Commission to become head of NATO is an example of how utterly bizarre

44:25.460 --> 44:40.500
the situation is. So I'm a professor of sustainable development, and that means that I study

44:42.180 --> 44:51.380
not only income levels, but quality of life, health, and many other dimensions of life.

44:51.700 --> 45:02.100
I also publish as a co-editor, founding co-editor of an annual report called the World Happiness

45:02.100 --> 45:11.220
Report, which uses data collected by Gallup International to assess the subjective assessment

45:11.220 --> 45:19.140
of life in more than 150 countries. The reason I mention all of this is Europe has by far

45:19.860 --> 45:26.820
the highest living standards on the planet, by far, the highest quality of life, by far,

45:27.860 --> 45:37.860
and is most attuned of any region in the world to reducing inequalities, to green transformation,

45:38.740 --> 45:45.940
to doing the things we should be doing in the 21st century. That's Europe's vocation,

45:46.020 --> 45:56.660
a continent of peace, sustainable development, social equity. That's the genius of the OSCE,

45:58.100 --> 46:06.580
that that Europe extends all the way to the Urals. I was advisor to President Gorbachev,

46:06.580 --> 46:13.540
I knew President Gorbachev. He believed in a common European home, not as some pernicious

46:13.700 --> 46:19.700
gimmick, because he really believed in it. And he was a great man of peace,

46:21.780 --> 46:28.900
probably the greatest statesman of our age. And the United States could not understand him.

46:29.860 --> 46:36.740
They could not take yes for an answer. He's offering peace. What's the trick? He's offering

46:36.820 --> 46:45.460
peace. Oh, I get it, will be the unipolar world. He's offering to disband the militaries. I get it,

46:45.460 --> 46:53.940
will extend NATO all the way to the Caucasus. That's the U.S. reaction to the greatest opportunity

46:53.940 --> 47:11.700
we had for peace. Europe is losing its greatest achievements in this. Europe is not the junior

47:11.700 --> 47:19.060
partner of the global hegemon. Europe doesn't even have the same values as the United States.

47:19.940 --> 47:31.220
That's, by the way, literally, objectively, so. We're part of the crazy Anglo-Saxon world.

47:32.580 --> 47:40.420
We're still with John Locke's libertarianism. We're still with, you don't have to help the poor,

47:40.420 --> 47:48.980
there are burden on society. We have ideas that go back to 17th century Britain. And then we learned

47:49.700 --> 47:55.220
what 19th century Britain, what global empire means and decided that that's what our vocation was.

47:56.180 --> 48:08.580
Europe is so much better than what it is signing up for right now. This is extremely sad and extremely

48:08.580 --> 48:19.940
dangerous. By the way, I understand Poland's sentiments. I was their main economic advisor.

48:21.300 --> 48:29.780
I helped them cancel their debts in 1990 and 1991. I helped them stabilize their economy.

48:29.780 --> 48:35.540
I was their biggest champion for becoming members of the European Union. By the way,

48:35.540 --> 48:41.220
it wasn't even the Union then. It was the European community when I started the campaign.

48:42.420 --> 48:49.460
I wrote their first reform program and I was told that the theme is the return to Europe.

48:49.460 --> 48:56.340
That's the instruction I was given by Lech Volens' team. You write a plan for the economic return

48:56.340 --> 49:05.780
to Europe. So I've seen all of this. I can understand their Russophobia. I don't accept it

49:06.420 --> 49:13.540
as geopolitics or as clever or as an answer. I certainly understand it.

49:15.060 --> 49:24.340
My wife was born in communist Czechoslovakia. I have no illusions about the hard attitudes,

49:25.060 --> 49:34.260
but we have to think about how we're actually going to have a safe planet. This isn't about

49:34.820 --> 49:42.980
sentiment only. It's about some knowledge of history, some ability to see the other point of

49:42.980 --> 49:49.220
view, to understand the history, even to understand the history of the Cold War.

49:50.100 --> 49:58.500
This country, as I emphasized, is a great lesson that is completely ignored, by the way,

49:58.500 --> 50:05.300
as all the neutral states other than Austria abandon their neutrality with such enthusiasm.

50:06.740 --> 50:16.100
Big mistake, but my point is, please, Europe is not NATO. Europe is not NATO.

50:16.500 --> 50:22.100
And if you knew how crazy it is on the other side of the Atlantic, I'm trying to tell you.

50:24.260 --> 50:30.500
They think that their biggest, important calling in the world is confrontation with China.

50:30.500 --> 50:40.420
Is that what you want to sign up for right now? Don't. Don't do it. You have the best living

50:41.300 --> 50:49.540
standards and the best values, I would say. Social democratic values, which even for the

50:49.540 --> 50:55.300
non-social democratic parties permeate the idea that people shouldn't be taken care of,

50:55.300 --> 51:01.140
that there should be social housing, that there should be public. We don't have universal health

51:01.140 --> 51:09.860
coverage. You sign up for those values. I wouldn't recommend it. We don't have public values.

51:09.860 --> 51:18.020
We have British, laissez-faire, Lockean, libertarian values. I don't recommend it,

51:18.020 --> 51:23.700
by the way. It doesn't work very well. I live in an expensive neighborhood in New York

51:24.580 --> 51:32.420
that is absolutely filled with beggars, filled with garbage that is not taken care of because

51:32.500 --> 51:42.260
the public spaces don't work and now filled with shootings. Don't do it. And that is an approach

51:42.980 --> 51:48.980
that is part of this, even as we're falling apart internally because we have a mass shooting

51:48.980 --> 51:56.420
almost every day, it seems. Sometimes more. Even as this is happening, we're all about war.

51:56.660 --> 52:06.980
And when we just had our debt negotiations, you know what the bipartisan agreement was?

52:07.860 --> 52:13.300
That the social spending is capped, but the military spending is allowed to rise,

52:14.580 --> 52:22.580
even though we're spending three times more than China. And even though we are spending

52:22.580 --> 52:30.820
more than the next 10 countries in the world combined, and even though we have 800 military

52:30.820 --> 52:39.300
bases overseas around the world, don't sign up for that. Europe is different from NATO.

52:40.100 --> 52:52.100
But at the moment, it doesn't seem like that because, of course, you said Europe's vocation,

52:52.100 --> 52:56.980
Europe's vocation is, of course, effective multilateralism. But what we are moving towards,

52:56.980 --> 53:02.580
it's a polarization. So some call it a multi-polar world, but the multi-polar world

53:02.580 --> 53:07.860
without multilateralism is very dangerous. We had multi-polar worlds before the first

53:08.740 --> 53:18.420
and the second world war. So my question would be, how could multilateralism be regained?

53:18.980 --> 53:24.340
So to combine it, should a European security system be constructed

53:25.860 --> 53:32.820
with Russia, without Russia, or against Russia? Should Russia be integrated in a multilateral

53:33.460 --> 53:41.060
world? And how would we do it? So you mentioned the OSCE, with the CEC of 75 being an example.

53:41.060 --> 53:48.500
So how could a multilateral world without polarization or without too much polarization

53:49.460 --> 53:52.260
look like? Do we have any models, ideas?

53:52.980 --> 54:04.740
I was very keen on the European Union enlargement and played a major role in it in the early years,

54:04.740 --> 54:14.580
because I believe that neighbors should cooperate with each other. And so I really like the OSCE

54:15.060 --> 54:22.420
framework. I think it's right, and I think it is proper for Europe to have a European

54:22.420 --> 54:34.180
security arrangement. All over the world, the regions are divided internally. Typically cold

54:34.180 --> 54:46.980
war divisions, often on a strategy, imperial U.S. strategy of impera et divide. So we want

54:46.980 --> 54:55.060
division. The U.S. is stoking divisions in Northeast Asia. China, Japan is on our side.

54:55.700 --> 55:02.980
I'm sorry, Japan and Korea are on our side. China is on the other side. We're forging a new

55:04.900 --> 55:14.660
military alliance. AUKUS, as you know, which is Australia, U.S., U.K. for nuclear submarines

55:15.380 --> 55:21.380
in Australia, just what we need, just what Australia needs.

55:24.100 --> 55:33.700
What the solution is, each region should cooperate, and African Union should cooperate

55:33.700 --> 55:41.060
internally. Europe should, of course, aim to include Russia. Of course, are you kidding?

55:41.060 --> 55:47.380
How could it not be other than to fall under the nuclear threat day by day again?

55:48.260 --> 55:57.300
So all of this cancel culture is mind-boggling in how wrong-headed it is. By the way, even

55:57.300 --> 56:06.420
the New York Philharmonic canceled a Rachmaninov concert for May.

56:10.100 --> 56:18.500
You can't even imagine how... I mean, I could never imagine how crude this is. This is high

56:18.500 --> 56:26.740
culture. They can't figure out to play Rachmaninov and that that's okay. Or there were protests about

56:26.740 --> 56:33.940
Tchaikovsky, about don't play Sleeping Beauty at Christmas time. Even here, it was an issue.

56:37.780 --> 56:47.860
Please, what is more beautiful than Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty? Maybe a few Strauss-Waltzes also.

56:48.580 --> 56:56.180
Okay, I would say that they're right up there, but we should not be behaving this way.

56:57.300 --> 57:06.020
And the demonization makes nobody safe. It solves no problems. It puts everybody on a hair trigger,

57:06.020 --> 57:18.100
and we are on a nuclear age. And so this is my basic idea is UN Charter and regional cooperation

57:19.140 --> 57:26.340
and globally agreed goals, sustainable development goals, Paris Climate Agreement,

57:27.060 --> 57:34.020
UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, the High Seas Treaty, the Kunming Montreal Biodiversity

57:34.020 --> 57:40.340
Framework. In other words, let's actually take care of people and the planet.

57:41.620 --> 57:49.620
Instead of the $2.2 trillion spent last year on military armaments, if we could get a bit of

57:49.620 --> 57:56.900
that to get kids in school, we'd make a much better world for the hundreds of millions of

57:56.900 --> 58:02.100
children who are not in school because their governments are too broke to be able to afford

58:02.100 --> 58:10.420
high schools for them. So this is what we should be doing. We actually have globally agreed goals,

58:10.420 --> 58:20.340
we have the OSCE, we have the means to do this. US politicians should not fly to Taiwan

58:21.860 --> 58:25.940
and declare that we're going to defend Taiwan at all costs.

58:26.740 --> 58:36.180
We had agreed 50 years ago to a one China policy, and that's the right policy. And China

58:36.180 --> 58:45.380
believes in that because starting in 1839, the Western imperialist powers, followed by Japan,

58:45.380 --> 58:54.180
tried to destroy China on several occasions, or to conquer China. So they're not too keen on that

58:55.140 --> 59:02.900
happening again. I understand that. We should have some prudence. So we're not so far away from a

59:02.900 --> 59:11.220
peaceful world because the vast majority of people in the world want it. And we don't really have,

59:11.860 --> 59:20.420
China, by the way, is not aiming to take over the world. That's another long evening. I have gone

59:20.500 --> 59:30.180
to China for 42 years, many times a year on many cases. It's the last thing in the world that I'm

59:30.180 --> 59:40.500
worried about is China taking over the world. It's not even a category. In 2000 years of Chinese

59:40.500 --> 59:50.340
statecraft, China has not launched one overseas war. 2000 years. The one that you could count is

59:50.340 --> 59:59.060
when the Mongols controlled Beijing and launched an invasion of Japan in, I think, 1274, though I

59:59.060 --> 01:00:06.020
may have the day wrong, and the Kamikaze wins, the typhoon defeated the Mongol fleet. Other than that,

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:13.140
never. You know, Britain and France fought with each other almost every year for a thousand years,

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:21.940
one way or another. But Japan and China never accept Japan invading China on three occasions,

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:29.300
never China invading Japan. So don't worry so much about China. Really don't.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:36.020
Nice place, good food, fascinating culture. Go have a visit.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:47.860
Before I ask you the very last question, I just want to add to your observation that was

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:54.740
China at the one and the last survey of the European Council on Foreign Relations,

01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:04.100
which is a transatlantic think tank. There was a poll asking citizens, not government,

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:12.500
citizens of the European Union, if it comes to a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan,

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:21.540
65% of Europeans would say 60 to 65% would say that other would stay neutral

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:29.380
instead of siding with China or even siding with the US. So European citizens might think

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:36.420
differently than the governments. But I cannot avoid asking this very last question now,

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:43.300
because we are sitting here as an American, and you also wrote a piece about the link between

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:54.660
war and debt. And debt is accumulating in the US, and in the US there will be elections next year.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:02:05.940
So will the debt crisis have an impact on the decision to support Ukraine by the next government?

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:27.860
US politics is basically a plutocratic state where public policy has been taken over by

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:37.620
several powerful lobbies, each one devoted to its specific area. And they keep the control over

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:46.260
US policy through campaign contributions, because our election campaigns are funded by

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:53.300
billionaires and by corporate lobbies. And they cost about $15 billion now for an election cycle.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:03:02.580
And you may have seen George Soros yesterday said, I give my empire to my son. And the son said,

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:09.380
I'm going to fund the Democratic Party. Well, that's the billionaires that

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:16.580
he'll put in hundreds of millions of dollars, a billion dollars would not be surprising

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:23.860
in the 2024 election. And then there are other billionaires. And so what are the lobbies?

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:29.780
Wall Street controls financial policy. And our health lobby controls

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:41.940
our unbelievably expensive private so-called health system. And our ad lobby controls the

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:49.860
food industry with about 60% obesity or overweight in the United States.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:58.180
Another huge, very serious public health crisis. And the military industrial complex

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:07.140
controls foreign policy, not just military policy, foreign policy. So we have perpetual war

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:17.700
and trillion dollar military budgets, 900 billion in the Pentagon budget, but there's a lot more.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.420
There's the CIA, and there's Homeland Security, and there are many other categories,

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:29.620
Department of Energy with nuclear weapons and so on. It's maybe $1.2 trillion a year.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:37.860
So that's on the spending side. On the revenue side, we have unanimous agreement among the

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:47.060
billionaires. Don't tax us. Very simple. So we have a low tax collection in the United States.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:58.660
And this spending on the military, for example, which has cost about $6 trillion in the wars in

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:06.260
Iraq and Afghanistan and some of the other wars, $6 trillion. It's a lot, by the way,

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:16.980
starts to add up a little bit. And so our debt crisis comes from a broken political system.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:24.660
It's not so interesting Democrats and Republicans, by the way. That's a little bit a children's game.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:37.140
The oligarchy is, the plutocracy is both parties. And I lost interest in the

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:43.780
because it's basically a game that is below our intelligence.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:50.100
And this is our problem. Now, we will have rising debt in the future.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:06:00.580
It's a big country, big economy. We can spend a lot on wars. There's been no public debate

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:08.980
for a moment on the $120 billion that has been spent so far. This has all been just bits and

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:15.540
pieces inside omnibus legislation. So we can't get a debate on anything because there is no debate.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:22.820
There'll have to be another appropriation for Ukraine. They'll try to put it in a must pass

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:31.620
bill so that it's not really debated and can just be snuck in because there's no interest in asking

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:39.940
the American people anything about any of this. There's no attempt at deliberative democracy at all.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:48.180
No debate at all. So the answer to the question is I'm not sure because there probably has to be

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:55.220
another vote, but they will try to make the vote so that nobody notices. And it's just part of some

01:06:55.300 --> 01:07:01.220
omnibus legislation that funds social security, something or other. It's not won't be social

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:07.700
security, but it'll be something that has to pass and it'll just get through. That's how it's done

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:16.900
in general. If it came to an actual vote, it would probably be defeated. If there was actually a debate

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:23.540
in Congress, do we really want to spend another $50 or $100 billion on this,

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:31.220
it would probably lose. They know that, but they have the convenience of avoiding any kind of public debate.
