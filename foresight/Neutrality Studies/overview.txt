1. In the event of a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan, European citizens may be more inclined to remain neutral rather than take sides.
2. The United States' political system is heavily influenced by powerful lobbies, including finance, health, advertising, and military industrial complexes, which control policies through substantial campaign contributions and have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
3. The U.S. has a significant debt crisis partly due to its large military expenditures, which have amounted to about $6 trillion in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan alone.
4. Tax collection in the United States is low, especially on billionaires, leading to budgetary challenges and reliance on debt.
5. The issue of further funding for Ukraine's defense against Russia will likely be bundled into a larger bill to avoid public debate and scrutiny, as there is little appetite among the political elite for such discussions with the American public.
6. While there may be resistance to additional spending on foreign aid if put to a direct vote, the political system is structured to circumvent such decisions through omnibus legislation, thereby avoiding transparent public deliberation.
