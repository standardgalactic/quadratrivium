Hello and thank you for watching this AutoHotKey tutorial for beginners. In this

00:05.320 --> 00:08.040
video we're going to cover a lot of different topics. We're going to start

00:08.040 --> 00:12.120
off discussing which versions of AutoHotKey to use, then we're going to

00:12.120 --> 00:15.960
cover which editor to use. There's a lot of different editors out there and I've

00:15.960 --> 00:19.400
tried a lot of them. The one I recommend is by far the easiest to start with.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.040
Then we're going to jump into doing some some little pre-work. We're going to use

00:23.040 --> 00:27.040
hotkeys which is actually a tool that you can use in AutoHotKey to launch

00:27.040 --> 00:30.520
programs and stuff, but we're going to first use them to work smarter, not

00:30.520 --> 00:34.160
harder. We're going to learn how to use them to edit our code and make it faster

00:34.160 --> 00:37.280
as we develop code. Then I'm going to show you how to launch programs and

00:37.280 --> 00:41.280
scripts and load a website with them. Then next we're going to jump into using

00:41.280 --> 00:45.040
hot strings. The hot string as you can think of is like a text expansion type

00:45.040 --> 00:48.680
thing. So you type a couple letters and bam there goes a lot of text whatever

00:48.680 --> 00:52.840
you want to put in there. After that I show you a script where there's about

00:53.280 --> 00:58.120
4,000 words in a spell check. What's great about AutoHotKey is any Windows

00:58.120 --> 01:01.480
program you're in you can have this script running and it will spell check

01:01.480 --> 01:05.240
across all your programs. It's another just a great example of hot strings. Then

01:05.240 --> 01:08.920
we switch back to using a few more hotkeys where we show you how to remap

01:08.920 --> 01:13.520
codes. Let's say you're using Outlook and you don't like a hotkey to launch a new

01:13.520 --> 01:16.680
email. I'll teach you how you can hit a different key combination and it will

01:16.680 --> 01:20.960
send the key combination that Outlook knows. It's a great way if you don't

01:21.000 --> 01:26.440
like the programs you're using to remap the keys. Then we work on how to send a

01:26.440 --> 01:29.480
mouse click to given coordinates. Of course first you have to understand you

01:29.480 --> 01:32.160
know identify where those coordinates are and then we send the mouse clicks

01:32.160 --> 01:36.040
there. Lastly we wrap up on the programming side of being able to

01:36.040 --> 01:38.920
compile a script and this is a really great thing about AutoHotKey. It's

01:38.920 --> 01:43.280
super super easy to compile a script and that way you can use it on a

01:43.280 --> 01:47.160
different computer where it doesn't have AutoHotKey installed or you can give it

01:47.160 --> 01:50.480
to a friend and they can write it on their Windows computer. At the very end of

01:50.480 --> 01:54.720
this script video I have a lot of resources where where to go when you

01:54.720 --> 01:57.840
get in trouble. A lot of great sources where you have live support where people

01:57.840 --> 02:01.000
are just willing to help you. The AutoHotKey community and forum the people

02:01.000 --> 02:05.640
are just great and very helpful. My site I have a lot of tutorials on them but

02:05.640 --> 02:09.400
this is places where you can go directly and get one-to-one help. In this

02:09.400 --> 02:12.760
video you'll notice I mentioned a lot of stuff. There's a lot of pop-ups with the

02:12.760 --> 02:16.040
actual links you know and hyperlinks of where you can go. Just make sure you

02:16.040 --> 02:19.160
check in the description down below because I'm going to put in the time

02:19.200 --> 02:22.840
codes of exactly in the video when it was and the URL there is too. So you don't

02:22.840 --> 02:26.680
have to try to type the URLs right so make sure you wait for that and I

02:26.680 --> 02:29.440
really appreciate you watching this video. Please like it if you think it

02:29.440 --> 02:33.640
really helped you. I spent quite a bit of time on this video to make sure that it

02:33.640 --> 02:38.080
really helps new people so I hope you like this tutorial for beginners. Cheers.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.920
In case is the first video you've seen of me my name is Joe Glynes and I'm from

02:41.920 --> 02:46.720
the Automator and I teach people how to automate their PCs. I love it's my

02:46.760 --> 02:50.880
passion to help people work smarter not harder. Come to my site check it out. I

02:50.880 --> 02:55.880
have over 600 videos on YouTube. I have three Udemy courses teaching AutoHotKey

02:55.880 --> 02:59.200
so all these are great resources. There's also some great AutoHotKey books out

02:59.200 --> 03:03.920
there but check us out. Also if at some point you want to get some work done for

03:03.920 --> 03:07.960
you now I have people working for me that will automate things. So drop me a

03:07.960 --> 03:12.520
note my email will be in this description and please like the video if you

03:12.520 --> 03:15.440
think it was helpful and looking forward to get going here. Cheers.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.440
Alright so the first thing we have to do is to download and install AutoHotKey.

03:20.440 --> 03:25.000
So let's go ahead and navigate to AutoHotKey.com in any browser. When you

03:25.000 --> 03:27.520
get there you're going to see this button that says download. Go ahead and

03:27.520 --> 03:31.560
click it. It's going to ask you which of these three options do you want. Always

03:31.560 --> 03:35.440
download the current version. The other two I don't want to get into it. It's a

03:35.440 --> 03:39.040
bit advanced to why. There's a lot of logic later that you might choose on but

03:39.040 --> 03:42.040
for now we're going to download the current version. Go ahead and save it. I

03:42.040 --> 03:46.040
already have it here on my desktop. It's a small file here. I'm going to say I'm just

03:46.040 --> 03:52.960
going to replace it and now once it's here I'm going to say open when done and

03:52.960 --> 03:57.640
it's going to come up with the setup files that you want to install. Now Windows

03:57.640 --> 04:02.640
now is trying to think that maybe this is a bad thing. Go ahead and click run

04:02.640 --> 04:07.520
anyway. It's going to come up with this window. Now the default isn't this

04:07.520 --> 04:12.560
express installation. For reasons I don't want to get into it's it's it's not what

04:12.560 --> 04:16.680
I recommend right and most people say do the custom installation instead of doing

04:16.680 --> 04:21.760
the Unicode 64 bit to the Unicode 32 bit and it just it works with more scripts

04:21.760 --> 04:26.440
you find online so it's just safer 64 a bit isn't necessarily better it's just

04:26.440 --> 04:30.680
different and you can install wherever you like. I'm just go ahead and hit next. I

04:30.680 --> 04:34.040
take the defaults on this screen as well. I take all the defaults don't change

04:34.040 --> 04:40.240
anything and basically you're done. Now that we have a hotkey installed let's

04:40.240 --> 04:44.400
work on getting an editor or an IDE and IDE is short for integrated development

04:44.400 --> 04:50.160
environment and I highly highly recommend you install something. I'm going to

04:50.160 --> 04:53.440
recommend site for Auto hotkey it's written specifically for using with

04:53.440 --> 04:58.240
Auto hotkey. Technically you could use either notepad or wordpad or almost

04:58.240 --> 05:02.200
anything that can edit a text file because the Auto hotkey code is written

05:02.200 --> 05:05.120
in plain text and that just means when you open it you'll see the actual

05:05.120 --> 05:07.880
characters and words there and you can recognize them and you could save it

05:07.880 --> 05:11.840
however there's a lot of functionality that using text pad wouldn't allow you

05:11.840 --> 05:17.480
to do like relaunch the script or assist you in typing the code you might

05:17.480 --> 05:21.840
want or hit F1 highlight a word hit F1 and bring up the support Auto hotkey

05:21.840 --> 05:26.160
support all of these things site will do for you automatically. Let's go ahead

05:26.160 --> 05:30.720
let me share my screen here and on the main page that we're working from I have

05:30.720 --> 05:34.760
a download for Auto hotkey site for Auto hotkey here so let's go I'm going to

05:34.760 --> 05:38.040
click this right now and we'll get it started here it's not a big program this

05:38.040 --> 05:41.960
is from my site I just make it for convenience because it might disappear

05:41.960 --> 05:45.040
in the form at some point that's going to download it we'll run it here in a

05:45.040 --> 05:49.600
second but what I wanted to point out is if you come up here there's this whole

05:49.600 --> 05:54.360
page dedicated to videos where I've taught people how to do it looks like I

05:54.360 --> 05:59.280
have at least 18 videos there I'm doing some advanced stuff now I don't recommend

05:59.280 --> 06:02.280
you start off here right because the great thing about site and you'll realize

06:02.320 --> 06:06.160
this when we start programming it is it's super easy it has a nice tool bar it

06:06.160 --> 06:09.840
has a lot of functionality it doesn't take a lot of learning there's not a

06:09.840 --> 06:13.440
steep learning curve and yet it's very simple easy to use so let's go ahead and

06:13.440 --> 06:17.600
install it I'm gonna I'm gonna hit Ctrl G and Chrome that'll well let's see I can

06:17.600 --> 06:21.920
do it right here I don't have to do that I'm gonna say open right so I don't

06:21.920 --> 06:25.080
have to navigate to it now it's gonna come up and say do you want the quick

06:25.080 --> 06:30.080
setup install I'm gonna hit install just to see what it's doing my default

06:30.080 --> 06:33.320
location is gonna be different than yours don't worry about that install

06:33.320 --> 06:37.440
wherever you want it you should it'll find auto hotkeys main install file and

06:37.440 --> 06:41.560
that's where mine is and then you're gonna click install but it's gonna come up

06:41.560 --> 06:44.640
and just say hey do you want to run these updates there's two updates it'll

06:44.640 --> 06:48.360
download and just say yes and that's it and then sites installed you have this

06:48.360 --> 06:53.840
nice toolbar up here it's a clean input interface so when you have the vertical

06:53.840 --> 06:58.040
split on this vertical split leave it off I would recommend it I think it

06:58.040 --> 07:01.080
makes more sense to have it down here mine just happened to be closed up so

07:01.080 --> 07:04.680
this is where you'll see output and this is where you'll see a lot of debug

07:04.680 --> 07:08.600
information mainly the big one is like hey the scripted launch and there's a

07:08.600 --> 07:13.760
problem like if we put something here and try to launch it it wants to save it

07:13.760 --> 07:20.560
first well fine save hotkeys script great now if I try to launch it it's gonna

07:20.560 --> 07:25.200
tell me hey this file has a problem specifically hey what in the world is

07:25.200 --> 07:30.000
our EFFD it tells you where it is right often they'll tell you the line that the

07:30.000 --> 07:34.440
problem's on but this is this little stuff that it really helps you understand

07:34.440 --> 07:39.120
what in the world's going on with your your script so I highly recommend you

07:39.120 --> 07:44.720
install there's also notepad plus plus HK studio which is the editor I use now

07:44.720 --> 07:49.600
but it's more advanced and this is by far the easiest to install easiest to pick

07:49.600 --> 07:53.480
up and use it's really a great advanced program for editing any kind of text

07:53.480 --> 07:56.640
there's a lot of search and replace stuff you can do in it so now let's go

07:56.640 --> 08:02.420
ahead and get into coding all right now that we have site and auto hotkey

08:02.420 --> 08:05.440
installed let's go ahead and start working on our first script so we're

08:05.440 --> 08:08.720
gonna jump in here and I just have a folder this folder it's in my temp

08:08.720 --> 08:15.000
directory and it's just keeping all the files together for me so go in somewhere

08:15.000 --> 08:19.760
right-click and say new and I'm gonna say new auto hotkey script now this is

08:19.760 --> 08:23.160
gonna generate a little bit of code in this file see it's one kilobyte it's not

08:23.160 --> 08:29.000
zero and we're gonna call this thing test I'm gonna hit right inner key to save

08:29.000 --> 08:33.840
it save the renaming and now I'm gonna right-click again and say edit and

08:33.840 --> 08:38.400
because site was installed it's the default editor it is gonna open this

08:38.400 --> 08:43.880
script in site for us and so we can see several things here this is really

08:43.880 --> 08:47.360
helpful is that notice this color coding if we open this file notepad this would

08:47.360 --> 08:51.440
just all be black text and it's it's this is where having site installed is

08:51.440 --> 08:56.720
really helpful to allow you to easily see this stuff things that begin with the

08:56.720 --> 09:00.080
pound sign they're called directives and we don't need to get into all the

09:00.080 --> 09:02.440
advanced stuff about that but I'm trying to point out they're a little

09:02.440 --> 09:07.240
different than other things just no end it's it's we don't need to go into the

09:07.240 --> 09:11.240
explanation of it you could comment it out you don't necessarily need it it's

09:11.240 --> 09:16.160
recommended but you don't have to have it in there control Q in site will toggle

09:16.160 --> 09:20.600
so I could I could highlight a bunch of these and it would toggle them but it

09:20.600 --> 09:24.240
will comment them out so that's control Q we'll leave it enabled it doesn't matter

09:24.240 --> 09:30.560
this sent now these two are commands and send mode input this is the most

09:30.560 --> 09:34.560
reliable and it's fast so we're gonna leave that enabled we'll use send a

09:34.560 --> 09:39.200
little bit later a send command and the set working directory that basically

09:39.200 --> 09:42.880
says hey when I'm accessing stuff use the the directory that I'm in is the

09:42.880 --> 09:46.960
default directory so it's a good thing to have I definitely recommend having it

09:46.960 --> 09:52.800
notice this auto assist this is why I love site also in in notepad you wouldn't

09:52.800 --> 09:56.120
have any of this and it's really much more complicated so I'm gonna hit it

09:56.120 --> 10:01.760
enter to accept that comma and we're gonna say force what this does it says

10:01.760 --> 10:11.600
hey only launch one instance of this script so if the script was already

10:11.600 --> 10:15.800
running it would basically relaunch it for you if it wasn't running a launch

10:15.800 --> 10:19.360
it if you'd launch it again it will say hey there's already one running don't run

10:19.360 --> 10:22.560
two instance of this only run one I don't understand why this isn't the

10:22.560 --> 10:27.800
default in every script it should be it's used all the time right so I use

10:27.800 --> 10:34.160
this is 99.9% of my scripts it should be in every script as the default you

10:34.160 --> 10:37.120
actually can go in a site you could change that or you know somewhere and

10:37.120 --> 10:40.360
you can change that this is the default value to have in there I highly

10:40.400 --> 10:46.320
encourage you to add it to yours and so this gets us going and now I'm gonna

10:46.320 --> 10:50.640
stop here and then we're gonna switch to actually working with hotkeys because

10:50.640 --> 10:53.520
we have a couple other things I want to put in this but I want to keep these

10:53.520 --> 10:57.920
compartmentalized while we're talking about directives and settings this is

10:57.920 --> 11:00.360
stuff that's for your script or other things you could put in here and over

11:00.360 --> 11:03.040
time you might learn you might want to have the next thing we're gonna get into

11:03.040 --> 11:06.480
is actually creating hotkeys to do some stuff that really helps speed up your

11:06.520 --> 11:13.160
coding. All right so let's jump into making our first script now before we

11:13.160 --> 11:16.560
actually do some fun coding stuff I'm gonna demonstrate a couple things to

11:16.560 --> 11:20.680
add to your main script the one that you're working in to make it easier to

11:20.680 --> 11:25.640
develop code so let's go ahead and start sharing here and we're gonna jump in now

11:25.640 --> 11:30.080
to start off let me show you there's this script right now is not running I

11:30.080 --> 11:34.120
can tell that one easy way is looking in here there's no green little green H's

11:34.120 --> 11:42.320
in here so we're gonna say let's say message box hello world now I'm gonna

11:42.320 --> 11:48.960
save this and when I hit this blue run it's going to or I could hit a five it's

11:48.960 --> 11:54.800
going to launch this script so notice two things here one here's the hello

11:54.800 --> 11:59.320
world message box this is the joseph's which script we're in and see this green

11:59.320 --> 12:03.800
H down here right this is telling us this script is running the second I hit

12:03.800 --> 12:07.920
okay here I also want you to notice something with this green H I hit okay

12:07.920 --> 12:12.300
and suddenly it's gone right why is that well there was nothing else in this

12:12.300 --> 12:16.160
script to keep it running keep it active and there are a couple things that

12:16.160 --> 12:19.040
you could do to do that if you had a hot key or a hot string in it it would

12:19.040 --> 12:24.240
automatically stay running you could add a single persistent a directive called

12:24.240 --> 12:28.800
persistent and this would keep it running so if I save this we launch it the

12:28.800 --> 12:33.320
message box comes up here's our green H when I said okay it stays running now it

12:33.320 --> 12:36.240
wouldn't do anything because there's nothing else in this so we don't we

12:36.240 --> 12:44.800
won't leave this in here but so we're gonna add that in our little pile of

12:44.800 --> 12:50.720
things to keep in memory I'll just remember so this next one what we're

12:50.720 --> 12:59.640
gonna do is let's say we wanted to be able to easily edit this script now

12:59.640 --> 13:02.960
there's a couple ways we could do it right now because it's running and it's

13:02.960 --> 13:08.120
down here I could right click on this and say edit so even if site was closed

13:08.120 --> 13:13.840
yeah changes I can right click it here and say edit and it's gonna open in my

13:13.840 --> 13:18.280
default editor which is site I could also come into the main script here and

13:18.280 --> 13:22.320
right click it and say edit and it will pull it up but that would be really

13:22.320 --> 13:26.240
tedious if you had closed site and you wanted to always edit it so what I love

13:26.240 --> 13:32.240
to do and we're gonna do this with a hot key is a let's start dabbling in hot

13:32.240 --> 13:38.960
key so there are things called modifier keys and those the main four are

13:38.960 --> 13:45.400
control alt shift in the windows key those and auto hot key and so let's add

13:45.400 --> 13:55.480
some comments here so the alt key is the exclamation point the the windows key

13:55.480 --> 14:13.320
is the pound and I'm not yet the shift key is the plus sign and well control key

14:13.320 --> 14:22.120
sorry and and this is the carrot which is above your six so these on their own

14:22.120 --> 14:24.760
we wouldn't use these by themselves but they're called modifiers and that's

14:24.760 --> 14:31.120
because you use them in conjunction with another letter or or or another key so

14:31.120 --> 14:41.120
let's say every time I hit we'll do control H we want that to run message

14:41.120 --> 14:45.840
box hello world now I'm gonna add a return here which basically tells auto

14:45.840 --> 14:51.720
hot key to stop stop going forward after from that point on so I'm gonna save

14:51.720 --> 14:57.000
this always remember you have to save and reload it or hit f5 so now it's

14:57.000 --> 14:59.880
rerun it this is another reason this output window here this can tell you if

14:59.880 --> 15:06.720
there's errors where what line the errors on so notepad doesn't have this and

15:06.720 --> 15:09.800
this is where it's really nice so I can when I relaunch this you'll see it flash

15:09.800 --> 15:14.960
also notice when I relaunch it you'll see it down here at blinks and so it's a

15:14.960 --> 15:19.400
great way to make sure you understand the changes were absorbed or used so now

15:19.400 --> 15:24.520
I'm gonna hit control H and bam there we go right and now if I hit enter it's

15:24.520 --> 15:28.460
gonna get rid of it but look I can hit control H again and it pulls it up so

15:28.460 --> 15:32.680
this is a hot key that's gonna launch whatever is between here and here I

15:32.680 --> 15:38.640
could put a second let's say I wanted to do this so now it'll have two so if I

15:38.640 --> 15:43.360
now I have to relaunch it again now this is the point of what I'm gonna show

15:43.360 --> 15:48.520
here in a second is control H and it's gonna say hello and then world right so

15:48.520 --> 15:52.160
we're using our hot key to use a message display a message box with a value in

15:52.160 --> 15:56.160
it I'm not overly useful but you get the idea of I can trigger this we can also

15:56.160 --> 15:59.240
trigger other things which we'll cover here in a minute but before we get to

15:59.240 --> 16:06.640
that let's say I want to automatically reload this script instead of having to

16:06.640 --> 16:10.960
come in here and launch it and then hit right click and say reload or relaunch

16:10.960 --> 16:14.960
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change this to control R so it makes sense to me

16:14.960 --> 16:19.280
this is a really powerful thing in auto hot key I think it's really under you

16:19.280 --> 16:24.120
know you don't understood of that I can make it what makes sense to me right so

16:24.120 --> 16:30.880
I'm gonna change this to control R and I'm gonna add the command edit now this

16:30.880 --> 16:33.640
is a special command let me also demonstrate here if I highlight if I'm

16:33.640 --> 16:38.800
in a word and I hit F1 it will pull up the auto hot key help and that's built

16:38.800 --> 16:42.960
into site also so this is a really great thing here the site document I'm sorry

16:42.960 --> 16:46.720
the auto hot key documentation is excellent you can read about it and

16:46.720 --> 16:50.920
then usually at the bottom it'll show you an example or two of how to use the

16:50.920 --> 16:55.400
commands so I highly recommend again using site and then using that F1 when

16:55.400 --> 16:59.160
you get stuck and don't not sure what it is so what is this gonna do well I'm

16:59.160 --> 17:04.440
gonna save this and relaunch it so it takes it in now you know what let's

17:04.440 --> 17:12.800
let's add here oh I don't want that that should have been reload there we go

17:12.800 --> 17:17.040
and let's look at reload real quick so replaces the current running instance of

17:17.040 --> 17:19.880
the script with a new one right so that's kind of what we're doing with this

17:19.880 --> 17:24.360
F5 we're relaunching it of course reload only works if it's already running but

17:24.360 --> 17:31.000
I'm gonna save this rerun it now watch what happens if I hit control R it it's

17:31.040 --> 17:37.000
funny it reloads it but it because it triggers the reload let me let me do

17:37.000 --> 17:49.520
this a smart way so I'm gonna save this and now hit R control R and now when I'm

17:49.520 --> 17:54.000
hitting control R so see it says it will reload now when I hit okay it's gonna

17:54.000 --> 17:58.840
trigger that reload and notice the green H blink down here so again control R it's

17:58.840 --> 18:01.880
gonna pull up the message box and then do the okay I just wanted the message box

18:01.880 --> 18:07.240
to show you we're actually in here right so now if I really hit just control R

18:07.240 --> 18:12.400
it's gonna well the first time through now it's gonna reload it right so I can

18:12.400 --> 18:15.880
just hit control R I don't have to come up here and hit f5 f5 is hard for me on

18:15.880 --> 18:20.560
my keyboard to reach so it's a nice handy one to be able to say hey I want to I

18:20.560 --> 18:25.720
want to make these changes and control R will do that for us because see how it

18:25.720 --> 18:29.960
reloads it for us so it's a super helpful one to have in here I also want to

18:29.960 --> 18:37.480
point out if your command is more than one line then you need the return if

18:37.480 --> 18:41.560
it's not more than one line so let me comment this out this is only one line

18:41.560 --> 18:44.640
right we can bring this one up here and a lot of these can be put on the same

18:44.640 --> 18:49.760
line and if we do it on the same line you don't actually need the return so I'm

18:49.760 --> 18:55.200
gonna save this hit control R again now it's reloading for us so it's great

18:55.240 --> 19:00.520
because I can just hit control R and have it reload for me now another one

19:00.520 --> 19:05.680
which is really helpful to have so we're gonna say control E to edit and now

19:05.680 --> 19:21.200
this is the one that I was started to work on earlier here so this so here are

19:21.200 --> 19:25.040
two that I will just love having in here so now I'm gonna hit control R to

19:25.040 --> 19:30.360
take that now if site was not open I can hit control E and it is going to edit

19:30.360 --> 19:35.840
this file it's gonna pull it up for us so these two hotkeys in the main script

19:35.840 --> 19:39.160
that you're working on are entity and again you don't have to use control R

19:39.160 --> 19:43.520
right that's my example but it's super helpful for helping you speed up what

19:43.520 --> 19:46.360
you're doing when you're coding because I don't have to come down here and right

19:46.360 --> 19:51.080
click and say reload or come up here with my mouse or hit F5 the control R and

19:51.160 --> 19:55.880
whatever's convenient for you are super easy to do and then what I often will

19:55.880 --> 20:00.680
do is I will use something to trigger so this is this is often much more how

20:00.680 --> 20:08.960
hotkeys are used is let's say I'll do control M for a message box and let's

20:08.960 --> 20:14.760
put that on the next line so message box hello world and now because that is

20:14.760 --> 20:19.160
going on the next line I'm pretty sure let's just test it I could have moved

20:19.240 --> 20:26.120
this up here and I'm gonna hit control R the say see this asterisk up here that

20:26.120 --> 20:30.920
means there's been changes that haven't been actually saved yet so now it's saved

20:30.920 --> 20:36.400
it now control R will relaunch it and I can do control M for my hello world

20:36.400 --> 20:43.280
control E to edit which is I'm already in it so if I was to close this I can

20:43.280 --> 20:46.840
hit control E and they'll pull it up and control R you can see it blinking down

20:46.880 --> 20:50.560
below in the bottom right so these are our three things now that with this

20:50.560 --> 20:55.640
message box I want to demonstrate you can do other things with hotkeys right so

20:55.640 --> 21:00.960
let's let's say I wanted to launch Chrome that one let's start off with notepad

21:00.960 --> 21:04.680
because notepad is a little easier and let's do control in now control in is

21:04.680 --> 21:10.320
already a hotkey in site right now if I don't say this I hit control in it's

21:10.320 --> 21:16.080
gonna open a new tab for me right but I want to use control in in a different

21:16.080 --> 21:25.280
way so I'm going to say run notepad now I don't have I'll add it here you don't

21:25.280 --> 21:29.160
have to have the exe and notepad especially you don't need the entire

21:29.160 --> 21:34.040
path because notepad is in the windows path and so but I wanted to start off

21:34.040 --> 21:39.000
with it to keep it simple so I'm gonna say control S control R to reload and

21:39.000 --> 21:43.080
then I'm gonna say control N unfortunately it launched notepad on my

21:43.080 --> 21:47.200
other screen here but let me bring it over here close it now if I control and

21:47.200 --> 21:52.040
again yeah it remembers where it was so I just made a hotkey to launch notepad

21:52.040 --> 21:57.200
but let's say we want to launch something that's not in the windows path

21:57.200 --> 22:01.080
well you could we could say well I'm gonna come down here got our properties

22:01.080 --> 22:06.560
I'm gonna get the full path and here this to the left I have my running in

22:06.560 --> 22:11.940
debug mode but this is the path to Chrome and so I'm gonna say and control C

22:11.940 --> 22:14.940
would be a terrible one right because that's copy so we don't want to replace

22:14.940 --> 22:22.100
copy so let's do alt C so I'm gonna do the alt C remember you got to use look

22:22.100 --> 22:27.580
up here alt you know the exclamation is the alt key so alt C and then we're

22:27.580 --> 22:32.060
gonna say run and here paste in this more often than not you don't need the

22:32.060 --> 22:35.540
double quotes around it but let's we'll just leave them here so I'm gonna save

22:35.540 --> 22:43.380
this reload it control R and alt C now alt C will launch Chrome for me right

22:43.380 --> 22:47.860
and you can do this with almost any Windows program you can launch it this

22:47.860 --> 22:51.020
way get the full path to it sometimes there's a little things what you need to

22:51.020 --> 22:55.820
have the set a given directory can run into some headaches or if you want to

22:55.820 --> 23:01.020
open a certain file you can add a space here and add the path to the file after

23:01.020 --> 23:09.740
it but being able to launch programs is a great simple thing and that's it for

23:09.740 --> 23:16.900
this one let's let's do one other one so the Windows key so Windows let's say

23:17.900 --> 23:25.740
Windows G and what is anything that starts with G we'll just do something

23:25.740 --> 23:36.700
run grepwin so I'm gonna go to properties this is the path to my file

23:36.700 --> 23:40.420
there we go no that one doesn't have the double quotes but it should be fine I'm

23:40.420 --> 23:45.020
ready this is the portable version of it so I'm gonna save this sorry save it

23:45.020 --> 23:50.780
reload it and now the Windows key G will launch grepwin for me grepwin is a

23:50.780 --> 23:55.300
search tool that will search across files in your computer it's free I highly

23:55.340 --> 23:59.820
recommend it if you need to search text in inside files but anyway you just see

23:59.820 --> 24:04.740
it now I use the Windows key the alt key let's do one more with shift so we're

24:04.740 --> 24:10.940
gonna do a shift and shift obviously the shift with a letter would be bad on

24:10.940 --> 24:14.140
its own right because you want to capitalize letters but we'll just do

24:14.140 --> 24:21.820
shift T and you know I'm gonna be lazy and run calc I think it's calc.exe so if

24:21.820 --> 24:30.940
I hit shift T oh I didn't I didn't save it save it reload it shift T just ran my

24:30.940 --> 24:37.540
calculator so there I used the the four main modifiers shift windows alt and

24:37.540 --> 24:41.660
control to demonstrate how you can launch programs you could launch other

24:41.660 --> 24:46.380
scripts you could launch web pages you could you could actually you know what

24:46.380 --> 24:50.900
let me let me let me demonstrate that I launched a browser however let's say we

24:50.940 --> 24:57.340
wanted to and you know what this will be a good one for the Windows G is let's

24:57.340 --> 25:02.620
say we wanted to run a certain website so here I would put in you know what I

25:02.620 --> 25:06.460
don't like I want to save this so we have it as an example but I'm gonna

25:06.460 --> 25:09.940
comment to that you know what let's demonstrate this I'm gonna leave those

25:09.940 --> 25:13.100
both there I'm gonna say run

25:13.940 --> 25:21.620
so I'm gonna save this when I hit reload notice it says hey there's a

25:21.620 --> 25:27.020
duplicate hotkey you can't have the same hotkey in the same script because it

25:27.020 --> 25:30.180
will cause a problem it won't know which one to run so it warns you that's

25:30.180 --> 25:33.700
another great thing about this is it warns you so I'm just for now I'm gonna

25:33.700 --> 25:38.180
comment this out if it was running in another script it would have launched and

25:38.180 --> 25:42.180
it would have just used the most recently launched one so so this though

25:42.180 --> 25:46.140
what I wanted to demonstrate was oh you know what actually I call it Windows G

25:46.140 --> 25:53.860
because I wanted to run Google there we go so control R now it reloaded now when

25:53.860 --> 26:00.660
I hit Windows G it launches my default browser and takes me to that web page so

26:00.660 --> 26:04.980
this is how I could easily do a search so let's that'll wrap this up here with

26:04.980 --> 26:09.420
dealing with hotkeys and these these ones I like to add in the just ease I I

26:09.460 --> 26:13.500
put something similar to this in every one of the scripts I'm working on that

26:13.500 --> 26:17.580
I'm adjusting I always have it running in that script and then when I'm finally

26:17.580 --> 26:21.660
done with it I either comment them out or I'll remove them because I'll have

26:21.660 --> 26:24.900
another one that I'm working on and I only put those in what the active script

26:24.900 --> 26:31.980
that I'm trying to develop okay the next thing we're covering are called hot

26:31.980 --> 26:37.340
strings or you can think of them as text expansion for me they are the lowest

26:37.340 --> 26:41.620
hanging fruit the simplest thing you can learn today and be using it and be more

26:41.620 --> 26:46.580
efficient at a computer they're so simple and important and save so much

26:46.580 --> 26:51.260
time it was the first Udemy course that my colleague Jackie and I built on Udemy

26:51.260 --> 26:55.100
because they just they're huge time savers they're way overlooked by

26:55.100 --> 26:58.620
everybody and they're just one of those little things once you get them you

26:58.620 --> 27:03.580
realize you do type the same things over and over and over and they're really

27:03.580 --> 27:07.660
helpful so let's go ahead and start working on them what we're gonna do is

27:07.660 --> 27:12.460
let's let's do in a little example here so let's say I I hey I type my email

27:12.460 --> 27:18.260
address a lot right so I'm gonna put in two colons and think to yourself what

27:18.260 --> 27:22.140
what do I want to type as the abbreviation for my email address so I'm

27:22.140 --> 27:27.540
gonna say JTA because this email address happens to be Joe at theautomanner.com

27:27.980 --> 27:32.980
and then you put in the two more colons and then you type what you want Joe at

27:32.980 --> 27:38.860
the-automater.com notice you make sure you put it in the case you want like

27:38.860 --> 27:42.780
uppercase here I uppercase my A right because I want that to come through but

27:42.780 --> 27:47.700
I don't want it here and I want my first name to be capitalized and so I'm gonna

27:47.700 --> 27:51.300
save this since I still have this running I'm a hit control R now it just

27:51.300 --> 27:56.220
absorbed it now when I type JTA period now it didn't do it right then but when I

27:56.260 --> 28:01.460
hit a space a return or a tab basically any kind of ending character it swaps

28:01.460 --> 28:05.740
that out for me right so it's it's a very simple thing to be able to learn how

28:05.740 --> 28:10.580
to do you can replicate this to your hearts and this will work I could open

28:10.580 --> 28:14.860
up do I have a hot key a control in will open up notepad JTA period space

28:14.860 --> 28:20.460
there's my email address right it's it is just the simplest thing in the world

28:20.700 --> 28:27.540
you could put in paragraphs of text like let's say also we wanted let's say we

28:27.540 --> 28:31.580
wanted to have it have a line break so I'm gonna do this till day which is to the

28:31.580 --> 28:35.900
left of the number one till day in stands for like a new line feed is the

28:35.900 --> 28:41.620
actual character for it so and make sure if you do edit your own add it into the

28:41.620 --> 28:44.420
script here that you don't try to save it or load it because that'll cause an

28:44.420 --> 28:56.140
error so new Joe Joe the automator is tick my tick in email to can address I'm

28:56.140 --> 29:02.420
gonna save this I'm gonna control R to reload let's go back to notepad now when

29:02.420 --> 29:09.220
I type JTA period space it put it across different lines right it out of the line

29:09.220 --> 29:13.300
so if you wanted to have multiple things in here there is a character limit on

29:13.300 --> 29:17.700
how many you can do in this structure however you can have up to like 16,000

29:17.700 --> 29:24.420
characters in a different way you can look at the the hot strings help which on

29:24.420 --> 29:27.980
that way at my win webpage for this beginner course I have a link to it

29:27.980 --> 29:34.060
about how to do continuous in sections but it's really that simple and so here

29:34.060 --> 29:39.220
let's get back I mean I'm gonna hit control D which is a hot key in site for

29:39.220 --> 29:45.140
duplicate the line and I'm gonna get back into my email address where when I

29:45.140 --> 29:50.060
save this control R to reload come into notepad you know what I think I can see

29:50.060 --> 29:54.900
if I can type down here yeah I can dump it in here so see that space at the end

29:54.900 --> 30:03.100
well often I'm using my email address or in a as the user area in username for a

30:03.100 --> 30:06.180
form and I don't want that space at the end because that of course would break it

30:06.180 --> 30:12.420
so it's a simple change in auto hotkey is just add an O in between the first two

30:12.420 --> 30:19.820
colons now when I save this and reload it when I come in here and type JTA

30:19.820 --> 30:25.100
period now watch what happens when I hit space so notice where my cursor is it's

30:25.100 --> 30:29.100
right at that M it didn't add the space at the end and so it's a very simple

30:29.100 --> 30:33.820
thing to adjust where if I am using a email address or maybe a password now

30:33.860 --> 30:38.300
you know do discretion if you're saving passwords because the password will be

30:38.300 --> 30:41.980
stored in a plain text file that's easily visible by anybody right there's

30:41.980 --> 30:47.180
ways around it and I have a video on that somewhere but it is they're not

30:47.180 --> 30:50.740
secure so just be careful with it but it's very convenient to be able to do

30:50.740 --> 30:54.260
this so things like you know just some things you just don't want to space out

30:54.260 --> 30:57.780
of the end sometimes you want to it might be plural sometimes not and this is an

30:57.780 --> 31:01.100
easy way to do it without having a backspace to get rid of that extra

31:01.100 --> 31:05.420
space another example that I want to demonstrate in this will wrap up the

31:05.420 --> 31:14.020
basic hot strings is there are certain characters because up here this windows

31:14.020 --> 31:19.100
key the the pound sign the alt key this exclamation point this carrot is

31:19.100 --> 31:25.500
control auto hotkey interpretees is very special characters right so you can't

31:25.500 --> 31:32.760
let's say we were doing this see the STB if you're a signfold fan you'll get

31:32.760 --> 31:38.580
this you have to see the baby exclamation point right so I'm gonna save

31:38.580 --> 31:42.660
this reload it now when I come in here and I'm doing it down here because if I

31:42.660 --> 31:47.060
do it here and I save it it'll break my code right so I'm typing in here STB

31:47.060 --> 31:52.740
period space hey it said you have to see the baby but no explanation point right

31:52.740 --> 31:57.820
why is there no exclamation point well that's because it literally thought hey

31:57.820 --> 32:03.700
let's send the alt key right because it's a special character so the easy there's

32:03.700 --> 32:07.340
two ways very simple ways to take care of it there are other ways we're gonna

32:07.340 --> 32:11.580
handle two of them right here the first way is to wrap this anytime you have a

32:11.580 --> 32:16.240
special character this wrap it with these curly braces and save remember save

32:16.240 --> 32:22.580
reload reload watch that green H flash now STB periods now see it has the

32:22.620 --> 32:28.260
exclamation point so that's option one option two is you can leave this the

32:28.260 --> 32:34.020
original way but put an R in between here so I'm gonna save this reload it

32:34.020 --> 32:41.420
there it goes and STB period space and that works also notice here we have the

32:41.420 --> 32:46.020
space which is perfectly fine but I could put the O in combination with the R

32:46.460 --> 32:53.820
save it reload it come down here see the space and now we have it without the

32:53.820 --> 32:58.140
extra space right so even though this works like looks like the word or it's

32:58.140 --> 33:02.060
not auto hotkey you can put multiple things in here and it's a simple easy

33:02.060 --> 33:06.580
way let me do one more one more fun one that's it's good to know is if you don't

33:06.580 --> 33:11.140
want to wait for that tab or space you want that hotkey to get replaced right

33:11.180 --> 33:19.140
away you can use another one here is you put in the asterisk so here is let's

33:19.140 --> 33:27.260
say HW period oh actually you know I don't want the period here so there we

33:27.260 --> 33:34.620
go so this is gonna send hello world save it reload it now watch what happens

33:34.620 --> 33:39.700
right when I hit the W so H now the second I hit the W it dumps it in right

33:39.700 --> 33:44.340
I didn't have to hit that space or a tab or return after so those are three things

33:44.340 --> 33:49.980
you can easily adjust in hot strings again hot strings to me this may it might

33:49.980 --> 33:54.900
to some of you seem very simple and then oh maybe I'll use that maybe I won't I

33:54.900 --> 34:00.900
can't stress how much you realize you type the same words or same URLs or

34:00.900 --> 34:06.300
passwords or email addresses or names of companies over and over and over or even

34:06.300 --> 34:11.180
entire paragraphs right so there's this is a lifesaver it just saves so much

34:11.180 --> 34:15.220
time and in a second here we're switch over to launching a spell check that

34:15.220 --> 34:18.420
will run again this will work in any program right I could have been a notepad

34:18.420 --> 34:23.380
and it'll dump it in right any Windows program so it's running across all of

34:23.380 --> 34:27.500
your tools some every once in a while you have a little problem sending to it

34:27.500 --> 34:30.860
and that's also check out my my Udemy course or just read the search and read

34:30.860 --> 34:34.620
the help you know I push my Udemy courses little just because they give a good

34:34.620 --> 34:38.460
guide it's not that I want to make a ton of money it's I don't mind making money

34:38.460 --> 34:42.540
but it's it's that they give a nice flow and they cover things they give you an

34:42.540 --> 34:46.940
order and some people really like having the structure in the order so let's get

34:46.940 --> 34:50.820
into the next one with using a spell check

34:52.140 --> 34:57.820
alright this spell check I found on the forum years ago and I tried backtracking

34:57.820 --> 35:01.540
it to get the documentation where I found it but I couldn't find it anyway it

35:01.820 --> 35:05.980
has nearly 4,000 words in it and it's great because no matter what program I'm

35:05.980 --> 35:09.380
in in Windows as long as the script is running it is doing the spell check for

35:09.380 --> 35:15.460
me across all of those Windows anywhere I'm typing so let's jump into it you can

35:15.460 --> 35:20.660
get it off of this main page and I'll put a link in this video too but on this

35:20.660 --> 35:24.740
main page down here download spell check I'm gonna right-click and say save

35:24.740 --> 35:30.400
link as and here we're gonna save it for now I'm gonna save it let's go to the

35:30.400 --> 35:35.260
where I have those other files saved

35:35.260 --> 35:39.080
a lot of key for beginners here we go and I'm gonna call it spell check that's

35:39.080 --> 35:43.680
fine save it now it's gonna save it I'm not gonna launch it here what I want to

35:43.680 --> 35:51.160
do is let's look at that directory and I'm gonna come in here and say edit oh

35:51.160 --> 35:55.920
gotta highlight it edit script and now this is gonna pull it up and I want to

35:55.920 --> 36:01.560
talk through a couple of things before we launch it notice these here's the

36:01.560 --> 36:06.400
source just so you have it here too this is where you can get it from and that no

36:06.400 --> 36:09.840
environment we're familiar with they're ready single lessons force absolutely

36:09.840 --> 36:14.760
send mode input great this one is basically turning off because these are

36:14.760 --> 36:18.360
spelled properly right so it turns off the back spacing for for some of these

36:18.360 --> 36:23.240
hot strings so because those are often people the spell check will think it's

36:23.240 --> 36:27.720
misspelled but it's not and so we're turning it off for that in here and I

36:27.720 --> 36:32.520
hear examples and look how big this file is right like I said it has got 4,000

36:32.520 --> 36:38.520
words that will auto correct for you so it's a really helpful script let's go

36:38.520 --> 36:48.600
ahead and do a demo down let's pick the one I let's do America so sometimes

36:48.600 --> 36:52.520
apparently people forget the sea because I guess there's no seas in America maybe

36:52.560 --> 36:57.800
few oceans but let's say America notice the star here so it's not going to wait

36:57.800 --> 37:00.520
for us for an ending character right it's gonna do the replacement right away

37:00.520 --> 37:04.240
and but unfortunately I haven't I haven't actually launched this yet right

37:04.240 --> 37:09.600
and right now in the system trade we don't have anything running right now

37:09.600 --> 37:13.080
this one has been killed for now but let's go ahead what I want to do is to

37:13.080 --> 37:19.680
come back into where we saved it and I'm gonna get the path to this file so come

37:19.680 --> 37:25.960
in here copy this go back to site here and this is actually going to cause a

37:25.960 --> 37:31.160
problem but I want to demonstrate this as well so I'm gonna say run because we

37:31.160 --> 37:35.760
wanted to run the script this is the folder and then it's what was it spell

37:35.760 --> 37:42.440
underscore I can see it at the top there in the other tab check HK now if I was to

37:42.440 --> 37:47.240
save this and we launched this script we see the one green H running here it's

37:47.240 --> 37:51.960
just test right but hey why didn't that launch the other script well the problem

37:51.960 --> 37:57.120
is we if we have a hot key or if I had a return this top part of your script is

37:57.120 --> 38:01.080
the auto exec script and it happens up until you come down to like a hot key or

38:01.080 --> 38:05.000
return like that so what we want to do is things that we want to launch we want

38:05.000 --> 38:09.680
to have it at the top part of your scripts and so now I'm gonna save this

38:09.680 --> 38:15.880
now if I relaunch this or hit ctrl R you're gonna notice over here now we have

38:15.880 --> 38:19.200
two green ages and it's unfortunate that it always puts in that same default

38:19.200 --> 38:23.960
icon and and this is where it gets really confusing if you have a lot of

38:23.960 --> 38:29.040
scripts running any given time I typically have like five to seven scripts

38:29.040 --> 38:34.360
running at a given time all the time right for this example video I've

38:34.360 --> 38:39.760
ripped everything out so I don't confuse anybody but remember this needs to be at

38:39.760 --> 38:44.880
the top in your auto exec section otherwise it won't it won't get to it

38:44.880 --> 38:50.360
basically it stops it it stops before it reaches it now there's an easy quote

38:50.360 --> 38:54.880
unquote cure for this one is at the top here again if we don't want these two

38:54.880 --> 38:59.040
green ages well hey the spell check I want it running all the time I don't it's

38:59.040 --> 39:03.240
rare I'm gonna edit that file so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come in here and

39:03.240 --> 39:09.240
that's why I've added this here is this no tray icon if I save this and you know

39:09.240 --> 39:13.520
what I could launch it from here but let's come back in we don't even have to

39:13.520 --> 39:18.080
be here I can just hit control R and you'll notice the the green H is gonna

39:18.080 --> 39:23.400
go away so I'm gonna hit control R now that other green H isn't there but the

39:23.400 --> 39:27.560
script is still running and I'll demonstrate that by coming in here

39:27.560 --> 39:35.600
let's come back down to our America example there we go so I'm gonna start

39:35.600 --> 39:41.920
typing AMERIA and notice it put in the C right so the script is still

39:41.960 --> 39:46.960
running but we don't have it in the system tray there's some some major

39:46.960 --> 39:49.800
benefits of this is that if you have a lot of scripts going it doesn't get

39:49.800 --> 39:53.920
confusing down here the drawback of course is I couldn't come in here and

39:53.920 --> 39:58.920
right-click and say edit so it can make it it can be a pain and I have another

39:58.920 --> 40:04.240
script that you can use that'll it'll show you all running scripts I could go

40:04.240 --> 40:07.400
to my task manager and I could find it from there and right-click and kill it

40:07.400 --> 40:11.680
or I could come back in here and I could just you know go to edit it I could I

40:11.680 --> 40:15.520
could even find it in here and right-click and say edit right so I can

40:15.520 --> 40:20.280
get to it that way but it just won't be in your system tray and you can change

40:20.280 --> 40:23.800
the icons like in some of my other scripts I have it where I change icons I

40:23.800 --> 40:27.800
even have a script to automate changing the icon so Google that on my on my

40:27.800 --> 40:33.240
YouTube channel but it's I recommend hiding you know only having one to two

40:33.240 --> 40:38.000
in there because otherwise it just gets too confusing and so I only allow my

40:38.000 --> 40:42.040
one script I'm playing with to be there and then I'll change it either I hide it

40:42.040 --> 40:46.120
or I change it to a different one so let's demonstrate a couple other things

40:46.120 --> 40:50.320
in here notice down here at the bottom they have abbreviations so I can type

40:50.320 --> 40:56.440
SCP period that's funny it was trying to interpret that SCP period space and it

40:56.440 --> 41:01.160
puts in September for me right so this would be a spell check or let's do this

41:01.160 --> 41:06.280
the days of the week I see Sun space right so it has a lot of default ones of

41:06.280 --> 41:08.920
course you could either comment these out or delete them if you don't want to

41:08.920 --> 41:12.760
have them in there obviously the word may you know that one's gonna come up in a

41:12.760 --> 41:16.600
lot of sentences so they didn't do it for that one but you get the idea right

41:16.600 --> 41:21.000
this is a great easy tool to have running and it runs like let's go back to

41:21.000 --> 41:28.320
I don't have it launched I was gonna say let's launch notepad which I just don't

41:28.320 --> 41:33.680
recall we got rid of that hotkey I'll just turn it back on save reload control

41:33.680 --> 41:38.520
in to launch it and I'm gonna kill it real quick because I'll forget that I

41:38.520 --> 41:46.360
did that and if we do the SUN period space there's Sunday a M E R I know see

41:46.360 --> 41:53.480
a America no V November right it'll run in every program so if you're like me I

41:53.480 --> 41:58.840
actually have a couple tools allow me a text from my computer it's so easy to be

41:58.840 --> 42:03.640
able to automate texting and be using your hot strings to help type the stuff

42:03.640 --> 42:08.680
that you want to send right so it's super simple super fast hot strings are

42:08.680 --> 42:14.440
there you know a really really really great tool that I highly recommend also

42:14.440 --> 42:18.680
don't add too many the spell checks one thing because it's doing automatically but

42:18.680 --> 42:23.520
the regular hot strings don't add too many at once baby step into it also make

42:23.520 --> 42:28.240
abbreviation so like mine what I do is for email addresses I'll put usually

42:28.240 --> 42:32.520
minor my own email addresses are different because I have about eight and I

42:32.520 --> 42:39.840
do them differently but if if I knew let's say Abraham Lincoln and he had an

42:39.840 --> 42:46.120
email address I would do Abraham Lincoln email oops and then a period so

42:46.120 --> 42:49.000
unfortunately that one may not because it looks like that's actually a word but

42:49.000 --> 42:57.560
and this would be Abe at gmail.com right so oh and I actually look at that I

42:57.560 --> 43:01.440
messed up that there we go that's better and this one of course I want the O in

43:01.440 --> 43:08.920
there so I'm gonna save this reload it a e so it's basically the first two

43:08.920 --> 43:13.000
initial the initials the there are the first two letters followed by an e and

43:13.000 --> 43:17.720
that way and then a period and so that helps me have a pattern and makes it

43:17.720 --> 43:20.640
easier for me to remember all my hot strings because I have hundreds upon

43:20.640 --> 43:25.440
hundreds of them and it can be it can be confusing but again they're super

43:25.440 --> 43:30.200
helpful and so let's get going on the next section

43:31.480 --> 43:36.000
okay so I want to do one more with the hot key just to demonstrate how easy it

43:36.000 --> 43:41.240
is to remap keys in a given program let's say you know in a lot of programs

43:41.240 --> 43:47.280
control H will do the search replace functionality and the control H to me

43:47.280 --> 43:52.560
just isn't the most intuitive hot key so what if I wanted to send a different

43:52.560 --> 43:59.560
you know hit a different hot key to send control H so let's say I wanted Alt R so

43:59.560 --> 44:07.280
Alt R that's gonna trigger this now we're gonna send control H and make sure

44:07.280 --> 44:10.520
you add the return because we're on more than one line so I'm gonna save this

44:10.520 --> 44:15.520
control R will reload the script I saw it blink now I'm gonna hit Alt R and

44:15.520 --> 44:21.240
notice it this came up which is the control H now control H still works in

44:21.240 --> 44:26.200
site because I didn't replace that but on that when I hit Alt R it sends control

44:26.200 --> 44:31.360
H which is what the active program is gonna interpret as oh hey here control H

44:31.360 --> 44:35.560
so it's a great easy way to adjust something if you don't like the hot key

44:35.560 --> 44:39.360
or accelerator key and the program you're in you can write it just to redo

44:39.360 --> 44:43.000
your own now when I was actually doing this I came up with a little bit of a

44:43.000 --> 44:47.400
problem here let's let's change the control R R R let's just comment it out

44:47.400 --> 44:54.440
so we don't have that one for now you you could do this this works technically

44:54.440 --> 45:04.960
so control R is gonna send you know what I want to leave that so we are we're

45:04.960 --> 45:10.200
gonna do control R to send control H and before the control R was up here so

45:10.200 --> 45:18.080
this technically will work so I'm gonna save this I'm gonna minimize that

45:18.400 --> 45:24.520
reload the script I think this should we'll control I'm gonna hit control R now

45:24.520 --> 45:34.440
that sent the control H however I got a caution you these modifier keys have to

45:34.440 --> 45:43.200
be the same so if I was trying to hit Alt R to send control H unfortunately so

45:43.200 --> 45:49.440
let me close this reload the script now I'm hit Alt R Alt R it doesn't work I

45:49.440 --> 45:56.040
just hit it it doesn't work and basically what's happening is this is what

45:56.040 --> 46:00.800
gets passed along the the control whatever modifier key was here is gonna

46:00.800 --> 46:04.600
be the same over here it when they're the same it works fine when they're

46:04.600 --> 46:09.960
different then you need to put it onto the next line and then add the return

46:10.000 --> 46:16.320
right so if you just get in the practice of doing them on the next line then

46:16.320 --> 46:20.000
you're fine right if you're gonna use the same modifier key you can have them the

46:20.000 --> 46:23.240
same line if not then put them on different line so I hope that helps it

46:23.240 --> 46:26.240
again just think about it if you're in a program you don't like you know the

46:26.240 --> 46:31.000
the commands being sent it's a great easy way the hotkey that the program is

46:31.000 --> 46:34.320
associated with it you can make your own and the other one I wanted to point out

46:34.320 --> 46:39.280
was you can make context sensitive hotkeys and I'll have a link in the

46:39.280 --> 46:44.240
the web page about this but basically I could have it say if I'm in site and

46:44.240 --> 46:48.560
hit control R and do one thing if I'm in notepad and I hit control R do another

46:48.560 --> 46:54.040
and if I'm in word and hit control R do something else so there there's context

46:54.040 --> 46:58.160
sensitive meaning they understand what program they're in the active program and

46:58.160 --> 47:01.240
it's gonna do something different they're not totally hard to do but be

47:01.280 --> 47:06.240
considering this is a beginning video I didn't want to you know do too much in

47:06.240 --> 47:10.840
this video training video to show you so that's it and then next we'll move on

47:10.840 --> 47:16.720
to our next section okay now we're gonna work on sending mouse clicks to a given

47:16.720 --> 47:20.440
position and before we dive into the code I do want to caution you because

47:20.440 --> 47:23.840
windows often are you know are in different locations where they have

47:23.840 --> 47:27.800
something in front of it and it's not the most consistent reliable way to

47:27.800 --> 47:31.800
automate programs there's a lot of other ways I have a lot of we have webinars

47:31.800 --> 47:36.040
and tutorials on different ways to approach this however this is easy and

47:36.040 --> 47:39.200
if you're controlling the environment it's definitely something you can easily

47:39.200 --> 47:43.880
do set up and let's go ahead and dive into it here so let's pretend we're

47:43.880 --> 47:47.880
gonna click this we'll stick with the control H type thing this is the we

47:47.880 --> 47:52.160
activate the program here so this is the replace button we want to get this down

47:52.160 --> 47:55.880
the problem of course is we need to know the coordinates of where that button is

47:55.880 --> 47:59.600
right so the sending of the click is easy there's a little bit of stuff we

47:59.600 --> 48:02.920
need to figure out where we're gonna send it to so there's a really simple

48:02.920 --> 48:11.360
command it's a get no mouse get position and it's gonna ask for the the two

48:11.360 --> 48:16.040
variables to store it so you can see here output var x I'll part var y those

48:16.040 --> 48:26.000
are suggestions so we'll just call this one look x comma look why look why there

48:26.000 --> 48:31.760
we go that's all we need there and to start off let's let's do a message box

48:31.760 --> 48:41.760
oh you know what well we'll finish this here so message box and x is at and this

48:41.760 --> 48:46.200
is where we're gonna wrap our variable name the thing we just had look x with

48:46.200 --> 48:51.360
percent signs and that will make the message box display the value in the

48:51.360 --> 48:59.880
variable not the actual text that we have there so x is there and y is at

49:02.640 --> 49:09.160
that's why here we go so unfortunately right now I could run this but guess what

49:09.200 --> 49:12.760
we don't have a hot key to trigger it right so let's add a hot key let's say

49:12.760 --> 49:23.600
what let's say control oh I got a control M control P sure for position so I try to

49:23.600 --> 49:35.440
think of them as you know meaningful so it control P to get mouse position now

49:35.440 --> 49:37.920
we're of course this is gonna change later because we're gonna swap this to

49:37.960 --> 49:43.120
actually click in the position but for now it's fine so I'm gonna save this control

49:43.120 --> 49:48.160
R to reload oh I disabled my control R to let's I think I I disabled it but I

49:48.160 --> 49:52.800
didn't read restart it now control our works and this is where this I'm trying

49:52.800 --> 49:55.000
to show you a little bit of the troubleshooting while you're going through

49:55.000 --> 50:01.760
this right so control P is gonna get if I hit it right now it's saying x is at

50:01.760 --> 50:06.200
384 and y is at 58 but that was down here right so we're gonna redo this come up

50:06.240 --> 50:13.040
here now hit control P and now we have to remember 481 and 93 so actually I'm

50:13.040 --> 50:16.560
gonna leave this up here by the way any message box and on a hotkey you can come

50:16.560 --> 50:21.200
in here and hit control C and come down here and paste and it will have the

50:21.200 --> 50:26.160
contents from that message box right so it's a nice easy way to get that little

50:26.160 --> 50:34.360
insider tip there so this is gonna be the x is gonna be 481 so let's comment this

50:34.400 --> 50:42.760
out and I'm gonna keep these numbers so x is 41 and y 93 so I'm cheating here

50:42.760 --> 50:51.480
because the next thing is you know we'll just we'll make that a comment and I'll

50:51.480 --> 50:56.040
have this and now we're gonna click so we're gonna say click comma and now it's

50:56.040 --> 51:05.440
as simple we entered those numbers right so 481 comma 93 and that is that let's

51:05.440 --> 51:11.200
add a return so it doesn't keep going so I'm gonna save this reload and now when

51:11.200 --> 51:17.920
I hit control P notice it moved my mouse there oh look at that how did I get the

51:17.920 --> 51:21.560
wrong thing that's it I'm you know I we can go back and watch a video I will

51:21.560 --> 51:28.200
bet you money I was on the wrong thing when I did that so simply we will disable

51:28.200 --> 51:36.920
this re-enable this oops well I need to reload the script make sure we're over

51:36.920 --> 51:41.640
the correct thing and this is why you know you'd practice right walk it through

51:41.640 --> 51:47.320
so 435 yeah look at that I was off an 87 now the y it's this way so that one

51:47.320 --> 51:54.640
probably can say the same but the 435 this should have been 435 right because

51:54.640 --> 52:01.800
your x is going across and the y is the up and down so now I'm a save reload and

52:01.800 --> 52:06.680
hit control P and there we go so funny how I got distracted apparently and

52:06.680 --> 52:14.280
moused over the wrong item that I wanted to click now again if I had a window up

52:14.280 --> 52:18.680
in front of this it wouldn't care oops hey it wouldn't care it would have

52:18.680 --> 52:23.360
clicked you know and right here and this is why that sending of a mouse click

52:23.360 --> 52:28.360
just isn't that robust or if I move this to another monitor the coordinates are

52:28.360 --> 52:32.080
gonna be different or even if I move it like this the coordinates are gonna be

52:32.080 --> 52:35.560
different right there's a lot of reasons why this can break but this is just the

52:35.560 --> 52:39.560
simple way of hey sending a mouse click to a given coordinates often we put our

52:39.560 --> 52:43.400
windows up we maximize them and and the things don't move so it definitely can

52:43.440 --> 52:47.280
work it's just not the most robust way by the way I have a script called

52:47.280 --> 52:52.560
automate my task on my website and it it eases the pain of getting these

52:52.560 --> 52:55.920
coordinates finding an image it actually narrows it down by the controls it's

52:55.920 --> 52:59.880
pretty robust it'll search everywhere for you you just lock in the image and

52:59.880 --> 53:03.560
then say go click this or go send text to this edit field so check that out if

53:03.560 --> 53:07.720
you're interested but that's it for the sending of a mouse click to given

53:07.720 --> 53:15.520
coordinates in this section we're gonna explain how if you want to share your

53:15.520 --> 53:19.280
code with someone else or that you want to run your code on another computer you

53:19.280 --> 53:23.920
don't have to install auto hotkey it's very very easy to compile a script an

53:23.920 --> 53:27.480
auto hotkey and give it to someone else or just run another computer so let's go

53:27.480 --> 53:31.840
ahead and get started we come in here and go to explore this is the easiest way

53:31.880 --> 53:37.680
highlight the script you want right click and just say compile script right

53:37.680 --> 53:41.480
that'll actually create an executable program in the same folder it takes a

53:41.480 --> 53:45.520
couple seconds so here now I have an executable program I can take this to

53:45.520 --> 53:49.320
any Windows computer I don't have to install anything I just put it on it and

53:49.320 --> 53:52.520
run it and when you run it it'll you'll have the you know if it had a system

53:52.520 --> 53:55.400
tray icon it'll it'll have it down there let's do this with the test so I'm gonna

53:55.400 --> 53:59.400
right click say in that one compile script I'll end up here with a test dot

53:59.440 --> 54:04.920
exe and that one because we have hotkeys in it and the icon is showing it

54:04.920 --> 54:10.840
should show up here in the system tray and that's it right other languages this

54:10.840 --> 54:15.960
can take a lot of work Python in particular I would compile scripts and

54:15.960 --> 54:20.200
it was a process and it's just it's amazing that it's so easy not a hotkey

54:20.200 --> 54:24.240
to compile script and give it to someone else and if they're running even

54:24.240 --> 54:29.600
down to Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 it's very very consistent

54:29.600 --> 54:34.600
there are some things with pre Windows 7 there was no user access control and so

54:34.600 --> 54:37.520
things were slightly different so XP might be just slightly different but

54:37.520 --> 54:41.240
generally speaking they're very stable across all versions of Windows on

54:41.240 --> 54:43.840
different computers now the program itself might be a little different

54:43.840 --> 54:46.480
depending if you're sending mouse clicks in the coordinates right I mentioned

54:46.480 --> 54:52.560
that earlier but the the heart of the program stays the same so that's simple

54:54.480 --> 54:59.840
as we wrap up I wanted to share some helpful links and resources that can

54:59.840 --> 55:04.920
help you automate everything and let me jump over here on this so in this

55:04.920 --> 55:10.120
beginner page right which I'll have in the resources here there's the you know

55:10.120 --> 55:15.160
absolute documentation commands and keys these links I have these three

55:15.160 --> 55:22.280
bookmarked on my main default home page I use them a lot that documentation and

55:22.320 --> 55:24.880
commands those are great the keys are when you're just getting used to

55:24.880 --> 55:28.640
understanding what keys you want to send all three of these are just must-haves

55:28.640 --> 55:33.680
that you use in and out the forum page the overall hotkey form it's an amazing

55:33.680 --> 55:37.840
form the people are super helpful and nice you can definitely go there you can

55:37.840 --> 55:42.440
find a ton of things already solved for you there's different forms let's

55:42.440 --> 55:46.440
actually let's jump to it real quickly here and show you so the main page here

55:46.440 --> 55:50.040
breaks down into different forms so there's tutorials scripts these are

55:50.080 --> 55:54.360
completed scripts and functions here's where you go to ask for help and then

55:54.360 --> 55:58.800
down below you'll actually see here are the links to the other languages so if

55:58.800 --> 56:02.720
if English isn't your first language you can actually ask questions about that in

56:02.720 --> 56:09.160
that language which is great and so I have those here discord is also it's a

56:09.160 --> 56:13.880
live site well I shouldn't say life I put people hang out there and they will

56:13.880 --> 56:17.400
they're more than happy to help you with with what you're working on and then

56:17.400 --> 56:20.640
you can share screens and so it's a dynamic way to be able to talk to people

56:20.640 --> 56:24.160
and get some help but you do have to use this link to create an account for it

56:24.160 --> 56:29.880
by the way I like I said I have over 600 maybe so for 700 YouTube videos on

56:29.880 --> 56:34.240
auto hotkey now and I cover a lot of different topics so you can definitely

56:34.240 --> 56:41.440
go there this tutorial on specific this playlist is specifically geared towards

56:41.440 --> 56:45.120
people like you that are just starting out an auto hotkey there's not a ton of

56:45.120 --> 56:48.400
videos in there but there is a deeper dive you know we skimmed over the

56:48.400 --> 56:52.360
installing a editor and installing the program and discussing it I go a little

56:52.360 --> 56:58.000
deeper in these and then there's we've given over 50 webinars on auto hotkey

56:58.000 --> 57:04.000
and we have also I think now around yeah 65 podcasts discussing different things

57:04.000 --> 57:08.800
with automation I did mention earlier I have three Udemy courses here and if you

57:08.800 --> 57:12.280
click them from here there's a coupon code that you'll get a discount for so

57:12.280 --> 57:16.360
for the basically for the intro to auto hotkey hot strings like I said it's hot

57:16.360 --> 57:20.040
strings are just amazing and the intermediate course these are all

57:20.040 --> 57:26.880
they're roughly are between ten dollars and thirteen twelve ninety nine so if you

57:26.880 --> 57:31.320
come here you'll get the best deal that there is and I'll get more of the money

57:31.320 --> 57:34.840
it's hard to explain but Udemy if you come in from other places I end up

57:34.840 --> 57:37.600
getting a tiny fraction of the money instead of getting them from here so I

57:37.600 --> 57:40.760
appreciate if you click these links at the same time it is going to be the

57:40.760 --> 57:45.360
cheapest price you can get so that's why I have them here there are auto hotkey

57:45.360 --> 57:49.600
books by Jack Dunning Jack's been writing for over 30 years and he has a

57:49.600 --> 57:54.000
ton of auto hotkey books you can go to his blog two of the books are free and

57:54.000 --> 57:57.320
then you can download or you know order the other ones they're very reasonably

57:57.320 --> 58:00.560
priced usually between four to six dollars I think and if you're one of

58:00.560 --> 58:05.160
those people that would rather have you know it it you know a step-by-step very

58:05.160 --> 58:09.480
minutiae work it's really great because he also gives you a ton of examples of

58:09.480 --> 58:12.920
how you might use auto hotkey and that's one of things I do a lot of my

58:12.920 --> 58:17.040
videos as well as just talk through what I've automated because it's easy to kind

58:17.040 --> 58:20.320
of get caught up in doing something and not realize hey there a lot of the stuff

58:20.320 --> 58:24.600
I do daily can be automated so I hope that helps auto hotkey is a very rich

58:24.600 --> 58:28.920
robust language we didn't even scratch the surface of what it's capable of this

58:28.920 --> 58:32.400
is just to introduce you to you but you can do things like web scraping I have a

58:32.400 --> 58:37.200
screen clipping tool it'll grab text you can do regular expressions it's an

58:37.240 --> 58:41.600
object-oriented language so you can do some pretty advanced stuff but the API

58:41.600 --> 58:46.260
calls are another great one I do a lot of automating of Excel and Outlook so

58:46.260 --> 58:51.520
sending emails or automating reporting in Excel anything with the Microsoft

58:51.520 --> 58:55.280
Office program you can basically connect to programmatically and really well

58:55.280 --> 59:01.240
drive it so go ahead and check it out my site alone if you come up to the main

59:01.240 --> 59:04.920
site here there's there's you know a lot of different things in here that you can

59:04.960 --> 59:09.480
learn about with using functions where they so here's the functions controlling

59:09.480 --> 59:14.040
programs with controls that's another really great one the web scraping I

59:14.040 --> 59:18.240
mentioned with either IE or now with Chrome which you can see in here again

59:18.240 --> 59:21.800
it's web scraping Excel Auto Hockey Studio once you get a little bit more

59:21.800 --> 59:26.280
robust is an amazing editor it's a default editor I use now but I do have

59:26.280 --> 59:30.240
all these videos on site on how to customize site and to do some advanced

59:30.240 --> 59:34.880
stuff thank you for watching my video if you found it helpful please like

59:34.920 --> 59:39.040
it now and share if you think that others will benefit from it the more you

59:39.040 --> 59:42.640
share the more we get likes we get the more videos like this we can make and

59:42.640 --> 59:46.840
it just helps support us also if you're interested you can go to my site and go

59:46.840 --> 59:50.400
to sign up for our alerts basically we send out alerts of new stuff new videos

59:50.400 --> 59:55.200
new things we've learned new concepts of how to do Auto Hockey and automation as

59:55.200 --> 59:58.600
well as just things you might want to automate so we hope to see you there

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.760
thanks again cheers
