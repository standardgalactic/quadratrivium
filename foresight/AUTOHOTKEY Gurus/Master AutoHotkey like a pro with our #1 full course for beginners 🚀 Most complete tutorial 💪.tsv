0	5320	Hello and thank you for watching this AutoHotKey tutorial for beginners. In this
5320	8040	video we're going to cover a lot of different topics. We're going to start
8040	12120	off discussing which versions of AutoHotKey to use, then we're going to
12120	15960	cover which editor to use. There's a lot of different editors out there and I've
15960	19400	tried a lot of them. The one I recommend is by far the easiest to start with.
19400	23040	Then we're going to jump into doing some some little pre-work. We're going to use
23040	27040	hotkeys which is actually a tool that you can use in AutoHotKey to launch
27040	30520	programs and stuff, but we're going to first use them to work smarter, not
30520	34160	harder. We're going to learn how to use them to edit our code and make it faster
34160	37280	as we develop code. Then I'm going to show you how to launch programs and
37280	41280	scripts and load a website with them. Then next we're going to jump into using
41280	45040	hot strings. The hot string as you can think of is like a text expansion type
45040	48680	thing. So you type a couple letters and bam there goes a lot of text whatever
48680	52840	you want to put in there. After that I show you a script where there's about
53280	58120	4,000 words in a spell check. What's great about AutoHotKey is any Windows
58120	61480	program you're in you can have this script running and it will spell check
61480	65240	across all your programs. It's another just a great example of hot strings. Then
65240	68920	we switch back to using a few more hotkeys where we show you how to remap
68920	73520	codes. Let's say you're using Outlook and you don't like a hotkey to launch a new
73520	76680	email. I'll teach you how you can hit a different key combination and it will
76680	80960	send the key combination that Outlook knows. It's a great way if you don't
81000	86440	like the programs you're using to remap the keys. Then we work on how to send a
86440	89480	mouse click to given coordinates. Of course first you have to understand you
89480	92160	know identify where those coordinates are and then we send the mouse clicks
92160	96040	there. Lastly we wrap up on the programming side of being able to
96040	98920	compile a script and this is a really great thing about AutoHotKey. It's
98920	103280	super super easy to compile a script and that way you can use it on a
103280	107160	different computer where it doesn't have AutoHotKey installed or you can give it
107160	110480	to a friend and they can write it on their Windows computer. At the very end of
110480	114720	this script video I have a lot of resources where where to go when you
114720	117840	get in trouble. A lot of great sources where you have live support where people
117840	121000	are just willing to help you. The AutoHotKey community and forum the people
121000	125640	are just great and very helpful. My site I have a lot of tutorials on them but
125640	129400	this is places where you can go directly and get one-to-one help. In this
129400	132760	video you'll notice I mentioned a lot of stuff. There's a lot of pop-ups with the
132760	136040	actual links you know and hyperlinks of where you can go. Just make sure you
136040	139160	check in the description down below because I'm going to put in the time
139200	142840	codes of exactly in the video when it was and the URL there is too. So you don't
142840	146680	have to try to type the URLs right so make sure you wait for that and I
146680	149440	really appreciate you watching this video. Please like it if you think it
149440	153640	really helped you. I spent quite a bit of time on this video to make sure that it
153640	158080	really helps new people so I hope you like this tutorial for beginners. Cheers.
158080	161920	In case is the first video you've seen of me my name is Joe Glynes and I'm from
161920	166720	the Automator and I teach people how to automate their PCs. I love it's my
166760	170880	passion to help people work smarter not harder. Come to my site check it out. I
170880	175880	have over 600 videos on YouTube. I have three Udemy courses teaching AutoHotKey
175880	179200	so all these are great resources. There's also some great AutoHotKey books out
179200	183920	there but check us out. Also if at some point you want to get some work done for
183920	187960	you now I have people working for me that will automate things. So drop me a
187960	192520	note my email will be in this description and please like the video if you
192520	195440	think it was helpful and looking forward to get going here. Cheers.
196800	200440	Alright so the first thing we have to do is to download and install AutoHotKey.
200440	205000	So let's go ahead and navigate to AutoHotKey.com in any browser. When you
205000	207520	get there you're going to see this button that says download. Go ahead and
207520	211560	click it. It's going to ask you which of these three options do you want. Always
211560	215440	download the current version. The other two I don't want to get into it. It's a
215440	219040	bit advanced to why. There's a lot of logic later that you might choose on but
219040	222040	for now we're going to download the current version. Go ahead and save it. I
222040	226040	already have it here on my desktop. It's a small file here. I'm going to say I'm just
226040	232960	going to replace it and now once it's here I'm going to say open when done and
232960	237640	it's going to come up with the setup files that you want to install. Now Windows
237640	242640	now is trying to think that maybe this is a bad thing. Go ahead and click run
242640	247520	anyway. It's going to come up with this window. Now the default isn't this
247520	252560	express installation. For reasons I don't want to get into it's it's it's not what
252560	256680	I recommend right and most people say do the custom installation instead of doing
256680	261760	the Unicode 64 bit to the Unicode 32 bit and it just it works with more scripts
261760	266440	you find online so it's just safer 64 a bit isn't necessarily better it's just
266440	270680	different and you can install wherever you like. I'm just go ahead and hit next. I
270680	274040	take the defaults on this screen as well. I take all the defaults don't change
274040	280240	anything and basically you're done. Now that we have a hotkey installed let's
280240	284400	work on getting an editor or an IDE and IDE is short for integrated development
284400	290160	environment and I highly highly recommend you install something. I'm going to
290160	293440	recommend site for Auto hotkey it's written specifically for using with
293440	298240	Auto hotkey. Technically you could use either notepad or wordpad or almost
298240	302200	anything that can edit a text file because the Auto hotkey code is written
302200	305120	in plain text and that just means when you open it you'll see the actual
305120	307880	characters and words there and you can recognize them and you could save it
307880	311840	however there's a lot of functionality that using text pad wouldn't allow you
311840	317480	to do like relaunch the script or assist you in typing the code you might
317480	321840	want or hit F1 highlight a word hit F1 and bring up the support Auto hotkey
321840	326160	support all of these things site will do for you automatically. Let's go ahead
326160	330720	let me share my screen here and on the main page that we're working from I have
330720	334760	a download for Auto hotkey site for Auto hotkey here so let's go I'm going to
334760	338040	click this right now and we'll get it started here it's not a big program this
338040	341960	is from my site I just make it for convenience because it might disappear
341960	345040	in the form at some point that's going to download it we'll run it here in a
345040	349600	second but what I wanted to point out is if you come up here there's this whole
349600	354360	page dedicated to videos where I've taught people how to do it looks like I
354360	359280	have at least 18 videos there I'm doing some advanced stuff now I don't recommend
359280	362280	you start off here right because the great thing about site and you'll realize
362320	366160	this when we start programming it is it's super easy it has a nice tool bar it
366160	369840	has a lot of functionality it doesn't take a lot of learning there's not a
369840	373440	steep learning curve and yet it's very simple easy to use so let's go ahead and
373440	377600	install it I'm gonna I'm gonna hit Ctrl G and Chrome that'll well let's see I can
377600	381920	do it right here I don't have to do that I'm gonna say open right so I don't
381920	385080	have to navigate to it now it's gonna come up and say do you want the quick
385080	390080	setup install I'm gonna hit install just to see what it's doing my default
390080	393320	location is gonna be different than yours don't worry about that install
393320	397440	wherever you want it you should it'll find auto hotkeys main install file and
397440	401560	that's where mine is and then you're gonna click install but it's gonna come up
401560	404640	and just say hey do you want to run these updates there's two updates it'll
404640	408360	download and just say yes and that's it and then sites installed you have this
408360	413840	nice toolbar up here it's a clean input interface so when you have the vertical
413840	418040	split on this vertical split leave it off I would recommend it I think it
418040	421080	makes more sense to have it down here mine just happened to be closed up so
421080	424680	this is where you'll see output and this is where you'll see a lot of debug
424680	428600	information mainly the big one is like hey the scripted launch and there's a
428600	433760	problem like if we put something here and try to launch it it wants to save it
433760	440560	first well fine save hotkeys script great now if I try to launch it it's gonna
440560	445200	tell me hey this file has a problem specifically hey what in the world is
445200	450000	our EFFD it tells you where it is right often they'll tell you the line that the
450000	454440	problem's on but this is this little stuff that it really helps you understand
454440	459120	what in the world's going on with your your script so I highly recommend you
459120	464720	install there's also notepad plus plus HK studio which is the editor I use now
464720	469600	but it's more advanced and this is by far the easiest to install easiest to pick
469600	473480	up and use it's really a great advanced program for editing any kind of text
473480	476640	there's a lot of search and replace stuff you can do in it so now let's go
476640	482420	ahead and get into coding all right now that we have site and auto hotkey
482420	485440	installed let's go ahead and start working on our first script so we're
485440	488720	gonna jump in here and I just have a folder this folder it's in my temp
488720	495000	directory and it's just keeping all the files together for me so go in somewhere
495000	499760	right-click and say new and I'm gonna say new auto hotkey script now this is
499760	503160	gonna generate a little bit of code in this file see it's one kilobyte it's not
503160	509000	zero and we're gonna call this thing test I'm gonna hit right inner key to save
509000	513840	it save the renaming and now I'm gonna right-click again and say edit and
513840	518400	because site was installed it's the default editor it is gonna open this
518400	523880	script in site for us and so we can see several things here this is really
523880	527360	helpful is that notice this color coding if we open this file notepad this would
527360	531440	just all be black text and it's it's this is where having site installed is
531440	536720	really helpful to allow you to easily see this stuff things that begin with the
536720	540080	pound sign they're called directives and we don't need to get into all the
540080	542440	advanced stuff about that but I'm trying to point out they're a little
542440	547240	different than other things just no end it's it's we don't need to go into the
547240	551240	explanation of it you could comment it out you don't necessarily need it it's
551240	556160	recommended but you don't have to have it in there control Q in site will toggle
556160	560600	so I could I could highlight a bunch of these and it would toggle them but it
560600	564240	will comment them out so that's control Q we'll leave it enabled it doesn't matter
564240	570560	this sent now these two are commands and send mode input this is the most
570560	574560	reliable and it's fast so we're gonna leave that enabled we'll use send a
574560	579200	little bit later a send command and the set working directory that basically
579200	582880	says hey when I'm accessing stuff use the the directory that I'm in is the
582880	586960	default directory so it's a good thing to have I definitely recommend having it
586960	592800	notice this auto assist this is why I love site also in in notepad you wouldn't
592800	596120	have any of this and it's really much more complicated so I'm gonna hit it
596120	601760	enter to accept that comma and we're gonna say force what this does it says
601760	611600	hey only launch one instance of this script so if the script was already
611600	615800	running it would basically relaunch it for you if it wasn't running a launch
615800	619360	it if you'd launch it again it will say hey there's already one running don't run
619360	622560	two instance of this only run one I don't understand why this isn't the
622560	627800	default in every script it should be it's used all the time right so I use
627800	634160	this is 99.9% of my scripts it should be in every script as the default you
634160	637120	actually can go in a site you could change that or you know somewhere and
637120	640360	you can change that this is the default value to have in there I highly
640400	646320	encourage you to add it to yours and so this gets us going and now I'm gonna
646320	650640	stop here and then we're gonna switch to actually working with hotkeys because
650640	653520	we have a couple other things I want to put in this but I want to keep these
653520	657920	compartmentalized while we're talking about directives and settings this is
657920	660360	stuff that's for your script or other things you could put in here and over
660360	663040	time you might learn you might want to have the next thing we're gonna get into
663040	666480	is actually creating hotkeys to do some stuff that really helps speed up your
666520	673160	coding. All right so let's jump into making our first script now before we
673160	676560	actually do some fun coding stuff I'm gonna demonstrate a couple things to
676560	680680	add to your main script the one that you're working in to make it easier to
680680	685640	develop code so let's go ahead and start sharing here and we're gonna jump in now
685640	690080	to start off let me show you there's this script right now is not running I
690080	694120	can tell that one easy way is looking in here there's no green little green H's
694120	702320	in here so we're gonna say let's say message box hello world now I'm gonna
702320	708960	save this and when I hit this blue run it's going to or I could hit a five it's
708960	714800	going to launch this script so notice two things here one here's the hello
714800	719320	world message box this is the joseph's which script we're in and see this green
719320	723800	H down here right this is telling us this script is running the second I hit
723800	727920	okay here I also want you to notice something with this green H I hit okay
727920	732300	and suddenly it's gone right why is that well there was nothing else in this
732300	736160	script to keep it running keep it active and there are a couple things that
736160	739040	you could do to do that if you had a hot key or a hot string in it it would
739040	744240	automatically stay running you could add a single persistent a directive called
744240	748800	persistent and this would keep it running so if I save this we launch it the
748800	753320	message box comes up here's our green H when I said okay it stays running now it
753320	756240	wouldn't do anything because there's nothing else in this so we don't we
756240	764800	won't leave this in here but so we're gonna add that in our little pile of
764800	770720	things to keep in memory I'll just remember so this next one what we're
770720	779640	gonna do is let's say we wanted to be able to easily edit this script now
779640	782960	there's a couple ways we could do it right now because it's running and it's
782960	788120	down here I could right click on this and say edit so even if site was closed
788120	793840	yeah changes I can right click it here and say edit and it's gonna open in my
793840	798280	default editor which is site I could also come into the main script here and
798280	802320	right click it and say edit and it will pull it up but that would be really
802320	806240	tedious if you had closed site and you wanted to always edit it so what I love
806240	812240	to do and we're gonna do this with a hot key is a let's start dabbling in hot
812240	818960	key so there are things called modifier keys and those the main four are
818960	825400	control alt shift in the windows key those and auto hot key and so let's add
825400	835480	some comments here so the alt key is the exclamation point the the windows key
835480	853320	is the pound and I'm not yet the shift key is the plus sign and well control key
853320	862120	sorry and and this is the carrot which is above your six so these on their own
862120	864760	we wouldn't use these by themselves but they're called modifiers and that's
864760	871120	because you use them in conjunction with another letter or or or another key so
871120	881120	let's say every time I hit we'll do control H we want that to run message
881120	885840	box hello world now I'm gonna add a return here which basically tells auto
885840	891720	hot key to stop stop going forward after from that point on so I'm gonna save
891720	897000	this always remember you have to save and reload it or hit f5 so now it's
897000	899880	rerun it this is another reason this output window here this can tell you if
899880	906720	there's errors where what line the errors on so notepad doesn't have this and
906720	909800	this is where it's really nice so I can when I relaunch this you'll see it flash
909800	914960	also notice when I relaunch it you'll see it down here at blinks and so it's a
914960	919400	great way to make sure you understand the changes were absorbed or used so now
919400	924520	I'm gonna hit control H and bam there we go right and now if I hit enter it's
924520	928460	gonna get rid of it but look I can hit control H again and it pulls it up so
928460	932680	this is a hot key that's gonna launch whatever is between here and here I
932680	938640	could put a second let's say I wanted to do this so now it'll have two so if I
938640	943360	now I have to relaunch it again now this is the point of what I'm gonna show
943360	948520	here in a second is control H and it's gonna say hello and then world right so
948520	952160	we're using our hot key to use a message display a message box with a value in
952160	956160	it I'm not overly useful but you get the idea of I can trigger this we can also
956160	959240	trigger other things which we'll cover here in a minute but before we get to
959240	966640	that let's say I want to automatically reload this script instead of having to
966640	970960	come in here and launch it and then hit right click and say reload or relaunch
970960	974960	so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change this to control R so it makes sense to me
974960	979280	this is a really powerful thing in auto hot key I think it's really under you
979280	984120	know you don't understood of that I can make it what makes sense to me right so
984120	990880	I'm gonna change this to control R and I'm gonna add the command edit now this
990880	993640	is a special command let me also demonstrate here if I highlight if I'm
993640	998800	in a word and I hit F1 it will pull up the auto hot key help and that's built
998800	1002960	into site also so this is a really great thing here the site document I'm sorry
1002960	1006720	the auto hot key documentation is excellent you can read about it and
1006720	1010920	then usually at the bottom it'll show you an example or two of how to use the
1010920	1015400	commands so I highly recommend again using site and then using that F1 when
1015400	1019160	you get stuck and don't not sure what it is so what is this gonna do well I'm
1019160	1024440	gonna save this and relaunch it so it takes it in now you know what let's
1024440	1032800	let's add here oh I don't want that that should have been reload there we go
1032800	1037040	and let's look at reload real quick so replaces the current running instance of
1037040	1039880	the script with a new one right so that's kind of what we're doing with this
1039880	1044360	F5 we're relaunching it of course reload only works if it's already running but
1044360	1051000	I'm gonna save this rerun it now watch what happens if I hit control R it it's
1051040	1057000	funny it reloads it but it because it triggers the reload let me let me do
1057000	1069520	this a smart way so I'm gonna save this and now hit R control R and now when I'm
1069520	1074000	hitting control R so see it says it will reload now when I hit okay it's gonna
1074000	1078840	trigger that reload and notice the green H blink down here so again control R it's
1078840	1081880	gonna pull up the message box and then do the okay I just wanted the message box
1081880	1087240	to show you we're actually in here right so now if I really hit just control R
1087240	1092400	it's gonna well the first time through now it's gonna reload it right so I can
1092400	1095880	just hit control R I don't have to come up here and hit f5 f5 is hard for me on
1095880	1100560	my keyboard to reach so it's a nice handy one to be able to say hey I want to I
1100560	1105720	want to make these changes and control R will do that for us because see how it
1105720	1109960	reloads it for us so it's a super helpful one to have in here I also want to
1109960	1117480	point out if your command is more than one line then you need the return if
1117480	1121560	it's not more than one line so let me comment this out this is only one line
1121560	1124640	right we can bring this one up here and a lot of these can be put on the same
1124640	1129760	line and if we do it on the same line you don't actually need the return so I'm
1129760	1135200	gonna save this hit control R again now it's reloading for us so it's great
1135240	1140520	because I can just hit control R and have it reload for me now another one
1140520	1145680	which is really helpful to have so we're gonna say control E to edit and now
1145680	1161200	this is the one that I was started to work on earlier here so this so here are
1161200	1165040	two that I will just love having in here so now I'm gonna hit control R to
1165040	1170360	take that now if site was not open I can hit control E and it is going to edit
1170360	1175840	this file it's gonna pull it up for us so these two hotkeys in the main script
1175840	1179160	that you're working on are entity and again you don't have to use control R
1179160	1183520	right that's my example but it's super helpful for helping you speed up what
1183520	1186360	you're doing when you're coding because I don't have to come down here and right
1186360	1191080	click and say reload or come up here with my mouse or hit F5 the control R and
1191160	1195880	whatever's convenient for you are super easy to do and then what I often will
1195880	1200680	do is I will use something to trigger so this is this is often much more how
1200680	1208960	hotkeys are used is let's say I'll do control M for a message box and let's
1208960	1214760	put that on the next line so message box hello world and now because that is
1214760	1219160	going on the next line I'm pretty sure let's just test it I could have moved
1219240	1226120	this up here and I'm gonna hit control R the say see this asterisk up here that
1226120	1230920	means there's been changes that haven't been actually saved yet so now it's saved
1230920	1236400	it now control R will relaunch it and I can do control M for my hello world
1236400	1243280	control E to edit which is I'm already in it so if I was to close this I can
1243280	1246840	hit control E and they'll pull it up and control R you can see it blinking down
1246880	1250560	below in the bottom right so these are our three things now that with this
1250560	1255640	message box I want to demonstrate you can do other things with hotkeys right so
1255640	1260960	let's let's say I wanted to launch Chrome that one let's start off with notepad
1260960	1264680	because notepad is a little easier and let's do control in now control in is
1264680	1270320	already a hotkey in site right now if I don't say this I hit control in it's
1270320	1276080	gonna open a new tab for me right but I want to use control in in a different
1276080	1285280	way so I'm going to say run notepad now I don't have I'll add it here you don't
1285280	1289160	have to have the exe and notepad especially you don't need the entire
1289160	1294040	path because notepad is in the windows path and so but I wanted to start off
1294040	1299000	with it to keep it simple so I'm gonna say control S control R to reload and
1299000	1303080	then I'm gonna say control N unfortunately it launched notepad on my
1303080	1307200	other screen here but let me bring it over here close it now if I control and
1307200	1312040	again yeah it remembers where it was so I just made a hotkey to launch notepad
1312040	1317200	but let's say we want to launch something that's not in the windows path
1317200	1321080	well you could we could say well I'm gonna come down here got our properties
1321080	1326560	I'm gonna get the full path and here this to the left I have my running in
1326560	1331940	debug mode but this is the path to Chrome and so I'm gonna say and control C
1331940	1334940	would be a terrible one right because that's copy so we don't want to replace
1334940	1342100	copy so let's do alt C so I'm gonna do the alt C remember you got to use look
1342100	1347580	up here alt you know the exclamation is the alt key so alt C and then we're
1347580	1352060	gonna say run and here paste in this more often than not you don't need the
1352060	1355540	double quotes around it but let's we'll just leave them here so I'm gonna save
1355540	1363380	this reload it control R and alt C now alt C will launch Chrome for me right
1363380	1367860	and you can do this with almost any Windows program you can launch it this
1367860	1371020	way get the full path to it sometimes there's a little things what you need to
1371020	1375820	have the set a given directory can run into some headaches or if you want to
1375820	1381020	open a certain file you can add a space here and add the path to the file after
1381020	1389740	it but being able to launch programs is a great simple thing and that's it for
1389740	1396900	this one let's let's do one other one so the Windows key so Windows let's say
1397900	1405740	Windows G and what is anything that starts with G we'll just do something
1405740	1416700	run grepwin so I'm gonna go to properties this is the path to my file
1416700	1420420	there we go no that one doesn't have the double quotes but it should be fine I'm
1420420	1425020	ready this is the portable version of it so I'm gonna save this sorry save it
1425020	1430780	reload it and now the Windows key G will launch grepwin for me grepwin is a
1430780	1435300	search tool that will search across files in your computer it's free I highly
1435340	1439820	recommend it if you need to search text in inside files but anyway you just see
1439820	1444740	it now I use the Windows key the alt key let's do one more with shift so we're
1444740	1450940	gonna do a shift and shift obviously the shift with a letter would be bad on
1450940	1454140	its own right because you want to capitalize letters but we'll just do
1454140	1461820	shift T and you know I'm gonna be lazy and run calc I think it's calc.exe so if
1461820	1470940	I hit shift T oh I didn't I didn't save it save it reload it shift T just ran my
1470940	1477540	calculator so there I used the the four main modifiers shift windows alt and
1477540	1481660	control to demonstrate how you can launch programs you could launch other
1481660	1486380	scripts you could launch web pages you could you could actually you know what
1486380	1490900	let me let me let me demonstrate that I launched a browser however let's say we
1490940	1497340	wanted to and you know what this will be a good one for the Windows G is let's
1497340	1502620	say we wanted to run a certain website so here I would put in you know what I
1502620	1506460	don't like I want to save this so we have it as an example but I'm gonna
1506460	1509940	comment to that you know what let's demonstrate this I'm gonna leave those
1509940	1513100	both there I'm gonna say run
1513940	1521620	so I'm gonna save this when I hit reload notice it says hey there's a
1521620	1527020	duplicate hotkey you can't have the same hotkey in the same script because it
1527020	1530180	will cause a problem it won't know which one to run so it warns you that's
1530180	1533700	another great thing about this is it warns you so I'm just for now I'm gonna
1533700	1538180	comment this out if it was running in another script it would have launched and
1538180	1542180	it would have just used the most recently launched one so so this though
1542180	1546140	what I wanted to demonstrate was oh you know what actually I call it Windows G
1546140	1553860	because I wanted to run Google there we go so control R now it reloaded now when
1553860	1560660	I hit Windows G it launches my default browser and takes me to that web page so
1560660	1564980	this is how I could easily do a search so let's that'll wrap this up here with
1564980	1569420	dealing with hotkeys and these these ones I like to add in the just ease I I
1569460	1573500	put something similar to this in every one of the scripts I'm working on that
1573500	1577580	I'm adjusting I always have it running in that script and then when I'm finally
1577580	1581660	done with it I either comment them out or I'll remove them because I'll have
1581660	1584900	another one that I'm working on and I only put those in what the active script
1584900	1591980	that I'm trying to develop okay the next thing we're covering are called hot
1591980	1597340	strings or you can think of them as text expansion for me they are the lowest
1597340	1601620	hanging fruit the simplest thing you can learn today and be using it and be more
1601620	1606580	efficient at a computer they're so simple and important and save so much
1606580	1611260	time it was the first Udemy course that my colleague Jackie and I built on Udemy
1611260	1615100	because they just they're huge time savers they're way overlooked by
1615100	1618620	everybody and they're just one of those little things once you get them you
1618620	1623580	realize you do type the same things over and over and over and they're really
1623580	1627660	helpful so let's go ahead and start working on them what we're gonna do is
1627660	1632460	let's let's do in a little example here so let's say I I hey I type my email
1632460	1638260	address a lot right so I'm gonna put in two colons and think to yourself what
1638260	1642140	what do I want to type as the abbreviation for my email address so I'm
1642140	1647540	gonna say JTA because this email address happens to be Joe at theautomanner.com
1647980	1652980	and then you put in the two more colons and then you type what you want Joe at
1652980	1658860	the-automater.com notice you make sure you put it in the case you want like
1658860	1662780	uppercase here I uppercase my A right because I want that to come through but
1662780	1667700	I don't want it here and I want my first name to be capitalized and so I'm gonna
1667700	1671300	save this since I still have this running I'm a hit control R now it just
1671300	1676220	absorbed it now when I type JTA period now it didn't do it right then but when I
1676260	1681460	hit a space a return or a tab basically any kind of ending character it swaps
1681460	1685740	that out for me right so it's it's a very simple thing to be able to learn how
1685740	1690580	to do you can replicate this to your hearts and this will work I could open
1690580	1694860	up do I have a hot key a control in will open up notepad JTA period space
1694860	1700460	there's my email address right it's it is just the simplest thing in the world
1700700	1707540	you could put in paragraphs of text like let's say also we wanted let's say we
1707540	1711580	wanted to have it have a line break so I'm gonna do this till day which is to the
1711580	1715900	left of the number one till day in stands for like a new line feed is the
1715900	1721620	actual character for it so and make sure if you do edit your own add it into the
1721620	1724420	script here that you don't try to save it or load it because that'll cause an
1724420	1736140	error so new Joe Joe the automator is tick my tick in email to can address I'm
1736140	1742420	gonna save this I'm gonna control R to reload let's go back to notepad now when
1742420	1749220	I type JTA period space it put it across different lines right it out of the line
1749220	1753300	so if you wanted to have multiple things in here there is a character limit on
1753300	1757700	how many you can do in this structure however you can have up to like 16,000
1757700	1764420	characters in a different way you can look at the the hot strings help which on
1764420	1767980	that way at my win webpage for this beginner course I have a link to it
1767980	1774060	about how to do continuous in sections but it's really that simple and so here
1774060	1779220	let's get back I mean I'm gonna hit control D which is a hot key in site for
1779220	1785140	duplicate the line and I'm gonna get back into my email address where when I
1785140	1790060	save this control R to reload come into notepad you know what I think I can see
1790060	1794900	if I can type down here yeah I can dump it in here so see that space at the end
1794900	1803100	well often I'm using my email address or in a as the user area in username for a
1803100	1806180	form and I don't want that space at the end because that of course would break it
1806180	1812420	so it's a simple change in auto hotkey is just add an O in between the first two
1812420	1819820	colons now when I save this and reload it when I come in here and type JTA
1819820	1825100	period now watch what happens when I hit space so notice where my cursor is it's
1825100	1829100	right at that M it didn't add the space at the end and so it's a very simple
1829100	1833820	thing to adjust where if I am using a email address or maybe a password now
1833860	1838300	you know do discretion if you're saving passwords because the password will be
1838300	1841980	stored in a plain text file that's easily visible by anybody right there's
1841980	1847180	ways around it and I have a video on that somewhere but it is they're not
1847180	1850740	secure so just be careful with it but it's very convenient to be able to do
1850740	1854260	this so things like you know just some things you just don't want to space out
1854260	1857780	of the end sometimes you want to it might be plural sometimes not and this is an
1857780	1861100	easy way to do it without having a backspace to get rid of that extra
1861100	1865420	space another example that I want to demonstrate in this will wrap up the
1865420	1874020	basic hot strings is there are certain characters because up here this windows
1874020	1879100	key the the pound sign the alt key this exclamation point this carrot is
1879100	1885500	control auto hotkey interpretees is very special characters right so you can't
1885500	1892760	let's say we were doing this see the STB if you're a signfold fan you'll get
1892760	1898580	this you have to see the baby exclamation point right so I'm gonna save
1898580	1902660	this reload it now when I come in here and I'm doing it down here because if I
1902660	1907060	do it here and I save it it'll break my code right so I'm typing in here STB
1907060	1912740	period space hey it said you have to see the baby but no explanation point right
1912740	1917820	why is there no exclamation point well that's because it literally thought hey
1917820	1923700	let's send the alt key right because it's a special character so the easy there's
1923700	1927340	two ways very simple ways to take care of it there are other ways we're gonna
1927340	1931580	handle two of them right here the first way is to wrap this anytime you have a
1931580	1936240	special character this wrap it with these curly braces and save remember save
1936240	1942580	reload reload watch that green H flash now STB periods now see it has the
1942620	1948260	exclamation point so that's option one option two is you can leave this the
1948260	1954020	original way but put an R in between here so I'm gonna save this reload it
1954020	1961420	there it goes and STB period space and that works also notice here we have the
1961420	1966020	space which is perfectly fine but I could put the O in combination with the R
1966460	1973820	save it reload it come down here see the space and now we have it without the
1973820	1978140	extra space right so even though this works like looks like the word or it's
1978140	1982060	not auto hotkey you can put multiple things in here and it's a simple easy
1982060	1986580	way let me do one more one more fun one that's it's good to know is if you don't
1986580	1991140	want to wait for that tab or space you want that hotkey to get replaced right
1991180	1999140	away you can use another one here is you put in the asterisk so here is let's
1999140	2007260	say HW period oh actually you know I don't want the period here so there we
2007260	2014620	go so this is gonna send hello world save it reload it now watch what happens
2014620	2019700	right when I hit the W so H now the second I hit the W it dumps it in right
2019700	2024340	I didn't have to hit that space or a tab or return after so those are three things
2024340	2029980	you can easily adjust in hot strings again hot strings to me this may it might
2029980	2034900	to some of you seem very simple and then oh maybe I'll use that maybe I won't I
2034900	2040900	can't stress how much you realize you type the same words or same URLs or
2040900	2046300	passwords or email addresses or names of companies over and over and over or even
2046300	2051180	entire paragraphs right so there's this is a lifesaver it just saves so much
2051180	2055220	time and in a second here we're switch over to launching a spell check that
2055220	2058420	will run again this will work in any program right I could have been a notepad
2058420	2063380	and it'll dump it in right any Windows program so it's running across all of
2063380	2067500	your tools some every once in a while you have a little problem sending to it
2067500	2070860	and that's also check out my my Udemy course or just read the search and read
2070860	2074620	the help you know I push my Udemy courses little just because they give a good
2074620	2078460	guide it's not that I want to make a ton of money it's I don't mind making money
2078460	2082540	but it's it's that they give a nice flow and they cover things they give you an
2082540	2086940	order and some people really like having the structure in the order so let's get
2086940	2090820	into the next one with using a spell check
2092140	2097820	alright this spell check I found on the forum years ago and I tried backtracking
2097820	2101540	it to get the documentation where I found it but I couldn't find it anyway it
2101820	2105980	has nearly 4,000 words in it and it's great because no matter what program I'm
2105980	2109380	in in Windows as long as the script is running it is doing the spell check for
2109380	2115460	me across all of those Windows anywhere I'm typing so let's jump into it you can
2115460	2120660	get it off of this main page and I'll put a link in this video too but on this
2120660	2124740	main page down here download spell check I'm gonna right-click and say save
2124740	2130400	link as and here we're gonna save it for now I'm gonna save it let's go to the
2130400	2135260	where I have those other files saved
2135260	2139080	a lot of key for beginners here we go and I'm gonna call it spell check that's
2139080	2143680	fine save it now it's gonna save it I'm not gonna launch it here what I want to
2143680	2151160	do is let's look at that directory and I'm gonna come in here and say edit oh
2151160	2155920	gotta highlight it edit script and now this is gonna pull it up and I want to
2155920	2161560	talk through a couple of things before we launch it notice these here's the
2161560	2166400	source just so you have it here too this is where you can get it from and that no
2166400	2169840	environment we're familiar with they're ready single lessons force absolutely
2169840	2174760	send mode input great this one is basically turning off because these are
2174760	2178360	spelled properly right so it turns off the back spacing for for some of these
2178360	2183240	hot strings so because those are often people the spell check will think it's
2183240	2187720	misspelled but it's not and so we're turning it off for that in here and I
2187720	2192520	hear examples and look how big this file is right like I said it has got 4,000
2192520	2198520	words that will auto correct for you so it's a really helpful script let's go
2198520	2208600	ahead and do a demo down let's pick the one I let's do America so sometimes
2208600	2212520	apparently people forget the sea because I guess there's no seas in America maybe
2212560	2217800	few oceans but let's say America notice the star here so it's not going to wait
2217800	2220520	for us for an ending character right it's gonna do the replacement right away
2220520	2224240	and but unfortunately I haven't I haven't actually launched this yet right
2224240	2229600	and right now in the system trade we don't have anything running right now
2229600	2233080	this one has been killed for now but let's go ahead what I want to do is to
2233080	2239680	come back into where we saved it and I'm gonna get the path to this file so come
2239680	2245960	in here copy this go back to site here and this is actually going to cause a
2245960	2251160	problem but I want to demonstrate this as well so I'm gonna say run because we
2251160	2255760	wanted to run the script this is the folder and then it's what was it spell
2255760	2262440	underscore I can see it at the top there in the other tab check HK now if I was to
2262440	2267240	save this and we launched this script we see the one green H running here it's
2267240	2271960	just test right but hey why didn't that launch the other script well the problem
2271960	2277120	is we if we have a hot key or if I had a return this top part of your script is
2277120	2281080	the auto exec script and it happens up until you come down to like a hot key or
2281080	2285000	return like that so what we want to do is things that we want to launch we want
2285000	2289680	to have it at the top part of your scripts and so now I'm gonna save this
2289680	2295880	now if I relaunch this or hit ctrl R you're gonna notice over here now we have
2295880	2299200	two green ages and it's unfortunate that it always puts in that same default
2299200	2303960	icon and and this is where it gets really confusing if you have a lot of
2303960	2309040	scripts running any given time I typically have like five to seven scripts
2309040	2314360	running at a given time all the time right for this example video I've
2314360	2319760	ripped everything out so I don't confuse anybody but remember this needs to be at
2319760	2324880	the top in your auto exec section otherwise it won't it won't get to it
2324880	2330360	basically it stops it it stops before it reaches it now there's an easy quote
2330360	2334880	unquote cure for this one is at the top here again if we don't want these two
2334880	2339040	green ages well hey the spell check I want it running all the time I don't it's
2339040	2343240	rare I'm gonna edit that file so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come in here and
2343240	2349240	that's why I've added this here is this no tray icon if I save this and you know
2349240	2353520	what I could launch it from here but let's come back in we don't even have to
2353520	2358080	be here I can just hit control R and you'll notice the the green H is gonna
2358080	2363400	go away so I'm gonna hit control R now that other green H isn't there but the
2363400	2367560	script is still running and I'll demonstrate that by coming in here
2367560	2375600	let's come back down to our America example there we go so I'm gonna start
2375600	2381920	typing AMERIA and notice it put in the C right so the script is still
2381960	2386960	running but we don't have it in the system tray there's some some major
2386960	2389800	benefits of this is that if you have a lot of scripts going it doesn't get
2389800	2393920	confusing down here the drawback of course is I couldn't come in here and
2393920	2398920	right-click and say edit so it can make it it can be a pain and I have another
2398920	2404240	script that you can use that'll it'll show you all running scripts I could go
2404240	2407400	to my task manager and I could find it from there and right-click and kill it
2407400	2411680	or I could come back in here and I could just you know go to edit it I could I
2411680	2415520	could even find it in here and right-click and say edit right so I can
2415520	2420280	get to it that way but it just won't be in your system tray and you can change
2420280	2423800	the icons like in some of my other scripts I have it where I change icons I
2423800	2427800	even have a script to automate changing the icon so Google that on my on my
2427800	2433240	YouTube channel but it's I recommend hiding you know only having one to two
2433240	2438000	in there because otherwise it just gets too confusing and so I only allow my
2438000	2442040	one script I'm playing with to be there and then I'll change it either I hide it
2442040	2446120	or I change it to a different one so let's demonstrate a couple other things
2446120	2450320	in here notice down here at the bottom they have abbreviations so I can type
2450320	2456440	SCP period that's funny it was trying to interpret that SCP period space and it
2456440	2461160	puts in September for me right so this would be a spell check or let's do this
2461160	2466280	the days of the week I see Sun space right so it has a lot of default ones of
2466280	2468920	course you could either comment these out or delete them if you don't want to
2468920	2472760	have them in there obviously the word may you know that one's gonna come up in a
2472760	2476600	lot of sentences so they didn't do it for that one but you get the idea right
2476600	2481000	this is a great easy tool to have running and it runs like let's go back to
2481000	2488320	I don't have it launched I was gonna say let's launch notepad which I just don't
2488320	2493680	recall we got rid of that hotkey I'll just turn it back on save reload control
2493680	2498520	in to launch it and I'm gonna kill it real quick because I'll forget that I
2498520	2506360	did that and if we do the SUN period space there's Sunday a M E R I know see
2506360	2513480	a America no V November right it'll run in every program so if you're like me I
2513480	2518840	actually have a couple tools allow me a text from my computer it's so easy to be
2518840	2523640	able to automate texting and be using your hot strings to help type the stuff
2523640	2528680	that you want to send right so it's super simple super fast hot strings are
2528680	2534440	there you know a really really really great tool that I highly recommend also
2534440	2538680	don't add too many the spell checks one thing because it's doing automatically but
2538680	2543520	the regular hot strings don't add too many at once baby step into it also make
2543520	2548240	abbreviation so like mine what I do is for email addresses I'll put usually
2548240	2552520	minor my own email addresses are different because I have about eight and I
2552520	2559840	do them differently but if if I knew let's say Abraham Lincoln and he had an
2559840	2566120	email address I would do Abraham Lincoln email oops and then a period so
2566120	2569000	unfortunately that one may not because it looks like that's actually a word but
2569000	2577560	and this would be Abe at gmail.com right so oh and I actually look at that I
2577560	2581440	messed up that there we go that's better and this one of course I want the O in
2581440	2588920	there so I'm gonna save this reload it a e so it's basically the first two
2588920	2593000	initial the initials the there are the first two letters followed by an e and
2593000	2597720	that way and then a period and so that helps me have a pattern and makes it
2597720	2600640	easier for me to remember all my hot strings because I have hundreds upon
2600640	2605440	hundreds of them and it can be it can be confusing but again they're super
2605440	2610200	helpful and so let's get going on the next section
2611480	2616000	okay so I want to do one more with the hot key just to demonstrate how easy it
2616000	2621240	is to remap keys in a given program let's say you know in a lot of programs
2621240	2627280	control H will do the search replace functionality and the control H to me
2627280	2632560	just isn't the most intuitive hot key so what if I wanted to send a different
2632560	2639560	you know hit a different hot key to send control H so let's say I wanted Alt R so
2639560	2647280	Alt R that's gonna trigger this now we're gonna send control H and make sure
2647280	2650520	you add the return because we're on more than one line so I'm gonna save this
2650520	2655520	control R will reload the script I saw it blink now I'm gonna hit Alt R and
2655520	2661240	notice it this came up which is the control H now control H still works in
2661240	2666200	site because I didn't replace that but on that when I hit Alt R it sends control
2666200	2671360	H which is what the active program is gonna interpret as oh hey here control H
2671360	2675560	so it's a great easy way to adjust something if you don't like the hot key
2675560	2679360	or accelerator key and the program you're in you can write it just to redo
2679360	2683000	your own now when I was actually doing this I came up with a little bit of a
2683000	2687400	problem here let's let's change the control R R R let's just comment it out
2687400	2694440	so we don't have that one for now you you could do this this works technically
2694440	2704960	so control R is gonna send you know what I want to leave that so we are we're
2704960	2710200	gonna do control R to send control H and before the control R was up here so
2710200	2718080	this technically will work so I'm gonna save this I'm gonna minimize that
2718400	2724520	reload the script I think this should we'll control I'm gonna hit control R now
2724520	2734440	that sent the control H however I got a caution you these modifier keys have to
2734440	2743200	be the same so if I was trying to hit Alt R to send control H unfortunately so
2743200	2749440	let me close this reload the script now I'm hit Alt R Alt R it doesn't work I
2749440	2756040	just hit it it doesn't work and basically what's happening is this is what
2756040	2760800	gets passed along the the control whatever modifier key was here is gonna
2760800	2764600	be the same over here it when they're the same it works fine when they're
2764600	2769960	different then you need to put it onto the next line and then add the return
2770000	2776320	right so if you just get in the practice of doing them on the next line then
2776320	2780000	you're fine right if you're gonna use the same modifier key you can have them the
2780000	2783240	same line if not then put them on different line so I hope that helps it
2783240	2786240	again just think about it if you're in a program you don't like you know the
2786240	2791000	the commands being sent it's a great easy way the hotkey that the program is
2791000	2794320	associated with it you can make your own and the other one I wanted to point out
2794320	2799280	was you can make context sensitive hotkeys and I'll have a link in the
2799280	2804240	the web page about this but basically I could have it say if I'm in site and
2804240	2808560	hit control R and do one thing if I'm in notepad and I hit control R do another
2808560	2814040	and if I'm in word and hit control R do something else so there there's context
2814040	2818160	sensitive meaning they understand what program they're in the active program and
2818160	2821240	it's gonna do something different they're not totally hard to do but be
2821280	2826240	considering this is a beginning video I didn't want to you know do too much in
2826240	2830840	this video training video to show you so that's it and then next we'll move on
2830840	2836720	to our next section okay now we're gonna work on sending mouse clicks to a given
2836720	2840440	position and before we dive into the code I do want to caution you because
2840440	2843840	windows often are you know are in different locations where they have
2843840	2847800	something in front of it and it's not the most consistent reliable way to
2847800	2851800	automate programs there's a lot of other ways I have a lot of we have webinars
2851800	2856040	and tutorials on different ways to approach this however this is easy and
2856040	2859200	if you're controlling the environment it's definitely something you can easily
2859200	2863880	do set up and let's go ahead and dive into it here so let's pretend we're
2863880	2867880	gonna click this we'll stick with the control H type thing this is the we
2867880	2872160	activate the program here so this is the replace button we want to get this down
2872160	2875880	the problem of course is we need to know the coordinates of where that button is
2875880	2879600	right so the sending of the click is easy there's a little bit of stuff we
2879600	2882920	need to figure out where we're gonna send it to so there's a really simple
2882920	2891360	command it's a get no mouse get position and it's gonna ask for the the two
2891360	2896040	variables to store it so you can see here output var x I'll part var y those
2896040	2906000	are suggestions so we'll just call this one look x comma look why look why there
2906000	2911760	we go that's all we need there and to start off let's let's do a message box
2911760	2921760	oh you know what well we'll finish this here so message box and x is at and this
2921760	2926200	is where we're gonna wrap our variable name the thing we just had look x with
2926200	2931360	percent signs and that will make the message box display the value in the
2931360	2939880	variable not the actual text that we have there so x is there and y is at
2942640	2949160	that's why here we go so unfortunately right now I could run this but guess what
2949200	2952760	we don't have a hot key to trigger it right so let's add a hot key let's say
2952760	2963600	what let's say control oh I got a control M control P sure for position so I try to
2963600	2975440	think of them as you know meaningful so it control P to get mouse position now
2975440	2977920	we're of course this is gonna change later because we're gonna swap this to
2977960	2983120	actually click in the position but for now it's fine so I'm gonna save this control
2983120	2988160	R to reload oh I disabled my control R to let's I think I I disabled it but I
2988160	2992800	didn't read restart it now control our works and this is where this I'm trying
2992800	2995000	to show you a little bit of the troubleshooting while you're going through
2995000	3001760	this right so control P is gonna get if I hit it right now it's saying x is at
3001760	3006200	384 and y is at 58 but that was down here right so we're gonna redo this come up
3006240	3013040	here now hit control P and now we have to remember 481 and 93 so actually I'm
3013040	3016560	gonna leave this up here by the way any message box and on a hotkey you can come
3016560	3021200	in here and hit control C and come down here and paste and it will have the
3021200	3026160	contents from that message box right so it's a nice easy way to get that little
3026160	3034360	insider tip there so this is gonna be the x is gonna be 481 so let's comment this
3034400	3042760	out and I'm gonna keep these numbers so x is 41 and y 93 so I'm cheating here
3042760	3051480	because the next thing is you know we'll just we'll make that a comment and I'll
3051480	3056040	have this and now we're gonna click so we're gonna say click comma and now it's
3056040	3065440	as simple we entered those numbers right so 481 comma 93 and that is that let's
3065440	3071200	add a return so it doesn't keep going so I'm gonna save this reload and now when
3071200	3077920	I hit control P notice it moved my mouse there oh look at that how did I get the
3077920	3081560	wrong thing that's it I'm you know I we can go back and watch a video I will
3081560	3088200	bet you money I was on the wrong thing when I did that so simply we will disable
3088200	3096920	this re-enable this oops well I need to reload the script make sure we're over
3096920	3101640	the correct thing and this is why you know you'd practice right walk it through
3101640	3107320	so 435 yeah look at that I was off an 87 now the y it's this way so that one
3107320	3114640	probably can say the same but the 435 this should have been 435 right because
3114640	3121800	your x is going across and the y is the up and down so now I'm a save reload and
3121800	3126680	hit control P and there we go so funny how I got distracted apparently and
3126680	3134280	moused over the wrong item that I wanted to click now again if I had a window up
3134280	3138680	in front of this it wouldn't care oops hey it wouldn't care it would have
3138680	3143360	clicked you know and right here and this is why that sending of a mouse click
3143360	3148360	just isn't that robust or if I move this to another monitor the coordinates are
3148360	3152080	gonna be different or even if I move it like this the coordinates are gonna be
3152080	3155560	different right there's a lot of reasons why this can break but this is just the
3155560	3159560	simple way of hey sending a mouse click to a given coordinates often we put our
3159560	3163400	windows up we maximize them and and the things don't move so it definitely can
3163440	3167280	work it's just not the most robust way by the way I have a script called
3167280	3172560	automate my task on my website and it it eases the pain of getting these
3172560	3175920	coordinates finding an image it actually narrows it down by the controls it's
3175920	3179880	pretty robust it'll search everywhere for you you just lock in the image and
3179880	3183560	then say go click this or go send text to this edit field so check that out if
3183560	3187720	you're interested but that's it for the sending of a mouse click to given
3187720	3195520	coordinates in this section we're gonna explain how if you want to share your
3195520	3199280	code with someone else or that you want to run your code on another computer you
3199280	3203920	don't have to install auto hotkey it's very very easy to compile a script an
3203920	3207480	auto hotkey and give it to someone else or just run another computer so let's go
3207480	3211840	ahead and get started we come in here and go to explore this is the easiest way
3211880	3217680	highlight the script you want right click and just say compile script right
3217680	3221480	that'll actually create an executable program in the same folder it takes a
3221480	3225520	couple seconds so here now I have an executable program I can take this to
3225520	3229320	any Windows computer I don't have to install anything I just put it on it and
3229320	3232520	run it and when you run it it'll you'll have the you know if it had a system
3232520	3235400	tray icon it'll it'll have it down there let's do this with the test so I'm gonna
3235400	3239400	right click say in that one compile script I'll end up here with a test dot
3239440	3244920	exe and that one because we have hotkeys in it and the icon is showing it
3244920	3250840	should show up here in the system tray and that's it right other languages this
3250840	3255960	can take a lot of work Python in particular I would compile scripts and
3255960	3260200	it was a process and it's just it's amazing that it's so easy not a hotkey
3260200	3264240	to compile script and give it to someone else and if they're running even
3264240	3269600	down to Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 it's very very consistent
3269600	3274600	there are some things with pre Windows 7 there was no user access control and so
3274600	3277520	things were slightly different so XP might be just slightly different but
3277520	3281240	generally speaking they're very stable across all versions of Windows on
3281240	3283840	different computers now the program itself might be a little different
3283840	3286480	depending if you're sending mouse clicks in the coordinates right I mentioned
3286480	3292560	that earlier but the the heart of the program stays the same so that's simple
3294480	3299840	as we wrap up I wanted to share some helpful links and resources that can
3299840	3304920	help you automate everything and let me jump over here on this so in this
3304920	3310120	beginner page right which I'll have in the resources here there's the you know
3310120	3315160	absolute documentation commands and keys these links I have these three
3315160	3322280	bookmarked on my main default home page I use them a lot that documentation and
3322320	3324880	commands those are great the keys are when you're just getting used to
3324880	3328640	understanding what keys you want to send all three of these are just must-haves
3328640	3333680	that you use in and out the forum page the overall hotkey form it's an amazing
3333680	3337840	form the people are super helpful and nice you can definitely go there you can
3337840	3342440	find a ton of things already solved for you there's different forms let's
3342440	3346440	actually let's jump to it real quickly here and show you so the main page here
3346440	3350040	breaks down into different forms so there's tutorials scripts these are
3350080	3354360	completed scripts and functions here's where you go to ask for help and then
3354360	3358800	down below you'll actually see here are the links to the other languages so if
3358800	3362720	if English isn't your first language you can actually ask questions about that in
3362720	3369160	that language which is great and so I have those here discord is also it's a
3369160	3373880	live site well I shouldn't say life I put people hang out there and they will
3373880	3377400	they're more than happy to help you with with what you're working on and then
3377400	3380640	you can share screens and so it's a dynamic way to be able to talk to people
3380640	3384160	and get some help but you do have to use this link to create an account for it
3384160	3389880	by the way I like I said I have over 600 maybe so for 700 YouTube videos on
3389880	3394240	auto hotkey now and I cover a lot of different topics so you can definitely
3394240	3401440	go there this tutorial on specific this playlist is specifically geared towards
3401440	3405120	people like you that are just starting out an auto hotkey there's not a ton of
3405120	3408400	videos in there but there is a deeper dive you know we skimmed over the
3408400	3412360	installing a editor and installing the program and discussing it I go a little
3412360	3418000	deeper in these and then there's we've given over 50 webinars on auto hotkey
3418000	3424000	and we have also I think now around yeah 65 podcasts discussing different things
3424000	3428800	with automation I did mention earlier I have three Udemy courses here and if you
3428800	3432280	click them from here there's a coupon code that you'll get a discount for so
3432280	3436360	for the basically for the intro to auto hotkey hot strings like I said it's hot
3436360	3440040	strings are just amazing and the intermediate course these are all
3440040	3446880	they're roughly are between ten dollars and thirteen twelve ninety nine so if you
3446880	3451320	come here you'll get the best deal that there is and I'll get more of the money
3451320	3454840	it's hard to explain but Udemy if you come in from other places I end up
3454840	3457600	getting a tiny fraction of the money instead of getting them from here so I
3457600	3460760	appreciate if you click these links at the same time it is going to be the
3460760	3465360	cheapest price you can get so that's why I have them here there are auto hotkey
3465360	3469600	books by Jack Dunning Jack's been writing for over 30 years and he has a
3469600	3474000	ton of auto hotkey books you can go to his blog two of the books are free and
3474000	3477320	then you can download or you know order the other ones they're very reasonably
3477320	3480560	priced usually between four to six dollars I think and if you're one of
3480560	3485160	those people that would rather have you know it it you know a step-by-step very
3485160	3489480	minutiae work it's really great because he also gives you a ton of examples of
3489480	3492920	how you might use auto hotkey and that's one of things I do a lot of my
3492920	3497040	videos as well as just talk through what I've automated because it's easy to kind
3497040	3500320	of get caught up in doing something and not realize hey there a lot of the stuff
3500320	3504600	I do daily can be automated so I hope that helps auto hotkey is a very rich
3504600	3508920	robust language we didn't even scratch the surface of what it's capable of this
3508920	3512400	is just to introduce you to you but you can do things like web scraping I have a
3512400	3517200	screen clipping tool it'll grab text you can do regular expressions it's an
3517240	3521600	object-oriented language so you can do some pretty advanced stuff but the API
3521600	3526260	calls are another great one I do a lot of automating of Excel and Outlook so
3526260	3531520	sending emails or automating reporting in Excel anything with the Microsoft
3531520	3535280	Office program you can basically connect to programmatically and really well
3535280	3541240	drive it so go ahead and check it out my site alone if you come up to the main
3541240	3544920	site here there's there's you know a lot of different things in here that you can
3544960	3549480	learn about with using functions where they so here's the functions controlling
3549480	3554040	programs with controls that's another really great one the web scraping I
3554040	3558240	mentioned with either IE or now with Chrome which you can see in here again
3558240	3561800	it's web scraping Excel Auto Hockey Studio once you get a little bit more
3561800	3566280	robust is an amazing editor it's a default editor I use now but I do have
