00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello and thank you for watching this AutoHotKey tutorial for beginners. In this

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,040
video we're going to cover a lot of different topics. We're going to start

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,120
off discussing which versions of AutoHotKey to use, then we're going to

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,960
cover which editor to use. There's a lot of different editors out there and I've

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,400
tried a lot of them. The one I recommend is by far the easiest to start with.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,040
Then we're going to jump into doing some some little pre-work. We're going to use

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,040
hotkeys which is actually a tool that you can use in AutoHotKey to launch

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,520
programs and stuff, but we're going to first use them to work smarter, not

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,160
harder. We're going to learn how to use them to edit our code and make it faster

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,280
as we develop code. Then I'm going to show you how to launch programs and

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
scripts and load a website with them. Then next we're going to jump into using

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,040
hot strings. The hot string as you can think of is like a text expansion type

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,680
thing. So you type a couple letters and bam there goes a lot of text whatever

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,840
you want to put in there. After that I show you a script where there's about

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,120
4,000 words in a spell check. What's great about AutoHotKey is any Windows

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,480
program you're in you can have this script running and it will spell check

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,240
across all your programs. It's another just a great example of hot strings. Then

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,920
we switch back to using a few more hotkeys where we show you how to remap

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,520
codes. Let's say you're using Outlook and you don't like a hotkey to launch a new

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,680
email. I'll teach you how you can hit a different key combination and it will

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,960
send the key combination that Outlook knows. It's a great way if you don't

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,440
like the programs you're using to remap the keys. Then we work on how to send a

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,480
mouse click to given coordinates. Of course first you have to understand you

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,160
know identify where those coordinates are and then we send the mouse clicks

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,040
there. Lastly we wrap up on the programming side of being able to

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,920
compile a script and this is a really great thing about AutoHotKey. It's

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,280
super super easy to compile a script and that way you can use it on a

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,160
different computer where it doesn't have AutoHotKey installed or you can give it

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,480
to a friend and they can write it on their Windows computer. At the very end of

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,720
this script video I have a lot of resources where where to go when you

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
get in trouble. A lot of great sources where you have live support where people

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,000
are just willing to help you. The AutoHotKey community and forum the people

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,640
are just great and very helpful. My site I have a lot of tutorials on them but

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,400
this is places where you can go directly and get one-to-one help. In this

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,760
video you'll notice I mentioned a lot of stuff. There's a lot of pop-ups with the

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,040
actual links you know and hyperlinks of where you can go. Just make sure you

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,160
check in the description down below because I'm going to put in the time

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,840
codes of exactly in the video when it was and the URL there is too. So you don't

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,680
have to try to type the URLs right so make sure you wait for that and I

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,440
really appreciate you watching this video. Please like it if you think it

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,640
really helped you. I spent quite a bit of time on this video to make sure that it

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,080
really helps new people so I hope you like this tutorial for beginners. Cheers.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
In case is the first video you've seen of me my name is Joe Glynes and I'm from

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,720
the Automator and I teach people how to automate their PCs. I love it's my

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,880
passion to help people work smarter not harder. Come to my site check it out. I

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,880
have over 600 videos on YouTube. I have three Udemy courses teaching AutoHotKey

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,200
so all these are great resources. There's also some great AutoHotKey books out

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,920
there but check us out. Also if at some point you want to get some work done for

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,960
you now I have people working for me that will automate things. So drop me a

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,520
note my email will be in this description and please like the video if you

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,440
think it was helpful and looking forward to get going here. Cheers.

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,440
Alright so the first thing we have to do is to download and install AutoHotKey.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,000
So let's go ahead and navigate to AutoHotKey.com in any browser. When you

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,520
get there you're going to see this button that says download. Go ahead and

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,560
click it. It's going to ask you which of these three options do you want. Always

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,440
download the current version. The other two I don't want to get into it. It's a

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
bit advanced to why. There's a lot of logic later that you might choose on but

58
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
for now we're going to download the current version. Go ahead and save it. I

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,040
already have it here on my desktop. It's a small file here. I'm going to say I'm just

60
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,960
going to replace it and now once it's here I'm going to say open when done and

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,640
it's going to come up with the setup files that you want to install. Now Windows

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,640
now is trying to think that maybe this is a bad thing. Go ahead and click run

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,520
anyway. It's going to come up with this window. Now the default isn't this

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,560
express installation. For reasons I don't want to get into it's it's it's not what

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,680
I recommend right and most people say do the custom installation instead of doing

66
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,760
the Unicode 64 bit to the Unicode 32 bit and it just it works with more scripts

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,440
you find online so it's just safer 64 a bit isn't necessarily better it's just

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,680
different and you can install wherever you like. I'm just go ahead and hit next. I

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,040
take the defaults on this screen as well. I take all the defaults don't change

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,240
anything and basically you're done. Now that we have a hotkey installed let's

71
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,400
work on getting an editor or an IDE and IDE is short for integrated development

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,160
environment and I highly highly recommend you install something. I'm going to

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
recommend site for Auto hotkey it's written specifically for using with

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,240
Auto hotkey. Technically you could use either notepad or wordpad or almost

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,200
anything that can edit a text file because the Auto hotkey code is written

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,120
in plain text and that just means when you open it you'll see the actual

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,880
characters and words there and you can recognize them and you could save it

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,840
however there's a lot of functionality that using text pad wouldn't allow you

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,480
to do like relaunch the script or assist you in typing the code you might

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,840
want or hit F1 highlight a word hit F1 and bring up the support Auto hotkey

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,160
support all of these things site will do for you automatically. Let's go ahead

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720
let me share my screen here and on the main page that we're working from I have

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,760
a download for Auto hotkey site for Auto hotkey here so let's go I'm going to

84
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,040
click this right now and we'll get it started here it's not a big program this

85
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,960
is from my site I just make it for convenience because it might disappear

86
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,040
in the form at some point that's going to download it we'll run it here in a

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,600
second but what I wanted to point out is if you come up here there's this whole

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,360
page dedicated to videos where I've taught people how to do it looks like I

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,280
have at least 18 videos there I'm doing some advanced stuff now I don't recommend

90
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,280
you start off here right because the great thing about site and you'll realize

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,160
this when we start programming it is it's super easy it has a nice tool bar it

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
has a lot of functionality it doesn't take a lot of learning there's not a

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
steep learning curve and yet it's very simple easy to use so let's go ahead and

94
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,600
install it I'm gonna I'm gonna hit Ctrl G and Chrome that'll well let's see I can

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,920
do it right here I don't have to do that I'm gonna say open right so I don't

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,080
have to navigate to it now it's gonna come up and say do you want the quick

97
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,080
setup install I'm gonna hit install just to see what it's doing my default

98
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,320
location is gonna be different than yours don't worry about that install

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,440
wherever you want it you should it'll find auto hotkeys main install file and

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,560
that's where mine is and then you're gonna click install but it's gonna come up

101
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,640
and just say hey do you want to run these updates there's two updates it'll

102
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,360
download and just say yes and that's it and then sites installed you have this

103
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,840
nice toolbar up here it's a clean input interface so when you have the vertical

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,040
split on this vertical split leave it off I would recommend it I think it

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,080
makes more sense to have it down here mine just happened to be closed up so

106
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,680
this is where you'll see output and this is where you'll see a lot of debug

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,600
information mainly the big one is like hey the scripted launch and there's a

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,760
problem like if we put something here and try to launch it it wants to save it

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,560
first well fine save hotkeys script great now if I try to launch it it's gonna

110
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,200
tell me hey this file has a problem specifically hey what in the world is

111
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,000
our EFFD it tells you where it is right often they'll tell you the line that the

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,440
problem's on but this is this little stuff that it really helps you understand

113
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,120
what in the world's going on with your your script so I highly recommend you

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,720
install there's also notepad plus plus HK studio which is the editor I use now

115
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,600
but it's more advanced and this is by far the easiest to install easiest to pick

116
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,480
up and use it's really a great advanced program for editing any kind of text

117
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,640
there's a lot of search and replace stuff you can do in it so now let's go

118
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,420
ahead and get into coding all right now that we have site and auto hotkey

119
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,440
installed let's go ahead and start working on our first script so we're

120
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,720
gonna jump in here and I just have a folder this folder it's in my temp

121
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,000
directory and it's just keeping all the files together for me so go in somewhere

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,760
right-click and say new and I'm gonna say new auto hotkey script now this is

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,160
gonna generate a little bit of code in this file see it's one kilobyte it's not

124
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,000
zero and we're gonna call this thing test I'm gonna hit right inner key to save

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,840
it save the renaming and now I'm gonna right-click again and say edit and

126
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,400
because site was installed it's the default editor it is gonna open this

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,880
script in site for us and so we can see several things here this is really

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,360
helpful is that notice this color coding if we open this file notepad this would

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
just all be black text and it's it's this is where having site installed is

130
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
really helpful to allow you to easily see this stuff things that begin with the

131
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
pound sign they're called directives and we don't need to get into all the

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,440
advanced stuff about that but I'm trying to point out they're a little

133
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,240
different than other things just no end it's it's we don't need to go into the

134
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,240
explanation of it you could comment it out you don't necessarily need it it's

135
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,160
recommended but you don't have to have it in there control Q in site will toggle

136
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,600
so I could I could highlight a bunch of these and it would toggle them but it

137
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,240
will comment them out so that's control Q we'll leave it enabled it doesn't matter

138
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,560
this sent now these two are commands and send mode input this is the most

139
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
reliable and it's fast so we're gonna leave that enabled we'll use send a

140
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
little bit later a send command and the set working directory that basically

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
says hey when I'm accessing stuff use the the directory that I'm in is the

142
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,960
default directory so it's a good thing to have I definitely recommend having it

143
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,800
notice this auto assist this is why I love site also in in notepad you wouldn't

144
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,120
have any of this and it's really much more complicated so I'm gonna hit it

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,760
enter to accept that comma and we're gonna say force what this does it says

146
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:11,600
hey only launch one instance of this script so if the script was already

147
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,800
running it would basically relaunch it for you if it wasn't running a launch

148
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,360
it if you'd launch it again it will say hey there's already one running don't run

149
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,560
two instance of this only run one I don't understand why this isn't the

150
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,800
default in every script it should be it's used all the time right so I use

151
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,160
this is 99.9% of my scripts it should be in every script as the default you

152
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
actually can go in a site you could change that or you know somewhere and

153
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,360
you can change that this is the default value to have in there I highly

154
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,320
encourage you to add it to yours and so this gets us going and now I'm gonna

155
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
stop here and then we're gonna switch to actually working with hotkeys because

156
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,520
we have a couple other things I want to put in this but I want to keep these

157
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,920
compartmentalized while we're talking about directives and settings this is

158
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,360
stuff that's for your script or other things you could put in here and over

159
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,040
time you might learn you might want to have the next thing we're gonna get into

160
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
is actually creating hotkeys to do some stuff that really helps speed up your

161
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,160
coding. All right so let's jump into making our first script now before we

162
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,560
actually do some fun coding stuff I'm gonna demonstrate a couple things to

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,680
add to your main script the one that you're working in to make it easier to

164
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,640
develop code so let's go ahead and start sharing here and we're gonna jump in now

165
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,080
to start off let me show you there's this script right now is not running I

166
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,120
can tell that one easy way is looking in here there's no green little green H's

167
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:42,320
in here so we're gonna say let's say message box hello world now I'm gonna

168
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,960
save this and when I hit this blue run it's going to or I could hit a five it's

169
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,800
going to launch this script so notice two things here one here's the hello

170
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,320
world message box this is the joseph's which script we're in and see this green

171
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,800
H down here right this is telling us this script is running the second I hit

172
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,920
okay here I also want you to notice something with this green H I hit okay

173
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,300
and suddenly it's gone right why is that well there was nothing else in this

174
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,160
script to keep it running keep it active and there are a couple things that

175
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,040
you could do to do that if you had a hot key or a hot string in it it would

176
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,240
automatically stay running you could add a single persistent a directive called

177
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,800
persistent and this would keep it running so if I save this we launch it the

178
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,320
message box comes up here's our green H when I said okay it stays running now it

179
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,240
wouldn't do anything because there's nothing else in this so we don't we

180
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:44,800
won't leave this in here but so we're gonna add that in our little pile of

181
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,720
things to keep in memory I'll just remember so this next one what we're

182
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:59,640
gonna do is let's say we wanted to be able to easily edit this script now

183
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,960
there's a couple ways we could do it right now because it's running and it's

184
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,120
down here I could right click on this and say edit so even if site was closed

185
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,840
yeah changes I can right click it here and say edit and it's gonna open in my

186
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,280
default editor which is site I could also come into the main script here and

187
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,320
right click it and say edit and it will pull it up but that would be really

188
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,240
tedious if you had closed site and you wanted to always edit it so what I love

189
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,240
to do and we're gonna do this with a hot key is a let's start dabbling in hot

190
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,960
key so there are things called modifier keys and those the main four are

191
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,400
control alt shift in the windows key those and auto hot key and so let's add

192
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:55,480
some comments here so the alt key is the exclamation point the the windows key

193
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:13,320
is the pound and I'm not yet the shift key is the plus sign and well control key

194
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:22,120
sorry and and this is the carrot which is above your six so these on their own

195
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,760
we wouldn't use these by themselves but they're called modifiers and that's

196
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,120
because you use them in conjunction with another letter or or or another key so

197
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:41,120
let's say every time I hit we'll do control H we want that to run message

198
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,840
box hello world now I'm gonna add a return here which basically tells auto

199
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,720
hot key to stop stop going forward after from that point on so I'm gonna save

200
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,000
this always remember you have to save and reload it or hit f5 so now it's

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,880
rerun it this is another reason this output window here this can tell you if

202
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,720
there's errors where what line the errors on so notepad doesn't have this and

203
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,800
this is where it's really nice so I can when I relaunch this you'll see it flash

204
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,960
also notice when I relaunch it you'll see it down here at blinks and so it's a

205
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,400
great way to make sure you understand the changes were absorbed or used so now

206
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm gonna hit control H and bam there we go right and now if I hit enter it's

207
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,460
gonna get rid of it but look I can hit control H again and it pulls it up so

208
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,680
this is a hot key that's gonna launch whatever is between here and here I

209
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,640
could put a second let's say I wanted to do this so now it'll have two so if I

210
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,360
now I have to relaunch it again now this is the point of what I'm gonna show

211
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,520
here in a second is control H and it's gonna say hello and then world right so

212
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,160
we're using our hot key to use a message display a message box with a value in

213
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,160
it I'm not overly useful but you get the idea of I can trigger this we can also

214
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,240
trigger other things which we'll cover here in a minute but before we get to

215
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,640
that let's say I want to automatically reload this script instead of having to

216
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,960
come in here and launch it and then hit right click and say reload or relaunch

217
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change this to control R so it makes sense to me

218
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,280
this is a really powerful thing in auto hot key I think it's really under you

219
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,120
know you don't understood of that I can make it what makes sense to me right so

220
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm gonna change this to control R and I'm gonna add the command edit now this

221
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,640
is a special command let me also demonstrate here if I highlight if I'm

222
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,800
in a word and I hit F1 it will pull up the auto hot key help and that's built

223
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,960
into site also so this is a really great thing here the site document I'm sorry

224
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,720
the auto hot key documentation is excellent you can read about it and

225
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,920
then usually at the bottom it'll show you an example or two of how to use the

226
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,400
commands so I highly recommend again using site and then using that F1 when

227
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,160
you get stuck and don't not sure what it is so what is this gonna do well I'm

228
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,440
gonna save this and relaunch it so it takes it in now you know what let's

229
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:12,800
let's add here oh I don't want that that should have been reload there we go

230
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,040
and let's look at reload real quick so replaces the current running instance of

231
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,880
the script with a new one right so that's kind of what we're doing with this

232
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,360
F5 we're relaunching it of course reload only works if it's already running but

233
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm gonna save this rerun it now watch what happens if I hit control R it it's

234
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,000
funny it reloads it but it because it triggers the reload let me let me do

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:49,520
this a smart way so I'm gonna save this and now hit R control R and now when I'm

236
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,000
hitting control R so see it says it will reload now when I hit okay it's gonna

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,840
trigger that reload and notice the green H blink down here so again control R it's

238
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,880
gonna pull up the message box and then do the okay I just wanted the message box

239
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,240
to show you we're actually in here right so now if I really hit just control R

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,400
it's gonna well the first time through now it's gonna reload it right so I can

241
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,880
just hit control R I don't have to come up here and hit f5 f5 is hard for me on

242
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,560
my keyboard to reach so it's a nice handy one to be able to say hey I want to I

243
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,720
want to make these changes and control R will do that for us because see how it

244
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,960
reloads it for us so it's a super helpful one to have in here I also want to

245
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,480
point out if your command is more than one line then you need the return if

246
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,560
it's not more than one line so let me comment this out this is only one line

247
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,640
right we can bring this one up here and a lot of these can be put on the same

248
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,760
line and if we do it on the same line you don't actually need the return so I'm

249
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,200
gonna save this hit control R again now it's reloading for us so it's great

250
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,520
because I can just hit control R and have it reload for me now another one

251
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,680
which is really helpful to have so we're gonna say control E to edit and now

252
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:21,200
this is the one that I was started to work on earlier here so this so here are

253
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,040
two that I will just love having in here so now I'm gonna hit control R to

254
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,360
take that now if site was not open I can hit control E and it is going to edit

255
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,840
this file it's gonna pull it up for us so these two hotkeys in the main script

256
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,160
that you're working on are entity and again you don't have to use control R

257
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,520
right that's my example but it's super helpful for helping you speed up what

258
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,360
you're doing when you're coding because I don't have to come down here and right

259
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,080
click and say reload or come up here with my mouse or hit F5 the control R and

260
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,880
whatever's convenient for you are super easy to do and then what I often will

261
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,680
do is I will use something to trigger so this is this is often much more how

262
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,960
hotkeys are used is let's say I'll do control M for a message box and let's

263
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,760
put that on the next line so message box hello world and now because that is

264
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,160
going on the next line I'm pretty sure let's just test it I could have moved

265
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,120
this up here and I'm gonna hit control R the say see this asterisk up here that

266
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,920
means there's been changes that haven't been actually saved yet so now it's saved

267
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,400
it now control R will relaunch it and I can do control M for my hello world

268
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,280
control E to edit which is I'm already in it so if I was to close this I can

269
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,840
hit control E and they'll pull it up and control R you can see it blinking down

270
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,560
below in the bottom right so these are our three things now that with this

271
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,640
message box I want to demonstrate you can do other things with hotkeys right so

272
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,960
let's let's say I wanted to launch Chrome that one let's start off with notepad

273
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,680
because notepad is a little easier and let's do control in now control in is

274
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,320
already a hotkey in site right now if I don't say this I hit control in it's

275
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,080
gonna open a new tab for me right but I want to use control in in a different

276
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:25,280
way so I'm going to say run notepad now I don't have I'll add it here you don't

277
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,160
have to have the exe and notepad especially you don't need the entire

278
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,040
path because notepad is in the windows path and so but I wanted to start off

279
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,000
with it to keep it simple so I'm gonna say control S control R to reload and

280
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,080
then I'm gonna say control N unfortunately it launched notepad on my

281
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,200
other screen here but let me bring it over here close it now if I control and

282
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,040
again yeah it remembers where it was so I just made a hotkey to launch notepad

283
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,200
but let's say we want to launch something that's not in the windows path

284
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,080
well you could we could say well I'm gonna come down here got our properties

285
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,560
I'm gonna get the full path and here this to the left I have my running in

286
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,940
debug mode but this is the path to Chrome and so I'm gonna say and control C

287
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,940
would be a terrible one right because that's copy so we don't want to replace

288
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:22,100
copy so let's do alt C so I'm gonna do the alt C remember you got to use look

289
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,580
up here alt you know the exclamation is the alt key so alt C and then we're

290
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,060
gonna say run and here paste in this more often than not you don't need the

291
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,540
double quotes around it but let's we'll just leave them here so I'm gonna save

292
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:43,380
this reload it control R and alt C now alt C will launch Chrome for me right

293
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,860
and you can do this with almost any Windows program you can launch it this

294
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,020
way get the full path to it sometimes there's a little things what you need to

295
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,820
have the set a given directory can run into some headaches or if you want to

296
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:01,020
open a certain file you can add a space here and add the path to the file after

297
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:09,740
it but being able to launch programs is a great simple thing and that's it for

298
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,900
this one let's let's do one other one so the Windows key so Windows let's say

299
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:25,740
Windows G and what is anything that starts with G we'll just do something

300
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:36,700
run grepwin so I'm gonna go to properties this is the path to my file

301
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,420
there we go no that one doesn't have the double quotes but it should be fine I'm

302
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,020
ready this is the portable version of it so I'm gonna save this sorry save it

303
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,780
reload it and now the Windows key G will launch grepwin for me grepwin is a

304
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,300
search tool that will search across files in your computer it's free I highly

305
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,820
recommend it if you need to search text in inside files but anyway you just see

306
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,740
it now I use the Windows key the alt key let's do one more with shift so we're

307
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,940
gonna do a shift and shift obviously the shift with a letter would be bad on

308
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,140
its own right because you want to capitalize letters but we'll just do

309
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:21,820
shift T and you know I'm gonna be lazy and run calc I think it's calc.exe so if

310
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:30,940
I hit shift T oh I didn't I didn't save it save it reload it shift T just ran my

311
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,540
calculator so there I used the the four main modifiers shift windows alt and

312
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,660
control to demonstrate how you can launch programs you could launch other

313
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,380
scripts you could launch web pages you could you could actually you know what

314
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,900
let me let me let me demonstrate that I launched a browser however let's say we

315
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,340
wanted to and you know what this will be a good one for the Windows G is let's

316
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,620
say we wanted to run a certain website so here I would put in you know what I

317
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,460
don't like I want to save this so we have it as an example but I'm gonna

318
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,940
comment to that you know what let's demonstrate this I'm gonna leave those

319
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,100
both there I'm gonna say run

320
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:21,620
so I'm gonna save this when I hit reload notice it says hey there's a

321
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:27,020
duplicate hotkey you can't have the same hotkey in the same script because it

322
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,180
will cause a problem it won't know which one to run so it warns you that's

323
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,700
another great thing about this is it warns you so I'm just for now I'm gonna

324
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,180
comment this out if it was running in another script it would have launched and

325
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,180
it would have just used the most recently launched one so so this though

326
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,140
what I wanted to demonstrate was oh you know what actually I call it Windows G

327
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,860
because I wanted to run Google there we go so control R now it reloaded now when

328
00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:00,660
I hit Windows G it launches my default browser and takes me to that web page so

329
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,980
this is how I could easily do a search so let's that'll wrap this up here with

330
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,420
dealing with hotkeys and these these ones I like to add in the just ease I I

331
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,500
put something similar to this in every one of the scripts I'm working on that

332
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,580
I'm adjusting I always have it running in that script and then when I'm finally

333
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,660
done with it I either comment them out or I'll remove them because I'll have

334
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,900
another one that I'm working on and I only put those in what the active script

335
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,980
that I'm trying to develop okay the next thing we're covering are called hot

336
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,340
strings or you can think of them as text expansion for me they are the lowest

337
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,620
hanging fruit the simplest thing you can learn today and be using it and be more

338
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,580
efficient at a computer they're so simple and important and save so much

339
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,260
time it was the first Udemy course that my colleague Jackie and I built on Udemy

340
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,100
because they just they're huge time savers they're way overlooked by

341
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,620
everybody and they're just one of those little things once you get them you

342
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,580
realize you do type the same things over and over and over and they're really

343
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,660
helpful so let's go ahead and start working on them what we're gonna do is

344
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,460
let's let's do in a little example here so let's say I I hey I type my email

345
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:18,260
address a lot right so I'm gonna put in two colons and think to yourself what

346
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,140
what do I want to type as the abbreviation for my email address so I'm

347
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,540
gonna say JTA because this email address happens to be Joe at theautomanner.com

348
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,980
and then you put in the two more colons and then you type what you want Joe at

349
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,860
the-automater.com notice you make sure you put it in the case you want like

350
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,780
uppercase here I uppercase my A right because I want that to come through but

351
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,700
I don't want it here and I want my first name to be capitalized and so I'm gonna

352
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,300
save this since I still have this running I'm a hit control R now it just

353
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,220
absorbed it now when I type JTA period now it didn't do it right then but when I

354
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,460
hit a space a return or a tab basically any kind of ending character it swaps

355
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,740
that out for me right so it's it's a very simple thing to be able to learn how

356
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,580
to do you can replicate this to your hearts and this will work I could open

357
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,860
up do I have a hot key a control in will open up notepad JTA period space

358
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,460
there's my email address right it's it is just the simplest thing in the world

359
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,540
you could put in paragraphs of text like let's say also we wanted let's say we

360
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,580
wanted to have it have a line break so I'm gonna do this till day which is to the

361
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,900
left of the number one till day in stands for like a new line feed is the

362
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,620
actual character for it so and make sure if you do edit your own add it into the

363
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,420
script here that you don't try to save it or load it because that'll cause an

364
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:56,140
error so new Joe Joe the automator is tick my tick in email to can address I'm

365
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:02,420
gonna save this I'm gonna control R to reload let's go back to notepad now when

366
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:09,220
I type JTA period space it put it across different lines right it out of the line

367
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,300
so if you wanted to have multiple things in here there is a character limit on

368
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,700
how many you can do in this structure however you can have up to like 16,000

369
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,420
characters in a different way you can look at the the hot strings help which on

370
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,980
that way at my win webpage for this beginner course I have a link to it

371
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,060
about how to do continuous in sections but it's really that simple and so here

372
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,220
let's get back I mean I'm gonna hit control D which is a hot key in site for

373
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,140
duplicate the line and I'm gonna get back into my email address where when I

374
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,060
save this control R to reload come into notepad you know what I think I can see

375
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,900
if I can type down here yeah I can dump it in here so see that space at the end

376
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:03,100
well often I'm using my email address or in a as the user area in username for a

377
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,180
form and I don't want that space at the end because that of course would break it

378
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,420
so it's a simple change in auto hotkey is just add an O in between the first two

379
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:19,820
colons now when I save this and reload it when I come in here and type JTA

380
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,100
period now watch what happens when I hit space so notice where my cursor is it's

381
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
right at that M it didn't add the space at the end and so it's a very simple

382
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,820
thing to adjust where if I am using a email address or maybe a password now

383
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,300
you know do discretion if you're saving passwords because the password will be

384
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,980
stored in a plain text file that's easily visible by anybody right there's

385
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,180
ways around it and I have a video on that somewhere but it is they're not

386
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,740
secure so just be careful with it but it's very convenient to be able to do

387
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,260
this so things like you know just some things you just don't want to space out

388
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,780
of the end sometimes you want to it might be plural sometimes not and this is an

389
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,100
easy way to do it without having a backspace to get rid of that extra

390
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,420
space another example that I want to demonstrate in this will wrap up the

391
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:14,020
basic hot strings is there are certain characters because up here this windows

392
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,100
key the the pound sign the alt key this exclamation point this carrot is

393
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,500
control auto hotkey interpretees is very special characters right so you can't

394
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,760
let's say we were doing this see the STB if you're a signfold fan you'll get

395
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,580
this you have to see the baby exclamation point right so I'm gonna save

396
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,660
this reload it now when I come in here and I'm doing it down here because if I

397
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,060
do it here and I save it it'll break my code right so I'm typing in here STB

398
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,740
period space hey it said you have to see the baby but no explanation point right

399
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,820
why is there no exclamation point well that's because it literally thought hey

400
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,700
let's send the alt key right because it's a special character so the easy there's

401
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,340
two ways very simple ways to take care of it there are other ways we're gonna

402
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,580
handle two of them right here the first way is to wrap this anytime you have a

403
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,240
special character this wrap it with these curly braces and save remember save

404
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,580
reload reload watch that green H flash now STB periods now see it has the

405
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,260
exclamation point so that's option one option two is you can leave this the

406
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,020
original way but put an R in between here so I'm gonna save this reload it

407
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:41,420
there it goes and STB period space and that works also notice here we have the

408
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,020
space which is perfectly fine but I could put the O in combination with the R

409
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:53,820
save it reload it come down here see the space and now we have it without the

410
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,140
extra space right so even though this works like looks like the word or it's

411
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,060
not auto hotkey you can put multiple things in here and it's a simple easy

412
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,580
way let me do one more one more fun one that's it's good to know is if you don't

413
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,140
want to wait for that tab or space you want that hotkey to get replaced right

414
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:19,140
away you can use another one here is you put in the asterisk so here is let's

415
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:27,260
say HW period oh actually you know I don't want the period here so there we

416
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:34,620
go so this is gonna send hello world save it reload it now watch what happens

417
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,700
right when I hit the W so H now the second I hit the W it dumps it in right

418
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,340
I didn't have to hit that space or a tab or return after so those are three things

419
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,980
you can easily adjust in hot strings again hot strings to me this may it might

420
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,900
to some of you seem very simple and then oh maybe I'll use that maybe I won't I

421
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,900
can't stress how much you realize you type the same words or same URLs or

422
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,300
passwords or email addresses or names of companies over and over and over or even

423
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,180
entire paragraphs right so there's this is a lifesaver it just saves so much

424
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,220
time and in a second here we're switch over to launching a spell check that

425
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,420
will run again this will work in any program right I could have been a notepad

426
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,380
and it'll dump it in right any Windows program so it's running across all of

427
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,500
your tools some every once in a while you have a little problem sending to it

428
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,860
and that's also check out my my Udemy course or just read the search and read

429
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,620
the help you know I push my Udemy courses little just because they give a good

430
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,460
guide it's not that I want to make a ton of money it's I don't mind making money

431
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,540
but it's it's that they give a nice flow and they cover things they give you an

432
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,940
order and some people really like having the structure in the order so let's get

433
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,820
into the next one with using a spell check

434
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:57,820
alright this spell check I found on the forum years ago and I tried backtracking

435
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,540
it to get the documentation where I found it but I couldn't find it anyway it

436
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,980
has nearly 4,000 words in it and it's great because no matter what program I'm

437
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,380
in in Windows as long as the script is running it is doing the spell check for

438
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:15,460
me across all of those Windows anywhere I'm typing so let's jump into it you can

439
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,660
get it off of this main page and I'll put a link in this video too but on this

440
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,740
main page down here download spell check I'm gonna right-click and say save

441
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,400
link as and here we're gonna save it for now I'm gonna save it let's go to the

442
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,260
where I have those other files saved

443
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,080
a lot of key for beginners here we go and I'm gonna call it spell check that's

444
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,680
fine save it now it's gonna save it I'm not gonna launch it here what I want to

445
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,160
do is let's look at that directory and I'm gonna come in here and say edit oh

446
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,920
gotta highlight it edit script and now this is gonna pull it up and I want to

447
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,560
talk through a couple of things before we launch it notice these here's the

448
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,400
source just so you have it here too this is where you can get it from and that no

449
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,840
environment we're familiar with they're ready single lessons force absolutely

450
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,760
send mode input great this one is basically turning off because these are

451
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,360
spelled properly right so it turns off the back spacing for for some of these

452
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,240
hot strings so because those are often people the spell check will think it's

453
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,720
misspelled but it's not and so we're turning it off for that in here and I

454
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,520
hear examples and look how big this file is right like I said it has got 4,000

455
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,520
words that will auto correct for you so it's a really helpful script let's go

456
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:48,600
ahead and do a demo down let's pick the one I let's do America so sometimes

457
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,520
apparently people forget the sea because I guess there's no seas in America maybe

458
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,800
few oceans but let's say America notice the star here so it's not going to wait

459
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,520
for us for an ending character right it's gonna do the replacement right away

460
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,240
and but unfortunately I haven't I haven't actually launched this yet right

461
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,600
and right now in the system trade we don't have anything running right now

462
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,080
this one has been killed for now but let's go ahead what I want to do is to

463
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,680
come back into where we saved it and I'm gonna get the path to this file so come

464
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,960
in here copy this go back to site here and this is actually going to cause a

465
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,160
problem but I want to demonstrate this as well so I'm gonna say run because we

466
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,760
wanted to run the script this is the folder and then it's what was it spell

467
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,440
underscore I can see it at the top there in the other tab check HK now if I was to

468
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,240
save this and we launched this script we see the one green H running here it's

469
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,960
just test right but hey why didn't that launch the other script well the problem

470
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,120
is we if we have a hot key or if I had a return this top part of your script is

471
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,080
the auto exec script and it happens up until you come down to like a hot key or

472
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,000
return like that so what we want to do is things that we want to launch we want

473
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,680
to have it at the top part of your scripts and so now I'm gonna save this

474
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,880
now if I relaunch this or hit ctrl R you're gonna notice over here now we have

475
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,200
two green ages and it's unfortunate that it always puts in that same default

476
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,960
icon and and this is where it gets really confusing if you have a lot of

477
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,040
scripts running any given time I typically have like five to seven scripts

478
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,360
running at a given time all the time right for this example video I've

479
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,760
ripped everything out so I don't confuse anybody but remember this needs to be at

480
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,880
the top in your auto exec section otherwise it won't it won't get to it

481
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,360
basically it stops it it stops before it reaches it now there's an easy quote

482
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,880
unquote cure for this one is at the top here again if we don't want these two

483
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,040
green ages well hey the spell check I want it running all the time I don't it's

484
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,240
rare I'm gonna edit that file so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come in here and

485
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,240
that's why I've added this here is this no tray icon if I save this and you know

486
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,520
what I could launch it from here but let's come back in we don't even have to

487
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,080
be here I can just hit control R and you'll notice the the green H is gonna

488
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,400
go away so I'm gonna hit control R now that other green H isn't there but the

489
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,560
script is still running and I'll demonstrate that by coming in here

490
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:35,600
let's come back down to our America example there we go so I'm gonna start

491
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,920
typing AMERIA and notice it put in the C right so the script is still

492
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,960
running but we don't have it in the system tray there's some some major

493
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,800
benefits of this is that if you have a lot of scripts going it doesn't get

494
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,920
confusing down here the drawback of course is I couldn't come in here and

495
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,920
right-click and say edit so it can make it it can be a pain and I have another

496
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,240
script that you can use that'll it'll show you all running scripts I could go

497
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,400
to my task manager and I could find it from there and right-click and kill it

498
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,680
or I could come back in here and I could just you know go to edit it I could I

499
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,520
could even find it in here and right-click and say edit right so I can

500
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,280
get to it that way but it just won't be in your system tray and you can change

501
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,800
the icons like in some of my other scripts I have it where I change icons I

502
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,800
even have a script to automate changing the icon so Google that on my on my

503
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,240
YouTube channel but it's I recommend hiding you know only having one to two

504
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,000
in there because otherwise it just gets too confusing and so I only allow my

505
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,040
one script I'm playing with to be there and then I'll change it either I hide it

506
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,120
or I change it to a different one so let's demonstrate a couple other things

507
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,320
in here notice down here at the bottom they have abbreviations so I can type

508
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,440
SCP period that's funny it was trying to interpret that SCP period space and it

509
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,160
puts in September for me right so this would be a spell check or let's do this

510
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,280
the days of the week I see Sun space right so it has a lot of default ones of

511
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,920
course you could either comment these out or delete them if you don't want to

512
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,760
have them in there obviously the word may you know that one's gonna come up in a

513
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,600
lot of sentences so they didn't do it for that one but you get the idea right

514
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,000
this is a great easy tool to have running and it runs like let's go back to

515
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,320
I don't have it launched I was gonna say let's launch notepad which I just don't

516
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,680
recall we got rid of that hotkey I'll just turn it back on save reload control

517
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,520
in to launch it and I'm gonna kill it real quick because I'll forget that I

518
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:46,360
did that and if we do the SUN period space there's Sunday a M E R I know see

519
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:53,480
a America no V November right it'll run in every program so if you're like me I

520
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,840
actually have a couple tools allow me a text from my computer it's so easy to be

521
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,640
able to automate texting and be using your hot strings to help type the stuff

522
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,680
that you want to send right so it's super simple super fast hot strings are

523
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,440
there you know a really really really great tool that I highly recommend also

524
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,680
don't add too many the spell checks one thing because it's doing automatically but

525
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,520
the regular hot strings don't add too many at once baby step into it also make

526
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,240
abbreviation so like mine what I do is for email addresses I'll put usually

527
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,520
minor my own email addresses are different because I have about eight and I

528
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,840
do them differently but if if I knew let's say Abraham Lincoln and he had an

529
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,120
email address I would do Abraham Lincoln email oops and then a period so

530
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,000
unfortunately that one may not because it looks like that's actually a word but

531
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,560
and this would be Abe at gmail.com right so oh and I actually look at that I

532
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,440
messed up that there we go that's better and this one of course I want the O in

533
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,920
there so I'm gonna save this reload it a e so it's basically the first two

534
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,000
initial the initials the there are the first two letters followed by an e and

535
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,720
that way and then a period and so that helps me have a pattern and makes it

536
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,640
easier for me to remember all my hot strings because I have hundreds upon

537
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,440
hundreds of them and it can be it can be confusing but again they're super

538
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,200
helpful and so let's get going on the next section

539
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,000
okay so I want to do one more with the hot key just to demonstrate how easy it

540
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,240
is to remap keys in a given program let's say you know in a lot of programs

541
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,280
control H will do the search replace functionality and the control H to me

542
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,560
just isn't the most intuitive hot key so what if I wanted to send a different

543
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,560
you know hit a different hot key to send control H so let's say I wanted Alt R so

544
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:07,280
Alt R that's gonna trigger this now we're gonna send control H and make sure

545
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,520
you add the return because we're on more than one line so I'm gonna save this

546
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,520
control R will reload the script I saw it blink now I'm gonna hit Alt R and

547
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,240
notice it this came up which is the control H now control H still works in

548
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,200
site because I didn't replace that but on that when I hit Alt R it sends control

549
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,360
H which is what the active program is gonna interpret as oh hey here control H

550
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,560
so it's a great easy way to adjust something if you don't like the hot key

551
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,360
or accelerator key and the program you're in you can write it just to redo

552
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,000
your own now when I was actually doing this I came up with a little bit of a

553
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,400
problem here let's let's change the control R R R let's just comment it out

554
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:54,440
so we don't have that one for now you you could do this this works technically

555
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:04,960
so control R is gonna send you know what I want to leave that so we are we're

556
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,200
gonna do control R to send control H and before the control R was up here so

557
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:18,080
this technically will work so I'm gonna save this I'm gonna minimize that

558
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,520
reload the script I think this should we'll control I'm gonna hit control R now

559
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:34,440
that sent the control H however I got a caution you these modifier keys have to

560
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:43,200
be the same so if I was trying to hit Alt R to send control H unfortunately so

561
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,440
let me close this reload the script now I'm hit Alt R Alt R it doesn't work I

562
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,040
just hit it it doesn't work and basically what's happening is this is what

563
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,800
gets passed along the the control whatever modifier key was here is gonna

564
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,600
be the same over here it when they're the same it works fine when they're

565
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,960
different then you need to put it onto the next line and then add the return

566
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,320
right so if you just get in the practice of doing them on the next line then

567
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,000
you're fine right if you're gonna use the same modifier key you can have them the

568
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,240
same line if not then put them on different line so I hope that helps it

569
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,240
again just think about it if you're in a program you don't like you know the

570
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,000
the commands being sent it's a great easy way the hotkey that the program is

571
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,320
associated with it you can make your own and the other one I wanted to point out

572
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,280
was you can make context sensitive hotkeys and I'll have a link in the

573
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,240
the web page about this but basically I could have it say if I'm in site and

574
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,560
hit control R and do one thing if I'm in notepad and I hit control R do another

575
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,040
and if I'm in word and hit control R do something else so there there's context

576
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,160
sensitive meaning they understand what program they're in the active program and

577
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,240
it's gonna do something different they're not totally hard to do but be

578
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,240
considering this is a beginning video I didn't want to you know do too much in

579
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,840
this video training video to show you so that's it and then next we'll move on

580
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,720
to our next section okay now we're gonna work on sending mouse clicks to a given

581
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,440
position and before we dive into the code I do want to caution you because

582
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,840
windows often are you know are in different locations where they have

583
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,800
something in front of it and it's not the most consistent reliable way to

584
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,800
automate programs there's a lot of other ways I have a lot of we have webinars

585
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,040
and tutorials on different ways to approach this however this is easy and

586
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,200
if you're controlling the environment it's definitely something you can easily

587
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,880
do set up and let's go ahead and dive into it here so let's pretend we're

588
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,880
gonna click this we'll stick with the control H type thing this is the we

589
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,160
activate the program here so this is the replace button we want to get this down

590
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,880
the problem of course is we need to know the coordinates of where that button is

591
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,600
right so the sending of the click is easy there's a little bit of stuff we

592
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,920
need to figure out where we're gonna send it to so there's a really simple

593
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:11,360
command it's a get no mouse get position and it's gonna ask for the the two

594
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,040
variables to store it so you can see here output var x I'll part var y those

595
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:26,000
are suggestions so we'll just call this one look x comma look why look why there

596
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,760
we go that's all we need there and to start off let's let's do a message box

597
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:41,760
oh you know what well we'll finish this here so message box and x is at and this

598
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,200
is where we're gonna wrap our variable name the thing we just had look x with

599
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,360
percent signs and that will make the message box display the value in the

600
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:59,880
variable not the actual text that we have there so x is there and y is at

601
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,160
that's why here we go so unfortunately right now I could run this but guess what

602
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,760
we don't have a hot key to trigger it right so let's add a hot key let's say

603
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:23,600
what let's say control oh I got a control M control P sure for position so I try to

604
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:35,440
think of them as you know meaningful so it control P to get mouse position now

605
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,920
we're of course this is gonna change later because we're gonna swap this to

606
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,120
actually click in the position but for now it's fine so I'm gonna save this control

607
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,160
R to reload oh I disabled my control R to let's I think I I disabled it but I

608
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,800
didn't read restart it now control our works and this is where this I'm trying

609
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,000
to show you a little bit of the troubleshooting while you're going through

610
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,760
this right so control P is gonna get if I hit it right now it's saying x is at

611
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,200
384 and y is at 58 but that was down here right so we're gonna redo this come up

612
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:13,040
here now hit control P and now we have to remember 481 and 93 so actually I'm

613
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,560
gonna leave this up here by the way any message box and on a hotkey you can come

614
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,200
in here and hit control C and come down here and paste and it will have the

615
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,160
contents from that message box right so it's a nice easy way to get that little

616
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:34,360
insider tip there so this is gonna be the x is gonna be 481 so let's comment this

617
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:42,760
out and I'm gonna keep these numbers so x is 41 and y 93 so I'm cheating here

618
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:51,480
because the next thing is you know we'll just we'll make that a comment and I'll

619
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,040
have this and now we're gonna click so we're gonna say click comma and now it's

620
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:05,440
as simple we entered those numbers right so 481 comma 93 and that is that let's

621
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,200
add a return so it doesn't keep going so I'm gonna save this reload and now when

622
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:17,920
I hit control P notice it moved my mouse there oh look at that how did I get the

623
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,560
wrong thing that's it I'm you know I we can go back and watch a video I will

624
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:28,200
bet you money I was on the wrong thing when I did that so simply we will disable

625
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:36,920
this re-enable this oops well I need to reload the script make sure we're over

626
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,640
the correct thing and this is why you know you'd practice right walk it through

627
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:47,320
so 435 yeah look at that I was off an 87 now the y it's this way so that one

628
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:54,640
probably can say the same but the 435 this should have been 435 right because

629
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:01,800
your x is going across and the y is the up and down so now I'm a save reload and

630
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,680
hit control P and there we go so funny how I got distracted apparently and

631
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:14,280
moused over the wrong item that I wanted to click now again if I had a window up

632
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,680
in front of this it wouldn't care oops hey it wouldn't care it would have

633
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,360
clicked you know and right here and this is why that sending of a mouse click

634
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,360
just isn't that robust or if I move this to another monitor the coordinates are

635
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,080
gonna be different or even if I move it like this the coordinates are gonna be

636
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,560
different right there's a lot of reasons why this can break but this is just the

637
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,560
simple way of hey sending a mouse click to a given coordinates often we put our

638
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,400
windows up we maximize them and and the things don't move so it definitely can

639
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,280
work it's just not the most robust way by the way I have a script called

640
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,560
automate my task on my website and it it eases the pain of getting these

641
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,920
coordinates finding an image it actually narrows it down by the controls it's

642
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,880
pretty robust it'll search everywhere for you you just lock in the image and

643
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,560
then say go click this or go send text to this edit field so check that out if

644
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,720
you're interested but that's it for the sending of a mouse click to given

645
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:15,520
coordinates in this section we're gonna explain how if you want to share your

646
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,280
code with someone else or that you want to run your code on another computer you

647
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,920
don't have to install auto hotkey it's very very easy to compile a script an

648
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,480
auto hotkey and give it to someone else or just run another computer so let's go

649
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,840
ahead and get started we come in here and go to explore this is the easiest way

650
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,680
highlight the script you want right click and just say compile script right

651
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,480
that'll actually create an executable program in the same folder it takes a

652
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,520
couple seconds so here now I have an executable program I can take this to

653
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,320
any Windows computer I don't have to install anything I just put it on it and

654
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,520
run it and when you run it it'll you'll have the you know if it had a system

655
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,400
tray icon it'll it'll have it down there let's do this with the test so I'm gonna

656
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,400
right click say in that one compile script I'll end up here with a test dot

657
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,920
exe and that one because we have hotkeys in it and the icon is showing it

658
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,840
should show up here in the system tray and that's it right other languages this

659
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,960
can take a lot of work Python in particular I would compile scripts and

660
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,200
it was a process and it's just it's amazing that it's so easy not a hotkey

661
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,240
to compile script and give it to someone else and if they're running even

662
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,600
down to Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 it's very very consistent

663
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,600
there are some things with pre Windows 7 there was no user access control and so

664
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,520
things were slightly different so XP might be just slightly different but

665
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,240
generally speaking they're very stable across all versions of Windows on

666
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,840
different computers now the program itself might be a little different

667
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,480
depending if you're sending mouse clicks in the coordinates right I mentioned

668
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,560
that earlier but the the heart of the program stays the same so that's simple

669
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,840
as we wrap up I wanted to share some helpful links and resources that can

670
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,920
help you automate everything and let me jump over here on this so in this

671
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,120
beginner page right which I'll have in the resources here there's the you know

672
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,160
absolute documentation commands and keys these links I have these three

673
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:22,280
bookmarked on my main default home page I use them a lot that documentation and

674
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,880
commands those are great the keys are when you're just getting used to

675
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,640
understanding what keys you want to send all three of these are just must-haves

676
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,680
that you use in and out the forum page the overall hotkey form it's an amazing

677
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,840
form the people are super helpful and nice you can definitely go there you can

678
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,440
find a ton of things already solved for you there's different forms let's

679
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,440
actually let's jump to it real quickly here and show you so the main page here

680
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,040
breaks down into different forms so there's tutorials scripts these are

681
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,360
completed scripts and functions here's where you go to ask for help and then

682
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,800
down below you'll actually see here are the links to the other languages so if

683
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,720
if English isn't your first language you can actually ask questions about that in

684
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:09,160
that language which is great and so I have those here discord is also it's a

685
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,880
live site well I shouldn't say life I put people hang out there and they will

686
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,400
they're more than happy to help you with with what you're working on and then

687
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,640
you can share screens and so it's a dynamic way to be able to talk to people

688
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,160
and get some help but you do have to use this link to create an account for it

689
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,880
by the way I like I said I have over 600 maybe so for 700 YouTube videos on

690
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,240
auto hotkey now and I cover a lot of different topics so you can definitely

691
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:41,440
go there this tutorial on specific this playlist is specifically geared towards

692
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,120
people like you that are just starting out an auto hotkey there's not a ton of

693
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,400
videos in there but there is a deeper dive you know we skimmed over the

694
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,360
installing a editor and installing the program and discussing it I go a little

695
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,000
deeper in these and then there's we've given over 50 webinars on auto hotkey

696
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and we have also I think now around yeah 65 podcasts discussing different things

697
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,800
with automation I did mention earlier I have three Udemy courses here and if you

698
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,280
click them from here there's a coupon code that you'll get a discount for so

699
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,360
for the basically for the intro to auto hotkey hot strings like I said it's hot

700
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,040
strings are just amazing and the intermediate course these are all

701
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:26,880
they're roughly are between ten dollars and thirteen twelve ninety nine so if you

702
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,320
come here you'll get the best deal that there is and I'll get more of the money

703
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,840
it's hard to explain but Udemy if you come in from other places I end up

704
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,600
getting a tiny fraction of the money instead of getting them from here so I

705
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,760
appreciate if you click these links at the same time it is going to be the

706
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,360
cheapest price you can get so that's why I have them here there are auto hotkey

707
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,600
books by Jack Dunning Jack's been writing for over 30 years and he has a

708
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,000
ton of auto hotkey books you can go to his blog two of the books are free and

709
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,320
then you can download or you know order the other ones they're very reasonably

710
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,560
priced usually between four to six dollars I think and if you're one of

711
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:05,160
those people that would rather have you know it it you know a step-by-step very

712
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,480
minutiae work it's really great because he also gives you a ton of examples of

713
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,920
how you might use auto hotkey and that's one of things I do a lot of my

714
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,040
videos as well as just talk through what I've automated because it's easy to kind

715
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,320
of get caught up in doing something and not realize hey there a lot of the stuff

716
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,600
I do daily can be automated so I hope that helps auto hotkey is a very rich

717
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,920
robust language we didn't even scratch the surface of what it's capable of this

718
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,400
is just to introduce you to you but you can do things like web scraping I have a

719
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,200
screen clipping tool it'll grab text you can do regular expressions it's an

720
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,600
object-oriented language so you can do some pretty advanced stuff but the API

721
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,260
calls are another great one I do a lot of automating of Excel and Outlook so

722
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,520
sending emails or automating reporting in Excel anything with the Microsoft

723
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,280
Office program you can basically connect to programmatically and really well

724
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,240
drive it so go ahead and check it out my site alone if you come up to the main

725
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,920
site here there's there's you know a lot of different things in here that you can

726
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,480
learn about with using functions where they so here's the functions controlling

727
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,040
programs with controls that's another really great one the web scraping I

728
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,240
mentioned with either IE or now with Chrome which you can see in here again

729
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,800
it's web scraping Excel Auto Hockey Studio once you get a little bit more

730
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,280
robust is an amazing editor it's a default editor I use now but I do have

731
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,240
all these videos on site on how to customize site and to do some advanced

732
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,880
stuff thank you for watching my video if you found it helpful please like

733
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,040
it now and share if you think that others will benefit from it the more you

734
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,640
share the more we get likes we get the more videos like this we can make and

735
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,840
it just helps support us also if you're interested you can go to my site and go

736
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,400
to sign up for our alerts basically we send out alerts of new stuff new videos

737
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,200
new things we've learned new concepts of how to do Auto Hockey and automation as

738
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,600
well as just things you might want to automate so we hope to see you there

739
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,760
thanks again cheers
