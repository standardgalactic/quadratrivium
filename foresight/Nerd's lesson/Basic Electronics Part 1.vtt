WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.760
Okay, since you know who I am and you know how I operate, I'm all about protocols, not

00:11.760 --> 00:15.480
putting the proverbial cart before the horse.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.920
That being said, tonight, one night, one night only, we're going to put the cart before the

00:20.920 --> 00:22.760
horse.

00:22.760 --> 00:29.560
The way that I want you to approach ELEC 110, and this is a recipe for success, because

00:29.560 --> 00:32.520
like I said, I've been doing this for a couple of years, I know what works and I know what

00:32.520 --> 00:33.520
doesn't.

00:33.520 --> 00:41.440
And I guarantee you, I guarantee you, if you follow the syllabus, if you do all the assignments

00:41.440 --> 00:45.920
that you're given, if you follow that recipe for success, you will be successful, you'll

00:45.920 --> 00:47.840
pass this class.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.840
Guarantee it.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.080
I don't know if any of you also know, Lake Washington Technical College has a guarantee

00:54.080 --> 00:59.840
that if you graduate our program, go into industry, and your local, whoever you go to

00:59.840 --> 01:04.520
work for says you don't know what you're talking about, we will re-educate you for free to

01:04.520 --> 01:08.520
get you to the standard that industry says, you know, how many students have been sent

01:08.520 --> 01:10.480
back to the electronics program?

01:10.480 --> 01:11.480
Zero.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.480
Zero.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.160
So I know it's working.

01:15.160 --> 01:21.200
So keep in mind, the way that this is supposed to work, I think this really is the best recipe

01:21.200 --> 01:28.760
for success, is I like to read through the chapter very quickly.

01:28.760 --> 01:34.120
And what that does is like format your hard drive for what you're about to receive.

01:34.120 --> 01:39.360
That of course is a given that you've already reviewed the syllabus.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.080
In reviewing the syllabus, that shows you specifically, like on page one they start,

01:44.080 --> 01:49.160
the course outcomes and objectives, and then you look at how those course outcomes and

01:49.160 --> 01:55.160
objectives of the syllabus, which is really the training contract between you and I, how

01:55.160 --> 02:03.040
closely the book and the chapter works meet those objectives.

02:03.040 --> 02:08.520
So read through the objectives in the syllabus first, then read through chapter one, or chapter

02:08.520 --> 02:12.080
17, whatever chapter you're on, just like a book.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.960
But this isn't a book, it's a textbook.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.360
So when you get to the end, it's not going to be like, oh, I never knew it was going

02:16.360 --> 02:17.960
to turn out like that, okay?

02:17.960 --> 02:20.240
I mean, this is a textbook.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.360
It's a text slash reference book.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.960
After you've read through the chapter, then go through it with a fine tooth comb.

02:27.960 --> 02:34.600
Whenever you come to an example or a problem, take out your calculator and do the math and

02:34.600 --> 02:38.280
follow along and do every practice problem.

02:38.280 --> 02:42.960
Keep note of that because that's going to be part of your written assignment.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.680
Then when you're all done with the chapter, then I'd read through it again very, very

02:46.680 --> 02:51.080
quickly just to make sure you retained all that information.

02:51.080 --> 02:58.000
Some of the stuff that we're going to talk about tonight in chapter one like atoms, molecules,

02:58.000 --> 02:59.560
you probably have heard before, right?

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
The periodic table.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.680
A lot of you have heard that already before.

03:02.680 --> 03:08.100
So keep that in mind that if you're going through the book and the book is talking about stuff

03:08.100 --> 03:12.480
that you already know, you don't need to beat that to death.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.640
And that's actually good because it's going to draw you to focus your attention on those

03:16.720 --> 03:19.920
areas that you don't understand.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.920
And you're going to be able to dump all of your energy into the stuff you don't understand.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
Does that make sense?

03:25.920 --> 03:30.840
I mean, it sounds really basic when you think about it like that, but that's really what's

03:30.840 --> 03:34.200
going to be the most effective means of traversing this.

03:34.200 --> 03:42.640
Normally, I will not lecture on a chapter until you've read the chapter, done your homework,

03:42.640 --> 03:53.440
and gotten together in your teams and completed a peer review, right, of your homework.

03:53.440 --> 03:59.520
Once your homework has gone through that process and then you've got completed homework, then

03:59.520 --> 04:03.640
come into lecture because you know what I want to spend my time and lecture, lecturing

04:03.640 --> 04:05.080
on?

04:05.080 --> 04:07.240
What you didn't get out of the book.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.280
What you didn't get out of the assignments.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.160
That's how I want to spend the majority of my time in lecture.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.160
Fair enough?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.800
Okay.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.200
Let's get started.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.680
These slides here actually follow the book.

04:21.680 --> 04:27.640
And these slides, by the way, are available online on the Google site.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.360
The TAs helped you out on how to get that site.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.640
The links are right there in your syllabus.

04:33.640 --> 04:39.760
So what you could do is you could download these from the site to your computer and then

04:39.760 --> 04:42.840
put them on your laptop or home computer and have the same slides that I'm showing you

04:42.840 --> 04:43.840
tonight.

04:43.840 --> 04:52.000
Also, there are audio files of this lecture, an MP3 format, that you could download, Joe

04:52.000 --> 04:56.680
Greenock on MP3, right, and listen to me when you're working out at the gym or running

04:56.680 --> 05:02.200
from the police or whatever it is you do when you listen to MP3s.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.400
And then also, we're going to be adding to this now videotape of the lecture that we've

05:07.400 --> 05:09.800
got our TAs back there working on right now.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.680
So ultimately, we'll be able to upload that.

05:12.680 --> 05:18.920
And the reason that I go out of my way with recordings, with the slides, I've got nothing

05:18.920 --> 05:19.920
to hide.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.920
I've got nothing to hide.

05:20.920 --> 05:25.440
As a matter of fact, I want to give you as much information as I possibly can so that

05:25.440 --> 05:29.240
you could benefit from that information.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.520
And you know what?

05:30.520 --> 05:35.840
How many of you here own any DVDs, your favorite movies?

05:35.840 --> 05:38.400
Why would you own a copy of a movie?

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
Why would you do that?

05:39.400 --> 05:42.680
Isn't seeing it once good enough?

05:42.680 --> 05:47.080
Why would you go out and buy DVDs of a movie?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
Because they're cheap.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.120
Unless they're given away, so it costs money.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.120
What's that?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
Yeah.

05:54.120 --> 06:03.200
If you could watch it any time you want, but why specifically would you purchase a particular

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
movie?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.560
Because it encompasses your interest.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.560
Exactly.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.400
It encompasses your interest.

06:09.400 --> 06:14.560
And for those of you that have movies, how many of you have watched a movie the second

06:14.560 --> 06:18.600
time and picked up stuff out of it the second time around that?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.640
There's some movies I've seen in the theater that I'm like, I got to go out and get that

06:21.640 --> 06:24.000
DVD because I want to see this again.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.600
Yeah, I know how it ends up, but I want to see it because I missed something in the beginning

06:28.600 --> 06:31.840
and I want to look for that thing that I missed in the beginning or whatever.

06:31.840 --> 06:36.360
So it's perfectly natural for you to want to hear this lecture over and over again.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.320
For some of you, once might be good enough.

06:38.320 --> 06:43.560
I go to church on Sunday, my pastor normally, he gets up there and he preaches.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.560
I get it right the first time.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.280
I don't need to hear it again.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.200
For some other people though, and actually at my church they do audio recordings and

06:52.200 --> 06:54.520
then people can listen to that content.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.640
They want to hear it again.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.920
Normally I get it the first time that's the kind of guy that I am, that's the type of

06:58.920 --> 07:00.280
learner that I am.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.440
Look at that.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.440
That's the other thing too with taking notes.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.000
Some of you, it's been a while since you've been in school.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.480
Try to hone your note-taking skills.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.680
When I emphasize something, I'm usually emphasizing it for a reason and that reason is you may

07:15.680 --> 07:22.600
see it again in the future on a quiz, on an exam, but most importantly, you may see it

07:22.600 --> 07:26.840
in industry because one of the things I don't want to do is teach you the exam, teach you

07:26.840 --> 07:27.840
the quiz.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.720
That's not what it's all about.

07:29.720 --> 07:35.000
One of the things that I want to share with you is I'm not really concerned.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.520
I mean, I want all of you to pass my quizzes.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.920
I want you to all pass my exam.

07:38.920 --> 07:42.360
I want you to all pass this class, but to be totally honest with you, do you know how

07:42.360 --> 07:44.920
I measure your success?

07:44.920 --> 07:52.160
I measure your success as to where are you going to be five years from now?

07:52.160 --> 07:56.400
Did I give you anything out of this course that helps you in that position you're in

07:56.400 --> 07:57.840
in five years?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.480
In ten years.

07:59.480 --> 08:06.520
The payoff for me is when you call me and say, Joe, I'm in town or I'm passing through.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.480
I'd like to buy you lunch.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.680
I like lunch.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.840
Swing by, buy me lunch.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.840
Tell me what's going on.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.960
Tell me what you're doing now and how I had an impact on that.

08:17.960 --> 08:23.880
I actually, I went on a cruise over Spring Break, Caribbean.

08:23.880 --> 08:29.280
I was just getting ready to get on the ship and I get all my emails forwarded to my phone

08:29.480 --> 08:36.240
and I got an email from a student that I had in 1993 and he introduced himself and he says,

08:36.240 --> 08:38.040
I don't know if you remember me.

08:38.040 --> 08:42.160
My response back to him, of course I remember you, you know, because again, we established

08:42.160 --> 08:45.280
a relationship, a professional relationship, but he graduated.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.840
He went down to California, kind of dropped off the radar.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.920
He was going to be in the area and was wondering if I'd be available next Friday to get together

08:51.920 --> 08:55.720
and we could visit and I said, Alice, she's unfortunately I'm out of town and, you know,

08:55.720 --> 09:01.200
that is how I measured the success.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.320
Number one, that he remembered me.

09:03.320 --> 09:08.800
Number two, what he learned here is part of his present reality.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.440
So that's what I want all of you to think about.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.600
Yeah, you want to pass the quiz, you want to pass the exam, you want to pass the class,

09:13.600 --> 09:15.680
but where are you really going to use this stuff?

09:15.680 --> 09:20.720
Anyway, kicking things off here, this is section one of the book, section one of the book.

09:20.720 --> 09:26.400
Every of the texts that deals with what are called DC circuits, DC stands for direct

09:26.400 --> 09:31.360
current and we're going to talk about the difference between direct current and alternating

09:31.360 --> 09:33.240
current throughout this.

09:33.240 --> 09:45.040
Chapter one deals with the fundamentals of electricity and I got to tell you that these

09:45.040 --> 09:52.520
first few chapters are like sacred chapters, you know.

09:52.520 --> 09:58.200
We should like ring bells and like hit gongs and chimes or whatever when we speak of some

09:58.200 --> 10:02.880
of this stuff because if you want to be successful in electricity and electronics, these things

10:02.880 --> 10:09.920
that we're going to speak of are critical attributes of what makes stuff work.

10:09.920 --> 10:16.480
As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag from the get go.

10:16.480 --> 10:26.680
The four, the big four things that we're looking at that drive this entire industry are four

10:26.680 --> 10:35.440
properties, the properties are voltage, current, resistance, and power.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.800
Voltage, current, resistance, and power, voltage, current, resistance, and power.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.160
My cell phone works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.120
My car computer works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.720
Satellite TV works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.760
Anything electrical or electronic works because of those four.

10:51.760 --> 10:57.740
So what we really need to ensure is that these four properties that we're going to discuss,

10:57.740 --> 11:01.680
we fully understand up one side and down the other.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.880
As I said earlier, I've been doing this like since puberty, so you would think that I know

11:06.880 --> 11:13.960
everything there is to know about voltage, current, resistance, and power, no, I do not.

11:13.960 --> 11:18.600
Occasionally I get questions from students that are associated with those properties

11:18.600 --> 11:22.160
that I can't quite answer, even though I've been doing this for so long.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.480
So I'm on a continual journey to learn as much as I can about those four properties.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.040
So we're going to kick things off of chapter one here, dealing with the fundamentals of

11:30.040 --> 11:35.680
electricity, but pay special attention to those four properties, voltage, current, resistance,

11:35.680 --> 11:38.960
and power, the big four, I like to call them the big four, because they are the big four.

11:38.960 --> 11:44.040
It's what everything is based on.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.520
If you know what's going on with voltage, current, resistance, and power, you know what's

11:46.520 --> 11:50.280
going on inside the circuit, we're going to talk about that.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.600
So kicking things off, fundamentals of electricity.

11:54.600 --> 12:00.080
One of the things that I do at the start of every lecture is I review the objectives.

12:00.080 --> 12:08.680
The objectives that I review are the same objectives that are on the syllabus.

12:08.680 --> 12:13.160
That's a pretty good reason why I selected this textbook to use.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.280
Although there's errors in this textbook, although it's not the best textbook on the

12:16.280 --> 12:25.440
face of the planet, the objectives in the textbook reflect the objectives in the syllabus.

12:25.440 --> 12:31.520
One of the other things I want you to fully understand is I don't teach the textbook.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.720
I teach the curriculum.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.520
The curriculum is contained in the syllabus.

12:37.520 --> 12:46.400
The curriculum is derived through input from our local industry advisory committee.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.920
This is a group of volunteers that get together on a regular basis, sit down and tell us what

12:50.920 --> 12:55.280
we need to be doing for this program to stay competitive.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.800
This book works really good because you're going to do all the chapters in it, but occasionally

12:59.800 --> 13:03.520
in the future you may get some textbooks that the instructor is going to say you don't need

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
to do this chapter.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
Why?

13:05.520 --> 13:06.600
It's not part of the curriculum.

13:06.600 --> 13:11.440
Local industry really doesn't think it's important that you learn that aspect of it.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.160
So does that make sense?

13:14.160 --> 13:18.200
One of the reasons that I review the objectives as well is to prepare you for what you're

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
about to receive.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.640
It's like formatting your hard drive so that when I start talking about this stuff, you're

13:23.640 --> 13:28.080
kind of like ready to store that information away on your hard drive, your mental hard

13:28.080 --> 13:31.120
drive, your brain.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.320
So let's take a look at this here.

13:33.320 --> 13:37.040
Objectives after completing this chapter, the student will be able to define matter,

13:37.040 --> 13:39.760
element, and molecule.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.600
There's three questions right off the quiz.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.440
Define matter, define element, define molecule.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.960
It's an objective.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.600
I hope at the end of this chapter you can define those.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.080
Notice the parts of an atom.

13:52.080 --> 14:01.040
Define the valence shell of an atom and identify the unit for measuring current.

14:01.040 --> 14:07.040
Draw the symbol used to represent current flow in a circuit.

14:07.040 --> 14:12.080
Describe the difference between conductors and insulators and semiconductors.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.400
Define difference of potential, electromotive force, and voltage.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.400
Voltage.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.640
Wasn't that one of the big four?

14:19.640 --> 14:24.640
So again, if this was like church would be ringing bells or gong, you know, we'll talk

14:24.640 --> 14:25.800
about projects later.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.880
Some of you may want to build sound effects so that we could, you know, whenever we do

14:29.880 --> 14:37.800
that stuff, or dim the lights, voltage.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.520
Draw the symbol used to represent voltage.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.440
Identify the unit used to measure voltage.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.680
To measure voltage.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.600
Define resistance, gong.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.000
For the big four.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.920
Identify characteristics of resistance, gong, in a circuit.

14:55.920 --> 15:02.320
Identify the unit for measuring resistance and draw the symbol used to represent resistance

15:02.320 --> 15:09.440
in a circuit.

15:09.440 --> 15:17.600
Everything you are about to learn as it pertains to electricity and electronics is traceable

15:17.600 --> 15:21.400
back to matter.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.880
Do any of you here know anything about matter?

15:24.880 --> 15:29.280
Do you know what matters?

15:29.280 --> 15:38.200
Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight.

15:38.200 --> 15:46.600
Does anybody know where we could find the absence of matter?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.000
Does anybody know?

15:48.000 --> 15:55.320
Can we create this condition here on planet Earth?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
Vacuum.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.920
And I'm not talking about the auric five pound upright.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.880
I don't think that's what you're talking about, right?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.480
What kind of vacuum are you talking about?

16:03.480 --> 16:07.100
It's called industrial vacuum.

16:07.100 --> 16:16.560
And in essence, what we're talking about is pumping all of the matter out of a vessel.

16:16.560 --> 16:24.560
So that all is that's left inside is space, empty space.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.600
It's used a lot, a lot of you that go into high tech careers, you're going to see this

16:27.600 --> 16:33.120
process used in the manufacturing process because it allows us to only put into the

16:33.120 --> 16:38.840
chamber what we want to be into the chamber.

16:38.840 --> 16:44.280
Where can we find a large abundance of an absence of matter?

16:44.280 --> 16:45.280
Space.

16:46.280 --> 16:52.880
And you know the odd thing about it is that's why it's called space.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.240
Because there's no matter.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.080
There's no matter.

16:57.080 --> 17:02.000
Now if you're in a spaceship traveling through space and you roll the window down and you

17:02.000 --> 17:09.960
stick your butterfly net out and you pick up some cosmic debris in your butterfly net,

17:09.960 --> 17:13.600
pretty odd thing to do, down a space suit if you're going to roll the window down in

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
the spaceship.

17:14.760 --> 17:23.160
But if you find any cosmic debris in your net, that means that you have found matter.

17:23.160 --> 17:32.440
Because if it's something and it occupies space and it has weight, therefore it's matter.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.520
Have any of you heard of antimatter?

17:35.520 --> 17:39.320
We will not be talking about that here in this program.

17:39.320 --> 17:44.280
I used to think it was science fiction until I was talking about it in a lecture like this

17:44.280 --> 17:48.960
and I had a student raise their hand and we're not going to talk about it because I don't

17:48.960 --> 17:53.000
know anything, you know, the absence of matter, antimatter, the opposite of matter.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.160
And he brought in an article the next week about a NASA project and these NASA teams

18:00.160 --> 18:01.880
are all about funding.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.960
So all these PhDs and all these scientists, it's all about getting money for them to continue

18:05.960 --> 18:07.440
their research.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.760
Well NASA was running out of money and there was a particular group that was doing research

18:11.760 --> 18:16.400
and they were going to get their operation shut down.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.320
So as soon as they all were basically put on notice, you all are no longer going to

18:20.320 --> 18:22.120
have a job at NASA.

18:22.120 --> 18:26.080
They're like, oh geez, you know, that's too bad, you know, that's really bad.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.160
Well, why is it so bad?

18:28.160 --> 18:36.480
Well, we just discovered a cloud of antimatter and we think it's headed this way, you know.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.960
So right away, you know, NASA gives them more money to continue the research and somewhere

18:40.960 --> 18:46.400
in my archives, I've actually got a picture of this antimatter cloud that, you know, I

18:46.400 --> 18:51.600
mean who knows if it even exists, but obviously if antimatter collides with matter, they cancel

18:51.600 --> 18:52.840
each other out.

18:52.840 --> 18:57.560
So if there was antimatter cloud that inundated our solar system, we'd be gone.

18:57.560 --> 19:02.240
You know, I don't know where we'd go, but this is what they say.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.440
Enough said, we won't be talking about antimatter in this class.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.480
We're more concerned about matter.

19:08.480 --> 19:14.880
Now the basic building block of all matter that we're aware of, and this is really interesting,

19:14.880 --> 19:18.600
is what's known as an element.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.720
An element can be found on the periodic table.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.280
I must not be a real professor.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.040
If I was a real professor, I'd have one of those pull down charts that's got the periodic

19:28.040 --> 19:30.600
table in all the squares, you know.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.880
That's the sign of a true professor.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.200
I don't have one of those.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.800
I could probably call it up on my computer screen, but it wouldn't be the same of having

19:36.800 --> 19:39.880
one of those pull down charts where you go with the pointer, right?

19:39.880 --> 19:41.200
And you've all seen that.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.000
You all know what I'm talking about, right?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.320
Probably saw it back in elementary school.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.740
Elements of the basic building block in nature cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by

19:50.740 --> 19:53.480
chemical means.

19:53.480 --> 20:04.360
And believe it or not, there are only about a hundred known elements in existence, period.

20:04.800 --> 20:19.640
That means me, you, that desktop, the chair, a cow, a monkey, a sports car, an airplane,

20:19.640 --> 20:28.720
were all made up of a hundred of the same ingredients, period.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.360
Isn't that amazing?

20:30.360 --> 20:34.520
When I was one of the things they really didn't know about going to the moon, were they going

20:34.520 --> 20:38.320
to go to the moon and find some new element?

20:38.320 --> 20:42.160
They went to the moon and they found the same stuff we got here on Earth.

20:42.160 --> 20:48.720
So basically, the assumption is in the scientific community that really, the entire universe

20:48.720 --> 20:52.040
is made up of about a hundred of the same ingredients.

20:52.040 --> 20:57.640
I mean, I got more crap in my pantry at home, spices, seasonings, you know, I got all kinds

20:57.640 --> 20:59.920
of stuff all over the place.

20:59.920 --> 21:05.640
But the fundamental essence of it all, a hundred plus elements, period.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.760
Everything's made up of those same hundred plus ingredients.

21:08.760 --> 21:17.000
Now, we're really focused on the parts of an atom.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.440
So when we have an element, the smallest particle that we could break that element down into

21:22.440 --> 21:28.880
and have it retain its identity is an atom.

21:28.880 --> 21:33.120
So I know you think I'm going all wacky like chemistry, onion, everything, okay?

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
Bear with me.

21:34.120 --> 21:38.080
We have to understand the essence of matter so that we get electricity out of matter.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.000
That's where we're going with this.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.880
The first part of the atom you need to understand is called the nucleus and the nucleus is not

21:44.880 --> 21:45.880
even really a part.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.600
I misspoke that.

21:47.600 --> 21:56.760
It's not a part, it's a place and that place is simply the center of the atom.

21:56.760 --> 22:05.560
The first true subatomic particle that we're going to talk about is the proton.

22:05.560 --> 22:11.840
Proton is a positively charged particle that's located in the nucleus, okay?

22:11.840 --> 22:15.600
And I just said something that's very, very significant.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.840
I just said the word positively charged.

22:19.840 --> 22:26.040
For the first time in this program, we just spoke of something that has an electrical

22:26.040 --> 22:30.760
characteristic, a positive charge.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.560
So proton has a positive charge.

22:33.560 --> 22:42.160
The other subatomic particle that's located in the nucleus of an atom is called the neutron.

22:42.160 --> 22:50.560
And neutrons are uncharged particles, meaning no charge.

22:50.560 --> 23:01.040
One of the ways that I remember it always is proton, positively charged.

23:01.040 --> 23:08.480
Both start with the letter P. Neutron, no, no, no, no, no, neutrally charged, okay?

23:08.480 --> 23:13.800
They're not positive or negative, they're uncharged, they're neutrally charged.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.120
That's where they're called neutrons.

23:17.120 --> 23:21.640
Electrons, well, that's the other subatomic particle.

23:21.640 --> 23:29.720
And if one's charged positive and one is neutral, then therefore the electron must be negatively

23:29.720 --> 23:33.640
charged particles.

23:33.640 --> 23:43.000
The electron actually orbits the nucleus where the protons and the neutrons are located.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.600
This is a very, very significant slide.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.400
Remember earlier I shared with you a little bit about my background?

23:48.400 --> 23:53.720
I wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.

23:53.720 --> 24:01.480
And as a matter of fact, when I was in the Navy on active duty, my uniform, the Navy,

24:01.480 --> 24:06.040
even if you sail on a cruise ship, you have a symbol that identifies what division you're

24:06.040 --> 24:07.640
part of.

24:07.640 --> 24:14.320
And for me, I had on my arm my chevrons, you know, that signified, you know, my rank.

24:14.320 --> 24:19.880
But then I had a helium atom on my arm.

24:19.880 --> 24:25.520
And that helium atom was to signify matter.

24:25.520 --> 24:31.200
And the helium atom with the electron orbiting around the outside was to signify electrons

24:31.200 --> 24:33.440
orbiting the nucleus.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
Why?

24:34.440 --> 24:37.240
Because I was an electronic technician.

24:37.240 --> 24:41.000
And I basically went for like three years of my career before I realized, why is there

24:41.000 --> 24:44.200
like an atom on my arm, okay?

24:44.200 --> 24:45.480
What does that mean?

24:45.480 --> 24:51.800
What it means is the electrons orbiting the nucleus because I was a subject matter expert,

24:51.800 --> 24:56.200
a technician on the behavior of electrons.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.120
That's what you're all here to learn.

24:58.120 --> 25:04.560
If you're here to learn about electronics, you're here to study the behavior of the electron.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.680
And that's what we're really going to talk about.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.840
Makes sense?

25:09.840 --> 25:13.720
One of the things I do not want you to study while you're here in this program.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.240
And I'm pretty open-minded.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.360
If you want to go off and do some projects and stuff like that, I'm all about it.

25:18.360 --> 25:23.720
One of the things I really don't want you doing is anything with the nucleus of the

25:23.720 --> 25:27.400
atom, okay?

25:27.400 --> 25:32.520
And if you plan on doing anything with the nucleus of the atom, give me fair warning.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.200
And I think I'll stay in federal way that day, okay?

25:36.200 --> 25:41.000
And then you can have at it and try to split the atom or do whatever it is you're going

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
to do.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.920
But when you start playing around with the nucleus of the atom, bad things happen.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.800
As electronics professionals, we're only going to play around with electrons.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.520
As a matter of fact, we're only going to play around with certain electrons.

25:53.520 --> 26:00.080
I'm going to share what those electrons are with you in a moment.

26:00.080 --> 26:05.760
This is kind of sort of what it looks like, maybe.

26:05.760 --> 26:12.200
This is an artist's depiction, and the scale is really, really off.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.440
The proton is a very big particle.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.040
The neutron is a very big particle.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.440
So the nucleus, this is kind of working, okay?

26:20.440 --> 26:23.480
This is kind of working for me.

26:23.480 --> 26:27.920
The electron, though, is not the same physical size as the proton.

26:27.920 --> 26:33.060
The electron would be like the spot of my laser pointer.

26:33.060 --> 26:39.260
But in actuality, if this truly was the neutron and the proton, I don't think the spot of

26:39.260 --> 26:42.720
my laser pointer would even be in the room anymore.

26:42.720 --> 26:47.260
That's how far the orbit is around the nucleus.

26:47.260 --> 26:49.980
I heard it once explained as like a cathedral.

26:49.980 --> 26:57.980
If you had the size of a grapefruit in the center of the cathedral, the electrons orbiting

26:57.980 --> 27:00.460
would actually be like on the outer walls.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.820
It'd be, you know, really, really far out there.

27:02.820 --> 27:08.500
So the scales here are off, but this gives you an idea of what's going on.

27:08.500 --> 27:16.820
One thing I want you to understand also is that all matter, when in its neutral, natural

27:16.820 --> 27:25.060
state, has an equal number of protons and electrons.

27:25.060 --> 27:28.260
Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged.

27:28.260 --> 27:30.780
They're equal numbers, so they cancel each other out.

27:30.780 --> 27:35.100
That means that matter is in a neutral, natural state.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.580
Did that answer your question?

27:38.580 --> 27:45.020
You had a balanced, so there's an equal number of electrons and protons in atoms until we

27:45.020 --> 27:46.020
do something to it.

27:46.020 --> 27:48.860
We're going to talk about that in a minute, too, because we're not just going to let everything

27:48.860 --> 27:50.860
stay in a neutral, natural state.

27:50.860 --> 27:53.780
If we did, we wouldn't have, we'd be out of jobs.

27:53.780 --> 27:54.780
We wouldn't have current flow.

27:54.780 --> 27:59.700
It'd be a drag.

27:59.700 --> 28:04.380
A couple of the numbers that you need to familiarize yourself with.

28:04.380 --> 28:09.820
And one of the things that I want to stress to you is that all of you are here taking

28:09.820 --> 28:11.340
electronics courses.

28:11.340 --> 28:15.580
You're here to learn the language of electricity and electronics.

28:15.580 --> 28:16.580
That's really what it is.

28:16.580 --> 28:17.740
It's like taking a second language.

28:17.740 --> 28:21.700
I've actually had a lot of students that speak different languages, and English is a second

28:21.700 --> 28:24.420
language, and they wonder if they could come in and do it, and say, yeah, you could come

28:24.420 --> 28:25.860
in and do it.

28:25.860 --> 28:29.980
Because you know what, what I'm talking about here is another language.

28:29.980 --> 28:35.220
So one of the technical terms that we may use in the future is a number called atomic

28:35.220 --> 28:36.980
number.

28:36.980 --> 28:43.060
An atomic number simply is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom.

28:43.060 --> 28:48.020
And every one of those hundred plus elements that I talked to you about earlier has a unique

28:48.020 --> 28:49.980
number of protons.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.420
You don't have two different elements that have the same number of protons.

28:53.420 --> 28:57.580
So the scientific community embraced this, and they said, you know what?

28:57.580 --> 29:03.180
Why don't we just use the number of protons, and that's going to give it its position on

29:03.180 --> 29:04.660
the periodic table.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.660
Make sense?

29:05.660 --> 29:06.660
Okay.

29:06.660 --> 29:11.820
The next number I want you to familiarize yourself with is the atomic weight.

29:11.820 --> 29:15.300
And the atomic weight deals with the mass of the atom.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
It's weight.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.300
It's physical weight.

29:17.300 --> 29:21.700
And remember when I said that protons and neutrons were big, and they were contained

29:21.700 --> 29:26.140
in the nucleus, and the electron was just like a little tiny subatomic particle orbiting

29:26.140 --> 29:27.140
way outside.

29:27.140 --> 29:34.340
Basically, to end up with atomic weight, all you do is count up the total number of protons

29:34.340 --> 29:36.620
and neutrons in the nucleus.

29:36.620 --> 29:37.620
Count that up.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.460
That gives you the atomic weight.

29:39.460 --> 29:46.460
Every weight of every element on the periodic table is unique.

29:46.460 --> 29:50.700
And basically, the mass of the electron is so insignificant, we don't even take that

29:50.700 --> 29:56.020
into account in determining the atomic weight.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.020
Make sense?

29:57.020 --> 30:03.780
Now, this is where things get interesting.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.660
First term, shell.

30:05.660 --> 30:10.220
This isn't the kind of shell you find by the seashore.

30:10.220 --> 30:17.020
What we're talking about here for shells is simply an orbital path around the nucleus.

30:17.020 --> 30:19.360
This is where the electrons orbit.

30:19.360 --> 30:24.860
They form concentric circles around the nucleus, and they're filled in sequence.

30:24.860 --> 30:29.080
Have any of you here been to a parking garage, like down at SeaTac Airport or Bellevue Square

30:29.080 --> 30:34.480
or, you know, I don't know about you, and I'm, again, not the smartest guy, but normally

30:34.480 --> 30:38.840
I want to park at, like, the first level like I find a space at.

30:38.840 --> 30:42.640
So what I'll do is I'll go to the first level and I'll drive around, and if I can't find

30:42.640 --> 30:46.080
a parking space, where do I go?

30:46.080 --> 30:48.480
Up to the next level, okay?

30:48.480 --> 30:53.600
And then I drive around, and if I can't find a space there, where do I go?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.840
The next level, and I keep doing that.

30:55.840 --> 31:00.220
This is how shells are filled in atomic structure.

31:00.220 --> 31:07.280
When the first shell gets filled, then electrons start going out to the second shell, and then

31:07.280 --> 31:09.440
the next shell, and then the next shell.

31:09.440 --> 31:18.120
So our most complex atoms in existence have electrons in shells that are way out there,

31:18.120 --> 31:21.680
because they have the highest number of electrons.

31:21.680 --> 31:27.600
And the higher the number of electrons, the higher the number of protons, because remember

31:27.600 --> 31:31.120
they have to be equal.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.200
Make sense?

31:34.200 --> 31:43.200
Now, the shell that most, should most concern you is this valence shell.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.600
This is the outermost shell.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.620
If it's a complex atom, it may be way out there.

31:48.620 --> 31:53.520
If it's a simple atom, it's going to be real close to the nucleus.

31:53.520 --> 31:59.800
And I'll talk to you in a minute why that's, it's important for two different reasons.

31:59.800 --> 32:07.760
The number of electrons contained in the valence shell also refers to the term valence.

32:07.760 --> 32:17.760
Now, this is the scheme that they came up with in naming the shells.

32:17.760 --> 32:24.320
If we have a simple atom, let's say we've got an atom that contains one electron.

32:24.320 --> 32:28.560
That one electron is going to be parked in the lowest level.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.840
And we're not going to call it the lowest level, no, that'd be too easy.

32:31.840 --> 32:35.880
We're not going to, we're not going to park it in what's called the first shell, because

32:35.880 --> 32:38.440
that would be too easy.

32:38.440 --> 32:42.560
You're here to attend college, okay, to get educated.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.800
So we've got to not call this the first shell or the A shell.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.960
We're going to call this innermost shell the K shell.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.960
Why?

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
I don't know.

32:52.960 --> 32:58.040
It helps us educated people justify our existence.

32:58.040 --> 33:02.680
After the K shell comes the, this, this is the part that actually makes sense to me.

33:02.680 --> 33:09.880
After K comes L, M, N, O, P, Q, so I did okay with the alphabet, so it kind of makes sense.

33:09.880 --> 33:17.280
So what this means is the Q shell, the most complex element that we have found in the

33:17.280 --> 33:23.040
universe contains electrons in the Q shell.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.520
Does that make sense?

33:25.520 --> 33:33.080
If it's a simpler element, an element with a lower atomic number, that means it's going

33:33.080 --> 33:36.720
to have electrons maybe only in some of these shells.

33:36.720 --> 33:41.320
But we have to fill a sequence first, fill this K shell before we bump an electron up

33:41.320 --> 33:42.320
into the L shell.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.160
When L gets filled, and some of you that have maybe taken chemistry and some physics classes

33:46.160 --> 33:49.800
know there's a certain number, I don't want you to memorize that.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.080
That's not going to help you become an electronics professional.

33:52.080 --> 33:57.000
And just remember there is a limit of how many electrons you could park in a shell before

33:57.000 --> 34:06.440
the electrons have to go into the outer shell.

34:06.440 --> 34:09.520
Now why am I talking to you about all of this stuff?

34:09.520 --> 34:15.960
Again, this was a question that plagued me for about three years since I was educated,

34:15.960 --> 34:18.600
like why were they teaching me about all the subatomic stuff?

34:18.600 --> 34:21.080
I'm not going to be some mad scientist, you know?

34:21.080 --> 34:23.000
Why do I need to know about the periodic table?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.280
Why do I need to know about subatomic structure?

34:25.280 --> 34:30.280
You know, I want to learn how to use a multimeter to take voltage readings.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.920
I want to know how to use an oscilloscope to take readings.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.920
Why do I have to understand subatomic shrubber?

34:34.920 --> 34:39.960
Two reasons you need to understand subatomic structure.

34:39.960 --> 34:47.280
Number one is so you could identify the properties of materials that we use in electronics.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.680
That's first and foremost.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.960
Secondly, you need to understand where voltage comes from.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.160
And we're going to talk about that in a minute.

34:56.160 --> 35:01.680
First let's talk about some of these materials and their properties.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.680
Conductors.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.000
How many of you are familiar with conductors?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.160
Conductors.

35:06.160 --> 35:11.680
That's the guy that runs the train, right, that's the conductor.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.280
Actually saw that the other night.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.280
What's that?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.280
Movie?

35:15.280 --> 35:16.280
Unstoppable?

35:16.280 --> 35:17.280
How many of you have seen the movie Unstoppable?

35:17.280 --> 35:18.280
Train?

35:18.280 --> 35:19.280
It was actually a pretty good movie.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.280
You haven't seen that one?

35:20.280 --> 35:21.280
Yeah, it was good.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.280
Wasn't it?

35:22.280 --> 35:23.280
Train?

35:23.280 --> 35:24.280
Running out of control?

35:24.280 --> 35:25.280
Based on true stories.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.480
It was based on a true story, you know.

35:27.480 --> 35:31.480
Let's set the throttle and jump off the train and switch the track and jump back on it.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.680
It just didn't work out very well.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.400
Anyway, that's not even what we're talking about.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.400
Conductors.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.400
We're not talking about train conductors.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.880
We're talking about conductors, electrical conductors.

35:42.880 --> 35:50.560
Materials that readily accept the flow of electrons or electricity, if you will.

35:50.560 --> 35:58.800
Categorically, the textbook says they're materials that contain a large number of free electrons.

35:58.800 --> 36:02.480
However, I want you to think of it in a different way.

36:02.480 --> 36:12.560
When I speak of conductors, I am speaking of materials that have three or fewer electrons

36:12.560 --> 36:17.760
in the valence shell.

36:17.760 --> 36:25.600
And by the way, in this class, in this program, the only shell that you will ever work with

36:25.600 --> 36:29.960
for safety reasons is the valence shell.

36:29.960 --> 36:36.160
If you plan to experiment beyond the valence shell, again, let me know, and I'll probably

36:36.160 --> 36:39.000
stay home that day, okay?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.240
So it's only the valence shell.

36:41.240 --> 36:46.840
So if you've got an element that has three or fewer electrons in the valence shell, it's

36:46.840 --> 36:49.800
going to potentially be a good conductor.

36:49.800 --> 37:01.160
Now, in order of precedence, the material that has the best conductivity or conductance

37:01.160 --> 37:04.160
is that of silver.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.560
Silver, believe it or not, that's the best, found in nature.

37:06.560 --> 37:11.160
Out of all the elements, silver is the best.

37:11.160 --> 37:22.320
Gold by copper, gold, aluminum, tungsten, iron, nichrome, okay?

37:22.320 --> 37:23.400
Silver is the best.

37:23.400 --> 37:31.880
If silver is the best, why when you buy a stereo, why when you buy audio-video equipment, do

37:31.880 --> 37:36.880
they try to sell you gold-plated patch cords?

37:36.880 --> 37:37.880
Okay?

37:37.880 --> 37:40.080
We've got one response, they're money, yeah?

37:40.120 --> 37:42.080
They could get more money out of you.

37:42.080 --> 37:48.080
It's corrosion, it's, silver has a higher corrosive potential than gold.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.080
Absolutely.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.080
Absolutely.

37:50.080 --> 37:58.800
And copper is a little bit more corrosive than gold, but not as much as silver.

37:58.800 --> 38:07.880
So basically, gold is the least likely to oxidize and corrode.

38:07.880 --> 38:15.320
So when we get copper wire and plate it with gold, we get a good conductor, because gold

38:15.320 --> 38:18.400
is still a good conductor, but it won't oxidize.

38:18.400 --> 38:25.480
If you're scuba diving in the Caribbean and you find a treasure chest full of gold that's

38:25.480 --> 38:31.040
been sunken, hundreds of years underwater, and you dig it out of the sand and you open

38:31.040 --> 38:36.320
it up underwater, salt water, hundreds of years, you open it up, you would know that

38:36.320 --> 38:44.080
you found gold, because it would look as good as the day that that treasure chest fell off

38:44.080 --> 38:47.720
the pirate ship.

38:47.720 --> 38:56.520
If you found a treasure chest under the ocean in the Caribbean and it was filled with silver

38:56.520 --> 39:00.480
and you pried it open, you'd be like, oh, what happened in there?

39:00.480 --> 39:01.480
Because it's all oxidized.

39:01.480 --> 39:05.320
Of course, there's still good silver in there, but the exterior would be oxidized.

39:05.320 --> 39:10.820
So that is why we use gold-plated connectors.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.080
Don't oxidize.

39:12.080 --> 39:17.560
We live in an oxygen-rich environment, so if I could have gold-plated connector to connector

39:17.560 --> 39:21.080
and I could mate the two, I'm going to get the best possible electrical connection that

39:21.080 --> 39:22.080
I can.

39:22.080 --> 39:25.440
Now, do you really need to go out and buy those gold-plated audio-video connectors?

39:25.440 --> 39:27.640
It's actually kind of funny, because I've seen a lot of people go out and spend good

39:27.640 --> 39:33.520
money on those, and then they plug it into the back of a dusty amplifier.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.240
It would have been better for you to go out and get some technical-grade alcohol, clean

39:37.240 --> 39:42.680
the male-female connectors, connect them, and you'd get a better electrical connection.

39:42.680 --> 39:50.520
Now, in a perfect world, a totally clean gold to totally clean gold, clean, nice, no dust,

39:50.520 --> 39:53.160
is going to give you a superior connection.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.960
We actually learned a lot of this was developed in the space program, because think about

39:56.960 --> 40:02.400
it, to basically send people to the moon and have them get back and have those electronic

40:02.400 --> 40:05.360
circuit boards needed to be highly reliable.

40:05.360 --> 40:08.600
This is where NASA started playing around with everything is interconnected.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.080
You can't permanently wire everything up.

40:11.080 --> 40:15.840
You have to have boards and sockets, and everything is interconnected like that.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.520
NASA did a lot of research, and I said, hey, we played the stuff with gold.

40:19.520 --> 40:26.880
We'll be golden, you know, and literally that started that whole trend in electronics.

40:26.880 --> 40:31.720
A lot of the circuit boards and stuff that you buy, your computer motherboard, your video

40:31.720 --> 40:36.080
card have gold plating on it, so they make that connection, and it's a highly reliable

40:36.080 --> 40:41.600
connection.

40:41.600 --> 40:45.800
Big thing I want you to remember, though, three or fewer electrons in a valence shell.

40:45.800 --> 40:49.120
Insulators are materials that prevent the flow of electricity.

40:49.120 --> 40:56.320
The textbook says they're stabilized by absorbing valence electrons.

40:56.320 --> 41:07.120
The material found on planet Earth that has the highest insulative quality in nature is

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
mica.

41:08.120 --> 41:10.880
Any of you know what mica is?

41:10.880 --> 41:12.440
It's found in rock formations.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.860
It's very fragile.

41:13.860 --> 41:16.560
It's a good thermal insulator, and it's a good electrical insulator.

41:16.560 --> 41:23.400
A lot of times it's found in quartz formations, and it's almost like paper, like you can kind

41:23.400 --> 41:24.400
of peel.

41:24.400 --> 41:28.800
There's one layer and another layer and another layer, but it's highly fragile.

41:28.800 --> 41:33.080
That for thickness is the best insulator that we have found in nature.

41:33.080 --> 41:37.560
That's why it's at the top of the list.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.000
That's what we compare everything to.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.240
Glass is high, but not as high as mica, followed by Teflon paper, wax paper, which is used

41:47.240 --> 41:50.280
in the manufacturing of some of the electronic components.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.200
Rubber, bake light.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.200
I know what bake light is.

41:54.200 --> 42:00.400
Bake light is like the handle on your toaster oven, and when you drop it, it chips it, and

42:00.400 --> 42:02.200
you can't glue it back together.

42:02.200 --> 42:06.120
It's not only a good electrical insulator, it's a good thermal insulator.

42:06.120 --> 42:10.120
It's that black stuff that, again, you chip on your pots and pans, and you can't fix.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.160
Isn't that the original form of plastic?

42:12.160 --> 42:13.160
They started now?

42:13.160 --> 42:14.160
Yes.

42:14.160 --> 42:19.720
It is one of the original forms of plastic, if you will, that they used as a composite,

42:19.720 --> 42:21.720
if you will.

42:21.720 --> 42:22.720
Oils.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.360
A lot of oils are used.

42:25.360 --> 42:32.160
They used to use a lot of oils that had a lot of poison in them for electrical transformers,

42:32.160 --> 42:35.400
but we kind of got out of that because oil is an insulator.

42:35.400 --> 42:39.720
It's nice because oil will draw heat away from circuits.

42:39.720 --> 42:46.640
If you had a circuit submerged in oil, if any, what do you call them, computer heads

42:46.640 --> 42:52.040
here, PC files, you know.

42:52.040 --> 42:57.200
One of the big problems we know with PCs are heat, the generation of heat in the processing.

42:57.200 --> 43:02.120
So one of the big things is if you could super cool a computer, you'd get more performance

43:02.120 --> 43:03.280
out of that computer.

43:03.280 --> 43:07.760
So if we got the computer, don't try it again with my computers, but if we got it and submerged

43:07.760 --> 43:11.960
it into a vat of oil, and then we cooled the oil and recirculated it, we could draw more

43:11.960 --> 43:16.120
heat away from the circuit, and then we could start bumping up the speed of the computer

43:16.120 --> 43:20.120
and in the industry, overdrive the chip.

43:20.120 --> 43:24.160
Ask more of the chip than what it's rated for.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.040
Yeah.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.440
Porcelain.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.440
And of course, air.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.080
Air is an insulator, isn't it?

43:31.080 --> 43:37.040
If you've driven under power lines, what's between the power lines?

43:37.040 --> 43:38.040
Air.

43:38.440 --> 43:42.240
I don't know if you've ever driven under or walked.

43:42.240 --> 43:49.000
Do some walking, hiking under the BPA power lines down south, and on a day that's damp,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.560
you could actually hear the zzzz, it's like, wow.

43:52.560 --> 43:56.120
Air is the insulator, and I guess it ain't working too good right now.

43:56.120 --> 44:01.520
Hope it doesn't arc to me.

44:01.520 --> 44:07.000
There's also a category of materials that are called semi-conductors.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.640
conductors are materials that could be altered to function as either a conductor

44:11.640 --> 44:18.480
or an insulator. Let me go back, I left out one thing here. Insulators are

44:18.480 --> 44:28.000
materials that have five or more electrons in the valence shell. Five or

44:28.000 --> 44:37.680
more electrons in the valence shell. So conductors were three or fewer, insulators

44:37.680 --> 44:45.400
five or more. Anybody want to take a wild guess what a semi-conductor might be?

44:45.400 --> 44:48.800
One that could be altered to function as either a conductor or an insulator. If you

44:48.800 --> 44:55.480
want to take a wild guess. Four, you all could have been scientists back in the

44:55.480 --> 44:59.440
1940s. Because that's basically what they came to the conclusion. We know the

44:59.440 --> 45:03.000
properties of conductors. We know the properties of insulators. What happens if

45:03.000 --> 45:05.600
we start playing around with something that has four electrons in the valence

45:05.600 --> 45:10.320
shell? We could get it maybe to swing both ways depending on how we want it to

45:10.320 --> 45:15.960
behave at that moment in time. And as you know, semi-conductors are the

45:15.960 --> 45:22.920
fundamental building block of diodes and transistors. Transistors are the

45:22.920 --> 45:28.000
fundamental building block of computer microprocessors. It's all a

45:28.000 --> 45:33.920
microprocessor is. Now, in essence, billions of transistors on something the

45:33.920 --> 45:40.680
size of a postage stamp. Made of materials that have four electrons in the

45:40.680 --> 45:44.680
valence shell. Those materials that you're going to study later on in the

45:44.680 --> 45:48.600
program, not real important now for you to know, but I think you'll recognize one

45:48.600 --> 45:55.040
of the names. Germanium? That's not geraniums, that's what grows in the

45:55.040 --> 46:02.320
gardens. Germanium, it's an element. Carbon, that's an element. And the most

46:02.320 --> 46:08.680
prevalent? Silicon. Silicon Valley. You've all heard of Silicon Valley? Have any of

46:08.680 --> 46:12.360
you know where Silicon Valley is? Have you ever been there? Vast mountains of

46:12.360 --> 46:18.160
silicon everywhere. Now, it's fabrication facilities, labs, okay? You're talking

46:18.200 --> 46:26.240
about the bay area. Make sense? And what they did is they harnessed the power of

46:26.240 --> 46:30.040
semi-conductors and made transformers, or transistors, excuse me, not

46:30.040 --> 46:35.440
transformers. It's another, it's another line. Trust me, we'll enjoy that lecture

46:35.440 --> 46:41.760
when we get to it. The other big thing I want to address with you is negative ion,

46:42.640 --> 46:51.000
positive ion. Because in essence, this is where voltage comes from. This is where

46:51.000 --> 46:59.160
voltage comes from. If I get this calculator here on the desktop, it's

46:59.160 --> 47:02.320
just been sitting on the desktop all day. It's just your average every day

47:02.880 --> 47:08.840
calculator. I assume that since it was sitting on the, on the desktop, minding

47:08.840 --> 47:16.160
its own business, it's electrically in a neutral, natural state. Because this

47:16.160 --> 47:25.080
calculator is made up of matter, which is made up of elements. Sitting here,

47:25.960 --> 47:35.560
neutral, natural state. So if I get this now, and I start rubbing it, I start

47:35.600 --> 47:38.800
rubbing it. What effect do you think that's going to have on the calculator?

47:38.800 --> 47:47.400
I'm cleaning it. No, it's a different class. That program's down the hall. Go

47:47.400 --> 47:58.280
out the double doors. Static electricity causes friction. The friction does what?

47:59.200 --> 48:02.200
Creates charge. How? And why?

48:03.640 --> 48:08.400
Through the resistance of the fabric going across the plaster.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.880
Close. Somehow. Close, kind of.

48:11.320 --> 48:23.400
The difference of the electrical potential, and that you're rubbing that

48:23.400 --> 48:31.640
cloth on the class calculator, which creates charge on there. And then when you

48:31.640 --> 48:35.320
touch it, you're less charged than the cloth.

48:35.320 --> 48:39.640
Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. In essence, by me rubbing this and

48:39.640 --> 48:45.320
applying friction, which is a form of energy, when I apply energy to matter, and

48:45.320 --> 48:50.840
I rub this, there's a pretty good chance that I am going to knock some subatomic

48:50.920 --> 48:54.440
particles. Which ones? Electrons, off of what shell?

48:55.720 --> 48:59.880
Valence shell. If I rub this so hard that smoke starts coming out of it and it bursts

48:59.880 --> 49:04.760
into flames, chances are I've gone in too far. But if I just rub the valence shells

49:04.760 --> 49:12.360
and I knock some of those electrons from this onto this, now we've got a disparity.

49:12.920 --> 49:18.200
Now no longer. If I've removed electrons from something that was neutral, natural,

49:18.200 --> 49:23.560
and I've taken electrons from it, what is the predominant positive? Why?

49:29.720 --> 49:36.520
Exactly. Now I'm left with more protons on this than I have electrons. It wasn't a

49:36.520 --> 49:42.440
neutral natural state, so I started rubbing it. So that's exactly what I've done.

49:42.440 --> 49:49.640
So I just made this a positive ion. I just made this a positive ion by removing electrons from it.

49:50.520 --> 49:54.520
If this was also in a neutral natural state until I started monkeying with it,

49:54.520 --> 50:00.280
now I rubbed electrons from the calculator onto the cloth. What does this mean for the cloth?

50:03.640 --> 50:11.480
It's now negatively charged. Why is that? Because it contains more electrons than it had

50:11.480 --> 50:18.760
when it was in its neutral natural state. Now you know what? When I do this, when I do this,

50:18.760 --> 50:22.920
both of these items, I don't want to make it sound like they have consciousness or whatever,

50:22.920 --> 50:28.360
but their whole freaking goal in life now is to get back into a neutral natural state.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.040
They cannot wait until I put them together and the electrons could jump off the cloth

50:34.040 --> 50:42.200
back onto the calculator and they could be at rest in a neutral natural state in a perfect world.

50:43.480 --> 50:49.560
Does that make sense? What I just shared with you is how we generate electricity.

50:50.520 --> 50:56.600
That's how we generate electricity. In order for us to generate electricity, we must apply

50:56.600 --> 51:04.520
energy to matter. When we apply enough energy to matter, we could knock electrons off

51:04.520 --> 51:12.280
the valence shell, gather them, and then say, hey, what? You want to get back to the positive?

51:12.280 --> 51:19.000
Have I got a deal for you? Come, travel through my circuit, make this light bulb,

51:19.000 --> 51:24.840
illuminate, and I'll give you a complete path back to your neutral natural state.

51:25.640 --> 51:31.560
That's what we end up doing as a career, making sure electrons that were harnessed

51:32.360 --> 51:36.840
are ready, able, and willing to do work for us, and then we make sure that they follow the correct

51:36.840 --> 51:42.040
path and do something for us. We just don't let them complete the path. If you're just letting

51:42.040 --> 51:46.440
them complete the path, that's called a short circuit. Okay? That's not a good thing. We'll

51:46.440 --> 51:50.680
talk more about that in future chapters. We just want to make sure that the electrons follow the

51:50.680 --> 51:55.800
path and complete that path. Makes sense? Very critical. Talked about two big things already,

51:55.800 --> 52:02.840
the properties of materials we use in electronics, and also the property of how we create voltage or

52:02.840 --> 52:06.440
electricity. There's one other thing here the book does not go into. There's a

52:07.960 --> 52:11.960
we have conductors, we have insulators, we have semiconductors. There's a fourth property that's

52:11.960 --> 52:16.040
floating around out there in science right now. Does anybody know what property I'm talking about?

52:16.280 --> 52:23.080
Superconductor. Superconductor. Very good. Very good. A superconductor, all of these, whether

52:23.080 --> 52:27.000
you're a conductor, whether you're an insulator, whether you're a semiconductor, you have one

52:27.000 --> 52:31.480
property associated with you. Everything has that property associated with it. It's a property of

52:31.480 --> 52:37.320
resistance. We're going to talk about it in a bit. There is a material that exists. It's called a

52:37.320 --> 52:42.280
superconductor. It has no resistance. The problem is, does anybody know where it exists?

52:47.000 --> 52:53.320
It is at low temperatures, so therefore where it's going to exist is in a laboratory. They don't

52:53.320 --> 52:57.480
have it operating at room temperature. I can't bring you next door and give you a tour of my

52:57.480 --> 53:02.840
superconductor that I have set up over on a bench over here. I could if I had a cryogenics plant,

53:03.800 --> 53:10.680
and I was a research facility and playing around with it. But when they harness superconductivity,

53:10.680 --> 53:15.640
it's really going to rewrite the textbooks on how we manage electricity and electronics.

53:15.640 --> 53:21.160
You think Bill Gates got a lot of money? The dude that captures and harnesses superconductivity

53:21.160 --> 53:25.720
at room temperature, it's going to be very, very wealthy. Very, very wealthy.

53:27.480 --> 53:33.160
Make sense? By the way, does anybody know what material they're having the best luck with

53:33.160 --> 53:40.840
as it pertains to superconductivity? What's that? Graphene, they're doing some stuff with that.

53:41.800 --> 53:49.400
That's not the best results yet. Believe it or not, it is ceramic. Ceramic at room temperature

53:49.400 --> 53:53.240
is an insulator. It's a great insulator. We use it as an electrical insulator,

53:53.240 --> 53:57.160
but when they bring these ceramics to really, really cold extreme temperatures,

53:57.160 --> 54:02.840
they take on conductive properties, and they conduct with no resistance. Pretty cool.

54:03.560 --> 54:12.280
Ionization, that's the process I described. It's the process of gaining and losing electron,

54:12.280 --> 54:14.360
and it's significant in current flow.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.200
Okay, without ionization, you wouldn't have voltage. Without voltage, you would not have

54:20.200 --> 54:26.840
current flow. Current, again, we should ring bells.

54:27.800 --> 54:36.280
Current is the movement of electrons from negatively charged atoms to positively charged

54:36.280 --> 54:43.880
atoms. The letter that we use to abbreviate current with is the capital letter i, capital letter i.

54:45.800 --> 54:49.640
One of the terms we need to familiarize ourselves with when dealing with these

54:49.640 --> 54:55.480
electrical properties is the term coulomb. We'll talk more about the coulomb next chapter,

54:55.480 --> 55:05.400
but what a coulomb is is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. This is a big, huge number.

55:05.960 --> 55:16.840
This is basically 6.24 and 16 zeros after that four. It's too big to fit in your calculator.

55:16.840 --> 55:23.640
That's why we refer to it in this as an engineering notation. We'll talk more about

55:23.640 --> 55:28.360
engineering notation again in future chapters, because we get you used to dealing with these

55:28.360 --> 55:34.600
extreme numbers. In electronics, we deal with a lot of extreme numbers, and we represent it

55:34.600 --> 55:45.400
with the capital letter c. Now, in ampere, named after André-Marie Ampere, French physicist,

55:46.040 --> 55:55.080
one coulomb, that big number of electrons, 6.24 with 16 zeros after it, that number of electrons

55:55.080 --> 56:01.480
moving past a single point in one second is called the ampere. Have you all familiar with the term

56:01.480 --> 56:07.160
ampere before? If you've ever burnt out a fuse, you make sure you get the fuse that's the proper

56:07.160 --> 56:11.800
ampere rating. If you pop your circuit breaker, you need to make sure when you're resetting it

56:11.800 --> 56:17.800
that you're not overloading the circuit and exceeding the amperage rating of the circuit.

56:19.560 --> 56:24.440
And what that is is physically a given number of electrons that you're forcing through a conductor

56:24.440 --> 56:33.160
in one second's time. One coulomb per second is one ampere. 15 coulombs per second is 15 amperes.

56:33.160 --> 56:38.200
We'll talk again more next chapter on that. Currents measure in ampere is that it's represented

56:38.200 --> 56:42.120
by the capital letter a. So if you go out to your fuse box in your car and pull a fuse out,

56:42.120 --> 56:50.280
it says 15a next to it, that stands for 15 amps. Universally accepted. Universally accepted.

56:52.360 --> 56:56.760
Potential, the ability of a source to perform electrical work. What we're talking about here

56:56.760 --> 57:04.440
with potential is voltage. Difference in potential causes electrons to move or flow in a circuit.

57:04.440 --> 57:12.200
This is referred to as EMF or Electromotive Force or Voltage. EMF, Electromotive Force,

57:12.200 --> 57:14.680
Voltage, Difference in Potential, they're all synonymous.

57:20.440 --> 57:27.000
Voltage, ring bells, chimes, hit the gong, is the force that moves electrons in the circuit.

57:27.240 --> 57:33.800
It's the pressure or pump that moves electrons, represented by the capital letter e or the

57:33.800 --> 57:41.160
capital letter v. Whether you use e or v, here the textbook uses e, you could use v if you want,

57:42.120 --> 57:47.240
as long as you know what we're talking about. It's universally accepted. The unit of measure is called

57:47.560 --> 57:59.080
the Volt. Resistance, the opposition to the flow of electrons, the degree of resistance depends on

57:59.080 --> 58:07.240
size, shape, and temperature, and it's measured in ohms. Named after George Simon Ohm, represented

58:07.240 --> 58:12.920
by the Greek letter omega. One of the things I want you to familiarize yourself with is,

58:12.920 --> 58:21.480
you know what has resistance? Everything, everything except superconductors. And superconductors

58:21.480 --> 58:25.800
only exist in the laboratory right now. Hopefully when you buy an extension cord,

58:25.800 --> 58:33.400
that extension cord has a low amount of resistance. Okay? Hopefully when you buy new spark plug wires

58:33.400 --> 58:38.920
for your car and they're insulated, hopefully the outside of the spark plug wires has a high

58:38.920 --> 58:50.120
amount of resistance. Make sense? Conductors have low resistance to current flow. That's why

58:50.120 --> 58:57.320
they're called conductors. They have many free electrons to transfer the energy. Insulators

58:57.320 --> 59:06.120
have high resistance to current flow, very few electrons. In summary, tonight we talked about

59:06.120 --> 59:12.440
matter. We talked about elements, the fundamental building block in nature. We talked about atomic

59:12.440 --> 59:19.720
structure, specifically subatomic particles and a place, right? Nucleus is not a particle, it's a

59:19.720 --> 59:25.320
place, which that place contains the protons, the neutrons, and the electrons. Protons are

59:25.320 --> 59:32.040
positively charged, neutrons are neutrally charged, and electrons, well those are the other ones,

59:32.040 --> 59:38.360
they're negatively charged. We talked about atomic number, number of protons in an atom. Atomic

59:38.360 --> 59:42.920
weight, number of protons, and number of neutrons in an atom. We talked about shell. These are the

59:42.920 --> 59:47.560
orbital arrangements of the electrons, starting with the K shell, going all the way up to the Q

59:47.560 --> 59:52.920
shell. We talked about ionization, the process of taking things out of a neutral natural state.

59:54.520 --> 01:00:01.320
We talked about current. Current is the flow of electrons from negative to positive. Why?

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.800
Because it wants to get back into a neutral natural state. We talked about the coulomb,

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.400
6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. It's a number of electrons, like a dozen eggs,

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.640
a bushel of apples, a gallon of gasoline.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:24.760
We talked about the ampere. The ampere is one coulomb per second. We talked about electronic

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.040
or electric current that is measured in the ampere. And then finally we talked about potential or

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.040
electromotive force. What we're talking about there is difference in potential or voltage.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.280
Does anybody have any questions on anything that I covered in a lecture for chapter one?

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.920
Going once. Going twice.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.960
What's that?

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.640
Yes, these slides are on the website. The audio recording is on the website,

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.880
and eventually we're going to get the video uploaded as well.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.040
But the content will remain the same.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:14.520
New Google site. Any other questions? Going once, going twice, going, going.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.120
The new Google site. The last one that's listed there, the HTTPS sites, google.com,

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.080
LWTC electronics. I've got that turned on. Anybody with the address should be able to get in there.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.600
We haven't uploaded this material to it yet, but it should be there.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:49.320
So I'm like messed up. Is that what you're saying? All right. I messed up. Cool. Cool.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.800
That's why you got the job as TA. You're here to keep me honest. Any other questions? Once, twice?

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.960
I honestly don't know. I mean, it's pretty far down. It is a conductor, of course.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.800
It's real close on a periodic table. It's amazingly close to silver.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:24.440
And that's why actually in solder, we used to contain lead, but because lead is lead,

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.320
and it's bad, they realized it was really, really bad. So we pulled it out of solder,

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:35.960
but it was used to join in complete electrical circuits. So it's pretty high.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.600
I don't know its actual conductivity value, but it's pretty high.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.560
And once, going twice, going, going. Go on. We're black.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:53.560
The next questions that I have for ELEC 110, Chapter 1, you'll be answering for me on a quiz.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.200
But don't worry. Well, you'll have another week or so before we take the quiz. I'll coordinate

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.120
with the class lead on that. Any other questions about protocol? Anything else we're doing here?

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.880
All right. I'm going to go ahead and cut you loose. We don't

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.280
know. Okay. Last week, wrapping up lecture, we're talking about electrical insulators.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.600
We're talking about conductors, things of this nature, right? I dug out of my archives here.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:31.160
Remember, I talked to you about mica? mica? I found my stash, my private stash of mica.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.880
Please be very careful passing this around. It actually kind of flakes off, so you can

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.640
just handle it, look at it. This is found in nature. It's found in rock formations.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:51.880
And this is the best insulator found in nature. This is a washer, an insulator washer that's

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.000
been made out of mica. Okay, so we'll pass these things around so you can see. But these are very

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.400
fragile. Don't try to bend it. You'll break it. It's almost like a real thin piece of glass,

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:11.320
if you will. So this is mica in the raw, and this is a processed piece that could be used as an

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:20.440
electrical insulator. So cool stuff. So anybody have any questions on anything else before we get

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:43.880
started here? Chapter number two. Okay, just to get us kind of ramped up from where we left off

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:51.320
last week. Really started our discussions last week talking about the fundamental properties

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:58.920
of electricity. And that discussion really started off with a discussion about matter.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:08.040
Matter is everything. If there is no matter, the absence of matter is called space. We could

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:17.320
recreate the absence of matter here on planet Earth by using an industrial vacuum chamber.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:23.160
That's where we pump all the gases out of the chamber, and we're left with nothing inside.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:31.400
Industrial vacuum is used a lot in industry, in the manufacturing process, so that they could

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.720
remove everything from it and only introduce those materials that they want to be inside the

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:45.880
chamber. Remember that discussion? The next thing we talked about, which is very, very critical,

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:53.160
are the properties, the fundamental physics properties, if you will, of materials that are

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:58.760
used in electrical and electronics applications. The most popular that we talked about is the

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:05.960
conductor. The conductor is a material that has three or fewer valence electrons, electrons in

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:11.880
the valence shell. That means basically we talked about it like a parking garage. There's room for

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.840
electrons to park in this valence shell, therefore it's going to make it a good conductor. Materials

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.480
that have five or more electrons in the valence shell are good insulators, like that piece of

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.080
mica that we're passing around right now. If you looked at that, you'd see, again, more than five

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:32.520
electrons in the valence shell. That means if you're a free electron, you're not going to have any

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:40.360
place to park on that piece of mica. We also talked about semiconductor materials. Those are materials

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:46.040
that have four electrons in the valence shell, and for those of you that continue on in this program,

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.160
ELEC 120, that's right where we're going to pick up the discussion, back to fundamental properties

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.560
of physics as it pertains to materials. If any of you were in the classroom the other night last

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:03.480
week, I gave that lecture to ELEC 120, and we were talking about these fundamental properties,

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:10.040
subatomic structure, because that discussion was all about solid state materials, silicon,

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.720
germanium that we use in the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:24.120
The other big thing we talked about is, in essence, the beginning, the creation of electricity.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:33.160
When we have matter and we impart energy on matter, we could knock an electron off

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.640
that valence shell. When we knock an electron off that valence shell, we end up with what's known as

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:50.360
a positive ion, a positive ion, because remember in nature, matter is typically in a neutral state.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.920
That means it has an equal number of protons and an equal number of electrons. Remember that?

01:07:54.920 --> 01:08:03.960
That's how we end up with the atomic weight. Atomic weight or atomic number? Which one is it?

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:12.440
A is weight, B is number on the quiz. C is both. D is none of the above. Which one's it going to be?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:24.360
The number of protons is number. So that number, whatever number of protons we have,

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.080
we also have the same number of electrons. That's what puts it in a neutral natural state.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:34.280
So when I impart energy on matter and I knock an electron off, now I have more protons that have

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:40.040
a positive charge than I have electrons in the atom that makes it a positive ion. In essence,

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:47.640
what I just did is created electricity. That's what electricity is. Electricity is also playing

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.840
energy to matter, knocking an electron off, gathering those electrons and then saying,

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.560
hey electrons, have I got a deal for you? You want to get back to your parent atom

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.960
and get it into a neutral natural state? Come this way. Go through this circuit. Do a little bit

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:11.800
of work for me and then I'll give you a path back to neutrality. And the electrons, they do this.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:17.480
So part of your careers in the electronics industry is going to be simply managing

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.000
the behavior of electrons, making sure the electrons do what they're supposed to do.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:31.480
I guess that's why they call this electronics, electronics, the study of the behavior of the

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:38.040
electron. So this is all about. The other thing we talked about last week briefly was the coulomb,

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:45.240
a unit of measure. A coulomb is like a gallon of gas, a dozen eggs, a bushel of apples.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:53.880
A coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. It's a big, huge, herken number of electrons.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.600
There was a guy by the name of Charles de Coulomb. He was counting electrons for a living and then he

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.960
died. And then he said, hey, anybody here want to continue on Chuck's work? Anyone? Anyone? All

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.280
right, we'll just call it even. We'll call the number that he came up with, 6.24 times 10 to

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:16.280
the 18th. We'll call that a coulomb. One coulomb per second is the ampere that was that was put

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.440
together by a guy by the name of Charles. Charles ampere? No, André ampere. Another Frenchman

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:31.720
or beret. André Marie ampere. And you know what? Universally that's accepted. See, the amazing

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.720
thing, I enjoy travel, travel all around the world. People speak different languages. We use

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:42.520
different coins, different monetary values. When it comes to current worldwide, the ampere

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:50.280
is the accepted value that we use, no matter where you go. So those of you that are learning

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:57.000
or if you have English as a second language and you struggle with this, we're all learning

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.720
a new language. It's the language of electronics. And the word we're going to study tonight

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:09.800
is current. Current. And you already know kind of a little bit about current based on our lecture

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.600
last week. Well, we're going to pull back to curtains and study a little bit more tonight.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:20.360
After completing this chapter, you're going to be able to state two laws of electrostatic charges.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.640
I'm going to give you a heads up. Anytime you see the word law, you should like sit up straight

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.040
and take note. Because if it's a law, the type of laws we're talking about here are not laws that

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.480
we could go to Olympia and have repealed. They're not talking about laws that we could go to the

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.920
Supreme Court and have overturned. That actually would be kind of fun, wouldn't it? Go to Washington,

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.240
D.C. Students from Lake Washington Technical College in Kirkland, Washington protested today

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:52.440
outside the Capitol to have the laws of physics repealed. We can't. These are laws of physics.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:59.800
Okay? So these electrostatic charge laws are kind of critical. We're going to be able to define

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:07.480
coulomb. Identify the unit used to measure current flow. Define the relationship of amps,

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:16.680
coulombs, and time through formula. Describe how current flows in a circuit. Describe how electrons

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:25.800
travel in a conductor. Define and use scientific notation. And identify commonly used prefixes

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:32.520
for powers of ten. Some of you may be familiar with this law. You've probably heard it before.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.720
The first law of electrostatic charges are like charges repel each other.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:47.080
Have all of you heard that one before? Okay? The other thing that you're probably familiar

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:53.880
with is like opposites attract. Right? Opposites attract. That's not only in relationships. That's

01:12:53.880 --> 01:13:00.280
actually the laws of electrostatic charges. Opposites attract is actually the second law

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:07.000
of electrostatic charges. So if I got a negative and a negative, they're going to oppose each other.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.840
If I have a positive and a positive, they're going to oppose each other. If I got a negative and a

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.640
positive, pow, they're going to be attracted to each other.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.280
Yep, very similar. That's not electrostatic. That's magnetism. It's a different property,

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.240
but the same thing. North's going to be attracted to south. You've got two north poles. They're not

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.080
going to be attracted. They're actually going to push back on each other. Two south poles, the same

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.760
thing. So we're actually going to study that in future chapters. But this is the law of electrostatic,

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:46.440
electromagnetic. So just keep those two separate. Coulomb. Coulomb is the unit adopted for measuring

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:54.200
charges. In last week in lecture, I gave you the number 6.24 x 10 to the 18th. I figure I'd

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.800
wait a week before I actually showed you what that number looks like. I mean, it's one thing for me

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.400
to say up on the board at 6.24, then 16 zeros after. But this is really what the number looks like.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:12.680
Okay? It's really what the number looks like. One of the reasons that we need to use this form of

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:21.160
notation is that this number right here will not fit in your calculator. It won't fit in your

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:27.000
calculator unless you enter it in this form. And I'll show you. By the end of lecture, I'll show

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.800
you how to make sure you know how to enter it in that form. It's kind of funny because if you had

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.440
your neighbor down the street or whatever and you found out that they were going to college

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.960
in an accounting program, right? If they're going to go to school to become an accountant,

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:49.400
you'd probably say, wow, that person must be really good with numbers. Okay? Tell you what,

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.920
if you're Bill Gates accountant, you're not dealing with a number like this. Okay? But yeah,

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:59.160
regularly on a daily basis in the study of electronics, we're going to be dealing with

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:08.200
numbers like this. So if you're struggling with this form of notation, we'll work with you.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:13.720
But don't be like me. When I was in school initially like this, I looked at this number and I looked

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.760
at this stuff and, ah, man, I don't know, that's too complex. It's like, you know, 6.24 times 10

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.480
to the 18th. That's a number like Mr. Spock would use or something on a Starship Enterprise. And

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.600
I'm a more down-to-earth guy, so I'm going to keep it basic, you know? And in very short order,

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.120
I realized you can't keep it basic in electronics because we're going to be dealing with these

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:40.280
extreme numbers. So we have to use this form of notation. So you see how we came up with this 10,

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:49.640
6.24 times 10 to the 18th? The decimal point here means there's 18 places past it. So if we

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:56.760
went ahead and actually counted here, all right, that's like us moving the decimal place from here

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:06.360
all the way up to here. So if we went ahead and count, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:22.280
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So 6 decimal point 2, 4 times 10 to the 18th. That means there's

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.480
18 places past the decimal point. In this particular case, since I have

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:38.440
0.24, that means there's going to be 16 zeros after it, right? 16, 17, 18. 16 zeros after that. Does

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:46.360
that make sense? Everybody see how I did that? All right. There's our first law of electrostatic

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:51.240
charges, negative and a negative, positive and a positive, negative and a positive, uh-huh,

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:58.520
uh-huh. Because remember, in the beginning, everything was in a neutral, natural state anyway,

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:05.560
right? So originally, everything was like harmonious, balanced. When we apply energy to matter, we

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.840
knock an electron off that valence shell, and all is that valence shell, that electron that we

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.720
knocked off has in mind is getting back and putting that atom in a neutral, natural state.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:25.080
So if you put an electron in the same room with a positive ion, they're going to seek

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.640
each other out. They want to achieve balance and harmony. Makes sense?

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:41.480
Current. Current. And every time I use this word here, we should like ring bells, chimes,

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:47.000
hit a gong, something like that. Because this is like a holy word in electronics. There's four

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.520
properties that you really need to be infatuated with. And when I say infatuated with, I'm not

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.800
talking about just as a student, I'm talking about later on when you continue on with your career.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.360
The worst day you have in this industry is a paid electronics professional. The problem will be

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.800
solved by understanding and knowing the behavior of voltage, current, resistance and power, period.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:14.520
Do I sound like I'm oversimplifying it? I'm not. It gets that basic. If they've got an

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.520
electrical problem with the space shuttle and they can't, you know, they can't hit the button and

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.320
have it blast off, it's because voltage, current, resistance or power isn't doing what it's supposed

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.400
to be doing. So if you know everything about those four parameters on the space shuttle,

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.640
you could get in and look at those four parameters and quickly find where the problem is.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.320
So today we're talking about current. We should ring bells, hit chimes, hit a gong,

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:43.080
or something because current is one of the big four properties. Now the textbook talks about

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:49.800
current as being the drift of electrons from an area of negative charge to an area of positive

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.320
charge. I don't like this definition, the drift of electrons. It makes it look like

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.640
I'm an electron and I'm drifting, I'm floating. Okay?

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:10.680
An electron is more like if I'm negative charge and there's like positive ions out in the freaking

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:21.240
hall, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be trying to get over there. Why? Because I want to fill

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:27.960
those holes. I want to fill the void that was created when energy was imparted on matter. Does

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.520
that make sense? So that's really the behavior of current. As a matter of fact, there's a kind of

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:39.080
mad dash. I bet you didn't think I had it in me, huh? It gets better than that. You know how quickly

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.240
electrons are going to go over there if you can complete the path at the speed of light,

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.200
at the speed of light. If we allow electrons to complete the path,

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.720
it's going to travel at the speed of light. So I don't call that the drift

01:19:53.960 --> 01:20:04.360
of electrons, negative to positive. Now, Andre Marie Ampere came up with this term that he called

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:10.120
the Ampere, named it after himself. These dudes didn't have egos. You kidding? They didn't have egos.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:17.800
Andre Marie Ampere invented a unit of measure called the Smith. Now, the Ampere. The Ampere is

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:23.960
the amount of current in a conductor when one coulomb of charge moves past the point in one

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:30.920
second. This is kind of emotional. This is your first real formula. It's your first real formula.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:37.880
The relationship between Ampere's and coulombs per second can be as expressed as i, which is current,

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:53.480
is equal to q charge measured in coulombs divided by t time measured in seconds. So what we're saying

01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:05.400
here is one amp or ampere is equal to one coulomb per second. Now, be careful with this, because I

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:11.720
could ask you a question about number of electrons. Is number of electrons coulombs? Number of electrons

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:20.600
is number of electrons. Coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. So this formula only works

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:30.360
if you're using coulombs. What happens if I have half a coulomb per second? It's not a trick question.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:38.040
If I have half a coulomb per second, what's my current going to be? Half an amp. If I have

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:45.000
quarter a coulomb per second, what's it going to be? Quarter of an amp. If I have two coulombs per

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.840
second, this is a trick question. No, just kidding. Two coulombs per second. That means I'm going to have

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:59.400
two amps. So typically for household current in your home, we talked about this last week,

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.040
what was that number? What's your typical utility connection from the power company to your home?

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:15.640
That's the voltage. What's the typical box? Typically about 200 amps is a typical residential

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.560
connection. You know, you buy a home, you're going to see that it's typically 200 amp connection

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:26.120
from the power pole or if you have underground service to your box, that big gray box that's in

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:32.840
your house, 200 amps. From that box, the circuits in your home get distributed to circuits that are

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:41.240
typically either 15 amps or in some cases 20 amps. And for some of your appliances,

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.120
they'll be a little bit higher in some cases. If you have an electric hot water heater or

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.640
things like that, I've got a hot tub. It requires more than 15 amps, more than 20 amps. I've got a

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:59.000
high current connection going to that. So if you've got 15 amp outlet in your home, that means

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:09.080
that outlet is capable of handling how many coulombs per second? 15. 15. I could also ask you,

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:14.680
how many electrons per second can I handle? Then you'd have to get 6.24 times 10 to 18

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:19.720
times 15, and that's how many electrons it would be, physically, that that's capable

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:27.320
of supporting. That's why it's so critical that all of these components, when they're manufactured

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.560
and they're given their specifications, that you don't exceed those specifications. Because if you

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.560
try fitting more electrons through than it's physically capable of handling, you're going to

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:42.280
start an electrical fire. Okay, so everything has ratings associated with the current ratings,

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.720
and this is why, physically, it can't handle any more electrons. If you try pumping, you know,

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:54.120
if you've got a garden hose and connected it to a fire engine, okay, and turn the pumps on high,

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.960
what do you think's going to happen to that garden hose? It's probably going to blow up,

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.480
it's probably going to explode, right? It can't handle that volume. That's why firemen have like

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.920
big hoses, okay? Because they have a higher volume of water that they try to put, you know,

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:15.160
from the truck onto the fire. That's why they're firefighters, fire people.

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.800
Make sense? The other thing I want to share with you about formulas, okay?

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.960
If there's shortcuts that I could teach you and you could remember, I'm all about that.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.320
This is college, so whenever I give you a formula, I'm just going to give it as formula and assume

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.840
that all of you are like college students that have paid your dues and are here for the right

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:42.840
reasons. So I'm not going to show you every possible variation of the formula. I'm going to

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.240
expect you to know how to do it on your own. But I don't expect you to know how to do it on your

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.280
own because all of you don't have a comprehensive algebra background yet. So I'm going to show

01:24:52.280 --> 01:25:01.880
you a couple shortcuts here, a way to cheat. What I want you to do is start off with drawing a triangle.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.680
I'm going to draw a simple triangle.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.920
Then inside the triangle, I want you to draw a t.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:25.560
The one formula that you know, I want you to plug into this triangle. So i, in this particular

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:37.720
case, i is equal to q over t. Does everybody see how I did that? i is equal to q divided by t.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:48.840
So that's the first formula that I gave you. i is equal to q over t. Now on a quiz or an exam,

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:52.280
or simply when you're hanging out together working with each other in the lab,

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:57.080
what happens if I gave you coulombs and I gave you current?

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:07.960
Then what we could do is simply cover up the letter t and say t is equal to q over

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:19.640
i. So I did that. So t is equal to q over i. That's the other algebraic manipulation of this.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:28.520
If I asked you on a quiz if I said if I gave you current and I gave you time and I want you to

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:37.160
figure out how many coulombs, what the value of coulombs would be, then we simply cover up the q

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:46.440
and then it's going to be i times t. See the i is next to the t, so it's going to be i times t.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:55.800
So that's going to be our other variation. q is equal to i times t. So with that one formula

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:02.600
that I gave you, there's three basic algebraic manipulations that we could have, and this is

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:08.600
all of them. So do you have to memorize these? No. Remember, do the triangle, put the t in the

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:14.520
center, and then lay that one formula out, and then now you have all the algebraic variations

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.800
of that formula. And you know what? You need to know how to do this, because I could ask you.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.680
I'll be honest with you. Everything right now is fair game. I could ask you to solve for current.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.360
You should be able to do it. I could ask you to solve for time. You should be able to do it.

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.000
I should ask you to be able to solve for coulombs, and you should be able to do it.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:41.320
I should be able to give you a number of electrons, right? You have 30 gazillion electrons.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.600
How many coulombs is that? That gives you this value. Then you could figure out the rest. Does

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.800
that make sense? So it's a stepping stone. But don't get hung up on what you don't know.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.000
Focus always on what you do know. And the one thing to remember is one amp is one coulomb per

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:03.080
second. i is equal to q over t. And then if you lay that out, it gives you all the other variations.

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:12.440
Does that make sense? Hold. An all-female progressive rock band from Seattle, Washington.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:30.840
Hold. That's a joke. Is hold even still around? No? No? No. When did they disband? Where did they go?

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.600
She's doing her own thing. Dad, it's where I understand she's doing her own thing.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.960
It's a reference. What Beavis and Butthead do America, right? There's a reference to whole. Not

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.760
this whole, but the other whole. Remember, they were... No, seriously. They were going...

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.920
Remember Beavis and Butthead do America? They're looking for their TV, or the TV

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.000
broke, and they stole one, and whatever they're doing. But they were going to go to Washington,

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:03.400
like DC. But when they heard about Washington, they were like, Washington, that's cool. That's

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:09.800
like where Seattle is. We could go see whole. Anyway, that's required viewing for all of you.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.440
Beavis and Butthead do America. That's going to help you understand. Anyway, no, I'm not talking

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:21.400
about a different type of whole. Whole that I'm talking about here is the absence of an electron.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:30.120
If I have an atom, and I apply energy to matter, and I knock that electron loose,

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:38.680
what do I leave behind? A whole. So a whole is nothing more than the absence of an electron.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:47.480
The reason I want to point this out to you is that here at Lake Washington Technical College,

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:53.720
every other technical and community college in Washington State, in the country, the U.S.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:59.640
military, all branches of the U.S. military, technical schools, a lot of universities all

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:08.200
embrace what we embrace, and that is electron flow. We call one amp 6.24 times 10 to the 18th

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.440
electrons traveling per second. That's what we call one amp, right?

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:24.040
Engineers, scientists embrace what's called whole flow. They think that the holes are flowing

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.880
to get filled by the electrons. I don't want any of you to lose sleep over this.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:35.320
Whether 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons travel in that direction per second, that's an amp,

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:40.840
or at 6.24 times 10 to the 18th holes that travel in that direction per second, that's going to be

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:46.760
an amp. But whole is the absence of the electron. And the reason I'm pointing this out to you is

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.400
I know all of you this weekend, as soon as you get a little bit of time off, you're probably

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:53.240
going to go to the library and pick up some electronic books, start reading. I don't want

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:58.840
you to call me a liar, and I want you to open up that book and say, hold on. This book shows

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:03.320
that current flows positive to negative. That Joe Greenock over there at that Lake Wash,

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:08.120
he doesn't know what he's talking about. He said that current flows negative to positive.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:14.200
Current does flow negative to positive. Electron flow. Current also flows positive to negative.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:21.240
Whole flow. Are any of you going to go home and lose sleep over this? Be honest with me.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.840
Let me know, because I did. Honestly, when I was in school, I got the same lecture I'm giving you

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:30.680
right now, and I'm like, oh no, I didn't raise my hand, but then I went home and I'm like scratching

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.920
head. What the heck was he talking about? You know, and I like months for months, I freaking

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:41.560
tried to add, it's not that difficult of a concept. You just got to hit the I believe button. Joe says

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:49.320
6.24 times 78T electrons per second equals one amp, so be it. We do want to talk about

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:54.360
whole briefly so you can differentiate between electron flow and whole flow, and also to prepare

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.880
you for what you are about to receive in the future. Because again, if you sat in on my lecture

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:06.920
last week on ELEC 120, guess what? We started talking about whole flow again, because whole

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:13.720
flow is significant in the study of semiconductor devices, solid state devices. If you want to

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:21.160
understand how a transistor really works, you have to embrace whole flow. So we are going to

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:26.440
talk about it more here at Lake Washington, but you don't need to beat yourself to death on it.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:33.240
Question? Well, you got to realize that the whole itself, though, is the absence.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:40.680
But if you're talking about matter that exists, and it's the absence of the electron,

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:44.440
that we're really talking about a positive ion, and a positive ion does have mass,

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:48.200
because you got all your protons, you got all your neutrons, and of course that's how we determine

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:58.360
atomic weight. Very good answer. A, the atomic weight number of protons and neutrons. So whole

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:02.840
is the movement of an electron from one atom to the next, creating the appearance of a positive

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:10.360
charge moving in the opposite direction. So that's what we call whole flow. If you had a piece of

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:18.200
copper, which we know copper is a good abundant conductor, this is kind of how the electron path,

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:25.800
how it would work. Negative to positive, kind of copper atom, it would jump over here to copper

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:33.240
atom, jump over here to copper atom. Make sense? Drifting along at the speed of light.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:41.480
This here we see, again, a conductor. We've got electron flow left to right,

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:48.840
current flow left to right, whole flow right to left. Make sense?

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:56.040
Okay. I want to show you something, how this really works, because the way they're making this

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:01.880
look, and I think you guys are all buying this, right? Because, again, you kind of got to believe

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:10.760
me, right? But this is kind of like the free electron is kind of like hopping from copper atom

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.400
to copper atom, because there's three or fewer electrons in a valence shell, right? It's kind of

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:20.440
hopping along, hopping along just another copper atom, you know? You ever jump across a stream,

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:26.680
right? It's kind of what they make it look like here, right? Everybody at this table here, can you

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:32.440
just back up here? Nobody has a coffee or anything on here, okay? Can you put your hand on the end

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.320
of the table just like this, okay? Okay, let me know how quickly you feel this.

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:47.080
That is how current flows through a conductor. That's how current flows through a conductor.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:54.280
The speed of light, instantaneous, instantaneous. If I've got a negative here and I've got a positive

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:59.880
there, pow, instantly that is going to be felt on the other side. That's how current flows through

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:07.880
a conductor. So it's not this. Got to have your tongue out when you're doing it too, right?

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.840
It doesn't work like that. It's instantaneous. The speed of light, which is important,

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:21.320
186,000 miles per second. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:26.680
Or for those of you on the metric system, 300 million meters per second.

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:35.560
300 million meters per second. Or for those of you that keep track of all things nautical,

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:41.400
161,000 nautical miles per second. And I got a couple of chuckles out there. It's kind of,

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:46.920
well, Joe's ex-Navy, he would probably know that. No, I'll tell you what. If you know those three

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.760
numbers, 186,000 miles per second, 300 million meters per second, 161,000 nautical miles per

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.320
second. If you know those three numbers, you could probably get about eight or nine questions

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:07.400
right on your FCC license exam. Because it's how RF energy transmits as well. If you're working on a

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.680
radar, you want to get your radar endorsement to be able to work on a radar, the only radar in the

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:20.600
world that I am familiar with that operates in statute miles is the radar that's operated by

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:27.880
the police. If you're on a Washington state ferry and they're looking at a radar, that radar is

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:34.680
calibrated for nautical miles. So all the math that takes place internal is 161,000 nautical miles

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:40.120
per second. If you go to work for the Federal Aviation Administration and you work at Seattle

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.480
Traycon that keeps track of all the aircraft arriving to Seattle and departing Seattle,

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:52.680
the radar that they're looking at is calibrated in nautical miles. And the aircraft also travel

01:36:52.680 --> 01:37:03.720
speed-wise in knots. In knots, which is nautical miles calibration standard. So that's why those

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:08.520
numbers are very important. That's how fast current travels, that's how fast radio frequency

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.560
energy travels at the speed of light or close to the speed of light. There's actually some

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:19.080
atmospheric anomalies that kind of slow it up a little bit, but generally speaking it's a speed

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:24.040
of light, which is also important to realize. That's why it's so great you got me as an instructor

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.600
because you could learn from all of my goofy mistakes. Back when I was in the Navy, the only

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:34.440
way that I could get a raise, the only way that I could increase rank was obviously not getting in

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:42.120
trouble for a period of time, which is actually another funny story. I'll show that one with you

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:48.200
in a second. I forgot all about it. But anyway, the other thing is by taking professional examinations

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.000
twice a year. And I remember one of the exams, you would have thought I would have been ramped

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.040
up with this stuff. I got to this whole section of the exam once when I was trying to go up and rank

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.480
and they started talking about the behavior of antennas in outer space.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:11.000
And I was like, I'm a submarine guy. I have no freaking clue how this antenna is going to behave

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.280
in outer space. What the heck are they talking about? The Navy's got like people in outer space

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.120
and I just got myself into a tailspin and I just I couldn't even answer anything

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.840
instead of looking at the obvious. How do antennas behave in outer space?

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:30.600
Perfectly. Theoretically, perfectly. That's what they were looking at. So I got all those

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.760
questions wrong because I could just, they're talking about going to freaking outer space.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:42.280
I'm not going outer space. I'm going to live beneath the sea. So more on that, on keeping

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.360
out of trouble. Can't make this stuff up. I was looking at a copy of my medical record.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.360
I have a copy of my military medical record at home and I was looking through it and I came upon

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.560
on a page. I got into a slight altercation and actually the medical record

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:05.480
reveals 25 year old Caucasian reported to sick call reports being worked over by two bouncers

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:13.160
and then it goes into how I slept well and I woke up somewhat sore and basically I reported

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:18.200
the sick call and it was I had a crushed my cheekbone got broken and one eye was pointing one way

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.800
and the other eye was pointing the other way and finally they said yeah you got to go get that

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:27.640
looked at but right in there print reports being worked over by two bouncers called my son over

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:32.280
I said check this out it's kind of cool I should have that frame put that in my office my medical

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:44.280
record you know but anyway I was a good sailor. Voltage source and again we should almost ring

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.920
bells chimes hit gongs when we're talking about voltage source and I hope you don't think that

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:54.680
I'm over exaggerating this these first few chapters are what we're talking about are the

01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:02.920
fundamentals you have to understand this stuff a hundred percent now you need at least a 70

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:08.840
percent to pass this class if I were truly the pope of electronics I'd say no you don't move on to

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:13.640
the next module the next chapter until you prove a hundred percent because this is how critical

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:19.800
this information is voltage source what we're talking about here is a power supply

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:30.040
it supplies electrons from one end of the conductor and it removes electrons from the

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.880
other end of the conductor it can be thought of for those of you that like using analogies

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:41.960
fluid systems it could be like a pump what does a pump do it sucks from one end it pushes out from

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:50.200
the other end right this is what a voltage source does it basically supplies electrons from one end

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:57.960
and then sucks them back from the other end that has to be taking place or it's not a valid voltage

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:06.120
source so a battery is a voltage source we're going to talk more about batteries of future

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.640
chapters right provides electrons on the negative end of the battery and it collects those electrons

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:17.800
of the positive end of the battery that's what makes it a battery it's what makes it a voltage

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:25.400
source and we need a viable voltage source in order for us to have a viable circuit

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:34.840
well finally we're going to talk about scientific notation but we're not actually what i want to

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.880
talk to all of you about tonight is what's known as engineering notation

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.960
anybody here really comfortable using scientific notation if you're really comfortable using

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:53.240
scientific notation i guess you keep using it but i would encourage you instead to use

01:41:53.800 --> 01:42:01.240
engineering notation the difference is scientific notation can be times 10

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:08.760
to the first power second third fourth fifth sixth seventh they can be anything you follow what i'm

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:16.920
saying can you dig it engineering notation is always going to be in groups of three

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:24.280
it's always going to be in groups of three which lends itself very well to what we're doing here

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:33.720
in electronics let me show you

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.240
let's start off with a decimal point

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:49.720
oops that is there's the decimal point okay so if i put something to the left of the decimal

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:57.400
point this is going to be my base 10 this is going to be my ones column so this number here

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:05.640
could be anywhere from zero to nine if i get nine and i add one to it nine plus one equals

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:14.360
10 so i've got to go to my tens column so this is my tens column this is my ones column can you

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:21.880
dig it this is the part that i did well in school too the number line okay if i get up to the

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:31.800
number 99 and i add one to 99 now i go i increment to the hundreds column okay so we're familiar

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:39.000
ones tens hundreds cool okay so those are going to be my basic units of measure this could be

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:51.320
pounds ounces volts amps miles whatever now if i go here to my thousands column one thousand column

01:43:51.880 --> 01:44:03.400
basically what i'm doing now is this is times 10 to the third times 10 to the third everything

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:09.800
in here will be times 10 to the third this could be one times 10 to the third 22 times 10 to the

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:17.800
third 943 times 10 to the third makes sense the reason that i'm so infatuated with having you

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:29.160
put it in engineering notation is by 10 to the third we're going to call this value here in the

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:40.920
metric system what what's thousands in in metric kilo very good kilo so what we're going to do is

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:51.880
we're going to call this small letter k kilo so instead of saying 1000 i'll say 1k instead of

01:44:51.880 --> 01:45:05.400
saying 943 thousand i'll say 943 kilo kilo pounds kilo ounces kilo miles kilo volts kilo ohms make

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:26.280
sense kilo miles there's a new one for you well metrics it's in metrics but if you put it into

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:32.920
engineering groups of three then it's going to fit directly into those prefixes those metric prefixes

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:43.160
so three more places past the decimal point one two three this is times 10 to the sixth we're going

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:56.040
to call this mega mega in an actuality it's like millions right one million ten millions hundred

01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:13.960
millions mega 10 to the ninth what's that giga very good capital letter g giga

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.880
when i first got into this industry i'm dating myself i don't know why i say that make myself

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:27.240
feel old this is as far like as we had gone in the electronics industry general electronics

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:35.640
giga wow and i'll be honest with you where i used to work in electronic intelligence

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:42.040
the only people that could that could afford to play up here in giga values were superpowers

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:47.320
it was either us or the soviets and we knew what we had so if i detected something that was in

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:57.720
giga hertz it had to be the soviets okay now giga commonplace after school today you could

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.240
probably stop at fred meyer pick up a laptop computer that's got a you know 80 gigabyte drive in it

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:09.960
for 49 that's actually too much money 49 bucks you could get a

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.240
times 10 to the 12th terra

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.520
terra also happens to be a barista down in federal way that's kind of got it going on if you know

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:36.520
what i mean i don't i don't even know what i mean i don't even know what that is terra

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.120
when i first started teaching here 20 years ago at like washington technical college

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:53.960
i can't even remember i think i might have had like an 80 meg hard drive or something

01:47:53.960 --> 01:48:01.160
i remember getting super jazzed by getting the sunday seattle times and i saw an ad in the paper

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:08.680
that i could get like a 250 megabyte hard drive for less than a dollar per megabyte and i'm like

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.440
you gotta be kidding me i could get less than you know less than a dollar per megabyte of storage

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.920
i'm gonna go on and get one of those you know so i went on and paid my 250 bucks or whatever

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:25.400
now you're getting a terabyte hard drive for 49 dollars now they have two terabyte hard drives

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:32.280
they could get for 99 dollars so this is have i made my point about the numbers we're going to work

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:40.280
with in high tech industry i mean the numbers are extreme they're extreme so again if you use

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.320
engineering notation and put it into groups of three and most of you and your calculators have

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:50.440
a mode that you could put it into engineering motet notation so ultimately the the answer is

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.160
going to be given given to you in either times 10 to the third 10 to the sixth 10 to the ninth 10 to

01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:01.640
the 12th if you don't know how to do that you might want to look at your owner's manual if you're

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:07.480
ready through your owner's manual away do a google search on your on on your model it'll come up with

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:13.640
a pdf of it okay you want to make sure you know how to access those modes in your calculator

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.680
because again we're going to be using some extreme numbers but you know what i'm not done

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:25.960
i've yet to begin we're about halfway done we're also going to be dealing with numbers that are

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:33.960
smaller than one so when i go back one two three places

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:41.880
anybody know what we call these times 10 to the negative third three places to the right of the

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:47.400
decimal plates milley and actually if any of you come from a machining background or whatever

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.280
like thousandths of an inch this would be a tenth of an inch right this would be hundredths of an

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:58.200
inch this would be thousandths of an inch and use the term mill right how thick is that plastic

01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:09.240
three mil three milley okay so we're going to call this small letter m for milley m i l l i milley

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.880
three more places past the decimal point gives me times 10 to the negative sixth anybody know what

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:24.760
we call this micro very good micro micro is kind of kind of weird too it's a greek symbol

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:33.160
kind of looks like this it's kind of like a backwards u it's actually the greek symbol called

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:48.360
mu mu dirty jobs dirty jobs really he does that micro micro micro for our friends at home yeah

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:54.840
micro he actually participated in a fundraiser here in the fall of like washington technical

01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:59.480
college via satellite actually the producer from that show dirty jobs is here and they

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:05.640
as a fundraiser for a college foundation but micro was live via satellite speaking directly

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:10.760
with all those that went to breakfast here at lake washington technical college i slept in that morning

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.800
i was hoping hoping they were going to tivo the event so i could watch it at my leisure but nobody

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:25.480
t-voted three more places past the decimal point times 10 to the negative ninth

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:33.640
yep nano very good small letter m small letter m nano

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:44.520
any of you have heard about nano technology this is kind of like where nano technology is playing

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:54.200
around with now three more places past the decimal point times 10 to the negative 12

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.280
pico small letter p pico

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.080
suffice to say i could go further there's a couple places past this but it's beyond the

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:06.760
scope of what we're talking about right now

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:16.360
but as students at lake washington technical college you on a regular basis are going to

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:23.800
be dealing with numbers times 10 than a negative 12 to times 10 to the positive 12 sometimes in

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:30.680
the same problem so like i said earlier even if you're bill gates accountant

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:36.840
even if you're the irs itself anybody here not filed their taxes yet

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:42.520
two of us three be honest four

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:49.960
it's actually funny i was with uh with friends on uh on saturday we stopped at starbucks for a cup

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:55.240
of coffee and my friend saw this woman that she thought she recognized that she knew and you can't

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.880
make this stuff up um you know it's like she's like you know you look like a good friend of mine

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.560
blah blah blah and you know do you work do you work for quests no i don't work for quests well

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:09.960
you know you know i work for the irs really excuse me ma'am but you look lovely today

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:16.040
can i buy you a pastry to go with that cup of coffee and you don't want to take those people off

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
too finely brought down al capone wasn't it right the irs

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.400
anyway we're going to be dealing with numbers like this so we have to make sure we get it right

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:34.600
so in most of your calculators you'll have a key ee a key ee and you could enter that whatever

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:43.400
you do do not enter it as as it appears here on the uh don't go three hit the times key 10

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:49.400
to the third power you're actually going to end up a decimal place off with that you have to enter

01:53:49.400 --> 01:54:00.760
it the ee key exponential notation any questions on that all right um

01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:10.680
there's no harm in using your imagination when you're when you're dealing with an electoral system

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:19.320
in equating it to a fluid system because let's be brutally honest you can't see electricity

01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:26.680
coursing through wires you can't see it our five senses are very very limited so sometimes analogies

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:31.240
really really help us out so for those of you that understand fluid systems you know it all

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.640
rolls downhill and you know pressure and pumps and that kind of stuff you could use the same

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:40.200
analogies to figure out what's taking place inside an electoral circuit one of the things

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:46.920
that i do because i just love seattle is i'll use the treat that the seattle freeway system

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:55.640
to sometimes explain the behavior of current in a circuit i5 405 520 and we'll use those as

01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:03.160
analogies of how current behaves how traffic behaves on a friday before a three-day holiday weekend

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:12.120
and it's sunny out and raining in the convergence zone and we'll use those analogies to kind of

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.280
figure out what's taking place in a circuit so this here this analogy shows us the pump this

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:22.040
would act like our voltage source right it's sucking and then discharging right so this is our

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:26.040
source of electrons and this is where it's drawing the electron through for the pump

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:34.920
the current flows through the plumbing the electrons flow through the circuit the only

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.360
thing that i would have done differently if i drew this illustration i can't take credit for this

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.840
i simply pulled it out of the text is the load this would have been nice if they had like a

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:49.320
water wheel right here so as the water runs by it turns the wheel because that's what a load does

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.880
a load converts one form of energy to another form of energy an electrical load converts

01:55:53.880 --> 01:56:00.440
electric energy into light energy or electric energy into motion or or some other form does

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:08.200
that make sense so you can use this if you care to since this chapter is talking about current

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:14.120
typically in the study of electronics electronics not electrical but electronics

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:21.800
we're typically only going to be using values associated with milli times ten to the negative

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:28.440
third milli amps which don't be fooled milli amps could kill you there's enough even though it's

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:34.200
it's thousands of an amp it's still enough to kill you more than enough to kill you

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:42.360
and also we're going to be dealing with micro amps typically as a student here in the electronics

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:47.240
program like washington technical college for those of you that go into the electrical trades at all

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:53.720
you're going to be dealing with amps and lots of them we had a student that just got

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:59.240
hired by bondable power administration bpa he's going to be working substations i don't even

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.720
know how many amps you're dealing with out of substation what makes a substation a substation

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.840
lots of amps i would imagine okay i never had an interest of working with that many amps

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:14.280
since milli amps could kill you why would i want to work with more than more than enough to kill me

01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:22.760
in summary we talked about the laws of electrostatic charges the first law is that like charges

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.440
oppose each other the second law is unlike charges attract each other a coulomb is six

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:34.600
point two four times ten to the 18th electrons electric current is the flow not the drift the

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:42.520
flow of electrons in a specified direction measured in amps conceived by the dude by the name of

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:51.480
andre marie amp here and andre marie amp here stated that one amp is equal to one coulomb per

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:56.520
second that's the relationship between current electrical charge and time formula we talked

01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:02.040
about holes moving holes moving the opposite direction of electrons electrons travel negative

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.880
the positive holes travel positive to negative we talked about scientific notation negative

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:14.600
exponents specifically milli micro nano and pico and we talked about positive exponents

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:20.200
specifically kilo mega giga and terra and terra also happens to be a

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:32.680
in that's kind of got it outstanding if you know what i mean i don't even know what i mean

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:40.120
we're going to talk about milli prefix typical these are the values of current that we'll see

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:45.160
in electronic circuit and also micro times ten to the negative six these are also values

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:51.640
of current we'll typically see inside an electronic circuit make sense anybody have any

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:59.160
questions anything that we covered in chapter two chapter two all right let's go ahead take

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:03.160
about a 15 minute break and at 645 we'll go ahead and kick things off again

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:13.480
okay chapter three voltage chapter three voltage after completing this chapter you're going to be

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:21.480
able to identify the six most common voltage sources describe six different methods of producing

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:29.240
electricity define cell and a battery describe the difference between primary and secondary cells

01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:36.280
describe how cells and batteries are rated identify ways to connect cells or batteries to

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:45.960
increase current or voltage output or both define voltage rise and voltage drop and identify the

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:54.440
two types of grounds associated with electrical circuits this this kind of makes me laugh you

01:59:54.440 --> 02:00:02.920
know the big buzzword now is alternative energy right alternative energy and um

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:12.520
really worldwide we consume electricity that's the form that we've pretty much chosen electronics

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:18.520
electricity you know i don't think there's any places that are installing oil lamps

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:25.400
you know new hotel in the caribbean we light our place with oil lamps no we use electricity

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:35.960
and there are six methods of producing electricity period so when i hear about alternative energy i

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:41.960
kind of sit up i'm like well have they come up with a seventh method no as long as i have been

02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:49.160
in this industry there have been six methods there are only six methods if you come up with a seventh

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:57.800
now maybe you're on to something those six methods are friction magnetism chemicals light

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:05.320
heat and pressure period the first one we're going to talk about is friction

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.320
probably the most familiar is the vandagraph generator how many of you are here familiar with

02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:20.600
the vandagraph generator um let me try that again uh how many of you here are familiar with with

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:28.040
lightning storms that's probably the best example of friction producing electricity

02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:37.320
guy by the name of ben franklin figured that out by flying a kite in an electrical storm

02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:45.320
one of our brilliant forefathers it's amazing it didn't get uh electrocuted in the in the process

02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:53.320
so lightning is a form of friction caused by atmospheric friction if you will um

02:01:53.320 --> 02:02:00.120
and that produces lightning another example is electrostatic discharge when you walk across

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:05.800
a carpet or you move if you're wearing clothes just that movement you could generate static

02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:13.640
electricity tens of thousands of volts could be generated by seeing you simply wearing clothes

02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:21.240
okay the alternative is not wearing clothes you wouldn't generate static electricity by doing so but

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.800
of course the world would be a different place

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:31.800
the vandagraph generator some of you have maybe seen in a museum before i've got one in the back

02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:36.200
room it's out of commission right now but there's a big sphere on the top of it and then what it is

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:42.120
is a belt pulls electrons off the bottom brings it up to the top so the sphere becomes charged

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.920
and what we could do with that is if you were insulated and you put yourself at that electrical

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:51.400
potential you've maybe seen the pictures where people's hair standing straight out on end that

02:02:51.400 --> 02:03:01.400
effect could be created with a vandagraph generator friction not really the best best method of

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:08.440
producing electricity you know i'm not going to hire tens of thousands of people to walk around

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:16.360
on carpets and then you know touch a touch of you know of a conductor and power cities that way it

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:22.360
just doesn't make sense on the other hand if there was a method of somehow harnessing lightning

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:29.240
now that would be something that would be something i don't know how many of you are from the seattle

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:34.600
area northwest uh originally your whole life uh i don't know if you've ever had the opportunity

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:44.520
to travel like to the east coast the midwest monster storms tropics monster storms storms that even

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:53.160
jet airliners can't get above you know 60 000 foot thunderstorms um just amazing i remember a few

02:03:53.160 --> 02:04:01.480
years ago i was flying commercially down to the caribbean and um on the way back this monster

02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:06.200
storm outside and even the pilot was talking about it he's like you know in my 30 years of flying i

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.320
have never seen a storm this big and he just looked out and the whole thing was just glowing

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:17.960
constantly glowing it wasn't like lightning flash lightning flash was just constantly sitting there

02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:25.400
just like throbbing glowing was pretty frightening so if you could somehow harness that lightning

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.080
that would almost constitute a form of alternative energy

02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:40.600
magnetism is the most common method of producing electrical energy this is how we produce electricity

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:48.920
using something called a generator that generator could be powered by steam

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:57.960
that steam could be generated from nuclear power coal water wind gas diesel it doesn't

02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:04.040
matter how you rotate the shaft the goal is you got to rotate the shaft

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:12.040
it's actually very devastating the news from uh japan was watching the news this morning and i guess

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:17.880
they upgraded it to a level seven accident now which is on par with chernobyl actually the amount

02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:21.800
of radioactivity that that puts out could exceed chernobyl if they don't get it figured out

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.760
um it's really too bad i'm not necessarily i don't know if you want to call me a proponent of

02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:34.920
nuclear i mean i i worked on nuclear submarines for you know eight and a half years of my life

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:41.240
and uh it's pretty cool i mean it's hot because it generates steam you know what i'm saying it's

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:48.120
pretty pretty uh innovative technology because you know how often we i you know i commute and i got

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:53.560
a i got to go to the back gas pumps about twice a week with my car and my car birds premium

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:58.920
um height um high compression engine i got to burn premium in it you're talking about 50 bucks

02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:04.600
pop just fill up my car for me to commute you know how many times i saw my nuclear submarine refueled

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:13.720
just kept going and going and going and going and going so you get a lot of use out of nuclear

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:20.680
power commercial nuclear power plant um basically what they do is they refuel the reactor started up

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:29.960
run it at full throttle for 18 months 100 flat out for 18 months then they shut it down refuel

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:34.520
it most nuclear power plants have multiple reactors so when they're refueling one they got another one

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:38.520
that's up and running and then just back and forth or so in some cases three reactors

02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:46.280
so it was actually getting quite a bit of momentum in the green movement a lot of the the the folks in

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:50.760
the green movement were like no nukes no nukes and they realized that it's pretty clean energy

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:56.440
yeah you got to worry about the nuclear waste afterwards but it's really a devastating uh you

02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:04.040
know not only for the folks in japan um but also really for uh you know energy energy efficiency

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:11.320
and um non-dependency uh fossil fuel burning uh so hopefully they could get a handle on it

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:15.720
i mean nuclear power all forms of energy are inherently dangerous you know i mean

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:21.000
my my fuel tank splits open on my car and i drive home and i burst into flames that'll

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:26.120
kill me just as dead as radiation you know what i'm saying so it's a matter of mitigating those

02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:31.400
risks but i want you to keep that in mind this is why again alternative energy

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:38.680
you know i've been to holland before they got freaking windmills over windmills

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:44.360
they were harnessing wind energy you know now we wind turbines you know all you're doing is

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:51.080
rotating the shaft and you're turning a generator as opposed to grinding your grain with power from

02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:57.240
the wind so is it really alternative energy no it's just a different spin on it which is interesting

02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:02.760
because i've known this stuff since like puberty and i always in the back of my mind was thinking

02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:07.240
about like energy in different forms because i was always getting yelled up on my parents you know

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:11.400
shut the door shut off the lights what do you think you live in a barn you know this type of

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:16.920
stuff so i was yeah at a very young gauge i was thinking wow you know i what one of my duties as

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:24.760
a child was cutting the grass and uh he used to amaze me the small amount of gas i could i was

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:29.560
always hoping i'd run out of gas so like i don't have to i couldn't finish the lawn why i ran out

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:34.520
of gas you know the thing would never run out of gas there was this little tiny tank and that motor

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:37.320
would just keep you know the engine would keep going and going and going and going and going

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.640
there's a way of harnessing that motor to a generator and that could like i could leave the

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:47.640
lights on i could leave the doors open i'd get my parents off my back you know at a young age i

02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:51.720
was thinking about alternative energy and obviously i didn't understand all the formulas

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:57.560
associated with it so no you can't necessarily power a home with a small three and a half horsepower

02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:06.760
brakes and strutting engine but with a ten horsepower you could do it and if you've got a

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:14.120
backup generator that's a good enough size generator power home anyway that's how we harness

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:21.880
magnetism the generator could be configured to produce either direct current direct current is

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:29.080
the flow of electrons in only one direction negative the positive period negative the positive

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:34.840
or alternating current alternating in current is actually current that goes back and forth back

02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:41.320
and forth what we what comes out of the outlets here in the school and at your home is alternating

02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:46.680
current the electrons never really go anywhere but they're getting shaken back and forth back

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:52.520
and forth back and forth that's the harness that's the energy that we harness so we could have a

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:59.160
generator connected to a shaft that produces either dc or ac dc generators are not that prevalent

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:06.920
they're not that prevalent really ac is used predominantly throughout the industry because

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:11.000
of it's a higher level of efficiency in transmitting the power

02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:19.960
this is the schematic symbol for an ac generator so if you saw this on a schematic

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:25.400
you would say ah this means an ac power source ac generator

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:40.280
chemical chemical the most common is a cell chemical means is the second most popular method

02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:45.880
of producing electrical energy a chemical cell what we're talking about here is batteries

02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:55.480
the original chemical cell consisted of two metals copper and zinc these were the old

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.320
school batteries remember the kind that if you left them in your device too long they'd start to

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:07.480
like ooze and ruin your portable electronic device those were just standard carbon or um

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.040
yeah zinc cells copper zinc cells

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:23.320
typically many cells can be connected to form a battery when we use the term battery

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:30.040
we're actually talking about something that's made of multiple cells and part of why i'm telling

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:34.520
you this is that you're all here to learn a second language and that second language is electronics

02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:40.200
so if you were going to go to fred my where you're going i'm going to fred meyer to get me some

02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:47.080
batteries if you said that to me i'm going to assume that you're going to get batteries and

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:54.040
batteries are multiple cells that are put together where you're going i'm going to fred

02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:59.480
meyer to get me some batteries what do you need batteries for for this here flashlight

02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:05.080
that battery doesn't take that flashlight doesn't take batteries that flashlight takes

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:12.600
cells and cells are the typical size batteries that we've come to know and love triple a

02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:23.800
double a c am i personal favor the d size cell d size means it's bigger since it's bigger it means

02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:33.160
it's got more chemical in it more chemical means it's gonna last longer if you had a d

02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:37.480
size battery and you connected it to your remote control it looks stupid but it would last forever

02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:45.160
okay i put triple a batteries in my remote and like they last for like longer than my tv lasts

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:51.800
you know i just had a i just had some cells go out in a remote and i looked they were the original

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.600
cells of the remote i'm like man i've had this thing for freaking 14 years it's got the original

02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:04.840
goofy brand batteries that came with it you know so typically many cells can be connected to create

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:10.840
what's known as a battery now it's schematic diagrams when you see this symbol right here you

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:19.480
can assume that this is a cell the short line is the negative lead the long line is the positive

02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:29.080
lead on a schematic diagram if you put a short one a long one a short one and a long one together

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:35.320
we could make the assumption that this is a battery the other assumption that you could

02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:47.640
make on a schematic diagram is when you see this assume 1.5 volts because most cells triple a

02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:51.880
double a c and d all produce 1.5 volts dc

02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:58.360
so if we saw this what can we assume

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:10.760
1.5 plus 1.5 is 3 so normally on a schematic diagram sometimes they'll draw two of these

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:14.520
side by side sometimes they'll draw three but they won't draw any more than three

02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:24.760
so anytime you see two or more assume assume that it's either the value here or right next to this

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:33.160
i could write 12v and if i write 12v well it's a 12 volt battery pack and if you split that battery pack

02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:39.800
open you would find that it's actually made up of multiple cells that are wired together internal

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:45.560
to that battery pack make sense

02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.160
light

02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:57.400
light photovoltaic cell harnesses light

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:06.680
a single cell can produce a very small voltage so therefore many cells must be linked together

02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:13.240
to produce a usable voltage and current these are primarily used in satellites

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:18.760
because satellites would look stupid if they had like an extension cord connected to them

02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.160
you know you'd be like what the heck is that going up into the sky you know well it's an

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:29.160
extension cord for you know communication satellite so we can't do that

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:35.240
cost is high but it's declining

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:42.040
what i suspect is going to happen with this photovoltaic basically to make a solar panel

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:48.440
it uses the same technology that is used to make microchips so it's pretty costly process

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:53.000
what i suspect to see and you're not going to find us on any textbook

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.720
what i suspect you're going to see is a marriage between photovoltaic

02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:05.560
and nanotechnology and when those two merge together you're going to be able to go to

02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:11.880
Sherwin Williams and get paint for your house and they're going to say sir would you like the

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:21.160
photovoltaic additive today for 1995 sure go ahead and a lot of photovoltaic additive and the

02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:28.520
fact that your paint on your house is outside and it's in daylight part of the time it's going to

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:33.720
be producing voltage now we're not quite there yet but i suspect that that's where we're going to be

02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:38.520
they do have the technology now that there are companies that basically could spit out photovoltaic

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:46.760
film almost like Reynolds wrap so you could you know go out buy a roll of photovoltaic and roll

02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:51.720
it out and connect your your connections and you're producing electricity so the cost is coming

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:57.720
down on this stuff and think about it free voltage from the sun i mean how cool is that i mean it

02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:03.720
really is here in western washington well you know you probably have to pressure wash it twice

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:08.200
so you're to keep the moss from growing on your panels i got moss growing on my car i'm getting

02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:14.760
in the other day and i'm like what the heck is it moss growing on it but other areas of the country

02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:22.520
they're doing us they're doing us was in arizona uh flagstaff several years ago and i checked into

02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:31.320
the hotel late at night and um got up in the morning and opened my wind and opened my curtain

02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:37.000
the hotel room i was on an upper floor and i was shocked number one it snowed out the night before

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.760
and it was like six inches snow out there i'm like holy crap this arizona what's your snow doing out

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:45.080
there it's flagstaff it's you know you're in the mountains the other thing that shocked me is wow look

02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:51.880
at this across the street was a solar farm and it was all photovoltaic panels connected directly

02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:57.560
to the power grid and these panels would all track the sun and and you know basically supplying

02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:02.040
energy to the power grid so in some areas of the country uh they're already doing this

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:09.320
when i run out tonight by solar panels for your home probably not but again it's free energy free

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:18.440
voltage so keep your eye on this technology because uh i'd love to be an investor in the company that

02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:24.120
gets that photovoltaic nanotechnology harnessed you know just add a little pinch of it to your paint

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:31.480
or whatever and paint whatever he just turned it into a solar panel science fiction now guarantee

02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:34.840
you within the next few years we're going to be seeing that technology it's one of those solar

02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:40.360
panels work uh look like and the problem is uh this is on a metal backing but basically it's

02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:46.680
glass it's glass it's pretty fragile you know you want to have it permanently mounted um

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:57.640
still for out of space satellite it's the best option pointed towards the sun the sun comes out

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.960
every day actually if you're an outer space it never goes out because you know you're not rotating

02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:07.720
if you're a stationary satellite just looking at it unlimited electrical resources it was actually

02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:14.040
interesting i was at a conference i spoke at a conference a month ago that was like a month

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:20.600
ago today in milwaukee wisconsin it was at the green energy summit i wasn't invited guest speaker

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:27.480
and one of the other speakers was very uh it was very interesting he had one of our first

02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:33.160
satellites a mock-up of it and when they were developing the satellite it was this was in response

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:38.920
to the russians uh launching spotnik and it was the whole thing with the space race and basically

02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:43.960
you know he who gets the satellite in space first and goes to space first is going to rule

02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:49.000
dominate the earth you know so this is all stuff that was going down the 1950s they um

02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:55.800
in a push to get our satellite up there in response to the russian satellite um

02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:03.480
um basically what they had was a battery operated satellite launch it goes up beep beep beep beep

02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:09.880
and that's literally all this thing did it was a beacon just beeping in space and then as an after

02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:15.480
thought though the engineers were like let's put this on it this here is a photovoltaic cell

02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:20.920
let's put this on it so that when the battery dies it'll continue to beep and they're like

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.720
what are you doing it's a stupid this is stupid this is no this is no you know this is not viable

02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:31.720
technology solar panel photovoltaic cell this doesn't make any sense well they finally convinced

02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:37.000
them to put it on well guess what happened after the battery died photovoltaic kicked on and then

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.840
it kept going and going and going and going and I think finally it was like interfering with some

02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:47.560
other communication technology that developed they finally had to shut the thing off so that

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:52.840
was proof of concept that photovoltaics really work and of course it's become mainstream ever since

02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:00.280
this is a cool way now it's a hot way actually producing voltage

02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:07.560
we could use heat to produce voltage with what's called a thermo couple thermo couple

02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:13.800
these are two dissimilar wires twisted together when I say dissimilar I don't mean one blue wire

02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:20.040
and one red wire I'm talking about two dissimilar metals and they're not actually twisted together

02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:25.320
they're actually welded together so you get the two dissimilar metals

02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:31.800
and then you'll weld them together where they're welded together when you heat that joint

02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:39.560
because they're dissimilar metals it's going to produce a voltage voltage produced is directly

02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:46.600
proportional to the amount of heat applied these are going to be used in thermometers

02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:53.320
if you've had it seen a digital thermometer typically that's going to be a thermo couple

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:59.080
because what it does is you apply heat it produces a voltage the voltage gets converted

02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:04.360
to an equivalency of either Fahrenheit or centigrade and then you read it out real

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:11.320
simple way of doing it also called a pyrometer pyrometer had a student in this class several

02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:17.880
years ago whose father owned a company locally I forgot the name of the company but they basically

02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:24.600
produced thermal couple sensors and one of the big products that they were developing was

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:34.040
specifically for the racing industry and what it was is about the size of my laser pointer

02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:37.880
it was nice stainless steel and I had a little probe on the end and that was the thermal couple

02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:44.040
and what was so popular in the race industry if you I don't know how many of you aren't a racing

02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:50.920
or whatever you know you take like NASCAR for example and ideally what you want to do with

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:58.520
one of those race cars is set it up so that you distribute the weight evenly on every tire

02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:06.680
equally across the tire and if you could do that obviously you've got the most contact with the

02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:10.200
road it's going to give you the most handling on the track it's going to give you the best

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:14.680
performance generally speaking there are some exceptions to that on road course versus whatever

02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:18.520
but basically you want full contact with all your tires on the track make sense

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:25.960
also understanding with NASCAR rear wheel drive right you're going to have a lot more friction

02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:32.600
on your rear wheels so what happens is when that race car pulls in and they pull the tires off

02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:36.360
then they could sit there after the after they get the car out of the pits

02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:45.400
with their thermal couple probe and then measure across the tire outside inside or outside middle

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:51.720
inside for my left rear my right rear take the same readings my front tire take the same readings

02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:57.560
my other front tire same readings so you should see consistency between the two fronts across

02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:01.960
temperature wise too that means you've got the car set up so that the tires are in full contact

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:09.160
with the road so it's really a poor man's alignment tool so he gave me one of these

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:12.440
it's kind of cool because it's the OEM it's just stainless it doesn't have any

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:16.680
decal or sticker on it I mean they're the factory that built it and then sold in some racing

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:21.960
companies so they can put their name on it and or you know snap on and charge you know an arm and

02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:27.160
leg for the thing so he gave me one of these things so I actually did some experimentation

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.040
since I am a commuter I I did that a couple times in my drive home I want that I was wondering

02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:38.200
what the alignment on my car was so sure enough you know I drive home I pull off the exit hot

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:42.760
federal way pull over the side of the road get out my fluke meter with this thing plugged in

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:47.160
take temperature readings look for consistency I've basically been tweaking alignment my vehicles

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:54.360
using nothing more than that temperature gauge pretty cool pretty cool thermal couple

02:24:54.360 --> 02:25:02.120
simply applying heat to the device produces voltage that's simple apply heat it'll produce

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:07.480
voltage this is what the schematic symbol for one looks like

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:14.760
again understanding that these are going to be dissimilar metals two dissimilar metals

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.320
and then you weld this together the bead

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:24.040
so are they not actually

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.480
actually that because they're in contact with each other it will produce

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:45.320
where would you take the other tips yeah so simply by putting the the wires together they

02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:49.000
are going to be in contact with each other so you are going to get some reaction but

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.920
these thermal couple probes are actually welded the tips are welded

02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:01.160
believe it or not another method of producing voltage is simply by the use of pressure this

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:07.480
is called the piezoelectric effect piezoelectric effect voltage is going to be very small

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:12.440
so it must be amplified in order for it to be useful

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:21.720
but just a pressure change on a crystal will produce a voltage this is used for crystal

02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:29.880
microphones phonograph pickups right and precision oscillators as well as some sensors

02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:35.160
pressure sensors you could get some really inexpensive pressure sensors now that are

02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:39.560
calibrated for barometric pressure standard barometric pressure so as the earth's pressure

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.040
the atmospheric pressure changes on it the voltage will change you couple couple that

02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:50.040
with a weather station or couple that with actually you could use a fur altimeter if you're

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.520
sending a rocket up and you want to know how high your rocket goes you know what your base pressure

02:26:54.520 --> 02:27:01.480
is as you go up an altitude the pressure decreases so you can have an inexpensive little sensor that

02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:09.480
keeps track of your pressure also these are used in a lot of engine sensors now right you

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:14.680
could monitor all types of different pressures your oil pressure your pressure your cooling system

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:20.360
on board an aircraft your hydraulic pressure is all a little sensor that voltage gets amplified

02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.880
sent into a computer and then you could look at all this virtual instrumentation

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:27.560
simply doing it by applying pressure to a crystal

02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:32.840
this is what the schematic symbol looks like for piezoelectric crystal

02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.000
now we're going to talk about some different types of batteries

02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:48.920
battery of course is a combination of two or more cells

02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:57.560
now we have two different choices of cells one is called a primary cell the other is called a

02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:05.320
secondary cell let's first talk about primary cells primary cells are cells that cannot be

02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:14.040
recharged one time use these are like most of the cells that you and I buy right when you're

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:20.760
done using them you recycle them don't throw them in the landfill right you recycle them

02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:27.240
bring them to the hazmat place and then they'll turn it in and get money and make your community

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:32.600
more profitable based on you turning in your dead batteries some of the stuff you don't want

02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:37.560
going to the landfill although they've gotten better with the choice of chemicals that they're

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:43.960
using but primary cells once you once you use them you throw them away this is designed after

02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:51.400
what's known as the La Clanche cell or dry cell also referred to as the carbon zinc battery

02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.040
carbon zinc battery this is the old school battery that we were talking about earlier

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:09.320
I got a couple old timers in here remember that's all we had these are the only types of batteries

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:14.760
that used to exist and then I believe was in the 1970s they came out with alkaline cells

02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:22.280
that's when alkaline became somewhat mainstream started to become mainstream these alkaline cells

02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:29.240
were still pretty expensive as compared to the carbon zinc batteries I remember Radio Shack

02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:32.600
because again I was a big electronics guy so I was like hanging out at Radio Shack like looking

02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:37.800
at all the parts and stuff and Radio Shack used to have a battery of the month club and you got a

02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.760
little card and you'd go in with the card and you'd pick out the battery that you wanted and then

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:46.840
they'd punch your card you got a free battery it was a carbon zinc battery but it got you in the

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:55.880
store kind of a cool thing alkaline cells really really good alkaline cells would work a lot better

02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:59.640
with a lot of electronic equipment when it came into being

02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:13.640
the latest cell and my personal favorite is the lithium cell these are the high end lithium batteries

02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:19.240
that Energizer produces they cost like

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:31.160
16 bucks for eight batteries they're very very pricey but these lithium batteries

02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:39.160
will produce a voltage longer than any of these other types of primary cells they also have a

02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:45.640
longer shelf life I'll bring in a package we could look at it I just I bought some last week

02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:51.320
and I think it's the the expiration date on them is like 2022 some crazy time in the future

02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:56.280
we won't even need batteries like that we'll be flying to work in jet packs and stuff

02:30:56.280 --> 02:31:03.800
we won't even need a lithium batteries and the other thing that these are real great at is working

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:09.800
at a variety of different temperatures from extreme cold which really kills batteries big time

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:12.840
slows down that chemical reaction to extreme heat

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:20.440
they've kind of known about lithium batteries for a while lithium cells for a while

02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:28.840
on my airplane there's something that's called an ELT emergency locate transmitter

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:35.880
in the event of crashing there's a g-switch that triggers triggers a transmitter to start

02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:41.080
transmitting out a beacon that gives your position away so search aircraft actually they used to

02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:44.840
have satellites that looked for that signal but now they've long story they've switched those

02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:49.320
satellites off they've gone to some different frequencies now and but it would transmit so

02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:54.760
when this thing worked it had to work it's a safety device even like on a ship that goes down they

02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:59.800
have these e-perm systems that transmit to the satellite you want that when you got when it has

02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:05.640
to work you need the thing to work so this has always been the choice for those types of applications

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:13.240
the lithium cell i was really really jazzed and excited when i saw these come on the market for

02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:20.680
a consumer based product because the lithium the lithium batteries before were unique you know to

02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:24.680
the manufacturer would put it together and you'd have to buy the replacement from them

02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:29.720
because like the f a a requires every 24 months you've got to replace that that cell whether you've

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:36.440
used it or not so for them to come out the sizes that i'm aware of they have triple a and they

02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:43.640
have double a size have any of you here used any of those if you use them highly recommend it if

02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:47.960
you're going on your dream vacation if you're doing photography and you want something for your

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:53.000
flash and you want that flash to keep going off and you don't have to worry about it if you have a

02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:00.760
if you're going hiking i use it in my gps i use a bat i have a backup gps um you know that i use

02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:06.520
whenever i'm i'm going off the grid or anything i've got a pack i've got a pack that i bought

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:11.640
energizer will sell you a pack that you could use to recharge your cell phone have you seen those

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:17.640
things it's like a little pack and it comes with those lithium batteries and it's got a little cord

02:33:17.640 --> 02:33:21.960
so like if you're off the grid and you got to recharge your battery it comes with that style

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:28.280
you know your micro usb or mini usb plug or you know kiesta everything now is micro usb that's

02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:34.760
kind of the standard for new newer cell phones but you put those lithium batteries in it you plug

02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:40.760
it in it'll give you another charge so if any of you do any backcountry stuff or anything like that i

02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:46.280
highly recommend you look into them it's a wise investment a very wise investment it's the best

02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:49.400
primary cell that money will buy

02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:59.080
this is kind of you got the diagrams in your book kind of a cutaway view of a standard carbon

02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:10.360
zinc cell another cutaway view there cutaway view of a nine volt battery is this really a nine volt

02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:18.920
battery is it really a battery yes it is it's made up of multiple cells that have been put together

02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:25.960
each cell is capable of 1.5 volt so they put multiple cells together to give them nine volts

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:34.920
why nine volts actually this nine volt battery is also synonymous what was what was called a

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:41.560
transistor battery back in the day there's no transistors in it why was it called a transistor

02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:47.560
battery because this is the type of battery that your transistor radio would take growing up in

02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:53.560
connecticut i used to have a little small eight transistor radio used to go to the beach and i

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.720
used to tune in my little radio you know playing you know playing music listen to new york radio

02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:04.600
stations playing all the top 40 hits and everything eight transistor radio took a nine volt battery or

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:10.760
transistor battery this was typically the battery that i would get as a free battery at the battery

02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:18.280
of the month club for radio shack why my assumption was it's got nine volts the other ones have 1.5

02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:27.160
volts i'm getting more for my punch my free battery than than a 1.5 volt battery so this

02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:33.080
was typically the bad boy that i always used to get for the purpose of experimenting secondary

02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:38.280
cells or cells that cannot be recharged you're all familiar with this type of cell the lead acid

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.400
battery or wet cell which is in your car right now

02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:52.600
these batteries are not just used for automotive applications these wet cells these lead acid

02:35:52.600 --> 02:36:00.600
cells are also used for backup power supplies by the phone company for your landline they're also

02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:05.880
used at cellular sites for backup power in the event that power is interrupted to the

02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:12.600
cell sites automatically they'll switch over to battery backup they're typically lead acid cells

02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:22.680
absolutely and they use those for solar systems now because they're the cheapest secondary cell

02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:28.280
that's really on the market there's other technology that's more efficient that's more better

02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:35.000
okay but it costs more so if you just want to let's say you live out in the desert and you want

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.320
want to run lights by day and harness the energy by day and you need a lot of solar panels and

02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:44.120
you're going to need a lot of secondary cells the cheapest secondary cells that you could buy

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:53.160
our lead acid cells my submarine had a whole bank of lead acid cells located in the center of the

02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:59.640
submarine down in the keel the very lowest portion of the boat and it was the called ironically the

02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:06.520
battery well and in the battery well were batteries that were basically six feet tall

02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:12.520
and they were about this big around and they were individual cells and it took a crane to be able

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:18.520
to lower these things in and move them all in and then they had wooden shims wax and

02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:23.080
pregnated maple shims were all put in between these and it was all one giant bank and they were all

02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:33.160
wired up lead acid on a daily basis an electrician would strip all the metal off of their uniform if

02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:38.280
they had a belt on or anything metal and typically what they had is a special jumpsuit that they put

02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:43.640
on it had all acid burns in it and what they would do is they'd have to climb down in the battery well

02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:49.640
and they'd have to check the gravity the specific gravity this is the electrolyte fluid inside

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:54.200
and basically when we charge your battery what are we putting into a battery

02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:04.600
who said electrons electrons that's really what we're doing when we charge your battery

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:10.520
we're putting free electrons we're storing it in an electrolyte solution our electrons matter

02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:18.600
absolutely they're not very dense but they still are matter when you charge your battery what you

02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:24.760
do is you increase the specific gravity of that fluid that electrolyte fluid

02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:31.800
so what the electricians would do on a daily basis is they had a clipboard and they had a

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:36.040
grid that showed all the locations of the battery they would go down in and they would

02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:41.720
check the specific gravity do you know what i'm talking about with specific gravity specific gravity

02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:49.480
is a comparison of the density of pure water h2o at room temperature standard temperature

02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:57.480
the specific gravity of h2o pure water at room temperature standard temperature is one

02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:04.520
1.000000 it's one it's what we compare everything else to

02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:11.080
now if i have pure water and i start to get some salt and i dissolve salt into the water

02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:16.200
what am i going to do the specific gravity i'm going to raise it i'm going to increase the density

02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:20.840
of the fluid and by taking a specific gravity reading i'm going to show that it's more dense

02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:24.120
that shows me that i've done what i've put matter into the solution

02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:30.520
if i dissolve sugar into it same thing if i pump electrons into it what am i going to do

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:37.800
same thing i'm going to increase the density of it i use specific gravity i i brew my own beer

02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:43.240
and i use specific gravity to tell me what the alcohol content is

02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:51.720
in the brewing process i basically impart a lot of sugars into the beer and i take that reading

02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:58.920
the more sugars i put into the beer the specific gravity increases the density increases make

02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:07.000
sense then what i do is i get yeast i put the yeast into that solution and the yeast consumes the

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:16.280
sugar converting it into co2 and alcohol so after the yeast has done its job i expect to see that

02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:23.160
specific gravity decrease because alcohol is less dense than water and then i take a read

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:28.120
my first reading compare it to my last reading that gives me my alcohol content of what's inside the

02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:39.240
beer for a battery your battery in your car has six cells if you buy a hydrometer and you test

02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:44.200
those cells you should get consistency across all of those cells if you don't

02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.480
if this cell is good this cell is good this cell is a little bit lower this good good good

02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:57.160
the cell being a little bit lower you're probably developing an internal short in that cell

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:05.160
need to replace your battery you can't just replace the individual cells you have to replace

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:11.000
the whole entire battery so back on the submarine they were really concerned about that on a daily

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.280
basis they sent somebody down in the battery well to take those readings because if they saw a cell

02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.520
that started to develop an internal short or problem conceivably it could take all of that

02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:27.160
energy and dissipate that energy through that one bad cell that's bad news because oh by the way

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:33.160
you know why we had a battery battery bank if our nuclear reactor shut down or we had a problem

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:40.120
we could get to the surface when we get to the surface we could start up a diesel generator

02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:45.960
so from that transit from the deep up to the surface we needed to be on battery power

02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:53.320
if you can't get the diesel started while you're on the surface or actually at periscope depth

02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:58.280
because we had a snorkel they could just stick up where it's an induction system for the diesel

02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:03.640
run the diesel we had a generator connected where we could keep not as much power as we'd have to

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:06.840
nuclear power but to keep all vital systems up and operational

02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.720
actually i had a real scare once we were someplace we weren't supposed to be

02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:17.640
like someplace we were not supposed to be typically where we always went with my submarine

02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:25.000
and it was a half it was a national holiday for this country so all of their you know they'd

02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:28.840
take their submarines and drive them through red square and their tanks and their missile

02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:32.920
launchers and everything and you know we had nothing better to do so instead of like hey you

02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:37.320
know we're watching the soviets they're having a holiday let's us have a holiday because on the

02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:40.520
fourth of july we're going to be watching the soviets and they're not going to take into account

02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:45.960
our holiday you know the captain didn't think it was a very good idea that i had now as a matter

02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:49.560
of fact mr grinnock i think what we're going to do is we're going to do some drilling today

02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:55.880
you know and it's firefighting whatever well we did it we did a drill an exercise

02:42:56.840 --> 02:43:02.440
that involves scrambling the reactor sounds ominous doesn't it scram the reactor oh no don't

02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:07.240
scram the reactor scrambling the reactor is actually a good thing scrambling the reactor is

02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:11.720
when you shut the reactor down you have control rods you move the control rods in you neutralize

02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:18.600
the the reaction the nuclear reaction this is actually what they did too in japan after the

02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:23.720
earthquake as soon as there was seismic activity pow they shut those reactors down scram the reactors

02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:29.800
the problem that they had afterwards was with the tsunami damaging i suspect it was their intake

02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:35.320
their seawater intake that for used for cooling and they couldn't dissipate all that heat that had

02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:41.400
already been generated and then it became a you know an avalanche so to speak of circumstances

02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:45.720
anyway we're somewhere we're supposed we're not supposed to be and it was quiet

02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:49.800
so the captain figures we're going to do some nuclear drill scram the reactor pow scram the

02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:53.560
reactor normal procedure as we start to come up to periscope depth make sure that no we're not

02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:58.200
going to hit anybody up on the surface come up raise the snorkel mast start the diesel generator

02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:01.640
well they try starting the diesel generator which is common commonplace wouldn't start

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.440
wouldn't start and what had happened is there was this multi pin connector that for whatever

02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:14.280
reason disintegrated in the back of the of the diesel control panel so it's kind of like well

02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:20.680
that's going to take two days to put back together you know so we're on battery power to be honest

02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:26.360
with you we knew it was a drill and we were all real sloppy rigging for reduced electrical that's

02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:33.640
where we shut down on non-vital systems and we knew it was a drill so we were very slow in doing it

02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:39.880
we expended over half of our battery energy in that period of time so now all of a sudden the

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:46.200
reactor shut down we can't start the diesel generator we've just consumed 50 of our battery

02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:52.600
power because we were screwing around kind of dragging our feet with this exercise so we realized

02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:59.800
what was happening and basically the decision was made restart the reactor well they try restarting

02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:06.120
the reactor and the reactor won't start and we've consumed all of our battery power so now

02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:11.160
we went to this like super super rig for reduced electrical where there's like you know emergency

02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:15.720
lighting and all the environmental systems are down so the air all of a sudden is almost

02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:21.720
unbreathable and it's it's it's in excess of 120 degrees and it's it's humid and it's just miserable

02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:28.120
can't get the reactor started and in my job surveillance i was down to one receiver i shut

02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:33.560
all my sophisticated stuff down i'm down to one receiver you can't make the story up it's like

02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:39.880
holy crap here comes the fleet it's like what are you talking about here comes the freaking

02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:47.320
soviet fleet headed right towards us like you gotta be kidding so it got really really hairy

02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:52.200
because this is the type of thing that like world war three could start over what's a submarine doing

02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:57.320
in our harbor you know violating our sovereign territory and all of this stuff you know we just

02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:03.320
we couldn't get get caught so truth be told they were able to get the reactor started they

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:12.040
had to kind of amend amend their procedures and come to find out it was actually a reactor control

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:17.080
switch had failed it was a series of circumstances we called that day anybody that served on the boat

02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:23.560
in that era affectionately known as black tuesday because things were really really bad and i had

02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:30.360
it good i mean my space normally where i worked i had a wear like foul weather jacket to stay warm

02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:33.960
because of all the air conditioning of course all the air conditioning was down

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:38.280
but i tell you what the guys in the engineering spaces i mean they were stripped down to their

02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:43.960
underwear and no shirts and they're just sweat and port sweat point i mean it's temperature skyrocketed

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:48.200
you know 150 160 degrees back there in the engineering spaces you're trying to troubleshoot

02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:55.240
something but anyway it all worked out good in the end but that's the necessity of backup battery

02:46:55.240 --> 02:46:58.520
now a lot of you may be saying well i'm never going to work on a nuclear submarine or a ship

02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:02.520
or whatever no you might go to work as a biomedical electronics tech at a hospital

02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:07.240
guess what hospitals have backup battery banks you might go to work for the federal aviation

02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:13.640
administration federal aviation administration down in auburn washington at the mountain region

02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:17.320
air route traffic control center i don't know if any of you are aware of that facility if you've

02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:21.720
go to the like the muckleshoot casino down there it's like right across the street it's a big building

02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:26.680
fences around it garb guards all kinds of stuff like that that's where they control all the air

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:32.200
traffic in the northwestern united states from western montana to the pacific ocean from the

02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:37.400
canadian border all the way to uh northern california if you're an airplane in flight you're talking

02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:43.160
to somebody in auburn washington they lose the power at that facility guess what the whole

02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:47.800
northwestern united states aircraft are flying blind so they were kind of smart about this they

02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:55.320
put in a battery backup system so as soon as the power ac crashes this these batteries have power

02:47:55.320 --> 02:48:00.680
inverters and that brings it back up online so they don't miss a beat once the batteries are up

02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:05.480
online then they have diesel generators and another building on the property that will go

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.560
ahead and kick in and they have huge huge fuel tanks so they could power that for a very very

02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:14.120
long period of time if any of you have ever heard of the news of the past a lot of times if they

02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:18.520
have a glitch like an air traffic control system and switching over to backup power that's actually

02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:24.040
what what the problem is is going from ac to that battery backup if that if it if it doesn't happen

02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.920
seamlessly all of those systems go down you all know with computers you got to reboot computers

02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:33.240
so you have aircraft flying blind without air traffic control for a period of time

02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:41.080
so it could be somewhat of a inconvenience safety concern so a lot of you are going to see this

02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:47.000
actually one of the most reliable systems and this is uh i don't know how many of you still

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:54.600
just have an old-fashioned power um old-fashioned telephone lying to your home pots it is called

02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:00.840
and basically what that is is an old school just two wires coming to your home most of us now are

02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:07.000
on broadband and voice over ip and all this kind of crap the old school telephones were the most

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:13.640
reliable you could have a power outage you could have earthquake whatever and you pick that phone

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:18.680
up and you're still going to get a dial tone because that dial tone is being generated by backup

02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:24.360
battery banks at the central office and that's powering the phone system so you know i've

02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:30.280
experienced a lot of blackouts in my life where the power would go out and i never lost that dial

02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:37.880
tone on the phone now you know how many of you are like with comcast you know i mean what was i

02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:41.560
thinking when i went to actually believe it or not i'm not i'm not just talking to talk i'm walking

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:46.440
to walk before i came to work today i actually called quest i want to get an old school line back

02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:51.480
into my house because i'm looking at my phone bill my freaking phone bill i don't like paying like

02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:56.680
70 bucks a month for you know call or id and call waiting and the only people that call me

02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:04.040
are people that i don't want calling me okay so why am i paying 70 bucks a month to have

02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:08.040
something that i don't want and i don't want to shut the line off because i have some other uses

02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:14.840
for that line so i called quest and i'm like it's kind of unusual request you have any of the

02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:21.560
old school lines that you know i could still have you know yeah yeah yeah and how much 13 dollars and

02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:28.360
50 cents a month plus tax i'm like that's what i want can you port my existing number out back

02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:33.320
to it yeah no problem so i'm gonna get that scheduled 1350 a month no you can't no long

02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:39.480
distance or anything but i don't want it for that i want it for that 911 i want it i don't know why

02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:42.680
i'm gonna disconnect the ringer because again the only people people that want to call me to call

02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:47.080
my cell number you know but i still need that if you have an alarm system at your home you need it

02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:53.960
if you've got a satellite tv box for updates and pay per view you need it so it could call into the

02:50:53.960 --> 02:51:00.680
mother ship on a daily basis so battery backups are still out there so i don't think you're not

02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:05.800
going to go to work in the industry and never see a battery backup now you're all familiar with

02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:11.640
lead acid nickel cadmium nicad how many of you are familiar with nicad batteries nicad have been out

02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:17.720
for for a long period of time nicad's had a nasty habit of generating what was called a memory

02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:24.280
and what that memory was in essence is uh if any of you have ever had your arm or leg in a cast

02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:30.520
and you don't use it basically the muscles forget how to fully exercise your range of motion you

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:36.360
got to go through through some therapy to get your arm working again right kind of the same thing

02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:44.760
with a nicad a nicad if you didn't fully discharge it and then fully charge it it would only think

02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:52.040
that its range was in this narrow margin of performance so the problem with nicads with

02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:57.480
like cam corridors and cell phones where as soon as that voltage started to drop a little bit you

02:51:57.480 --> 02:52:02.840
start to get the low battery indicator and to preserve the electronic integrity of what you

02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:08.840
were doing it would shut off then you'd get it sticking in your charger charge it back up and

02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:13.640
what would happen it would only get used to operating in this little room right here some of

02:52:13.640 --> 02:52:18.440
the manufacturers got smart and they put a little button on there and they could connect it to a load

02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:23.320
and drag it down all the way and then recharge it all the way i've gotten because i understand this

02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:29.480
stuff i've gotten exceptional exceptional use out of out of nicad batteries when my kids were

02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:35.400
growing up my first video camera back in the 1980s i had one of those big vhs units don't laugh it was

02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:40.120
vhs at least it wasn't beta should have been beta beta was better but that's another story for another

02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:46.040
day but it was one of these big herken vhs you know and it took this big 12 volt battery pack

02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:50.840
and i went to replace it and i was looking at some different vendors and they're looking at me

02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:55.160
and they couldn't believe that it was the original battery pack it's like we don't even carry

02:52:55.160 --> 02:52:59.160
replacements for those anymore you know how long have you had this uh since the beginning

02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:05.480
well you know how could this be it's because i understood how to take care of nicads what i did

02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:10.600
is i made myself a dummy load and when the battery got low you know i mean obviously if it was a

02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:15.560
birthday party or something that i wanted a video i could recharge the battery but at least on a regular

02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:22.200
basis i would discharge it all the way and then charge it all the way and by the way with nickel

02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:26.680
cadmium cells when i say charge it all the way that doesn't mean slapping on your quick charger

02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:34.760
like if you've got a cordless drill at home a makita i got a quick charger for it worst thing

02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:40.680
you could do mine still works being all those quick chargers work they actually have a temperature

02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:47.960
sensor in the battery pack when the battery starts to get hot it must be full so it cuts the battery

02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:55.880
off that's not a full charge the only true method of charging an icad properly is a timed charge

02:53:55.880 --> 02:54:01.080
a trickle charge where you're trickling in a note amount of current and then you bring it gradually

02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:07.800
up to that 100% now slam it and then the thing gets hot and then shuts off some of the early ones

02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:14.600
once it would stop charging it would cut it off right and then what would happen when the battery

02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:19.560
cooled down it started charging again and then would get hot and shut down so you ended up with

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:24.200
this cycle and these were the real cheap chargers and those would just eat these nicads so if you

02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:31.000
know about nicads nicads weren't that bad they really weren't the next thing was uh nickel metal

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:36.440
hydride nickel metal hydride that was the next evolutionary process rechargeable battery secondary

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:42.760
cells a lot of us had them years ago and our cell phones worked very very well less prone to that

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:49.160
memory condition with all these secondary batteries though is it a limited unlimited number of charges

02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:55.880
and discharges and recharges no every rechargeable battery when it's brand new you only get so many

02:54:55.880 --> 02:55:01.160
cycles out of it they're not going to last forever even if you take good care of them and then now

02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:06.840
lithium ion lithium ion if you've got a newer cell phone probably came with lithium ion that's

02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:21.320
really the best that's out there now i don't know i was just i don't know i was thinking about that

02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:25.720
the other day because i've and i've actually gotten new battery put aside that i've never charged it

02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:33.640
still in the package so um i don't know i've been keeping my eyes open in the store for that style

02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:38.280
pack and i'm sure it's available on the internet but what am i going to have to pay for it you know

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.280
the other thing though too check this out because you know i'm not the smartest guy but i kind of

02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:48.440
understand some of this stuff some of those cases you could actually cut them open and you could

02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:53.800
replace the cells yourself you know and then re bond the plastic back together and i've done that

02:55:53.800 --> 02:56:01.640
on several things myself as i've reconditioned put in new packs i had a i had some i forgot what the

02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:10.520
heck it was it took nycad batteries and then what i did is i cut it open and it was just standard

02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:16.120
nycad battery usually doesn't have the label on it but the sizes were the same and then what i did

02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:23.080
is i went to a harbor freight tools and i bought nickel metal hydride rechargeable cells and i put

02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:31.320
the pack back together soldered it up good to go good to go so in some some cases you could do that

02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.320
a lot of high performance things too even like jet aircraft if you're down drive past bowing field

02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:42.360
you see a lear jet sitting out there believe it or not what they're typically going to use is not

02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:48.120
the lead acid they're actually going to have nycad packs so when they start the engines on the jet

02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:52.760
they're starting it off a nycad and those are very very expensive so it's kind of amazing

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:57.320
you're a multi-millionaire flying around in a lear jet a lot of times you know what those guys will

02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:02.760
ask for they want a starter pack to be brought over with a little tug and there's a cart with a

02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:07.800
bunch of batteries on it a lot of acid batteries and then you plug that into the aircraft and then

02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:13.240
what they'll do is they'll they'll use that so they don't have to put a charge discharge cycle in

02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:17.960
their night nycads in their precious lear jet it's like man if you could afford a freaking lear jet

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:24.280
you can afford a new freaking nycad you know but i used to work part you're the funnest job i ever

02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:29.160
had i worked part-time at an airport canada kept those guys always used to amaze me and a lot of

02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:33.240
them wouldn't a lot of them would tip you you know you bring that pack over whatever here you go go

02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.840
go buy yourself a good lunch here son oh thank you sir you know i didn't mind somebody's dude so

02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:44.680
man i'm saving you money you're not even tossing me a bone come on man the heck next time i'm gonna

02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:53.400
park you out there this is the cutaway view of a lead acid cell now connecting cells and batteries

02:57:54.920 --> 02:58:01.960
connecting cells and batteries we have series aiding this this chart here is is erroneous

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:11.960
um let me draw this on the board here what we're talking about here series aiding means

02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:20.760
negative positive i can assume that this is what voltage

02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:29.480
1.5 volts so if i connect it to another cell

02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:40.680
i can assume that this is 1.5 volts and if i go ahead and even connect the third cell down here

02:58:40.680 --> 02:58:49.160
i can assume that this is 1.5 volts what am i up to right here what's my total voltage

02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:56.920
from this point to this point okay very good 4.5 volts everybody see that

02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:07.960
everybody see that so what i'm doing here is by series in series aiding i am increasing the

02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:15.000
electrical pressure that's available to me the amount of current that's available here

02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:22.360
is going to stay the same because this is what we call a series configuration and current will

02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:29.080
always stay the same in a series configuration so by connecting up batteries or cells like this

02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:36.680
i could get a higher voltage but current will remain the same does that make sense

02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:44.920
now down below it talks about series opposing series opposing would be like

02:59:46.520 --> 02:59:48.600
okay i got a negative and a positive here

02:59:51.160 --> 02:59:52.040
y'all agree with that

02:59:54.920 --> 02:59:57.960
then i'm going to connect the positive and a negative here

03:00:00.680 --> 03:00:05.080
so i've got 1.5 volts here and how many volts do i have here

03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:17.720
minus 1.5 volts so what's my voltage across zero so

03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:26.280
my slide which is politically correct says it has little practical value it's actually stupid

03:00:26.920 --> 03:00:31.480
this is like you know you're you're putting a battery in backwards why come my flashlight no

03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:36.360
work and you take them out you realize you're putting one of the cells backwards has little

03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:43.560
practical value this one's adding 1.5 volts this one's taking 1.5 volts away you're putting

03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:49.080
a negative and a negative here current's not going to want to flow again it has little practical

03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:55.800
value yeah challenging electronic students when they're going through a theory course like this

03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:00.840
it really is because i could draw like five or six of these and then you got it let's see plus

03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:08.200
1.5 plus 1.5 minus 1.5 minus so we are going to give you some problems like that that have

03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:12.200
voltages because quite frankly when you do get into sophisticated electronic equipment

03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:17.000
you're going to see that there are some voltages that are being added to a circuit and some that

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:22.200
are being taken away from a circuit so from a math standpoint a theory standpoint it does have value

03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:31.480
in studying it in parallel and again this is a this is a typo here these should not be equal

03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:37.480
signs this should be total current is equal to i1 plus i2 plus i3 let me show you this one

03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:42.920
actually let me just go to the next slide and i'll show you on the slide this is what we were

03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:46.600
talking about or this is what i was talking about i don't know if we're talking about it it's what i'm

03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:53.800
talking about one point uh this is three volts three volts and three volts is equal to how much

03:01:53.800 --> 03:02:00.040
across this six volts can you dig it all right so here we got three volts and three volts which is

03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:11.960
equal to six volts connected in parallel with six volts why why come why come i do this why would

03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:22.040
i possibly what is the advantage of this over this what's that is the voltage increased

03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:28.600
you said to increase the voltage in the current is the voltage increased

03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:39.240
no i still get how much electrical pressure am i getting out of the circuit six volts

03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:47.960
what's that increase the capacity tell me more about that i like that

03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:56.680
very good batteries are measured in in amp hours how much current

03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:04.520
over a period of time can they provide us with so let's look at this scenario for a

03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:08.520
minute let's say that we all have a sailboat wouldn't it be nice if we all had a sailboat

03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:14.680
we could sail off to the sunset let's sail up to the sand one islands and hang out up there

03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:23.960
okay i've got a six volt it's an unusual sailboat i've got a six volt anchor light

03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:32.040
so when i find a nice cove up in the sand wands and i drop my anchor by coast guard regulations

03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:40.520
i'm required at night to turn on a light that says i'm anchored and it's a six volt light

03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:49.720
the problem is this configuration here will only last for six hours

03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:58.760
and then the light gets dimmer and dimmer and dimmer until it goes out

03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:05.880
and shortly after it goes out the fog rolls in and here comes along a washington state ferry

03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:12.520
and it runs us down and it ruins ruins all of our fun that we're having on our sailboat in sand

03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:21.640
one islands so i'm a pretty smart guy what i did is i went out and i got another battery pack

03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:29.480
and i i put it in parallel with the original battery pack the original battery pack lasted

03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:37.080
for how many hours how many is this going to last for for the same size load it's going to last

03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:41.080
twice as long how's about them apples

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:51.160
that's how it works so basically he or she who has the most batteries in parallel is going to

03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:58.680
last the longest playing it simple it was actually kind of a funny story

03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:07.800
um going to sea for extended periods of time under the water there are very few things i mean even

03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:15.160
reading material books how many books can you bring with you what can you do so back in the day

03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:19.960
the only the only form of media for me basically for music was cassette tapes

03:05:21.400 --> 03:05:27.000
so i had my little i didn't even have a sony walkman i eventually upgraded to a sony walkman

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:34.280
but originally i had some you know off brand cassette player and actually that was a big

03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:38.920
advancement because prior to that you needed the big cassette player put the cassette in headphones

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:45.480
you know no eight track i'm talking strictly the cassettes we this was high tech cassettes

03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:52.920
so i bought something that looked like a walkman but of course walkman is a trademark of sony

03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:58.360
corporation and this was some off brand so it was so funny too because uh you know everything

03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:02.760
that we did was super secret you couldn't tell anybody we couldn't even tell our spouses that

03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:09.400
we were going so all of a sudden you see a guy in uniform you know at the at the exchange

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:15.400
you know buying like you know five tubes of toothpaste and seven bars of soap and you

03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:21.080
know a hundred packs of batteries and he's in uniform with his unit you know on his ball cap

03:06:21.080 --> 03:06:26.040
and you know it's kind of like ah you're stocking up you guys are going to see you know so you didn't

03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:30.840
have to be like an intelligence expert to figure out who's coming and going so anyway we're going

03:06:30.840 --> 03:06:35.720
to go to see and it was going to be like a seven month operation that doesn't mean that we'd be

03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:42.040
totally in communicato or away from civilized uh you know shopping or whatever but for at least

03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:50.120
a minimum of 90 days we're going to be underwater so i go out and my my cassette player took

03:06:50.120 --> 03:06:56.520
double a batteries so i bought a bunch of these double a batteries well come to find out that this

03:06:56.520 --> 03:07:06.920
thing was such a piece of crap that i could want i could listen to 1.5 sides of a cassette tape

03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:14.040
before the batteries would die and i'm like i'm not a math expert but i'm like i'm going to run out

03:07:14.040 --> 03:07:20.120
of batteries like really quick so after i used up all my double a batteries and i still want

03:07:20.120 --> 03:07:25.160
that to listen to music because again you're living with 120 other people in a steel tube 285

03:07:25.160 --> 03:07:30.600
feet long 28 foot diameter when you could put those headset on and you could kind of zone out

03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:36.200
that was you know a little piece of piece of tranquility you could have so i'm like well i'm

03:07:36.200 --> 03:07:40.200
a smart guy i got electronics background how tough can this be so i cracked the thing off i figured

03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:48.360
out what voltage i could wire in externally so then what i did is um uh every every division on

03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:53.000
the submarine had different consumable products they were responsible for stocking because you

03:07:53.000 --> 03:08:00.360
didn't have a store so actually for my division it was pens pads paper so if you were a nuclear

03:08:00.360 --> 03:08:05.320
reactor guy you'd come to me and say hey joe you know can i need some pens look screw you

03:08:05.320 --> 03:08:11.240
you know but i'd give you the pens or the paper whatever you need well ironically the division

03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:18.200
that was responsible for first um uh providing batteries ironically were the electricians so

03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:21.240
when i went back and i said you know i need some batteries what do you guys got well you know we

03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:25.720
got these sizes here and they were the you know the big d size and they were military you know olive

03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:32.600
drab green big batteries and i'm like yeah give me like eight of them you know so i got these eight

03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:39.160
batteries and i wind them all up wired them all up combination series parallel and then i got

03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:45.080
electrical tape and i like this big freaking brick you know and so i got this this nice little

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:49.880
portable cassette player that i paid you know an exorbitant amount of money for and then i got this

03:08:49.880 --> 03:08:57.480
big brick i'm like so it was truly a portable device you know so anyway it worked and it worked

03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:03.800
fine and then i got so used to carrying this thing around that it was like months later we're in port

03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:09.000
and i'm still carrying this brick and i even with a handle on it it was and it kept working and i'm

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:13.000
like why am i doing this this thing is stupid i finally i actually cut it off and i threw it

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:16.520
over the side of the boat it's probably sitting in the bottom of the Thames river in connecticut

03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:25.880
still but the moral of the story is that portable cassette recorder operated off of 1.5 volt cells

03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:33.000
did it not what was the difference when i added the brick to it those are 1.5 volt cells right

03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:42.280
capacity physically more chemical physically more capacity higher amp hour rating and it

03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:47.560
kept going and going and going and going and going so this is one of the principles for a lot of

03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:56.760
you that may pursue alternative energy whatever that means basically it's the efficiency of your

03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:05.080
cells how many cells do you have how much energy can you store actually had a student that is a

03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:13.960
project he owns the property in central washington and um living off the grid had a backup generator

03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:19.480
also put in some photovoltaic cells and as a project he basically did the math and figured out

03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:25.800
like on the shortest day of the year how many appliances am i going to want to run in my little

03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:32.040
cabin and will i have enough electrical energy to make it through the night and that's basically

03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:38.120
what his target was and he says i need this much storage capacity and that's what he used as a target

03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:45.160
actually increased that i think by about 20 percent and then in the summer how many how many hours

03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:50.200
could he use photovoltaic to charge that and then what's the minimum amount of time that he needs to

03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:56.440
run his generator to get those batteries up to that full capacity charge so if you understand

03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:00.200
the math behind this let me tell you your commodity out there because a lot of people

03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:07.560
don't have a freaking clue they don't they don't when i was on a cruise a couple weeks ago on

03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:12.200
vacation i met a uh i'm trying to i'm trying to get on better terms with this guy and actually

03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:20.200
we've been corresponding via email he owns a 52 foot yacht in miami and an airplane high-performance

03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:29.880
aircraft and um he likes taking his his yacht down to the bahamas in dropping anchor and he

03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:34.600
doesn't like running the generator so we had a whole discussion about energy management photovoltaic

03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:40.120
what's the minimum amount of time that you could run your generator can you add batteries to augment

03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:46.440
the system and i mean this guy he's a couple masters degree highly intelligent and he didn't

03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:51.640
have a clue of what i was talking about so if you understand this let me tell you

03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:55.960
you got it going on when it comes to this type of stuff makes sense

03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:03.800
voltage rise is the energy we put into a circuit voltage drop is the energy that we take out of

03:12:03.800 --> 03:12:08.520
the circuit if you will is given up as the electrons encounter resistance to the circuit

03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:15.240
so voltage rise would be like your batteries voltage drop is what you're powering

03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:22.120
and you know what they should always be equal to each other if you've got a five-volt battery pack

03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:27.480
and you're powering a radio that radio should be consuming five volts five volt voltage rise five

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:34.520
volt voltage drop makes sense should never end up with energy left over if you are that's what we

03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:39.960
call a malfunction you've got a malfunction you've got voltage not going from the source to the load

03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:46.200
the voltage rise that the power company provides my house with is 240 volts a c

03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:54.120
my voltage drop for my home is 240 volts a c if it was 239 that means a volt is being dropped

03:12:54.120 --> 03:13:00.440
somewhere underground or in the overhead it's not supposed to be getting dropped there question

03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:11.640
voltage rise

03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:27.560
yeah that's your question is more related to power i'm talking simply voltage i'm talking simply

03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:33.160
voltage so that if i've got and i'm keeping it real simplistic and you need to understand it in a

03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:40.520
simplistic manner if this calculator takes three volts dc the three volts dc is going to be my

03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:47.880
voltage drop right if i want this thing to operate properly i need to give it a voltage rise of

03:13:49.320 --> 03:13:55.880
three volts so that's all i'm saying voltage rise is the power is the elect the voltage pressure

03:13:55.880 --> 03:14:02.200
you apply to it the voltage drop is the pressure that gets consumed by the load and they should

03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:07.400
always be equal if they're not wherever the missing voltages that's a problem

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:17.080
if you're consuming less than what the power company's providing you with you've got a problem

03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:22.680
because that missing voltage has got to be somewhere and where you find it that's the problem

03:14:24.520 --> 03:14:29.560
make sense okay we'll talk more about that concept but right now i just want you to understand

03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:32.280
voltage rise equals voltage drop

03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:43.400
ground ground this is an interesting concept and if you hear ever driven over snow qualmi pass

03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:48.760
how do you know you're going over snow qualmi pass it's not a trick question

03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:56.360
how do you know you're going over the pass there's a sign on the side of the road that says

03:14:57.320 --> 03:14:58.760
snow qualmi pass

03:15:02.920 --> 03:15:09.240
i try to keep it basic here now that sign also says snow qualmi pass and there's another bit

03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:19.720
of information there elevation elevation above what north bend seattle above where

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.400
sea level you guys are all smart you guys are one of my smartest classes here in a while

03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:37.080
high tide or low tide average you know what we call that

03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:46.840
msl mean sea level mean sea level so one of the things that al gore is talking about like sea

03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:53.720
level rising that's what he's talking about so his big concern is all the expense of changing all

03:15:53.720 --> 03:16:00.280
the signs elevation now obviously it's going to cause a lot of problems if mean sea level if

03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:05.320
the polar ice caps melt and sea level rises it's going to be a lot of flooding and devastation

03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:12.120
okay especially during hurricanes and high tide events and tsunamis and everything else

03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:21.240
so we use the height of the ocean mean sea level as a reference for all of our height measurements

03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:26.120
it's actually really important when i fly my airplane it's one of the first things instruments

03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:32.600
i calibrate when i get in is the altimeter and that shows me how high i am above sea level

03:16:33.320 --> 03:16:39.560
it's kind of important i flew my airplane friday night i went across the top of c-tac airport

03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:44.440
i had airplanes taken off and arriving and i'm flying through there in my small plane

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.480
you kind of think it's important that i know what else to do what i'm at

03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:53.720
yeah and as a matter of fact they check back with you when you establish radio communications

03:16:53.720 --> 03:16:59.880
they say you know hold maintain 1500 forces kilo what's your current altitude 1500 roger we got

03:16:59.880 --> 03:17:04.520
you at 1500 you're cleared through our airspace because they want to make sure you're not off

03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:09.880
it's important to me so that's how we calibrate if you're in hiking driving even boating mean sea

03:17:09.880 --> 03:17:15.000
level is kind of critical isn't it high tide low tide if you're at low tide you hit a freaking rock

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.560
it's kind of important you have the right charge and you understand low tide

03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:29.800
mean mean no mean me and mean which is average so when we started playing around with electricity

03:17:29.800 --> 03:17:37.720
we had to come up with a methodology if you will to what's what's what can we compare what's a

03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:41.160
benchmark of something that's in a neutral natural state

03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:53.720
earth why because this is where we be okay this is where we're standing so literally what we got

03:17:53.720 --> 03:18:00.760
is a ground rod an eight foot ground rod drive it into the earth and say you know what you connected

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:09.320
you're connected to ground and you're connected to zero potential it's not positive it's not

03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:16.120
negative it's neutral why because it's driven into the freaking ground so what happens is

03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:24.280
the idea kind of caught on so the power company out at the power pole or your transformer if you

03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:29.640
have underground they got a rod and they drove it into the ground they said you know what we're

03:18:29.640 --> 03:18:41.240
going to sell you 240 volts ac in reference to ground at your home at your load you should get

03:18:41.240 --> 03:18:49.640
240 volts in reference to ground the electrical generating plant where they generate the electricity

03:18:49.640 --> 03:18:56.200
they drove a ground rod in and they reference that voltage to ground so we use it as a reference to

03:18:56.200 --> 03:19:01.000
all of our voltages which are really quite critical i'm kind of making fun of this in a in a in a

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:08.360
goofy way but in all honesty it's actually really really critical like right now at my home i've got

03:19:08.360 --> 03:19:17.240
the electrical connection coming from the power company in reference to hopefully ground i get my

03:19:17.240 --> 03:19:24.040
telephone line soon to be replaced kicking at old school and that needs to be referenced to

03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:31.960
ground i've got a satellite receiver that has the antenna up on the roof that antenna needs to

03:19:31.960 --> 03:19:38.040
be referenced to ground the satellite receiver also plugs into the electrical outlet that should

03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:43.480
be referenced at ground and it also needs to be plugged into the telephone connection that should

03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:51.720
be referenced at ground actually when i had con cast installed in my home it was over the summer

03:19:51.720 --> 03:19:56.600
i had time off i was watching these dudes install it and because i teach electronics i'd always like

03:19:56.600 --> 03:20:00.520
to say hey dude what's going on man how long you've been with comcast these people treat you okay

03:20:00.520 --> 03:20:05.160
what's the deal what's your educational background what's going down you know how are you doing that

03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:08.520
if i could learn something from you somebody that doesn't installs all day long i'm gonna pick your

03:20:08.520 --> 03:20:13.560
brain and see what i can learn anyway see this dude hooking his freaking contraption up to my

03:20:13.560 --> 03:20:18.120
my my faucet i'm like what are you doing he said i'm connecting this to ground we got a reference

03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:24.120
at the ground i'm like hold on cease and desist what are you doing well i got to connect this to

03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:27.880
ground i says my freaking water connection well yeah but this is you know water pipe is a good

03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:34.760
ground no you see that right there driven into the ground that's a ground rod okay that's the

03:20:34.760 --> 03:20:39.560
same ground rod that the power company's providing me with the ground it's the same ground that everything

03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:43.400
else in the house is connected to so why are you going to connect it to this faucet coming out all

03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:48.360
you don't know if it's pvc inside he really got an attitude and i'm like no boom cease and desist

03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:53.640
i got a supervisor out there and i had assigned paperwork modified install modified install

03:20:56.120 --> 03:21:02.040
customer request i want ground and i wrote that right in there me want ground to be connected to

03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:06.760
ground rod you know so they all really got an attitude and stuff you know but it's kind of like

03:21:06.760 --> 03:21:10.200
no i mean it really needs to happen because especially too this is back in the day when

03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:14.920
you had a computer modem you could have that modem you could have your computer power supply you

03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:20.360
could have all these things and if they're not all connected to ground they could develop a difference

03:21:20.360 --> 03:21:27.160
in potential and if they develop a difference in potential you know how that's going to manifest

03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:34.120
itself with highly sophisticated electronic systems not necessarily sparks of fire could be gremlins

03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:41.160
it could just be real wacky behavior all of a sudden your satellite receiver starts rebooting

03:21:41.160 --> 03:21:45.720
itself all of a sudden your computer reboots itself all of a sudden your modem kicks you out

03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:51.640
so when they started doing all of this interbuilding networking and everything it became a real big

03:21:51.640 --> 03:21:58.280
issue to make sure that ground was really ground years ago when they built this building uh well

03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:03.400
actually they renovated this building behind here they pulled up the concrete they drilled down into

03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:09.000
the earth and they put in this huge ground for the school to make sure it wasn't just a standard

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:13.320
ground rod this was like drilled way down into into the earth you know you can see like the

03:22:13.320 --> 03:22:19.320
core and stuff and i'm just kidding but it was it was it was pretty far down in this is actually

03:22:19.320 --> 03:22:24.360
one of the problems they have like in arizona because of the sand and in the desert and it's

03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:29.880
we have good ground here because it's like all wet but in arizona they have some problems so

03:22:29.880 --> 03:22:34.280
i think there's some uh code variants down there where they're like actually connecting

03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:39.480
like rebar in the concrete you know foundation and such and they do some different stuff down there

03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:43.480
i'm not totally familiar with it but some of those dry climates they have to do it john

03:22:45.960 --> 03:22:52.600
it was and they were actually adding chemicals to almost create like a p and an n type material

03:22:52.600 --> 03:22:57.400
there so current would only have one way to travel through that like a giant diode buried in the

03:22:57.400 --> 03:23:02.760
ground behind here so i wish i'd take a picture it's like i know you know you're not believing me

03:23:02.760 --> 03:23:07.560
but it was like a drilling rig out there it's like black gold texas tea we're going to hollywood

03:23:09.480 --> 03:23:17.320
anyway the other type of electrical ground is electrical ground and this provides a common

03:23:17.320 --> 03:23:29.160
reference point we use this electrical ground because the 747 taking off would look stupid

03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:37.240
with a big reel spool wired trailing behind it okay it just wouldn't look right so for pure

03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:43.720
aesthetic purposes we can't do this so we use what's called electrical ground your car uses

03:23:43.720 --> 03:23:50.440
electrical ground airplanes use electrical ground ships use electrical ground and what that in

03:23:50.440 --> 03:23:57.800
essence means is a chassis ground now most of our home appliances use both we ground the chassis

03:23:59.240 --> 03:24:06.680
the electrical ground to earth ground so that if you have a three prong plug one of those plugs

03:24:06.680 --> 03:24:10.520
that round plug is ground and that's connected to the chassis

03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:18.520
so be aware of this in the lab you're going to have some problems with ground

03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:26.760
because you don't understand what i'm talking about some of the equipment that we have in the

03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:32.440
lab is isolated from ground so when you connect the negative lead like on a power supply you think

03:24:32.440 --> 03:24:37.240
you're connecting ground as a chat you're not that negative if you have a dc power supply in the

03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:43.160
lab you have a positive you have a negative they're isolated from ground they have nothing to do with

03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:48.360
earth ground so in some cases you could create a ground loop in there and they get wacky results

03:24:48.360 --> 03:24:55.400
with your equipment most commercial consumer industrial products are for the purposes of

03:24:55.400 --> 03:25:00.120
electrical safety that chassis will be a ground and that's connected also to earth ground question

03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:05.240
electrical ground can vary from whatever you want

03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:11.400
absolutely absolutely and that's one of the things that could be a real problem

03:25:11.400 --> 03:25:16.120
is you might think you get into a piece of equipment and say oh wow look at this big metal

03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:21.080
look at this big um if this was inside this is actually a dc power supply like we use in the lab

03:25:21.720 --> 03:25:27.720
okay this in the back here is a heat sink if this was installed inside some big piece of

03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:32.520
equipment like a radar system you see this metal you assume that oh this metal here that's that's

03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:39.000
that's ground that must be ground because it's metal right and all of a sudden you know you put

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:46.200
your hand on there you lean into it and you get electrocuted this in some cases could be electrically

03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:53.640
isolated from ground this could be connected to some big high power transmitter tube for the purpose

03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:58.040
of dissipating energy and it could actually have like that mica that i passed round earlier

03:25:58.600 --> 03:26:04.760
it could have a big sheet of that mica there electrically insulating it from the rest of

03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:09.880
the chassis or frame of the piece of equipment and that's taken out many a good technician

03:26:09.880 --> 03:26:16.440
so never assume never assume generally yes some of the worst shocking experiences i've ever had

03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:21.160
were working on a lot of tube circuits because sometimes those tube circuits were notorious

03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:26.360
for too prong old school tube amplifier you plug it in too prong and you didn't have that

03:26:26.360 --> 03:26:30.040
electrical ground in there all of a sudden you you go up against the chassis and you're getting

03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:41.560
getting zapped by 300 volts make sense all right we talked about current flow of electrons

03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:46.440
in a specified direction happens at the speed of light voltage and there's only six different

03:26:46.440 --> 03:26:52.120
methods of producing voltage friction magnetism chemicals light heat and pressure we talked about

03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:57.960
voltage rise that's the energy that we put into a circuit voltage drop is the voltage we get out

03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:03.080
of the circuit voltage rise and voltage drop should equal each other if they don't you got a problem

03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:10.360
am i being silly am i keeping it basic yeah but you know what i have fixed in my career dozens

03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:16.840
of problems that that was the symptom and the symptom is the equipment doesn't work right what's

03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:21.880
the first thing that i do check the voltage coming in if the voltage coming in isn't good

03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:27.080
it's not going to work right then you got to find out where the missing voltages maybe it's a brown

03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:32.680
out maybe it's a brown out maybe the power company they're having a problem with with with generating

03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:38.840
power and giving you know the feed but those two always need to equal each other we also talked

03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:46.600
about ground earth ground is a freaking rod driven into the earth why the earth well it's where we

03:27:46.600 --> 03:27:51.000
stand it's where we live it is what it is neutral natural state and we talked about electrical

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:58.040
ground which is typically the chassis could be the airframe of an airplane which is actually kind of

03:27:58.040 --> 03:28:03.080
odd it's kind of odd when they talk about an airplane because what's Boeing building now

03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:12.200
787 what's that thing made out of aluminum composite think about this one by using the

03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:17.160
chassis of your automobile as ground you know how much wiring it saves on your car

03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:23.560
go ahead make a stab at it you know how much how much wiring it saves on your car

03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:32.360
saves half the wiring if your car was made out of composites and it was not a conductive material

03:28:32.360 --> 03:28:38.520
you would have double the amount of wires on your car because we use the chassis as an electrical

03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:48.680
connection make sense okay i've got a question for you and i'm going to ask you about this uh in

03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:59.800
our next lecture and i want you to discuss this in teams and as a class since there are six different

03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:13.240
methods of producing voltage i am going to design a deep space probe to boldly go where no man has

03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:24.680
gone before so this deep space probe is going to probe deep space that's why it's called deep space

03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:37.800
probe what method should i use to power this thing in outer space so that it keeps going

03:29:37.800 --> 03:29:45.000
and going and going and sending data back to earth through a high power transmitter so we could we

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:51.320
could monitor its journey from afar i want you to think about this i want you to discuss it as teams

03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:57.800
in next week when we lecture on e-lc 110 i'm going to expect an answer from unit better b

03:29:57.800 --> 03:30:05.720
and the right answer they're all hell's going to break loose any questions question

03:30:06.440 --> 03:30:18.120
um

03:30:24.200 --> 03:30:28.120
radiating something absolutely

03:30:35.880 --> 03:30:39.720
sounds like you got some good ideas that are worth pursuing

03:30:42.920 --> 03:30:50.680
enough said we've got somebody in here that's thinking that's cool question how do you measure

03:30:50.680 --> 03:30:59.720
ground it is measured in ohms um what you do is you have to it's a comparative process of what

03:30:59.720 --> 03:31:09.320
you assume is a good ground and um you're basically comparing your ground unknown ground to that good

03:31:09.320 --> 03:31:17.400
ground but there's an assumption may made that by getting an eight foot long rod in in driving it in

03:31:17.400 --> 03:31:22.200
that that is providing you with an adequate adequate ground you need something else to compare it to

03:31:22.760 --> 03:31:32.440
in order for your assessment to be accurate what are you measuring it in reference to

03:31:41.720 --> 03:31:47.080
okay well you're doing from an electrical outlet if i wanted to verify that this is a good ground

03:31:47.800 --> 03:31:52.200
um in actuality what i need to do here is i could measure ground against my neutral

03:31:52.200 --> 03:32:00.040
those two should be connected back at that box okay so between the hot lead and ground

03:32:00.040 --> 03:32:04.520
in between the hot lead and neutral i should end up with the same difference in potential

03:32:04.520 --> 03:32:09.880
then going with a multimeter to that box i should get that same difference in potential across the

03:32:09.880 --> 03:32:14.760
two and that basically is letting me know that the ground and the neutral for that particular

03:32:14.760 --> 03:32:24.920
circuit are valid but for you to compare a good earth ground to a not so good earth ground

03:32:27.160 --> 03:32:30.840
i don't know how you'd go about that other than you you've got to you've got to basically know

03:32:30.840 --> 03:32:37.320
that one of them is is good and that's actually one of the things about ground too that um i don't

03:32:37.880 --> 03:32:47.480
any of you are aware a lot of am radio stations are located in swamp lands it's the best place

03:32:47.480 --> 03:32:54.120
that you could put an am radio station because in a swampy area you get a really good ground

03:32:54.760 --> 03:32:59.400
so you get a really good ground plane and because the frequencies that you radiate at

03:33:00.200 --> 03:33:07.080
it's going to ensure much better transmission of that rf signal a second choice is also a field

03:33:07.400 --> 03:33:15.160
a pasture where cows graze and urinate and keep everything nice and moist okay and healthy

03:33:15.960 --> 03:33:20.280
that's why even in new york city grown up in connectica all the new york city radio stations

03:33:20.280 --> 03:33:26.520
wabc wnbc wcbs all of their transmitters were located in new jersey the meadowlands

03:33:27.160 --> 03:33:31.880
okay if there's any giant fans here through all their transmitters were located why because it was

03:33:31.880 --> 03:33:38.440
a marshy location fm transmitters different if you're in new york city where do you want to

03:33:38.440 --> 03:33:44.600
put an fm transmitter top of the empire state building why because it's the highest it doesn't

03:33:44.600 --> 03:33:49.320
have as much to do you still need a good ground but it's not as essential as that low frequency

03:33:49.320 --> 03:33:54.360
transmitters so ground is important folks we're going to talk more about it we can have a course

03:33:54.360 --> 03:34:00.360
in ground we honestly could five credit class and just talk about ground testing processes um

03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:03.400
you know some of the some of the different things that that we've encountered with ground

03:34:04.200 --> 03:34:09.000
50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago ground wasn't that big of a deal ground right now is very

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:15.400
very big because a difference equates to a difference in potential and even a small difference in

03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:21.080
voltage could create could create a circuit it caused that circuit to go here's your final technical

03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:27.000
term for the night cattywampus all right all right it's all i got folks have a good

03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:35.480
okay let's get started chapter four chapter four

03:34:38.280 --> 03:34:41.160
just kind of as a review to get us up to speed with

03:34:45.240 --> 03:34:52.440
what we've talked about thus far we talked about the fundamental physics of electricity

03:34:52.920 --> 03:35:03.640
where does electricity come from and uh what subatomic properties mean to both materials

03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:13.800
the type of materials that we use in harnessing electricity and electronics and also how materials

03:35:13.800 --> 03:35:21.480
are affected when we apply energy to them when we apply energy to matter we could

03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:27.240
knock some electrons free from the valence shell when we knock those electrons free from

03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:34.680
the valence shell that represents potential energy right because we could uh we could direct

03:35:35.480 --> 03:35:42.680
those free electrons through a circuit and make them do some work for us right

03:35:43.400 --> 03:35:52.520
so we call that flow of electrons current current the flow of electrons in a specified

03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:59.400
direction and that specified direction is negative to positive and every 6.24 times 10 to the 18th

03:36:01.320 --> 03:36:09.000
electrons equals one coulomb one coulomb per second equals one ampere

03:36:09.400 --> 03:36:15.800
so we talked about current already the next thing we're going to talk about tonight

03:36:16.360 --> 03:36:26.920
chapter four is resistance or as the french would say resistance right i mean resistance

03:36:29.320 --> 03:36:35.560
and this is kind of easy to remember one of the questions that i'm going to ask you in the future

03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:44.600
in lecture is going to be what has resistance and the answer is easy everything has resistance

03:36:46.280 --> 03:36:53.320
everything some things have more resistance than others but basically everything has resistance

03:36:53.320 --> 03:37:00.920
there's only one thing that i'm aware of that doesn't have resistance and it only exists in a

03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:14.200
laboratory what am i talking about superconductor superconductor superconductivity is the utilization

03:37:14.200 --> 03:37:25.400
of materials that have no resistance zero resistance so once we get that stuff up and running once

03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:31.080
science masters that they're going to be dealing with materials that have no resistance

03:37:32.520 --> 03:37:36.920
that's going to revolutionize the industry because right now it's something we just got

03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:43.320
to deal with and there's a lot of losses associated with it the power companies would love to get a

03:37:43.320 --> 03:37:49.960
whole superconductivity at room temperature they'd love to harness that question

03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:57.560
do modern computers have superconductors no no it is not feasible right now for any

03:37:57.560 --> 03:38:06.360
everyday use it only exists in a laboratory at extremely cold temperatures the use of a cryogen

03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:12.920
cryogenics and believe it or not i shared with you right what what material are they having the

03:38:12.920 --> 03:38:23.640
best luck with ceramics who would have thunk ceramics ceramic a great insulator at room temperature

03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:29.960
but at these extremely cold temperatures some of these ceramics take on superconductive properties

03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:34.520
anyway we're not going to talk anymore about that i'd love to but we just don't have time

03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:39.480
what we've got to do is embark on our journey here chapter four resistance

03:38:39.480 --> 03:38:46.200
after completing this chapter you're going to be able to define resistance and explain its

03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:55.160
effect in a circuit determine the tolerance range of a resistor identify carbon composition

03:38:55.160 --> 03:39:04.280
wire wound and film resistors identify potentiometers and rheostats describe how a variable

03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:13.800
resistor operates decode a resistor's value using a color code or alphanumeric code

03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:20.520
identify the three types of resistor circuits and calculate out total resistance in series

03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:31.720
parallel and series parallel circuits resistance is the opposition to electron flow in a circuit

03:39:34.440 --> 03:39:41.800
what has resistance everything except superconductors everything everything has resistance

03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:49.640
if you went out and bought a new extension cord over the weekend even though you paid a lot of

03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:56.040
money and it's a really good high quality extension cord still has resistance if you went out and bought

03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:02.120
cable for your speakers you're rewiring your house and you're putting in some new speakers

03:40:02.120 --> 03:40:09.720
and you went out and got some of that monster cable cost your fortune still has resistance

03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:15.400
everything has resistance it's expressed by the symbol r

03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:26.840
it's measured in ohms ohms discovered by a guy by the name of john ohms

03:40:27.560 --> 03:40:37.640
abbreviated with the greek symbol omega the greek greek symbol omega

03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:46.360
and although everything has resistance the amount of resistance varies from material

03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:57.240
to material silver is the best meaning it has the least found in nature so if we if you went out

03:40:57.240 --> 03:41:03.480
the periodic table and played around with it and tried to find what materials on the periodic table

03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:13.800
you could find and which one had the least resistance it would be silver copper is the most common

03:41:13.800 --> 03:41:22.760
meaning it's really the cheapest even though it's expensive in the grand scheme of things that's why

03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:28.360
you got these people like cannibalizing stuff taking stuff apart to steal the freaking wire

03:41:29.960 --> 03:41:34.760
what took the cake was did you hear down in Tacoma a couple months ago they've got the uh

03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:38.600
that drawbridge that go down down by downtown Tacoma the big ships go underneath

03:41:39.320 --> 03:41:44.440
the cannibal they just got in there one night and they tore it all up the control panel it's

03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:50.280
gonna i don't know it's like millions of dollars to rebuild this thing and they just stole all the

03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:55.800
wire out of it gutted it and i just started turning into a recycling place yeah i got all this wire

03:41:57.080 --> 03:42:06.520
sure you know how much you're kidding

03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:15.160
huh that's nuts

03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:19.560
for legitimate people that's nuts

03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:26.120
now washington or oregon washington washington huh

03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:39.720
gold doesn't tarnish so although gold is not as good a conductor as silver by plating it

03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:46.200
by plating copper with gold then you get the best of both worlds you have something that

03:42:46.200 --> 03:42:52.360
doesn't tarnish because the problem with silver if any of you have any silver jewelry or silver

03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:58.760
wear about the same time you're done polishing it you need to polish it again because being exposed

03:42:58.760 --> 03:43:09.080
to oxygen oxidizes it gold that doesn't happen no oxidation means you get a superior connection

03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:17.400
when you use it as a termination on an electrical connector resistance is affected by temperature

03:43:17.480 --> 03:43:28.040
it is affected by temperature typically resistance has a positive temperature coefficient we call it

03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:34.280
positive temperature coefficient meaning as temperature increases the amount of resistance

03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:42.120
in a conductor increases which is a problem if you have an extension cord and it starts to get hot

03:43:43.080 --> 03:43:49.320
the extension cord is going to possess more resistance if it possesses more resistance that

03:43:49.320 --> 03:43:54.600
means less current makes it to your load and the extension cord is going to get even hotter if it

03:43:54.600 --> 03:43:59.480
gets even hotter its resistance is going to increase more limiting the amount of current even more

03:43:59.480 --> 03:44:03.400
that's going so that's where you end up with a vicious cycle you let that go on long enough you

03:44:03.400 --> 03:44:11.480
end up with an electrical fire so keep that in mind if you've got an extension cord or a cable

03:44:11.480 --> 03:44:22.760
that's getting warm getting hot it's a problem it's also affected by size size does matter

03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:29.560
when it comes to conductors basically the individual that has the thickest conductor

03:44:31.640 --> 03:44:37.400
will have the least amount of resistance so earlier in lecture when i said about connecting

03:44:37.400 --> 03:44:44.200
up your speakers using that monster cable if you really are using monster cable and that

03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:51.240
cable is really thick the thicker it is the least resistance it has the more energy you transfer

03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:58.920
from the source to the load from your amplifier to the speaker and that's a good thing so generally

03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:05.480
speaking you want to use the thickest conductor that you can afford or of course adhere to standard

03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:11.800
manufacturing processes and there's tables that you could find that show specifically

03:45:11.800 --> 03:45:14.920
what is required electrical code dictates that

03:45:17.160 --> 03:45:22.520
in your home the majority of circuits in your home are 15 amp circuits they can handle up the

03:45:22.520 --> 03:45:30.200
15 amps standard electric code code dictates that you need to use at least 14 gauge wire for those

03:45:30.200 --> 03:45:36.520
circuits for 20 amp circuits you have some 20 amp circuits in your in your house maybe in your

03:45:36.520 --> 03:45:42.600
kitchen or out in your garage your workroom your utility room electrical code dictates that you

03:45:42.600 --> 03:45:50.920
have 12 gauge wire minimum that means that the wire is thick enough to support the flow of 20 amps

03:45:50.920 --> 03:46:01.560
of current resistivity is the resistance of a material to current flow resistivity is going to

03:46:01.560 --> 03:46:11.240
be different for different materials even good conductors have different levels of resistivity

03:46:11.240 --> 03:46:25.080
here is a table that shows us the resistivity and what we use as a benchmark is the resistivity of

03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:33.080
silver there's a lot of things in science that we we do like this one we were talking about last

03:46:33.080 --> 03:46:39.720
week remember i talked about specific gravity remember specific gravity specific gravity

03:46:39.720 --> 03:46:48.280
is a benchmark that we use with fluids and we compare everything to the specific gravity

03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:56.200
of pure water h2o at room temperature typically 65 degrees standard temperature

03:46:57.080 --> 03:47:01.080
and we say that it has a specific gravity of 1.000

03:47:01.880 --> 03:47:14.760
in dealing with conductors we use resistivity which compares resistivity to that to the best known

03:47:14.760 --> 03:47:22.520
conductor that we have found in nature which is silver so we say that resistivity has a or excuse

03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:39.240
resistivity of 1.000 copper 1.0625 lead 1.370 gold 1.5

03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:49.720
and you can see the rest of the table there this compares all resistivity of all materials so silver

03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:57.080
has the least resistance it's the best so therefore it has a resistivity we use as a benchmark of 1.000

03:47:57.080 --> 03:48:02.600
so do you understand the difference between resistivity and resistance

03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:12.280
resistance is measured in ohms resistivity compares everything to silver

03:48:12.760 --> 03:48:23.880
conductance the ability of a material to pass electrons conductance

03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:32.280
it's expressed as the capital letter g and believe it or not i'm not making this up

03:48:32.760 --> 03:48:43.720
the unit that we measure this in is called the mo mho its ohms felt backwards and that's not by a

03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:50.360
mistake basically the dude that came up with this said i'm going to spell ohm backwards take the

03:48:50.360 --> 03:48:57.560
reciprocal of resistance and call it the mo and see if that makes the textbooks well it made the

03:48:57.560 --> 03:49:07.720
textbooks but it's not the unit of measure that we've adopted for measuring resistance

03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:14.760
it is the unit we measure conductance with it's abbreviated with the greek symbol

03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:21.240
it should be an upside down omega i don't know why it gives me like an orthodox cross

03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:29.240
but since that orthodox cross appeared on my slide i'm not inclined to remove it if you

03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:36.040
know what i mean it's it may be a sign but all this should be as an upside down omega

03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:43.640
a guide by the name of seamans came up with this have any of you heard of seamans before seamans

03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:51.160
corporation well this was like great great great granddad seamans and he made the textbooks by

03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:56.920
playing around with electrical properties and the rest of that company of course is history

03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:03.560
and what seamans said i guess he was in a big argument with ohm back in the day

03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:11.720
ohm said we should measure the materials all for their resistance seamans said no we

03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:14.520
shouldn't we should measure it all for their conductance

03:50:14.520 --> 03:50:23.160
resistance is measured in ohms seamans is like uh conductance is measured in

03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:31.400
mose it's ohms spelt backwards well how do you calculate it well it's real simple what you do

03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:39.960
here is you take the reciprocal of resistance one over resistance equals conductance i mean i

03:50:39.960 --> 03:50:46.120
guess the guy said this to his face with a straight face so what do you say the answer

03:50:46.120 --> 03:50:51.400
is you know i say the answer is a thousand ohms well one divided by a thousand well that's how

03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:58.040
many mose i think it is and actually since it's thousands of ohms taking the reciprocal of it

03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:08.040
means that most of our answers will actually be in millie mose millie mose or micro mose

03:51:09.720 --> 03:51:18.200
you can't make this stuff up it used to be that i put out in lecture you will never see a

03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:27.960
conductivity meter anytime i put out any absolutes in lecture somebody feels compelled to prove the

03:51:27.960 --> 03:51:34.360
prof wrong so i stated you will never see a conductivity meter and then almost immediately

03:51:34.360 --> 03:51:40.920
i had a student of my class raise their hand it said i use one every day at work really i've

03:51:40.920 --> 03:51:46.600
never seen one in my life where do you work and the individual worked actually at a water treatment

03:51:46.600 --> 03:51:53.880
facility a water treatment facility and what they use the conductivity meter for

03:51:54.040 --> 03:52:04.680
or literally is to see how much stuff is left over in the water after they treat the water

03:52:05.800 --> 03:52:14.920
because i don't know if any of you realize this is water a conductor or is it an insulator

03:52:24.120 --> 03:52:36.520
very good very good pure water h2o pure water

03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:43.240
basically is an insulator current will not pass through pure water

03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:50.680
so if i'm in my hot tub filled with pure water my neighbor's wife comes over and joins me

03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:57.640
and my wife comes home this is why you look comfortable in there would you like a piece of

03:52:57.640 --> 03:53:04.760
toast and throws a toaster oven that's plugged in provided the tub was filled with pure water

03:53:04.760 --> 03:53:13.400
h2o it wouldn't be a shocking experience but due to the fact that my water chemistry actually if

03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:18.280
i get in the tub there's going to be salts and oils from my body that are going to contaminate that

03:53:18.280 --> 03:53:21.720
and immediately take that pure water into the conductive realm

03:53:23.720 --> 03:53:29.400
so again the conductivity meter that my former student was using was to measure the conductivity

03:53:29.400 --> 03:53:33.080
of the water the more stuff you have in the water the more conductive it's going to be

03:53:36.040 --> 03:53:42.760
i had a terrible bout of um bronchitis several years ago the flu with bronchitis

03:53:42.760 --> 03:53:49.080
was terrible the verge of pneumonia was coughing fever felt miserable got up went to the doctor

03:53:50.360 --> 03:53:54.440
it's in the middle of winter you know how dry our air gets in our homes in the middle of winter

03:53:54.440 --> 03:54:00.760
he recommended i go and get one of those humidifiers fill it up with water plug it in makes humidity

03:54:01.400 --> 03:54:02.520
puts humidity in the air

03:54:05.960 --> 03:54:11.800
so i stopped that wall green picked one up brought it home it didn't even have an on off switch

03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:17.800
you know it's just a tank of water you put the thing on you plug it in and it puts humidity

03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:24.840
into the air how tough can this be so i mustered every ounce of courage that i had because i really

03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:32.600
felt like i was dying filled the thing up with water climbed under my covers and i'm looking at

03:54:32.600 --> 03:54:40.840
the thing sitting over on my uh on my uh nightstand and it's just sitting there so i look at the clock

03:54:40.840 --> 03:54:47.400
and i continue to watch it nothing's happening i'm like you've got to be kidding me okay this

03:54:47.400 --> 03:54:54.120
thing's busted or worse yet i got to read the owner's manual on something that doesn't even

03:54:54.120 --> 03:54:59.320
have an on off switch so i go ahead and i open the owner's manual i'm reading it and stuff

03:54:59.320 --> 03:55:03.960
and they say right in there if you plug this in and it doesn't produce steam

03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:10.840
in a certain number of minutes i think it was five minutes your your water may be too soft

03:55:13.400 --> 03:55:22.040
and add no more than an eighth of a teaspoon of salt to the two and a half gallons in the tank

03:55:23.160 --> 03:55:28.040
any more than this could corrode the electrodes blah blah blah blah blah blah so i'm like you know

03:55:29.160 --> 03:55:33.000
i'll read the instructions i'll follow the instructions but i don't think an eighth of

03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:36.760
a teaspoon of salt in two and a half gallons is going to make much of a difference

03:55:38.360 --> 03:55:42.040
so i got an eighth of a teaspoon which is a pinch i mean that's just a pinch of salt

03:55:42.760 --> 03:55:48.440
put it in there plug the thing in got back under the covers by the time i was tucked in under the

03:55:48.440 --> 03:55:54.680
covers i look over to think steams steams pouring out of it that small amount of impurity was enough

03:55:54.680 --> 03:55:59.720
to make that water conductive because those don't boil the water what they physically do their

03:55:59.720 --> 03:56:07.720
electrodes and they flash it to steam so its operation is contingent on having water that

03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.640
has some impurities in it that being said what does this say about our water tap water here in

03:56:11.640 --> 03:56:21.880
western washington really good water what's that really where where where do you where are you that

03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:28.520
you don't think the water is that good all right they're getting a little slew out there don't they

03:56:29.720 --> 03:56:37.720
also depends on which side of red in here generally speaking though here yeah generally speaking here

03:56:37.720 --> 03:56:42.440
in western washington in the northwest in general we have pretty good water um if any of you've ever

03:56:42.440 --> 03:56:47.480
lived in southern california i mean i'm by i was buying bottled water back there before bottled

03:56:47.480 --> 03:56:52.520
water was in vogue you know i was buying bottled water because it tasted like it it didn't have

03:56:52.520 --> 03:57:00.360
a taste to it that was super hard yeah um in the midwest i mean you know i stayed with a cousin of

03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:05.800
mine that lives in missouri once and you know get the water softener you got like stalactites and

03:57:05.800 --> 03:57:10.440
stalagmites in the shower you know because all the minerals that are you know i mean it's just

03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:15.880
crazy stuff it's very hard on plumbing i grew up in the east coast actually an artesian well well

03:57:15.880 --> 03:57:22.440
water until the city came in and finally you know put but water was perfect so to some areas of

03:57:22.440 --> 03:57:29.320
country that are really bad but keep that in mind pure water h2o is an insulator so we have to add

03:57:29.320 --> 03:57:40.520
some impurities to it to be able to convert it now everything has resistance but we in electricity

03:57:40.520 --> 03:57:47.480
and electronics have a component that is designed to have this property of resistance and amazingly

03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:57.640
enough you know what they call it the resistor so a resistor is a specific device designed to

03:57:57.640 --> 03:58:05.480
possess the property of resistance it's designed to have resistance it's designed to possess a specific

03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:14.840
value of resistance that's predictable comes in two different classifications one is a fixed value

03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:26.600
meaning what you see is what you get and the other is a variable value variable meaning we can adjust it

03:58:26.840 --> 03:58:35.000
variety of shapes and sizes to meet specific circuit space and operating requirements

03:58:37.400 --> 03:58:40.680
so there are all kinds of resistors on the market

03:58:45.480 --> 03:58:49.640
these components all have a tolerance associated with them

03:58:50.280 --> 03:58:56.520
them tolerance is the amount that the resistor may vary and still be acceptable

03:59:02.440 --> 03:59:06.360
the larger the tolerance typically the cheaper it is to manufacture

03:59:09.160 --> 03:59:16.520
now believe it or not in electronic components we could have values of tolerances that go

03:59:16.520 --> 03:59:23.160
anywhere from plus or minus 20 percent 10 percent five two one percent but 20 percent

03:59:23.160 --> 03:59:29.560
can you imagine that everybody get their taxes in on time how do you think that would go over here

03:59:29.560 --> 03:59:35.800
irs uh you know i did my taxes and i think they're accurate within 20 percent i think that'd go over

03:59:35.800 --> 03:59:43.400
pretty big what about if your employer said you know here's your paycheck on friday but

03:59:44.200 --> 03:59:50.840
uh plus or minus 20 percent we're not really sure if it's accurate plus or minus 20 and if you're on

03:59:50.840 --> 04:00:00.760
the plus side cool but if you're on the negative 20 it's no either plus plus 20 or minus 20 but

04:00:00.760 --> 04:00:07.160
it's a difference yeah it well i don't even know if it's a difference of 40 percent is it i guess it

04:00:07.160 --> 04:00:16.280
would be yeah but the way we say it so we're allowed plus 20 or minus 20 but it's a difference

04:00:16.280 --> 04:00:21.880
yeah you know if you had a if you've got a hundred ohm resistor keep the math simple right

04:00:21.880 --> 04:00:27.560
that means that that resistor out of the package could be anywhere from 80 to 120 ohms

04:00:28.920 --> 04:00:35.080
and it's still okay you got what you paid for so it's kind of wacky thing here because

04:00:35.480 --> 04:00:41.480
i make you follow all these procedures and policies here dot your eyes cross your t's make sure your

04:00:41.480 --> 04:00:46.840
paperwork is accurate you're answering to your team lead the class lead we have all this protocol

04:00:46.840 --> 04:00:52.680
here and everything i expect your answers to be very very accurate but when you get over here to

04:00:52.680 --> 04:00:55.960
the lab when you get out into industry you're going to find that you're working with components that

04:00:55.960 --> 04:01:04.040
have tolerances up to plus or minus 20 percent very very frustrating it's actually one of the

04:01:04.040 --> 04:01:09.800
challenges that i had in this industry because in here everything we talk about is theoretical

04:01:09.800 --> 04:01:18.520
perfect in industry it's a plus or minus 20 percent and it's okay it's okay

04:01:22.680 --> 04:01:26.920
so keep that in mind when you're when you're working with any of these components

04:01:27.160 --> 04:01:36.520
some of the different types of resistors we have molded carbon resistors that are made out of

04:01:37.320 --> 04:01:46.600
carbon that is molded it's the most commonly used it's inexpensive and it's manufactured in

04:01:46.600 --> 04:01:52.680
standard resistor values by standard resistor values what i'm talking about you know like how

04:01:52.680 --> 04:02:00.520
tires come in different sizes you know you i mean i'm sure you could if you wanted to go take a

04:02:00.520 --> 04:02:06.200
machine class and then make your own wheels on a lathe or whatever on a milling machine down here

04:02:06.200 --> 04:02:11.640
you could make your own wheel whatever size you want knock yourself out you could make your own

04:02:11.640 --> 04:02:16.360
wheel can you find a tire that's going to fit your wheel probably the first thing that you would do

04:02:16.360 --> 04:02:21.880
is look and see what standard tire values are and then make a wheel if you're going to make a custom

04:02:21.880 --> 04:02:25.560
wheel that fits standard tire sizes because you're going to end up making a wheel that you can't even

04:02:25.560 --> 04:02:30.360
find a tire for it makes sense so resistors are the same thing when we say they come in standard

04:02:30.360 --> 04:02:39.560
sizes they come in standard sizes don't expect to go out and find a 103.5 ohm resistor

04:02:41.880 --> 04:02:48.120
don't expect to find that on the market you could go buy a package of resistors that are

04:02:48.120 --> 04:02:54.280
100 ohm resistors that are plus or minus 10% and start going through and see if you could find one

04:02:54.280 --> 04:03:01.720
that's 103.5 but an engineer is never going to specify and say i want 103.5 ohm resistor in the

04:03:01.720 --> 04:03:11.960
circuit they'll say i want 100 ohm resistor standard sizes another type of resistor manufacturing

04:03:11.960 --> 04:03:19.400
process comes up with what's called a wire wound resistor these are used in high current circuits

04:03:20.120 --> 04:03:34.520
and they are made out of wire that is wound because we know that wire has resistance so

04:03:34.760 --> 04:03:40.760
if i get a certain amount of wire in one turn then i can make another turn and get

04:03:42.200 --> 04:03:45.240
twice the amount and it's literally how it works

04:03:48.440 --> 04:03:54.680
the resistance of these varies from a fraction of an ohm to several thousand ohms question

04:04:05.240 --> 04:04:13.560
it could change over time it could typically it's going to stay pretty close to what it was

04:04:13.560 --> 04:04:18.680
but again since these heat up things could change in the composition of it and alter its

04:04:18.680 --> 04:04:24.840
characteristics but that's not a big factor to worry about there's a lot more components

04:04:24.840 --> 04:04:29.480
in electronics that are a lot more sensitive than resistors good question

04:04:35.000 --> 04:04:43.800
yeah um the question is do tolerances add up is there a cumulative effect yes

04:04:44.360 --> 04:04:49.640
i worked um as a contract employee for a biomedical company before i came to tea chair

04:04:49.640 --> 04:04:55.640
at lake washington you know 20 plus years ago and this um unmentioned biomedical company i was

04:04:55.640 --> 04:05:00.360
working on this product and it was pretty expensive motherboard and um

04:05:03.640 --> 04:05:08.840
every component this board kicked my butt i could fix these boards pretty much you know

04:05:08.840 --> 04:05:12.920
a lot of them were common problems i'd look at the symptoms you know kind of hold it to

04:05:12.920 --> 04:05:19.240
my forehead let me guess resistors you know our r 22 needs to be replaced i'd replace it

04:05:19.240 --> 04:05:26.840
fired up the thing works okay i had this one board that i couldn't fix i just could not fix it

04:05:26.840 --> 04:05:32.120
and when i looked and evaluated the integrity of every component every component was within

04:05:32.120 --> 04:05:37.480
tolerances but when you put it all together one tolerance was pulling it this way another

04:05:37.480 --> 04:05:41.960
tolerance was pulling it that way when you put it all together the board would not work it was

04:05:41.960 --> 04:05:48.200
an anomaly because everything individually functioned and i kind of got in trouble over it

04:05:48.200 --> 04:05:53.320
it was kind of like my ego like i'm not going to let no stink and board kick my butt and um

04:05:53.320 --> 04:05:59.320
believe it or not this company had it figured out where every circuit board a technician was allowed

04:05:59.320 --> 04:06:05.720
allotted basically 0.65 hours to troubleshoot it so what i would do is if i was given a big

04:06:05.720 --> 04:06:11.000
production run to do on racks what i would go through is fix all the easy problems first

04:06:11.000 --> 04:06:15.000
and then go to the next easiest problems and work my way so that when i was done i had all

04:06:15.000 --> 04:06:19.640
the real difficult problems left and then i'd look and see how much time i had left statistically

04:06:20.360 --> 04:06:23.720
see a lot of a lot of you i don't even think realize that this is how you're

04:06:23.720 --> 04:06:28.360
met you're measured when you get to industry they know exactly how long it takes to fix this board

04:06:29.160 --> 04:06:33.480
okay so if it takes you if it's 0.65 hours and it takes you three hours you're gonna have a

04:06:33.480 --> 04:06:37.560
discussion with the boss you're in the wrong profession you're in the wrong so anyway i knocked

04:06:37.560 --> 04:06:42.280
out all my boards and i ended up with like four days left so i could go take breaks for four days

04:06:42.280 --> 04:06:47.720
goof off and still end up statistically ahead of the game but i want that to fix this board i ended

04:06:47.720 --> 04:06:51.960
up screwing around with this board for two and a half two and a half days and then finally you

04:06:51.960 --> 04:06:57.160
know my boss saw that you know i'm all i don't have a lot of boards i'm on what are you doing

04:06:57.160 --> 04:07:00.280
i'm working on this board since kicking my butt you know i've been working on it two and a half

04:07:00.280 --> 04:07:04.840
day two and a half days you know got the thing through to cross the freaking floor we're not

04:07:04.840 --> 04:07:09.640
paying you to screw with that and i never was able to fix it but what it was again were tolerances

04:07:10.200 --> 04:07:13.960
pulling in different directions so sometimes you could have something that individually

04:07:13.960 --> 04:07:17.640
everything is functional you put it together as integrated as a system just doesn't work why

04:07:18.200 --> 04:07:20.600
because of what you said tyler's just pulling in different directions

04:07:26.520 --> 04:07:29.080
you know it's probably more common than we think

04:07:30.840 --> 04:07:35.480
but yeah generally speaking it's it's uncommon one of the and that's why i'm not mentioning the

04:07:35.480 --> 04:07:42.840
name of this company one of the things that they did is the majority of boards that were rejected

04:07:42.840 --> 04:07:49.560
were because of this capacitor that they use 20 percent tolerance capacitors and the circuit would

04:07:49.560 --> 04:07:56.680
not tolerate that it had to be right in the zone so what i would do is i would go to stores and i'd

04:07:56.680 --> 04:08:03.400
get a bin of capacitors i'd sit there and then i would test every one and basically sort from

04:08:03.400 --> 04:08:08.760
20 percent tolerance to like a five percent tolerance and keep those capacitors so when i

04:08:08.760 --> 04:08:12.040
ran into that problem i would just unsotter that cap with the new cap in

04:08:12.920 --> 04:08:16.920
wrote it you know employees wrote a beneficial suggestion that a company saying you know why

04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:22.200
don't we just buy five percent tolerance capacitors and all these things wouldn't have to be reworked

04:08:22.200 --> 04:08:25.720
you know you don't know what you're talking about you know just do your own job or whatever

04:08:25.720 --> 04:08:29.400
instead of looking at the big peter i think it was like in a production manager i think his brother

04:08:29.400 --> 04:08:33.560
in law sold cheap capacitors for a living or something and he was buying them by the semi load

04:08:33.560 --> 04:08:39.960
or it just made no sense it just made apps it is a biome is a well-known biomedical company

04:08:39.960 --> 04:08:45.400
it's kind of like why are you doing this why not just use a tight tolerance component to begin with

04:08:45.400 --> 04:08:50.200
and avoid somebody having to solder and unsotter and you know repair these boards it's costing them

04:08:50.200 --> 04:08:59.240
a ton of money but what do i know film resistors are becoming increasingly popular there's three

04:08:59.240 --> 04:09:07.000
different types carbon film metal film and tin oxide film and by film what we mean is a manufacturing

04:09:07.000 --> 04:09:14.360
process that lays down a thin film of this material on a substrate and then that becomes the resistive

04:09:14.360 --> 04:09:24.040
material so it's um some of the manufacturing processes actually are on par with manufacturing

04:09:24.040 --> 04:09:30.360
solid state semiconductor devices surface mount resistors ideal for small circuit applications

04:09:30.360 --> 04:09:36.360
available in both thick and thin film if you're working with surface mount resistors and you

04:09:36.360 --> 04:09:43.640
have a package open and you sneeze they're gone so don't sneeze near a package of open because

04:09:43.640 --> 04:09:49.160
these are tiny these are some of these are almost the size of a head of a pin tiny tiny components

04:09:49.400 --> 04:09:55.960
that's what goes into making your cell phones and digital watches and tv's on your wrist that you

04:09:55.960 --> 04:10:06.680
could watch and all of that kind of stuff we also have variable resistors variable resistors allow

04:10:06.680 --> 04:10:20.200
resistance to vary both linear and logarithmically linear and logarithmically when i say linear do

04:10:20.200 --> 04:10:32.920
you know what i'm talking about linear linear means a straight line so if i if i have something on a

04:10:32.920 --> 04:10:39.480
linear scale if i adjust if i adjust it a little bit i get a little bit of response if i go to 100

04:10:39.480 --> 04:10:45.880
percent i get 100 percent if i go to 50 percent i get half if i go to 25 percent i get a quarter

04:10:47.560 --> 04:10:55.560
make sense that's linear it's a straight line logarithmically is on a curve it's on a logarithmic

04:10:55.560 --> 04:11:02.840
curve so if i turn a little bit i'm not necessarily it's it's it the whole response is on a curve

04:11:04.200 --> 04:11:10.040
so anybody know why we would want to have a control that is not linear that intentionally puts

04:11:10.040 --> 04:11:25.400
things on a curve for us very good logarithmic is used for audio

04:11:25.480 --> 04:11:36.360
applications because audio is not linear audio is not linear audio some of you may be aware is

04:11:36.360 --> 04:11:45.320
measured in decibels and that's on a logarithmic scale so if you want to control something that is

04:11:45.320 --> 04:11:52.840
non-linear you need to use a control that's non-linear and audio is that example so that's

04:11:52.840 --> 04:12:01.800
why we have this logarithmic control one of the things if you're shopping for these variable

04:12:01.800 --> 04:12:09.400
resistors you may also see it say audio on the box because it's for use with audio so volume control

04:12:09.400 --> 04:12:16.120
on a radio on a stereo would be a logarithmic control because it's controlling something that is

04:12:16.120 --> 04:12:21.720
non-linear and what we're trying to do is get somewhat of a linear response out of it right

04:12:21.800 --> 04:12:25.640
when you turn the volume all the way up to a hundred percent you expect to get a hundred percent

04:12:25.640 --> 04:12:31.160
when you turn to fifty percent you expect to get fifty percent but since audio is not a linear

04:12:31.160 --> 04:12:37.640
we need to use a logarithmic control to get a linear type response make sense

04:12:41.560 --> 04:12:50.840
these variable resistors when they're configured as a potentiometer potentiometer

04:12:50.840 --> 04:13:03.720
or pot also known as pot a pot when we configure it to control voltage we call it a potentiometer

04:13:05.400 --> 04:13:10.600
and i'll show you how we do that in a second but i want you first to hit the i believe button

04:13:11.560 --> 04:13:16.520
what type of a device do we use to control voltage variable resistor do we use to control voltage

04:13:16.520 --> 04:13:27.640
the answer is potentiometer when we use a variable resistor to control current we call it a rheostat

04:13:30.680 --> 04:13:32.360
we call it a rheostat

04:13:37.080 --> 04:13:39.080
and basically the way that this thing works

04:13:46.600 --> 04:13:57.400
what i just illustrated here on the board is a resistor right and what i've got here

04:13:59.320 --> 04:14:09.960
is i've got terminal a and i've got terminal b when i put my meter across terminal a and b

04:14:09.960 --> 04:14:18.440
what am i going to what am i going to measure the resistance the resistance between a and

04:14:19.160 --> 04:14:28.680
b the total resistance you all agree with me with that okay so if i go ahead now and connect this

04:14:28.680 --> 04:14:33.400
up to a circuit

04:14:40.040 --> 04:14:47.800
this is the negative terminal this is the positive terminal okay current is going to want to flow

04:14:50.520 --> 04:14:56.040
in a counterclockwise direction here and it's going to flow through this resistor

04:14:56.040 --> 04:15:03.400
and when it encounters this resistance it's going to limit how much current flows through this circuit

04:15:04.440 --> 04:15:08.360
do you agree with me with that okay

04:15:12.280 --> 04:15:21.800
so if i go ahead now this is a this is a fixed resistor if i go ahead and turn this into a

04:15:21.800 --> 04:15:26.120
variable resistor a variable resistor has a third lead on it

04:15:30.440 --> 04:15:31.800
and i'll label this this

04:15:35.880 --> 04:15:43.480
terminal c so i have between a and b is my total resistance and then i have

04:15:43.800 --> 04:15:53.400
c and what this is is a wiper arm this is a wiper arm and physically what it's going to do is move

04:15:53.960 --> 04:16:00.040
up and down and come in contact with either more resistive material or less resistive material

04:16:00.040 --> 04:16:07.560
it all depends on your perspective if i have this adjusted right now smack dab in the middle

04:16:08.200 --> 04:16:10.840
how much resistance do i have between a and c

04:16:15.000 --> 04:16:25.000
half how much resistance do i have between c and b half if i adjusted just just barely touch it just

04:16:25.000 --> 04:16:35.480
a little bit now i'm 49 percent on one side 51 on the other tweak it more i'm 40 60 right

04:16:35.480 --> 04:16:41.960
80 20 90 10 99 1

04:16:44.200 --> 04:16:48.120
so i'm i'm moving this wiper arm coming in contact with a different amount of

04:16:48.120 --> 04:16:53.640
resistive material i'll agree with that does that make sense okay now in this particular

04:16:53.640 --> 04:16:58.840
configuration i could move this wiper arm up and down all day long am i going to have any effect

04:16:58.920 --> 04:17:01.800
on current flowing through the circuit why

04:17:04.760 --> 04:17:11.240
it's just flowing between point a and point c excuse me point a and point b point c is

04:17:11.240 --> 04:17:15.640
effectively not even part of the path so i can move that wiper arm hey look mom

04:17:17.160 --> 04:17:19.480
right nothing's going to change nothing's going to happen

04:17:19.640 --> 04:17:23.800
now what if

04:17:26.440 --> 04:17:28.440
what if i break this connection here

04:17:30.840 --> 04:17:36.600
and come and move this and connect to point c directly

04:17:41.480 --> 04:17:44.040
now what's going to happen when i move that wiper arm

04:17:44.440 --> 04:17:55.640
what's that total resistance is going to change in the circuit absolutely if i adjust this thing

04:17:55.640 --> 04:18:02.120
all the way to the end right here i may have what 100 percent

04:18:04.120 --> 04:18:07.960
well if i move it all the way here and it's not in contact with any any resistance 100

04:18:08.040 --> 04:18:14.120
percent current flow zero resistance or as close to zero as i could get

04:18:15.000 --> 04:18:20.280
when i move the wiper arm all the way to the bottom here now i get 100 percent resistance

04:18:21.320 --> 04:18:26.520
minimum current flow so literally when i'm adjusting this wiper arm here i'm adjusting

04:18:26.520 --> 04:18:34.280
the amount of you said current in the circuit so i've got this configured right now is what

04:18:34.520 --> 04:18:45.080
a real stat a real stat so when i'm using only two terminals of a three terminal device i've

04:18:45.080 --> 04:18:51.880
got it configured as a real stat when i adjust my wiper arm i'm literally adjusting the total

04:18:51.880 --> 04:18:56.600
amount of resistance and that total amount of resistance is going to affect the total amount

04:18:56.600 --> 04:19:06.360
of current flowing in that circuit makes sense i'm going to disconnect this

04:19:11.080 --> 04:19:18.440
reconnect this and let's assume that i'm going to have make another connection over here

04:19:19.240 --> 04:19:21.480
and this is going to be a voltmeter

04:19:25.000 --> 04:19:31.160
i'm going to connect a voltmeter between a and c and i'm going to connect a voltmeter

04:19:31.160 --> 04:19:36.760
another voltmeter why because they're cheap right between b and c

04:19:41.000 --> 04:19:47.640
when i have this adjusted smack dab in the middle what voltage am i going to get across this

04:19:47.720 --> 04:19:55.480
voltmeter half i like you you keep it a basic half that's why i want you to keep it you know

04:19:55.480 --> 04:19:59.080
i asked that question i see somebody going for their calculator you know it's i haven't given

04:19:59.080 --> 04:20:03.240
you any numbers you can't calculate this one if i've got it set smack dab in the middle i'm

04:20:03.240 --> 04:20:09.400
going to get half my voltage here which means i'm going to get my other half voltage down the bottom

04:20:10.120 --> 04:20:14.840
okay so if this is 10 volts i get five volts here and five volts here

04:20:16.840 --> 04:20:28.360
as soon as i begin to move that wiper arm slightly now i'm that 51 49 60 40 but i'm not

04:20:28.360 --> 04:20:37.000
talking about resistance now i'm talking about what voltage so when i connect all three i could

04:20:37.000 --> 04:20:43.720
use this as a voltage divider a hundred percent of the voltage it gets applied between a and b gets

04:20:43.720 --> 04:20:50.040
divided proportionally between the wiper arm and the outer terminals

04:20:52.200 --> 04:20:58.520
when i have it configured like this and i'm dividing voltage or controlling voltage we call that a

04:21:00.600 --> 04:21:04.920
potentiometer this is how the volume control on your stereo is connected

04:21:04.920 --> 04:21:13.720
this is basically what you're doing and that voltage that voltage that you're controlling

04:21:13.720 --> 04:21:20.440
is going typically to a transistor and it's telling that transistor here's more voltage i want you

04:21:20.440 --> 04:21:28.040
to amplify more and make the music louder or turn it down and make the music softer i'm going to give

04:21:28.040 --> 04:21:36.040
you less voltage to the amplifier the transistor this is how it works so keep that in mind that's

04:21:36.040 --> 04:21:43.400
how that's how we say we're either controlling current or or voltage could i use a potentiometer

04:21:43.400 --> 04:21:49.960
as a real stat how would i do that

04:21:52.840 --> 04:22:01.080
only connect two of the terminals so if you go to radio shack and say do you have any real stats

04:22:01.080 --> 04:22:05.320
here that would be a fun question i should give you that as an out of class assignment everybody

04:22:05.320 --> 04:22:11.000
go to radio shack and ask if you got any real stats and they'd probably scratch their head and bring

04:22:11.000 --> 04:22:17.320
you know but we have some potentiometers you could use a potentiometer as a real stat you only

04:22:17.320 --> 04:22:27.160
need to connect to the terminals if you went out and bought special ordered a real stat and it came

04:22:27.160 --> 04:22:35.320
in the box and it said real stat could you use a real stat as a potentiometer if it only came

04:22:35.320 --> 04:22:42.840
with two terminals now you need that third terminal to be able to divide the voltage make sense

04:22:46.120 --> 04:22:52.760
okay resistor identification there's a couple different methods that we use to identify resistors

04:22:55.240 --> 04:22:58.200
does anybody know the easiest method of identifying resistors

04:22:59.160 --> 04:23:11.640
i love it now the easiest method is when they put the value right on the outside of it with numbers

04:23:11.640 --> 04:23:17.400
and letters i always sucker people in with that one because everybody knows resistor color code

04:23:17.400 --> 04:23:21.400
now the easiest method is is really when they use numbers and letters and they just say if it's like

04:23:21.400 --> 04:23:27.480
a 1000 ohm resistor you know one k ohm it's right in there in black and white you read it you're

04:23:27.480 --> 04:23:38.120
good to go another method that they use is alpha numeric code and for a lot of these resistors you're

04:23:38.120 --> 04:23:45.640
going to have to like a secret agent use a decoder ring or decoder chart to figure out exactly what

04:23:45.640 --> 04:23:54.920
the code means the third easiest method is the color code and of course you can't have a successful

04:23:54.920 --> 04:23:59.560
career in electronics unless you understand the color code first thing we're going to take a look

04:23:59.560 --> 04:24:09.400
at here is the alpha numeric code if you looked at a small resistor and it had an rn 60d 5 1 1 2 f

04:24:09.400 --> 04:24:19.960
on it and you came up to me and you said hey joe what kind of a component is this i would probably

04:24:20.040 --> 04:24:27.400
hold my head and say i have no freaking idea what you're going to have to do is you're going to have

04:24:27.400 --> 04:24:35.320
to call up this code and decipher it if you work at a company this is one of the things

04:24:35.320 --> 04:24:40.120
this is a very difficult judge tough job i got i got to train all of you generically but what

04:24:40.120 --> 04:24:44.360
happens is when you go to your specific industries you're going to see some of the same components

04:24:44.360 --> 04:24:47.720
day in and day out day in because you're going to get used to your company's product line

04:24:47.960 --> 04:24:53.720
but here it's very difficult i'm teaching you generic electronics and there's a lot of different

04:24:53.720 --> 04:24:59.800
schemes that are you know that they use this is one of them so the rn 60 identifies the

04:24:59.800 --> 04:25:10.840
resistor style what what is it carbon comp wire wound film the d are its temperature characteristics

04:25:11.560 --> 04:25:16.120
how does this behave and they'll normally include some tables or charts in there to say

04:25:16.120 --> 04:25:22.680
you know for every five degrees rise in Fahrenheit this is how many ohms it's going to change so

04:25:22.680 --> 04:25:33.000
it's going to be its temperature characteristics question yes yeah no don't memorize this the

04:25:33.000 --> 04:25:40.600
point of this is that you're dead in water unless you get the code the five one one two that shows

04:25:40.680 --> 04:25:50.040
the resistance value the five one one the two represents the number of zeros at the end so this

04:25:50.040 --> 04:25:58.120
would be five one one zero zero putting that most common terms be fifty one point one k ohms

04:25:59.640 --> 04:26:03.560
fifty one thousand one hundred ohms and the tolerance would be f

04:26:04.440 --> 04:26:11.480
i don't know if that's good bad you're gonna have to look it up and see what it equates to five percent

04:26:11.480 --> 04:26:18.040
two percent ten percent twenty percent i don't know but that's how you would decode that if you saw

04:26:18.040 --> 04:26:26.920
that on the side of the resistor if you saw colors on the side of the resistor well there they are

04:26:28.760 --> 04:26:33.000
you've got this in your book the way the color code works you have your first band second band

04:26:33.000 --> 04:26:40.760
third band fourth band if you have a resistor that's well first thing you want to do is hold it

04:26:40.760 --> 04:26:47.720
so that one of the bands is closest to the edge you normally want to put that closest on the left

04:26:47.720 --> 04:26:58.440
and then read it like a book if i had a resistor and i held it in my hand and it was orange white

04:26:58.520 --> 04:27:05.960
red gold orange on the color code equals the number three white is the number nine

04:27:06.680 --> 04:27:14.360
red is the number two so that means i'm going to add two zeros after the three nine three nine zero

04:27:14.360 --> 04:27:20.600
zero and gold means it's a five percent tolerance putting that most common terms means this would be

04:27:20.600 --> 04:27:27.240
a three thousand nine hundred ohm resistor or three point nine k ohm resistor five percent

04:27:34.120 --> 04:27:45.560
question i hate the word memorization question is we have to memorize it you gotta know it

04:27:46.120 --> 04:27:54.040
but you've got to know it and to be honest with you a lot of job interviews they're gonna ask you

04:27:54.040 --> 04:27:58.360
to do that the best thing though i'm not going to go out of my way i'm going to be honest with you

04:27:58.360 --> 04:28:03.320
i'm not going to go out of my way on a quiz to hammer you on it you're not going to fail this

04:28:03.320 --> 04:28:07.800
quiz because you don't know the resistor color code one of the big things with the resistor

04:28:07.800 --> 04:28:13.160
color code is simply your experience doing your labs you're going to you're going to come to learn

04:28:13.160 --> 04:28:17.800
this and the more you work with it you're going to understand it and you're going to remember it

04:28:17.800 --> 04:28:23.560
but i don't want to make flash cards other programs do that you know we could give you

04:28:23.560 --> 04:28:28.120
flash cards and identify this resistor i could keep you occupied and entertained for but then when

04:28:28.120 --> 04:28:32.680
you're all said and done you know you're ready to go get a job and identify resistors for a living

04:28:32.680 --> 04:28:37.240
not a lot of money in that so this is just something that you need to learn you need to know you need

04:28:37.240 --> 04:28:47.480
to be able to decode it make sense i'll let you study the acronyms at your own leisure in a group

04:28:47.480 --> 04:28:54.600
form see i'm ex-navy and we had some acronyms that basically if i repeated here i would be

04:28:55.160 --> 04:29:02.280
handcuffed and dragged off and start with bad boys that was one of them that's a lot of you

04:29:02.280 --> 04:29:07.560
you know so i'll let you discuss some of these amongst yourselves and they they do work it's

04:29:07.560 --> 04:29:13.240
actually funny because having interviewed potential faculty member i'll of course always throw in

04:29:13.240 --> 04:29:20.040
there identify this resistor and you see some man making charts and you know i've never once given

04:29:20.040 --> 04:29:25.720
anybody a resistor you know what size of this resistor oh that's a 1.2 k 5 percent resistor

04:29:25.720 --> 04:29:29.720
you know actually if somebody identified i'd probably you know you're a freak you're a freak of

04:29:29.720 --> 04:29:35.000
nature yeah but it is something that again through experience you're going to get used to

04:29:35.000 --> 04:29:40.520
and when you're prototyping a circuit you're going to say i'm looking for a 1.5 k ohm resistor you

04:29:40.520 --> 04:29:47.720
know and you find it you plug it in your circuit and you move on so resistors and circuits

04:29:49.640 --> 04:29:54.040
resistors are typically configured in a circuit in one of three different ways

04:29:54.040 --> 04:30:05.320
either series parallel or compound and to be honest with you i hate to let the cat out of the bag

04:30:05.320 --> 04:30:14.600
put the cart before the horse but you know what in the entire world of electronics and the entire

04:30:14.600 --> 04:30:21.720
entire universe of electronics there's only three types of circuits and here you are week number three

04:30:21.800 --> 04:30:28.840
learning about them it's that simple the most complex circuit you ever work on in your life

04:30:28.840 --> 04:30:37.160
will be one of these three it's either going to be a series circuit a parallel circuit or it's called

04:30:37.160 --> 04:30:47.640
a compound circuit or a combination yeah the first circuit we're going to talk about is a series

04:30:47.640 --> 04:30:57.080
circuit and the simple thing to remember with a series circuit is resistance is additive

04:30:59.240 --> 04:31:05.480
resistance is additive so the formula that we need to remember

04:31:07.320 --> 04:31:11.880
and this is not accurate this should have an equal sign right here there's an error in this formula

04:31:11.880 --> 04:31:20.120
should be rt total resistance is equal to resistor one plus resistor two plus resistor three plus

04:31:20.120 --> 04:31:27.480
etc etc etc if you got 5000 resistors in a circuit you're gonna have 5000 resistances to add up

04:31:28.280 --> 04:31:29.240
it's cumulative

04:31:33.640 --> 04:31:38.360
so in this particular circumstance all is we have to do is pick a point in the circuit and start to

04:31:38.360 --> 04:31:44.120
count we'll start right here at the negative terminal the first resistor I encounter has

04:31:44.120 --> 04:31:55.560
30 ohms of resistance 30 plus 20 is equal to 50 plus 10 is equal to 60 that completes the circuit

04:31:55.560 --> 04:32:02.280
in this circuit there are a total of 60 ohms of resistance does that make sense

04:32:02.840 --> 04:32:11.960
sounds real basic doesn't it it's all fun and games until you have a bad battery connection

04:32:11.960 --> 04:32:16.680
right here there's some corrosion that adds some resistance you got a bad solder joint right here

04:32:16.680 --> 04:32:24.200
it adds a little bit more resistance so in in in a theory class like this how many ohms of

04:32:24.200 --> 04:32:28.680
resistance are they supposed to be in a circuit 60 you get in there and measure it with your meter

04:32:28.680 --> 04:32:35.080
and you get 67 ohms then you realize you have tolerance of these resistors did you take that

04:32:35.080 --> 04:32:40.280
into account yeah but that only accounts for a small percentage based on that then all of a

04:32:40.280 --> 04:32:45.240
sudden you realize why i've got corrosion in the circuit or i've got a bad solder joint in the circuit

04:32:46.520 --> 04:32:50.360
so that's where there's a disconnect sometimes between the world of theory that we live in

04:32:50.360 --> 04:32:55.320
here in a classroom a lecture environment and the world of reality in the lab that's why i want to

04:32:55.320 --> 04:32:59.800
see all of you getting in the lab doing your lab assignments because you're basically going to

04:32:59.800 --> 04:33:04.600
start scratching your head saying hey i thought joe i kind of believed what joe was saying in a

04:33:04.600 --> 04:33:10.440
lecture but it isn't quite working like that it's going to work like i say but there's going to be

04:33:10.440 --> 04:33:16.680
also a lot of variables that take place in the lab and in the real world as i said before that's

04:33:16.680 --> 04:33:21.640
the toughest thing that i had when i got out into industry i went through a bunch of theory

04:33:21.640 --> 04:33:29.080
schools when i started seeing things for real i was like wow this doesn't make sense is this good

04:33:30.040 --> 04:33:34.200
can this possibly be good this doesn't look like a good reading and it's not what the book says

04:33:34.840 --> 04:33:37.800
how could this be you know so that's the only way you're getting that is experience

04:33:40.360 --> 04:33:42.440
any questions on series resistance

04:33:45.000 --> 04:33:48.440
parallel this is my favorite slide of the entire

04:33:48.680 --> 04:33:54.280
entire quarter because like watch i'm going to hit the key and the formula is going to fly in from

04:33:54.280 --> 04:34:05.880
the side oh it's not cool you ever see how people like abuse powerpoint use too much animation this

04:34:05.880 --> 04:34:10.840
is just right all right and i'm going to do it one more time it's the last time i'm going to do the

04:34:10.840 --> 04:34:16.440
entire quarter the last slide that i have that's animated is this slide okay you ready oh

04:34:20.680 --> 04:34:21.720
just kidding one more time

04:34:25.960 --> 04:34:31.960
now in order for us to calculate out the total resistance in parallel this is kind of different

04:34:31.960 --> 04:34:39.720
this is this is kind of odd right what we're going to do is this reciprocal formula

04:34:41.160 --> 04:34:50.200
the reciprocal of resistor one plus the reciprocal of resistor two plus the reciprocal of resistor

04:34:50.200 --> 04:34:56.840
three on and on and on what that sounds awful familiar to me what is the reciprocal of resistance

04:34:59.880 --> 04:35:05.720
conductivity remember that one over r equals conductivity

04:35:06.120 --> 04:35:21.880
so what we're saying here is by adding up all of the conductivities of all of these branches to

04:35:21.880 --> 04:35:28.840
a parallel network then taking the reciprocal of that we end up with total resistance

04:35:28.840 --> 04:35:38.760
so this is kind of like a bar trick how can you add resistors to a circuit

04:35:39.800 --> 04:35:48.280
and yet make the resistance of the circuit less the answer is add them in parallel because that's

04:35:48.280 --> 04:35:56.360
exactly what we're doing here it's exactly what we're doing think of this as the seattle

04:35:57.320 --> 04:36:09.240
traffic system seattle traffic system okay this is a uh it's a friday afternoon before a three-day

04:36:09.240 --> 04:36:14.440
weekend and these are all the people that are in seattle and they want to get the bell view

04:36:17.000 --> 04:36:22.520
and they've got multiple paths to take how do you get from seattle to bell view

04:36:22.760 --> 04:36:33.480
five twenty how else i-90 how else up and around the north end of the lake

04:36:33.480 --> 04:36:38.280
or down around the south end of the lake so basically we have four let's say let's just

04:36:38.280 --> 04:36:45.160
talk about three for the case of our example here if you're in seattle i'm a big commuter so i

04:36:45.160 --> 04:36:50.120
like these analogies they really work well for me they work all too well for me if i'm in seattle

04:36:50.120 --> 04:36:55.560
and i want to get the bell view and it's a friday three-day weekend what path is probably going

04:36:55.560 --> 04:37:05.160
to be the best for me to take and why what's that no if i'm in seattle and i want to go to bell

04:37:05.160 --> 04:37:16.520
view three-day weekend which is the best path for me to take and why why most lines it's going to

04:37:16.520 --> 04:37:27.160
move the most traffic it's got the least amount of resistance after i-90 what would be my second

04:37:27.160 --> 04:37:38.840
choice before the toll the toll will quickly make this number three choice at least for me i'm a

04:37:38.840 --> 04:37:49.160
tightwad i'll take the ferry to vancouver and drive down around before i get a boat five twenty

04:37:49.880 --> 04:37:54.600
five twenty has fewer lanes it's got more resistance it doesn't move the same amount of traffic

04:37:55.480 --> 04:37:59.240
and then finally the other option is driving around the north end of the south end of the lake

04:38:00.760 --> 04:38:08.680
not an easy way of doing it a lot more traffic less flow so comparing that now to this we could

04:38:08.680 --> 04:38:14.120
say that i-90 is like the equivalent of 10 ohms of resistance because even though i-90 it's a super

04:38:14.120 --> 04:38:20.840
interstate highway and it's got multiple lanes does it still have resistance oh yeah oh yeah if it

04:38:20.840 --> 04:38:28.600
didn't have resistance there would never be any brake lights on it this would be like five twenty

04:38:28.600 --> 04:38:34.200
would be like twice the amount of resistance meaning it moves half the amount of traffic

04:38:34.520 --> 04:38:42.200
and then the north end of the lake three times the amount of resistance meaning even less traffic

04:38:43.480 --> 04:38:51.640
does that make sense so every one of these is a viable current path every one of those routes

04:38:51.640 --> 04:39:04.760
is a viable traffic path let's say for example that bill gates he really wanted a give back

04:39:04.760 --> 04:39:11.000
and he loves the people of the puja sound region and he wants to build another bridge across lake

04:39:11.000 --> 04:39:16.600
washington and he he he is so into it he's even going to let the bridge like come off of his property

04:39:16.840 --> 04:39:23.560
okay and because he's building the bridge it's going to be called the bill gates memorial bridge

04:39:25.800 --> 04:39:31.960
when he builds that bridge across lake washington what's it going to do to this flow here what's

04:39:31.960 --> 04:39:39.240
it going to do it's going to it's going to make the overall circuit have less

04:39:39.960 --> 04:39:48.520
resistance because he built another viable path is the path he builds going to be perfect

04:39:48.520 --> 04:39:54.920
is it still going to have resistance yes but is it going to have an overall effect on increasing

04:39:54.920 --> 04:40:01.560
the flow in the seattle metropolitan area of traffic absolutely so that's how we can add

04:40:01.560 --> 04:40:08.920
resistances on this circuit yet lower the overall resistance of the total circuit

04:40:09.880 --> 04:40:15.320
and that's why we have to use this formula we're actually adding up the conductivity

04:40:15.320 --> 04:40:19.480
we end up with the total conductivity for the circuit take the reciprocal of that that gives us

04:40:19.480 --> 04:40:27.560
the total total resistance for the circuit makes sense okay now i'm going to give you some thumb

04:40:27.560 --> 04:40:30.840
rules thumb rules

04:40:34.040 --> 04:40:39.320
the first thumb rule that i want to give you it's very very important when you're analyzing a

04:40:39.320 --> 04:40:49.480
circuit like this the total resistance of the circuit will always be less than the value of least

04:40:49.560 --> 04:40:55.240
resistance if not you made a mistake plain and simple

04:40:58.360 --> 04:41:04.360
absolutely and if you come up with something other than that you're done screwed up plain and simple

04:41:07.240 --> 04:41:11.560
so the total resistance of a parallel network will always be less than the value of least

04:41:12.360 --> 04:41:18.920
resistance and your assumption is correct in this circuit it's got to be less than 10 ohms

04:41:20.280 --> 04:41:28.120
the other thumb rule that i'm going to give you is if the values of resistance are all equal

04:41:31.400 --> 04:41:37.320
you simply count up the number of resistors take the resistance and divide it by that number

04:41:37.960 --> 04:41:49.400
as an example if this is if our three is 30 ohms our two is 30 ohms and our one is 30 ohms

04:41:50.280 --> 04:41:54.520
30 divided by how many resistors equals

04:41:58.120 --> 04:42:03.720
30 divided by 3 equals 10 the answer to this is going to be

04:42:03.720 --> 04:42:12.520
10 ohms that's a thumb rule so if i've got four 100 ohm resistors in parallel 100 ohms divided

04:42:12.520 --> 04:42:21.080
by four equals 25 if i have two 50 ohm resistors in parallel with each other

04:42:21.080 --> 04:42:34.520
250 ohm resistors 25 50 divided by 2 25 so that's a thumb rule only if the values are equal

04:42:35.400 --> 04:42:40.120
so a lot of times in the lab you may be looking for a certain value of resistance

04:42:40.120 --> 04:42:44.840
i need 20 ohms of resistance or you could put two tens in series with each other

04:42:44.840 --> 04:42:47.800
or you could put two forties in parallel with each other

04:42:49.800 --> 04:42:53.080
there's a couple different ways of doing it it's one of the reasons we're teaching about this stuff

04:42:53.080 --> 04:42:57.080
make sense

04:43:03.320 --> 04:43:11.080
okay

04:43:11.880 --> 04:43:17.640
the number of resistors only if they're equal it's only works if they're equal

04:43:19.640 --> 04:43:20.440
it's a thumb rule

04:43:23.880 --> 04:43:27.160
if you don't need to use the thumb rule it's just another tool in your toolbox

04:43:28.200 --> 04:43:33.720
to make it easier for you if you doubt me well you could always use that formula

04:43:35.880 --> 04:43:40.280
there is another formula i want to show you it's not in the book but i want you to know it

04:43:40.280 --> 04:43:50.520
learn it

04:43:55.960 --> 04:43:59.320
this is called the product over some formula

04:44:00.360 --> 04:44:07.560
product over some this only works if we have two resistors in parallel with each other

04:44:07.560 --> 04:44:12.200
period two resistors in parallel with each other period

04:44:15.480 --> 04:44:24.360
so this literally is the product over some the product is r1 multiplied by r2 r1 times r2

04:44:25.400 --> 04:44:31.560
divided by r1 plus r2 the product over the sum

04:44:31.560 --> 04:44:47.560
this works if you only have two resistors in parallel with each other

04:45:01.560 --> 04:45:08.840
if you've got two or more resistors you have to use this formula here

04:45:09.400 --> 04:45:12.520
i just drew it a little bit differently but that's basically the same formula

04:45:16.200 --> 04:45:23.400
the reciprocal of r1 which is the conductance of r1 plus the conductance of r2 plus the sum of

04:45:23.400 --> 04:45:29.880
the conductances total conductance the reciprocal one over the total conductance equals the total

04:45:29.880 --> 04:45:37.160
resistance so this formula works for two or more resistors in parallel this one here works for

04:45:37.720 --> 04:45:41.560
two resistors in parallel period

04:45:45.240 --> 04:45:50.440
the reason i want you to start using this is because in the future we're going to take

04:45:50.440 --> 04:45:55.080
this formula and we're going to adapt this formula for some other use

04:45:55.480 --> 04:45:59.960
so it's better that you just learn it now and it's another tool in your toolbox

04:46:01.000 --> 04:46:06.200
product over sum easy enough to remember product over sum

04:46:11.320 --> 04:46:17.400
when we execute the math on this formula here the reciprocal of r1 plus r2 plus r3

04:46:18.040 --> 04:46:23.160
we had those conductances up take the reciprocal of it we end up with 5.405 ohms is that answer

04:46:23.160 --> 04:46:29.880
sound right why does it sound right it's less than 10 works for me

04:46:31.320 --> 04:46:41.320
and that's like at r3 you consider rn as well no our rn would be like r4 5 r22 r447

04:46:41.960 --> 04:46:48.520
r to the nth degree means to the nth degree that this formula works to infinity if we keep adding

04:46:48.600 --> 04:46:54.840
resistors in parallel we just keep adding the reciprocal of that resistance on it that's what

04:46:54.840 --> 04:47:01.800
we mean by that so they drew it like this plus one r to the nth i did it etc etc etc

04:47:05.320 --> 04:47:12.120
this is a complex circuit now again i know you want to do the math you want to get it right

04:47:12.120 --> 04:47:16.680
that's cool okay i want to keep things real i want to keep things basic

04:47:17.480 --> 04:47:25.720
the first thing that i notice in this circuit is that these two resistors are in parallel with each

04:47:25.720 --> 04:47:32.440
other so this is an actual ideal situation for us to use this product over some formula

04:47:33.880 --> 04:47:37.800
50 times 25 divided by 50 plus 25

04:47:37.800 --> 04:47:44.040
why don't we just do it right now you got your calculators let's do it

04:47:46.440 --> 04:47:47.160
just do it

04:47:49.800 --> 04:47:52.760
but i want to do it in stages here for those folks at home

04:47:58.280 --> 04:48:00.280
this is how i'm going to start off with the formula

04:48:02.200 --> 04:48:07.320
now what i'm going to do is substitute in my numbers i what is that 50 and 25

04:48:08.200 --> 04:48:22.840
so it's going to be 50 times 25 divided by 50 plus 25 okay i know that this is going to 50 plus 25

04:48:22.840 --> 04:48:32.120
i could do that in my head right that's 75 okay but the 50 plus 25 50 excuse me times 25 equals

04:48:33.080 --> 04:48:35.560
1250

04:48:38.040 --> 04:48:43.320
so 1250 divided by 75 equals

04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:58.440
16.67 ohms so does everybody see how i did that isn't that a cool formula

04:48:58.680 --> 04:49:04.600
oh it's cool i like that formula i don't know why because the answer is always like

04:49:05.240 --> 04:49:11.080
come out i don't know i like that formula you could do the same thing down here and you're

04:49:11.080 --> 04:49:17.480
going to get the same results so i know that i've got and the way i want you to look at these

04:49:17.480 --> 04:49:24.280
parallel circuits the way that i want you to think of these parallel circuits is how much

04:49:24.280 --> 04:49:35.160
resistance is there between between this point here and that's actually called a node a node

04:49:35.160 --> 04:49:42.360
are where two or more wires are joined together how much resistance is there between node a and node b

04:49:45.480 --> 04:49:47.720
so to lay this out mathematically

04:49:54.440 --> 04:50:06.120
the way that i would actually calculate out this whole problem

04:50:07.640 --> 04:50:16.760
is rt for this circuit total resistance is going to be equal to the resistance of resistor one

04:50:17.240 --> 04:50:33.000
plus the resistance between node a and b plus the resistance of resistor

04:50:36.920 --> 04:50:37.240
three

04:50:40.040 --> 04:50:41.960
four four thank you

04:50:42.040 --> 04:50:50.600
why this is a dry erase board so r1 plus rab plus r4

04:50:52.920 --> 04:50:57.560
now before i could solve for this i'm going to have to calculate out what

04:50:59.160 --> 04:51:05.880
rab is equal to rab is going to be equal to

04:51:06.200 --> 04:51:16.680
r2 times r3 divided by r2 plus r3 you agree with that

04:51:20.280 --> 04:51:26.360
so then it's just a matter of me we already did this this is 16.67 ohms

04:51:26.680 --> 04:51:37.880
plus 30 ohms plus 20 ohms gives me my total amount of resistance in the circuit

04:51:41.880 --> 04:51:46.200
so i highly recommend until you really got a handle on this you lay it all out like this

04:51:47.000 --> 04:51:51.080
although so many formulas whatever i don't look at them as formulas these are tools

04:51:52.040 --> 04:51:59.560
these are tools yeah they're formulas but they're tools to solve the problem to unlock the key to the problem

04:52:01.560 --> 04:52:02.520
use the right tool

04:52:05.000 --> 04:52:11.640
you get the right results use the wrong tool on your car you strip the knot

04:52:13.960 --> 04:52:19.320
use the right tool you get about the results that you desire make sense

04:52:22.040 --> 04:52:29.880
when you first see a problem like this though one of the things that i'm going to stress

04:52:29.880 --> 04:52:35.320
in this program is that you keep it real what's the what was this total resistance

04:52:35.320 --> 04:52:43.400
going to be between these between this a and b it's going to be less than 25 so i've got 30 ohms

04:52:43.400 --> 04:52:49.720
here and 20 ohms there 30 plus 20 is 15 and less than 25 what do i know my answer is going to be

04:52:49.720 --> 04:52:58.440
less than what less than 75 if you could do that in your mind looking at this stuff i want

04:52:58.440 --> 04:53:04.760
you on my team i'll be honest with you i want you on my team those are the people that i want

04:53:05.640 --> 04:53:09.640
if i give you this problem and immediately you're with the calculator and you know you're

04:53:10.520 --> 04:53:14.280
i don't mind if you use the calculator but if you're turning it upside down your you know

04:53:14.280 --> 04:53:21.240
sideways and you know no what i want out of all of you is to look at this i got 30 ohms here i got

04:53:21.240 --> 04:53:30.760
20 that's 50 50 and 25 less than 25 my answer is going to be less than 75 ohms do not try to take

04:53:30.760 --> 04:53:39.480
my quizzes doing that if you do you'll probably be very successful with a lot of my quizzes i could

04:53:39.480 --> 04:53:43.560
take most of my quizzes not even use a calculator and get them all right well it has something to

04:53:43.560 --> 04:53:51.320
do with the fact that i wrote my quizzes but what i want you to do is that thumb rule as a litmus

04:53:51.320 --> 04:53:57.080
test at the end or even before you calculate it i should get less than 75 ohms as an answer

04:53:58.600 --> 04:54:04.280
my answer should be less than 75 ohms i came up with 66.7 ohms does that sound about right

04:54:05.800 --> 04:54:11.560
if you come up with an answer of what's the total resistance in a circuit 1250

04:54:12.360 --> 04:54:17.000
well that's not less than 75 houston we got a problem there's probably a math error

04:54:18.840 --> 04:54:23.480
if i were pope of electronics i would require you to all get a hundred percent on all of these

04:54:23.480 --> 04:54:27.240
quizzes because if you use the right tool you get the right results make sense

04:54:29.320 --> 04:54:35.480
in summary we talked about resistance what has resistance everything everything

04:54:36.920 --> 04:54:41.240
we talked about specific devices that are designed to possess the property of resistance

04:54:41.240 --> 04:54:47.480
it's known as a resistor can you imagine some dude wakes up every day and like you know instead

04:54:47.480 --> 04:54:52.840
of it's off to make the donuts it's off to design the resistors there are engineers in the world that

04:54:52.840 --> 04:55:03.160
design resistors for a living huh talk about a career path resistivity that property that we

04:55:03.160 --> 04:55:12.600
compare the resistivity of everything to that of silver silver the best conductor found in nature

04:55:12.600 --> 04:55:21.160
conductivity conductivity the reciprocal of resistance measured in mose or typically millimose

04:55:22.920 --> 04:55:30.120
resistor identification for fixed value variable values we talked about fixed resistors variable

04:55:30.120 --> 04:55:33.800
resistors that could be configured as potentiometers if they're used to control

04:55:36.040 --> 04:55:43.160
voltage real stats if they're used to control current if i'm using three leads i'm using it to

04:55:43.160 --> 04:55:50.280
control voltage if i'm using two leads i'm using it to control current and then finally we talked

04:55:50.280 --> 04:55:56.920
about certain configurations first was a series configuration in a series configuration how do

04:55:56.920 --> 04:56:05.000
i determine total resistance simply add it up it's additive in a parallel circuit

04:56:06.760 --> 04:56:12.520
how do i determine total resistance add up the reciprocal sounds like i'm adding up the conductivity

04:56:12.520 --> 04:56:24.040
of the paths in a compound circuit what do i got to do both thumb rules for parallel circuits total

04:56:24.120 --> 04:56:32.840
resistance will always equal less than the value of least and if i have like resistor same size

04:56:32.840 --> 04:56:37.720
then i could simply take that number take the value divide it by the number of resistors that

04:56:37.720 --> 04:56:43.160
i have and that will give me the total resistance any questions out of this chapter

04:56:46.680 --> 04:56:52.440
in parallel you got to divide it out so if i've got four one hundred ohm resistors it's a hundred

04:56:52.440 --> 04:56:57.480
ohms a hundred ohms a hundred ohms hundred ohms 100 divided by how many resistors for 100 divided

04:56:57.480 --> 04:57:06.280
by 4 equals 25 i should have approximately 25 ohms across that circuit all right let's go ahead

04:57:06.280 --> 04:57:14.520
and take a about a 10 little 12 minute break and we'll start up at about 10 after

04:57:22.920 --> 04:57:29.560
chapter five ohms law

04:57:33.240 --> 04:57:37.880
again we should like hit a gong ring a bell ring some chimes

04:57:40.360 --> 04:57:41.320
ohms law

04:57:44.120 --> 04:57:49.880
ohms law has more of an effect on being able to predict the behavior of electricity than

04:57:50.120 --> 04:57:57.480
really anything else so anybody know how predictable the behavior of electricity is

04:57:58.120 --> 04:58:02.920
percentage wise we're talking about tolerance is last chapter anybody know how accurate we

04:58:02.920 --> 04:58:11.640
could predict the behavior 100 it's bold statement it's absolutely correct 100 you use ohms law you

04:58:11.640 --> 04:58:19.160
could predict with 100 accuracy what's going to take place inside a circuit it's pretty powerful

04:58:20.440 --> 04:58:25.160
it's pretty powerful tool especially when you're going to be paid to go out into industry and fix

04:58:25.160 --> 04:58:29.000
broken electronic equipment get this tool working for you you got something

04:58:31.720 --> 04:58:36.200
after completing this chapter you're going to be able to identify the three basic parts of a circuit

04:58:37.400 --> 04:58:42.040
identify three types of circuit configurations describe how current flow can be varied in a

04:58:42.040 --> 04:58:48.920
circuit state ohms law with reference to current voltage and resistance solve problems using ohms

04:58:48.920 --> 04:58:54.280
law for current resistance voltage in series parallel in series parallel circuits describe how

04:58:54.280 --> 04:59:00.920
the total flow differs between series and parallel circuits describe how the total voltage drops

04:59:00.920 --> 04:59:05.640
differs between series and parallel circuits describe how the total resistance differs between

04:59:05.640 --> 04:59:13.160
series and parallel circuits state and apply kerfs current and voltage laws and verify answers using

04:59:13.160 --> 04:59:21.080
Ohm's law with Kerchoff's law.

04:59:21.080 --> 04:59:25.380
First of all, electric circuits.

04:59:25.380 --> 04:59:33.140
The path that current follows is called an electric circuit.

04:59:33.140 --> 04:59:38.280
All circuits consist of, and this is important, and it sounds really basic and it sounds very

04:59:38.280 --> 04:59:41.640
simplistic, but I'll tell you what.

04:59:41.640 --> 04:59:48.160
Doing this helped me on my worst day of my career as an electronics professional because

04:59:48.160 --> 04:59:55.560
it's so easy to get turned around and lose track of what the problem is, and if you could

04:59:55.560 --> 05:00:00.120
get back to basics, you're always going to do well.

05:00:00.120 --> 05:00:11.400
The basics are all electric circuits must consist of a voltage source, a load, and a

05:00:11.400 --> 05:00:15.640
conductor.

05:00:15.640 --> 05:00:18.520
The voltage source is the source of your electric energy.

05:00:18.520 --> 05:00:24.360
It could be any of those six different types that we talked about last week.

05:00:24.360 --> 05:00:30.800
The load is what converts one form of energy into another form of energy.

05:00:30.800 --> 05:00:38.440
An example of an electric load would be a light bulb, a motor, a heater.

05:00:38.440 --> 05:00:46.360
It converts electric energy into light, heat, motion.

05:00:46.360 --> 05:00:55.400
A conductor, a conductor, electrical conductor transfers the energy, the electric energy,

05:00:55.400 --> 05:01:01.400
the current from the source to the load.

05:01:01.400 --> 05:01:08.120
You have to have those three parts of a circuit, or it's not a circuit.

05:01:08.120 --> 05:01:15.320
I'm going to add two other optional parts that are not in the book.

05:01:15.320 --> 05:01:26.200
The other optional device, most circuits have them, not all do, is a controlling device.

05:01:26.200 --> 05:01:31.920
A simple example of a controlling device is a switch.

05:01:31.920 --> 05:01:38.520
A simple example of a complex controlling device is a microprocessor with 1.9 billion

05:01:38.520 --> 05:01:42.640
transistors on it.

05:01:42.640 --> 05:01:47.800
You see, that's where we're going in this course, by the way, from one switch to 1.9

05:01:47.800 --> 05:01:56.240
billion switches in a microprocessor.

05:01:56.240 --> 05:02:00.320
Controlling device is used to control the flow of current in the circuit.

05:02:00.320 --> 05:02:08.200
The fifth optional device that you could have inside a circuit is a protective device.

05:02:08.200 --> 05:02:20.080
An easy example of this is a fuse, a circuit breaker, a fusible link, a thermal circuit

05:02:20.080 --> 05:02:22.960
breaker.

05:02:22.960 --> 05:02:27.440
These are all examples of protective devices.

05:02:27.440 --> 05:02:34.800
On my worst day of my career as an electronics professional, it involved a nuclear submarine,

05:02:34.800 --> 05:02:40.600
someplace we weren't supposed to be, and it involved, unfortunately, my equipment that

05:02:40.600 --> 05:02:41.600
I was responsible for.

05:02:41.600 --> 05:02:47.920
There were three of us that were responsible for that system, big system, $16 million system,

05:02:47.920 --> 05:02:53.760
and that was like a $1982 expensive.

05:02:54.200 --> 05:03:00.840
The system was sold to the Navy, and it was designed with what was called graceful degradation.

05:03:00.840 --> 05:03:08.920
That means bits and pieces could fail, and the whole system would keep up and running.

05:03:08.920 --> 05:03:12.960
That's what the vendor told the Navy when the Navy bought the system.

05:03:12.960 --> 05:03:16.280
Here we are someplace we're not supposed to be, doing stuff we weren't supposed to

05:03:16.280 --> 05:03:21.840
be doing, and it was showtime for my equipment to do its thing.

05:03:22.840 --> 05:03:24.160
It didn't work right.

05:03:24.160 --> 05:03:25.160
It didn't work at all.

05:03:25.160 --> 05:03:29.520
As a matter of fact, it was totally down, 100%.

05:03:29.520 --> 05:03:33.040
And the captain, like, Mr. Greenock, how can this be?

05:03:33.040 --> 05:03:37.080
The system was designed with graceful degradation, it should never be 100% down.

05:03:37.080 --> 05:03:43.000
Well, Skipper, it's like this, it's totally busted.

05:03:43.000 --> 05:03:46.520
I don't care what you gotta do, I want you to fix it.

05:03:46.520 --> 05:03:55.800
Now we literally worked on that system non-stop, three days in a row, stayed up, popping no-dos,

05:03:55.800 --> 05:03:58.760
drinking coffee, just working on it, working on it, working on it.

05:03:58.760 --> 05:04:01.960
Two other guys might, they finally gave up, they're like, we just cannot fix this, it's

05:04:01.960 --> 05:04:02.960
not fixable.

05:04:02.960 --> 05:04:06.440
It just cannot, we can't bring it back from the dead.

05:04:06.440 --> 05:04:10.200
Me, I went back to these basics.

05:04:10.200 --> 05:04:14.400
It's an electronic system, it's made up of nothing but circuits.

05:04:14.400 --> 05:04:19.640
Circuits have a voltage source, they have a load, you have inter-connected with conductors,

05:04:19.640 --> 05:04:24.080
have controlling devices, and have protective devices.

05:04:24.080 --> 05:04:26.680
It's something not doing what it's supposed to be doing.

05:04:26.680 --> 05:04:28.920
It's gotta be, that's what's causing the problem.

05:04:28.920 --> 05:04:31.120
It's narrowing it down.

05:04:31.120 --> 05:04:36.800
And I stuck with the problem, I ended up fixing the problem, save the day, whoop-de-doo, I

05:04:36.800 --> 05:04:39.800
basically did my job and fixed the equipment.

05:04:39.800 --> 05:04:47.200
But I had to take a couple steps back and say, here's a $16 million system, fills half

05:04:47.200 --> 05:04:52.000
a room with equipment racks, none of it works.

05:04:52.000 --> 05:04:55.240
Can I verify the voltage sources for everything?

05:04:55.240 --> 05:05:00.000
Can I narrow it down and say, this stuff's not working, but this stuff is working?

05:05:00.000 --> 05:05:05.760
Can I look at the loads, what's not working, what's not converting electric energy into

05:05:05.760 --> 05:05:09.000
the form of energy that we need to be getting out of it?

05:05:09.000 --> 05:05:12.760
So if you know all of these systems, then you're gonna be an effective troubleshooter,

05:05:12.760 --> 05:05:15.160
but always go back to basics.

05:05:15.160 --> 05:05:20.000
Okay, God forbid you get out of class tonight, go out to your car, out in the North Parking

05:05:20.000 --> 05:05:22.360
lot, turn the key, and you've got an electrical problem.

05:05:22.360 --> 05:05:25.240
If you do have an electrical problem, approach it like this.

05:05:25.240 --> 05:05:27.720
Do I have a good source?

05:05:27.720 --> 05:05:29.720
Is my load functional?

05:05:29.720 --> 05:05:30.880
Is it the interconnects?

05:05:30.880 --> 05:05:34.680
Can I prove that the interconnects are viable?

05:05:34.680 --> 05:05:37.280
Is it a controlling device?

05:05:37.280 --> 05:05:40.720
And to be honest with you, in this day and age, most of the problems we encounter are

05:05:40.720 --> 05:05:43.120
controlling devices.

05:05:43.120 --> 05:05:49.920
Okay, it's not a simple switch, toggle switch, that was easy to troubleshoot.

05:05:49.920 --> 05:05:56.080
I do a lot of traveling, I forgot what brand car it was.

05:05:56.080 --> 05:05:59.520
I got the rental car, I flew in, it was on the East Coast, and I'm there late at night

05:05:59.520 --> 05:06:04.040
and I got in and I'm like, I couldn't figure out where to put the key.

05:06:05.040 --> 05:06:08.440
Where do I put the key to start the car?

05:06:08.440 --> 05:06:12.600
There was no place to put the key, and I'm looking at it, you know, I got a little flashlight

05:06:12.600 --> 05:06:15.080
and I'm looking, there's no place to put the key.

05:06:15.080 --> 05:06:16.640
I didn't need a place to put the key.

05:06:16.640 --> 05:06:19.960
The fact that the key was on my person was good enough for the car.

05:06:19.960 --> 05:06:23.600
Just hit the start button, ooh, it started.

05:06:23.600 --> 05:06:31.160
Alright, so the controlling device there was the FOB, RFID talking to the computer saying

05:06:31.160 --> 05:06:35.080
this is a valid operator to be inside the car to operate it.

05:06:35.080 --> 05:06:41.280
Kind of a complex controlling device, but a controlling device nonetheless.

05:06:41.280 --> 05:06:48.320
And of course protective devices, and sometimes wacky stuff is done with protective devices.

05:06:48.320 --> 05:06:53.520
I was working on my Tivo about a month ago, I had problems with my Tivo, and I've got

05:06:53.520 --> 05:06:58.600
an older Tivo, it's a direct Tivo, so it's got two dual receivers, I could record two

05:06:58.600 --> 05:07:00.920
shows and watch another show.

05:07:00.920 --> 05:07:08.240
It's non-HD, because I don't have HD, I don't want to pay for HD, I'm a cheapskate, okay?

05:07:08.240 --> 05:07:13.560
Feed my nice plasma screen, high resolution plasma screen with my basic signal, it's great.

05:07:13.560 --> 05:07:16.200
It's great, it's all good.

05:07:16.200 --> 05:07:18.440
My Tivo crapped out, okay?

05:07:18.440 --> 05:07:22.520
So all the Tivo's got a hard drive in there.

05:07:22.520 --> 05:07:27.880
So I got a new hard drive, I configured that and everything, and I was just through putting

05:07:27.880 --> 05:07:32.080
it together, and something happened, and I heard a pop, and all of a sudden Tivo wouldn't

05:07:32.080 --> 05:07:33.080
fire up anymore.

05:07:33.080 --> 05:07:39.320
And I'm like, oh man, if this thing is dead, I don't want to go out and buy a new direct

05:07:39.320 --> 05:07:46.880
TV DVR, and I got, it's a higher, I'm grandfathered into paying the older Tivo value, and plus

05:07:46.880 --> 05:07:52.600
quite frankly, I don't know if any Tivo users here, Tivo's the bomb.

05:07:52.600 --> 05:07:56.240
It truly is, because it could do word searches and all kinds of additional stuff that a normal

05:07:56.240 --> 05:07:59.000
DVR will not necessarily do for you.

05:07:59.000 --> 05:08:02.000
So I want that to bring this thing back from the dead, and I'm like, what the heck, I was

05:08:02.000 --> 05:08:06.560
pretty ticked off, because I already wasted a whole weekend screwing with this thing.

05:08:06.560 --> 05:08:12.160
So I'm looking through the circuit for something obvious, and I find this device, and basically

05:08:12.160 --> 05:08:17.120
it's got shrink wrap, black shrink wrap over it, two leads coming out of it, and I measure

05:08:17.120 --> 05:08:18.920
across it, and I'm getting it open.

05:08:18.920 --> 05:08:21.920
I mean, I just got in there with the thing unplugged, and I'm poking around, and what

05:08:21.920 --> 05:08:24.440
the heck is this?

05:08:24.440 --> 05:08:28.400
So anyway, I unsodder it, and I inspect it, and with an exacto knife, I cut the heat

05:08:28.400 --> 05:08:29.400
shrink out.

05:08:29.400 --> 05:08:30.400
You know what it is?

05:08:30.400 --> 05:08:31.400
It's a fuse.

05:08:31.400 --> 05:08:35.080
It's a fuse, and the manufacturer tried to disguise and get by putting a piece of heat

05:08:35.080 --> 05:08:39.840
shrink around it, and sticking it on the circuit board, and that's what was burned out.

05:08:39.840 --> 05:08:44.960
I found a suitable replacement that I had at home, and my tin can, soldered it back in

05:08:44.960 --> 05:08:46.880
place, fired it up, I was good to go.

05:08:46.880 --> 05:08:50.160
Tivo's been working nonstop ever since.

05:08:50.160 --> 05:08:51.320
Okay?

05:08:51.320 --> 05:08:52.320
And that's a hidden.

05:08:52.320 --> 05:08:56.160
A lot of companies do that type of stuff, so that if you don't know, if you're not the

05:08:56.160 --> 05:09:00.640
authorized service center, you don't know to get in there and even check that.

05:09:00.640 --> 05:09:06.760
I've seen some companies that will encapsulate a fuse, inside silicon or epoxy, you don't

05:09:06.760 --> 05:09:08.720
even know what's in there.

05:09:08.720 --> 05:09:11.480
So keep your eye open for all these basic parts of the circuit.

05:09:11.480 --> 05:09:15.920
I know this sounds basic, and I'm beating it to death, but I tell you, you will deceive

05:09:15.920 --> 05:09:21.240
me in the future when you get in the lab, and it's going to be like, I can't fix this.

05:09:21.920 --> 05:09:23.680
The problem's too complex.

05:09:23.680 --> 05:09:26.120
It's never a complex problem.

05:09:26.120 --> 05:09:29.000
It's usually a real simple problem.

05:09:29.000 --> 05:09:30.000
Very rarely.

05:09:30.000 --> 05:09:31.000
All of you are here.

05:09:31.000 --> 05:09:34.080
You want to get into advanced electronics and work on sophisticated equipment.

05:09:34.080 --> 05:09:37.960
The problems with sophisticated equipment are always very, very simple.

05:09:37.960 --> 05:09:38.960
Okay?

05:09:38.960 --> 05:09:41.920
You've got to follow this protocol, though.

05:09:41.920 --> 05:09:45.000
So use this as a checklist.

05:09:45.000 --> 05:09:46.080
This is a series circuit.

05:09:46.080 --> 05:09:51.040
We talked about series circuits already.

05:09:51.040 --> 05:10:00.200
The most important thing for you to remember about a series circuit is that current is

05:10:00.200 --> 05:10:04.160
constant in a series circuit.

05:10:04.160 --> 05:10:11.840
The most important thing to remember is that current is constant in a series circuit, meaning

05:10:11.840 --> 05:10:15.080
I've got a resistor here, a resistor here, a resistor here.

05:10:15.080 --> 05:10:21.000
These three resistors cumulatively add up to the total amount of resistance in the circuit.

05:10:21.120 --> 05:10:26.240
This electrical pressure here encounters this total resistance and allows this amount of

05:10:26.240 --> 05:10:29.620
current to flow.

05:10:29.620 --> 05:10:34.240
This current has to travel the entire path of the circuit.

05:10:34.240 --> 05:10:39.560
That is the most important thing about a series circuit, period.

05:10:39.560 --> 05:10:43.960
The second thing I want you to remember about a series circuit is a series circuit is also

05:10:43.960 --> 05:10:57.960
known as, like FBI lingo, a.k.a., a series circuit is also known as a voltage divider.

05:10:57.960 --> 05:10:59.680
A voltage divider.

05:10:59.680 --> 05:11:02.040
What voltage gets divided up?

05:11:02.040 --> 05:11:03.880
The total voltage.

05:11:03.880 --> 05:11:04.880
Remember this?

05:11:04.880 --> 05:11:06.680
We call this voltage rise.

05:11:06.680 --> 05:11:09.040
How many voltage drops do I have in this circuit?

05:11:09.040 --> 05:11:10.840
This circuit.

05:11:10.840 --> 05:11:12.200
Three.

05:11:12.200 --> 05:11:18.240
So voltage rise is going to get divided into three proportional values.

05:11:18.240 --> 05:11:22.560
The biggest resistance gets the biggest voltage drop, the smallest resistance gets the smallest

05:11:22.560 --> 05:11:29.000
voltage drop, and the resistance that's just right gets a voltage drop that's just right.

05:11:29.000 --> 05:11:30.000
Make sense?

05:11:30.000 --> 05:11:33.680
That's the series circuit.

05:11:33.680 --> 05:11:39.160
The parallel circuit, the most important thing I want you to remember about the parallel

05:11:39.160 --> 05:11:47.720
circuit is that voltage is constant across a parallel network.

05:11:47.720 --> 05:11:49.720
This is a parallel network.

05:11:49.720 --> 05:11:54.240
Here there are three resistors in parallel with each other.

05:11:54.240 --> 05:12:04.760
The voltage rise will be distributed equally, equally, across all three branches.

05:12:04.760 --> 05:12:09.080
So whatever this is, if this is 120 volts, this is going to have 120 volts across it.

05:12:09.080 --> 05:12:12.200
This is going to have 120 volts across, and this is going to have 120 volts across.

05:12:12.200 --> 05:12:16.080
Kind of like how your house is wired.

05:12:16.080 --> 05:12:17.960
Your house is wired in parallel.

05:12:17.960 --> 05:12:22.680
Each of the outlets has the same voltage across them, or they should.

05:12:22.680 --> 05:12:26.360
If not, you've got a problem.

05:12:26.360 --> 05:12:32.040
That's the most important thing about a parallel network.

05:12:32.040 --> 05:12:36.920
A series circuit was also known as a voltage divider.

05:12:36.920 --> 05:12:43.040
A parallel circuit is going to be known as a current divider.

05:12:43.040 --> 05:12:45.520
Because what happens to current in the circuit?

05:12:45.520 --> 05:12:50.640
This total current here gets divided here at this node and here.

05:12:50.640 --> 05:12:53.600
Then current gets divided here and here.

05:12:53.600 --> 05:12:58.520
The current flowing through R3 and the current flowing through R2 join up at this node and

05:12:58.520 --> 05:13:00.880
flow onto this node.

05:13:00.880 --> 05:13:07.680
Currents current plus this current equals total current.

05:13:07.680 --> 05:13:10.360
Series circuit, current's constant.

05:13:10.360 --> 05:13:13.040
Series circuit also known as a voltage divider.

05:13:13.040 --> 05:13:20.040
Parallel circuit, voltage is constant, also known as a current divider.

05:13:20.040 --> 05:13:25.240
Complex circuit, well, that's got both going on.

05:13:25.240 --> 05:13:31.160
I've got current division going on here in my parallel network and I've got voltage

05:13:31.160 --> 05:13:41.880
division going on here between this resistor and this resistance.

05:13:41.880 --> 05:13:43.160
This resistance.

05:13:43.160 --> 05:13:50.480
The best thing you could do in this circuit is label this A, node A, or in B, or X and

05:13:50.480 --> 05:13:52.840
Z, or whatever you want to label it.

05:13:52.920 --> 05:13:58.080
I like using letters because numbers typically equate to components.

05:13:58.080 --> 05:14:03.840
Letters I could use to, and there's no rule on this, but it works for me.

05:14:03.840 --> 05:14:07.760
So I'm going to label this node A and this node B.

05:14:07.760 --> 05:14:15.920
The resistance between node A and B is equal to the product over some of R2 and 3.

05:14:15.920 --> 05:14:16.920
Remember that?

05:14:16.920 --> 05:14:18.880
I studied that last chapter.

05:14:18.880 --> 05:14:27.480
The total resistance of the circuit is going to be equal to R1 plus RAB.

05:14:27.480 --> 05:14:35.560
This voltage drop, RAB plus the voltage drop across R1 equals RT.

05:14:35.560 --> 05:14:39.200
Voltage rise, and really, how many voltage drops do I have in the circuit?

05:14:39.200 --> 05:14:41.760
Really, how many voltage drops do I have in the circuit?

05:14:41.760 --> 05:14:42.760
Two.

05:14:42.760 --> 05:14:46.320
And what are they?

05:14:46.320 --> 05:14:51.640
R1 and RAB, or R2 and R3.

05:14:51.640 --> 05:14:54.880
If I say R2, it's really the same thing.

05:14:54.880 --> 05:14:57.000
R2 is the same as R3.

05:14:57.000 --> 05:14:59.440
You could argue and say, well, you really got three voltage drops here.

05:14:59.440 --> 05:15:00.440
You got a voltage drop here.

05:15:00.440 --> 05:15:03.080
You got a voltage drop here, and you got a voltage drop here.

05:15:03.080 --> 05:15:07.200
Well, this voltage drop and this voltage drop are the same voltage drop.

05:15:07.200 --> 05:15:11.360
It's the same difference in potential, so I really, I don't want to call it different.

05:15:11.360 --> 05:15:12.360
It's the same.

05:15:12.800 --> 05:15:16.600
Make sense?

05:15:16.600 --> 05:15:21.520
Some different circuit conditions that I want to talk about, and this is very important.

05:15:21.520 --> 05:15:24.400
I want you to use the proper terminology with me.

05:15:24.400 --> 05:15:28.880
It's part of why you're here at Lake Washington Technical College studying this stuff is to

05:15:28.880 --> 05:15:34.880
learn to speak another language, the language of electronics.

05:15:34.880 --> 05:15:41.640
The circuit condition that I want to talk about is called a closed circuit.

05:15:41.640 --> 05:15:47.920
Is a closed circuit a good thing, or is it a bad thing?

05:15:47.920 --> 05:15:48.920
Depends on what you want.

05:15:48.920 --> 05:15:49.920
Thank you.

05:15:49.920 --> 05:15:52.520
It depends on what you want.

05:15:52.520 --> 05:15:59.760
Right now, the circuit in this room for the interior lights is closed, meaning the circuit's

05:15:59.760 --> 05:16:05.600
energized, and we have an appropriate amount of illumination in here.

05:16:05.600 --> 05:16:08.680
That's a good thing.

05:16:08.680 --> 05:16:15.280
If I go and operate the switch and try to open the switch and the lights won't go out,

05:16:15.280 --> 05:16:17.920
that could be a problem.

05:16:17.920 --> 05:16:20.160
That could be a problem.

05:16:20.160 --> 05:16:25.000
If you're operating an electric tool and you try to shut it off and you can't shut

05:16:25.000 --> 05:16:30.560
it off, that's a problem.

05:16:30.560 --> 05:16:34.320
Be a closed circuit is causing you a problem.

05:16:34.320 --> 05:16:37.320
I had this problem with a pressure washer.

05:16:37.320 --> 05:16:43.160
One of these $100 pressure washers, Costco special, great pressure washer for what I

05:16:43.160 --> 05:16:44.160
do.

05:16:44.160 --> 05:16:52.120
Got a patio, I got a deck, I don't need 40 horsepower, fire breathing, peel the paint

05:16:52.120 --> 05:16:56.000
off the Queen Mary pressure washer.

05:16:56.000 --> 05:16:58.800
But it's my pressure washer, and I like it.

05:16:58.800 --> 05:17:04.720
I got a lot of tools, got a lot of neighbors, I know I got a lot of tools.

05:17:04.720 --> 05:17:09.400
My neighbor Tom, he's since moved, it's another story, I'll tell you about that some other

05:17:09.400 --> 05:17:10.400
time.

05:17:10.400 --> 05:17:14.400
I finally drove him out of the neighborhood.

05:17:14.400 --> 05:17:17.800
Tom's an engineer, an electrical engineer with Boeing.

05:17:17.800 --> 05:17:21.040
Hey Joe, I'm going to stain my deck.

05:17:21.040 --> 05:17:22.640
Can I borrow your pressure washer?

05:17:22.640 --> 05:17:26.720
I'm a nice guy, but I hate loaning out tools because nobody takes care of stuff like I want

05:17:26.720 --> 05:17:27.720
to take and care of.

05:17:27.720 --> 05:17:32.480
I mean, if I borrow somebody's tool, I take care of it 10 times better than my own, and

05:17:32.480 --> 05:17:34.840
if I break it, I buy it, I replace it.

05:17:34.840 --> 05:17:45.040
So Tom, that's fine, I'll loan you my pressure washer, but only plug it in a dedicated outlet

05:17:45.040 --> 05:17:48.480
and do not use any extension cords.

05:17:48.480 --> 05:17:52.720
Because it's right on the label, it's not that I'm that smart a guy, I just read the

05:17:52.720 --> 05:17:55.040
label, the tag that's on it.

05:17:55.040 --> 05:18:01.000
Because this motor requires a lot of current to be able to turn and be effective.

05:18:01.000 --> 05:18:04.320
If you plug it in an extension cord, it doesn't get the right amount of current.

05:18:04.320 --> 05:18:08.600
Remember that whole thing, the cord gets hot, the hotter it gets, the more resistance, the

05:18:08.600 --> 05:18:11.680
more resistance, the less current, the less current, the hotter it gets, it's a vicious

05:18:11.680 --> 05:18:12.680
cycle.

05:18:12.680 --> 05:18:15.840
So I loaned him my pressure washer.

05:18:15.840 --> 05:18:16.840
How did it work out?

05:18:16.840 --> 05:18:17.840
Oh, pretty good.

05:18:17.840 --> 05:18:19.840
Thanks Joe.

05:18:19.840 --> 05:18:23.760
Fast forward a couple of weeks later, I go out to wash my sidewalk.

05:18:23.760 --> 05:18:29.600
I plug the thing in, turn it on, and it's on, continuously on.

05:18:29.600 --> 05:18:31.000
It won't shut off.

05:18:31.000 --> 05:18:35.840
Normally what happens, it's a real simple circuit.

05:18:35.840 --> 05:18:40.760
This switch right here on a pressure washer, one of those cheap Costco specials, what it

05:18:40.760 --> 05:18:43.640
does is there's a water pressure sensor.

05:18:43.640 --> 05:18:48.560
When the water pressure builds up, what it physically does is open the switch.

05:18:48.560 --> 05:18:52.840
So what you do in the handle, when you release the switch or release the pressure, as soon

05:18:52.840 --> 05:18:57.400
as you release the pressure, you close the switch, you turn your motor on, the motor

05:18:57.400 --> 05:19:00.480
turns the pump on, and you're pressure washing.

05:19:00.480 --> 05:19:06.760
You release the trigger, you build the pressure up, you open the switch.

05:19:06.760 --> 05:19:11.880
Mine will never shut off unless I unplug it.

05:19:11.880 --> 05:19:18.600
If I unplugged it and it still kept operating, well, that'd be something.

05:19:18.600 --> 05:19:19.600
Keeps operating.

05:19:19.600 --> 05:19:24.280
I'd ripped the thing apart, and what had happened was, I guarantee you, I didn't see

05:19:24.280 --> 05:19:28.920
him do it, but what, because I had no problem with that, and I had it for years.

05:19:28.920 --> 05:19:33.160
He plugged it in a non-dedicated circuit, it built up a lot of heat, and physically,

05:19:33.160 --> 05:19:36.600
the switch, the contacts got welded.

05:19:36.600 --> 05:19:40.240
I took the switch apart, the contacts were welded to each other.

05:19:40.240 --> 05:19:44.600
That's how hot it got.

05:19:44.600 --> 05:19:49.040
So I went to my file cabinet, opened the drawer, pulled out the manual, got the parts list,

05:19:49.040 --> 05:19:50.200
contacted the company.

05:19:50.200 --> 05:19:55.480
The new switch would be $65 plus shipping.

05:19:55.480 --> 05:20:03.800
A new pressure washer at Costco, $109, I can have it right now.

05:20:03.800 --> 05:20:06.640
The old one's in a landfill somewhere.

05:20:06.640 --> 05:20:08.880
After I cannibalized some parts off of it.

05:20:08.880 --> 05:20:12.000
You thought your neighbor called?

05:20:12.000 --> 05:20:14.800
No, I ran him out of the neighborhood.

05:20:14.800 --> 05:20:18.480
I finally ran him out of the neighborhood.

05:20:18.480 --> 05:20:23.400
There was a chainsaw involved.

05:20:23.400 --> 05:20:24.400
Trees falling.

05:20:24.400 --> 05:20:25.400
Long story.

05:20:25.400 --> 05:20:26.400
Long story.

05:20:26.400 --> 05:20:36.200
Now actually, what pushed Tom over the edge was, he had problems in his basement, flooding,

05:20:36.200 --> 05:20:39.360
split level house, and water would get in.

05:20:39.360 --> 05:20:44.440
So what he dug, did is he dug a trench around the entire foundation of his house, and then

05:20:44.440 --> 05:20:48.000
what he's going to do is he's going to put a treatment on the outside concrete, and then

05:20:48.000 --> 05:20:50.640
he was also going to backfill it, put in drainage and everything.

05:20:50.640 --> 05:20:52.520
So he had this ditch dug.

05:20:52.520 --> 05:20:54.080
It was a lot of backbreaking work.

05:20:54.080 --> 05:20:55.080
He did it all by hand.

05:20:55.080 --> 05:20:59.040
Got to respect that.

05:20:59.040 --> 05:21:00.720
But it took him forever to do it.

05:21:00.720 --> 05:21:02.080
It took him years to do it.

05:21:02.080 --> 05:21:03.880
So I used to accuse him of having a moat.

05:21:03.880 --> 05:21:09.160
It's like, Tom, what's the deal with the moat?

05:21:09.160 --> 05:21:14.200
So anyway, again, I had a buddy of mine over, and it was the wee hours of the morning, and

05:21:14.200 --> 05:21:19.320
we were enjoying some libations and some cigars.

05:21:19.320 --> 05:21:24.080
And actually, my buddy who's got my sense of humor, he's like, hey, Joe, is that Tom's

05:21:24.080 --> 05:21:25.080
moat?

05:21:25.080 --> 05:21:26.080
What's up with that?

05:21:26.080 --> 05:21:27.080
Doesn't he want that thing full?

05:21:27.080 --> 05:21:29.440
I'm like, that's a good point.

05:21:29.440 --> 05:21:32.440
Why have a moat if it's not?

05:21:32.440 --> 05:21:36.920
So anyway, we turned on his garden hose and started filling the moat, and then we're just

05:21:36.920 --> 05:21:40.600
laughing and like busting a gut, and then Tom came out and he's pretty freaking ticked

05:21:40.600 --> 05:21:41.600
off.

05:21:41.600 --> 05:21:43.920
Then we're filling his moat with water.

05:21:43.920 --> 05:21:47.800
I mean, he woke up to the sound of running water, like, why is water running in my house?

05:21:47.800 --> 05:21:52.680
And hey, man, we thought we were doing you a favor by filling your moat, you know?

05:21:52.680 --> 05:21:56.640
He was out of there within six months.

05:21:56.640 --> 05:22:00.040
Open circuit, is this good or bad?

05:22:00.040 --> 05:22:01.040
Depends.

05:22:01.040 --> 05:22:02.040
Depends.

05:22:02.040 --> 05:22:05.560
Now, my pressure washer, this would have been highly desirable.

05:22:05.560 --> 05:22:12.920
When pressure builds up, it opens the switch, interrupts the flow of current to the motor.

05:22:12.920 --> 05:22:20.820
Another circuit condition is called a short circuit.

05:22:20.820 --> 05:22:23.520
Have you all heard of a short circuit before?

05:22:23.520 --> 05:22:30.440
God blessed my wife, but she's been my wife now for a long time, and I've been in this

05:22:30.440 --> 05:22:31.920
industry since puberty.

05:22:31.920 --> 05:22:36.280
So hanging out with a guy that teaches electronics and does electrical stuff, you'd think something

05:22:36.280 --> 05:22:37.280
would rub off.

05:22:37.280 --> 05:22:43.320
Constantly, I get a call, and it's kind of like, the blunder's not working, I think

05:22:43.320 --> 05:22:48.640
it's got a short circuit, and I'm like, holy crap, you tell short circuit to me, I'm like

05:22:48.640 --> 05:22:51.480
ready to call the fire, but I mean, short circuit is like what you see in a Star Trek

05:22:51.480 --> 05:22:55.920
when they get hit by a phaser, you know, and the, you know, I mean, that's a short circuit.

05:22:55.920 --> 05:22:58.160
That literally is what a short circuit is.

05:22:58.160 --> 05:23:02.960
A short circuit will cause an electrical fire.

05:23:02.960 --> 05:23:06.680
And then on further probing, what exactly is the blunder doing?

05:23:06.720 --> 05:23:09.280
Well, I plug it in, I hit the button, but nothing happens.

05:23:09.280 --> 05:23:14.360
Oh, you mean it's an open circuit, not a short circuit, big difference.

05:23:14.360 --> 05:23:18.720
The majority of household appliances that I've encountered that have failed have failed

05:23:18.720 --> 05:23:23.360
because of an open circuit condition.

05:23:23.360 --> 05:23:25.360
That's where nothing works.

05:23:25.360 --> 05:23:31.960
Now you've got to be careful, because sometimes a short circuit will cause a protective device

05:23:31.960 --> 05:23:39.040
to open and render the piece of equipment dead.

05:23:39.040 --> 05:23:44.680
So you've got to get in, and like that direct TV, direct TVO, that was dead.

05:23:44.680 --> 05:23:46.640
That was open intentionally.

05:23:46.640 --> 05:23:51.080
I found the open, it was that fuse with heat shrink around it, trying to disguise it to

05:23:51.080 --> 05:23:55.480
make it look like a fuse with heat shrink around it.

05:23:55.480 --> 05:23:57.120
Make sense?

05:23:57.120 --> 05:24:01.320
So keep that in mind, open circuit, short circuit is always bad.

05:24:01.760 --> 05:24:07.040
There's never an intentional reason to short anything.

05:24:07.040 --> 05:24:11.800
Current flow in a circuit can be varied by changing the voltage applied to the circuit.

05:24:11.800 --> 05:24:14.640
As voltage increases, current increases.

05:24:14.640 --> 05:24:18.840
As voltage decreases, current decreases.

05:24:18.840 --> 05:24:22.960
And also changing the resistance in the circuit.

05:24:22.960 --> 05:24:28.960
As resistance increases, currents going to decrease.

05:24:28.960 --> 05:24:33.240
So these first values we call these directly proportional, right?

05:24:33.240 --> 05:24:37.920
If voltage increases, current increases, directly proportional.

05:24:37.920 --> 05:24:41.400
Voltage decreases, current decreases, directly proportional.

05:24:41.400 --> 05:24:48.400
Resistance increases, current decreases, inversely proportional.

05:24:48.400 --> 05:24:55.400
Now, in the beginning when Ohm gave his like sermon, I don't know if it was a sermon, Ohm's

05:24:59.720 --> 05:25:06.720
sermon on the mount, somehow I think I'm getting my history messed up.

05:25:10.760 --> 05:25:14.920
This is what Ohm said.

05:25:14.920 --> 05:25:18.680
I think the speech was given down at the king dome.

05:25:18.680 --> 05:25:22.760
And he was at the king dome, and he got up, hello, hello, hello.

05:25:22.760 --> 05:25:26.160
This is, this is, I'm the happiest man, man, man, alive.

05:25:26.160 --> 05:25:33.160
Alive, alive, because, because, because, I know, no, no, Ohm's law, law, law, law.

05:25:33.240 --> 05:25:35.360
Y'all ready, ready for this, this, this, this?

05:25:35.360 --> 05:25:40.360
E, E, E is equal to I, I, I times times times R, R, R.

05:25:40.360 --> 05:25:42.080
And the crowd went nuts.

05:25:42.080 --> 05:25:45.120
Forty-five thousand people on their feet.

05:25:45.120 --> 05:25:48.000
Ohm's law, Ohm has spoke.

05:25:48.000 --> 05:25:50.120
Actually, I think I'm getting my history mixed up a little.

05:25:50.120 --> 05:25:56.640
I don't think it went down like that, quite like that.

05:25:56.640 --> 05:25:58.040
So this is Ohm's law.

05:25:58.040 --> 05:25:59.320
This is what Ohm really said.

05:25:59.320 --> 05:26:03.560
Voltage is equal to current times resistance in the circuit.

05:26:03.560 --> 05:26:10.160
And of course, instead of the letter E, we could use the letter V, V is equal to I times R.

05:26:10.240 --> 05:26:17.840
Now remember that trick that I showed you with the triangle T in the center?

05:26:17.840 --> 05:26:23.640
Let's put this in that, V, I, R.

05:26:23.640 --> 05:26:27.160
So now you've got all the other variables.

05:26:27.160 --> 05:26:31.400
If I ask you how much resistance is in there in a circuit, you cover R up, it's voltage

05:26:31.400 --> 05:26:33.720
divided by current.

05:26:33.720 --> 05:26:37.520
If I ask you how much current is there in a circuit, you cover up the I and you say

05:26:37.520 --> 05:26:39.800
it's V over R.

05:26:39.800 --> 05:26:44.520
If I ask you how much voltage is there in a circuit, it's I times R.

05:26:44.520 --> 05:26:50.440
So by knowing that one formula, you can figure out all the other algebraic manipulations

05:26:50.440 --> 05:26:51.440
of it.

05:26:51.440 --> 05:26:53.640
Does that make sense?

05:26:53.640 --> 05:27:01.920
So in essence, that is Ohm's law in all of its variables or variations, I should say.

05:27:01.920 --> 05:27:02.920
Algebraic variations.

05:27:02.920 --> 05:27:09.640
So you don't even need to be a math whiz to be able to do it.

05:27:09.640 --> 05:27:14.960
Ohm's law states relationship between current, voltage, and resistance or I is equal to E

05:27:14.960 --> 05:27:20.760
over R or E is equal to I times R or R is equal to E over I, however you want to look

05:27:20.760 --> 05:27:22.760
at it.

05:27:22.760 --> 05:27:29.360
But in the beginning, beginning, beginning, it was V, V, V, or actually E, E, E is equal

05:27:29.360 --> 05:27:37.760
to I times R, R, R, R, 45,000 people on their feet applauding the man with the beret.

05:27:37.760 --> 05:27:43.120
I don't know if you wore a beret or not.

05:27:43.120 --> 05:27:51.320
If I was Ohm, I'd wear a beret.

05:27:51.320 --> 05:27:58.480
Some of the algebraic formulas, if you will, and when I say that, I know there's some people

05:27:58.480 --> 05:28:01.560
in here that cringe like, I got to know all this math or whatever.

05:28:01.560 --> 05:28:02.880
All this is a recipe.

05:28:02.880 --> 05:28:03.880
That's all this is.

05:28:03.880 --> 05:28:07.360
By laying it out like this, it shows you how it needs to be laid out to explain the

05:28:07.360 --> 05:28:08.360
behavior.

05:28:08.360 --> 05:28:12.240
In a series circuit, the same current flows throughout the circuit.

05:28:12.240 --> 05:28:15.240
Total current is equal to the current through resistor one plus the current through resistor

05:28:15.240 --> 05:28:18.440
two plus the current through resistor three, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

05:28:18.440 --> 05:28:26.400
It's a fancy way of saying current is constant in a series circuit.

05:28:26.400 --> 05:28:30.400
Total voltage is equal to voltage drop across one across two across three, et cetera, et

05:28:30.400 --> 05:28:31.400
cetera.

05:28:31.400 --> 05:28:32.400
That's what I'm saying.

05:28:32.400 --> 05:28:40.120
A series circuit is also known as a voltage divider.

05:28:40.120 --> 05:28:44.440
Total resistance in a circuit is the sum of the individual resistances in a circuit.

05:28:44.440 --> 05:28:47.640
That's a fancy way of saying you got to add it all up.

05:28:47.640 --> 05:28:51.480
Resistance is additive in a series circuit.

05:28:51.480 --> 05:28:57.080
In a parallel circuit, total voltage is constant across the parallel network.

05:28:57.080 --> 05:29:00.200
Resistance is formula.

05:29:00.200 --> 05:29:05.920
Down below, total current is equal to i or one plus i or two.

05:29:05.920 --> 05:29:12.840
This says that a parallel circuit is also known as a current divider.

05:29:12.840 --> 05:29:16.200
Oops, there it is.

05:29:16.200 --> 05:29:18.000
That's another formula.

05:29:18.000 --> 05:29:25.800
The reciprocal of the resist, the sum of the reciprocal of the resistances equals the

05:29:26.360 --> 05:29:31.480
reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals equals the total resistance in the circuit because

05:29:31.480 --> 05:29:33.960
when we add resistors in parallel, what are we doing?

05:29:33.960 --> 05:29:40.320
We're actually adding up the conductivity of the individual branches.

05:29:40.320 --> 05:29:44.200
To determine unknown quantities in a circuit, you can kind of use this as a checklist.

05:29:44.200 --> 05:29:45.200
Draw schematic of the circuit.

05:29:45.200 --> 05:29:50.040
You've got to start off with the schematic of the circuit.

05:29:50.040 --> 05:29:55.080
If one has not been provided to you, you need to draw one.

05:29:55.520 --> 05:29:58.680
Troubleshooting circuits off the top of your head doesn't really work well.

05:29:58.680 --> 05:30:03.080
You've got to be looking at the big picture, pun intended.

05:30:03.080 --> 05:30:06.960
Label all known quantities.

05:30:06.960 --> 05:30:13.960
Sometimes you may need to get these known quantities from manufactured data sheets.

05:30:15.680 --> 05:30:19.320
Solve for equivalent circuits.

05:30:19.320 --> 05:30:24.920
Solve for equivalent circuits.

05:30:25.920 --> 05:30:31.440
When I say redraw the circuit, remember when we were dealing with a parallel network,

05:30:31.440 --> 05:30:35.760
two resistors in parallel with each other, you could redraw that circuit and just show

05:30:35.760 --> 05:30:37.920
one resistance.

05:30:37.920 --> 05:30:40.720
Two resistors equals one resistance.

05:30:40.720 --> 05:30:44.200
I could do a simplified, do you want me to do a simplified drawing of my car, electrical

05:30:44.200 --> 05:30:45.440
system right now?

05:30:45.440 --> 05:30:52.440
Want to see this?

05:30:54.920 --> 05:31:01.920
Battery.

05:31:01.920 --> 05:31:05.920
Car.

05:31:05.920 --> 05:31:12.920
And to be honest with you, I'm not being silly.

05:31:14.760 --> 05:31:20.120
I could redraw every circuit of my car and come up with an equivalency and this is what

05:31:20.120 --> 05:31:21.640
it is.

05:31:21.640 --> 05:31:25.920
And I'll tell you what, if you go out to your car and you turn the key and there's nothing

05:31:25.920 --> 05:31:30.680
and you open the door and the dome light doesn't come on, nothing works in the car and all

05:31:30.680 --> 05:31:35.880
of a sudden this is exactly what you've got and there's an open in this circuit and it's

05:31:35.880 --> 05:31:38.760
a pretty big open or your battery's dead.

05:31:38.760 --> 05:31:40.440
I don't think your whole load is dead.

05:31:40.440 --> 05:31:42.760
It's like oh my goodness all my load is dead.

05:31:42.760 --> 05:31:49.760
I've got to replace the load, save the battery, you know what I'm saying?

05:31:50.760 --> 05:31:52.440
It doesn't work like that.

05:31:52.440 --> 05:31:54.920
But do you see the power of troubleshooting like that?

05:31:54.920 --> 05:31:55.920
What's working?

05:31:55.920 --> 05:31:56.920
My car's dead.

05:31:56.920 --> 05:31:57.920
What do you mean it's dead?

05:31:57.920 --> 05:31:58.920
It's a conversation with my wife.

05:31:58.920 --> 05:31:59.920
The car's dead.

05:31:59.920 --> 05:32:00.920
What do you mean it's dead?

05:32:00.920 --> 05:32:02.120
It's dead.

05:32:02.120 --> 05:32:03.680
When you turn the key does it click?

05:32:03.680 --> 05:32:04.680
No.

05:32:04.680 --> 05:32:06.040
When you open the door does dome light come on?

05:32:06.040 --> 05:32:07.040
No.

05:32:07.040 --> 05:32:08.040
Oh it's dead.

05:32:08.040 --> 05:32:10.880
But you've got to ask those questions because it's different.

05:32:10.880 --> 05:32:14.560
When you open the door the dome light comes on but you turn the key, does anything, do

05:32:14.560 --> 05:32:16.480
you hear a click or anything?

05:32:16.480 --> 05:32:19.600
Immediately your troubleshooting, you're narrowing it down to what circuits perhaps

05:32:19.600 --> 05:32:22.000
could be faulty.

05:32:22.000 --> 05:32:26.840
So redraw to simplify.

05:32:26.840 --> 05:32:33.920
There's another big law out there, it's Kirchhoff's law, GR Kirchhoff extended Ohm's law with

05:32:33.920 --> 05:32:40.240
two important statements, Kirchhoff's current law, the algebraic sum of all currents entering

05:32:40.240 --> 05:32:44.880
and leaving a junction is zero, equal to zero.

05:32:44.880 --> 05:32:49.000
Kirchhoff's law is kind of like this, everybody know the intersection down here at the bottom

05:32:49.000 --> 05:32:51.360
of the hill.

05:32:51.360 --> 05:32:55.800
Let's say that you're a traffic cop and you're directing traffic down there in the center

05:32:55.800 --> 05:32:58.520
of the intersection.

05:32:58.520 --> 05:33:03.440
And you've got three cars coming at you this way and you've got five cars coming at you

05:33:03.440 --> 05:33:05.560
this way.

05:33:05.560 --> 05:33:10.520
In a few moments how many cars are going to be going away from you?

05:33:10.520 --> 05:33:13.440
Eight.

05:33:13.440 --> 05:33:17.640
Because three are coming from one way, five are coming the other way, chances are our cars

05:33:17.640 --> 05:33:20.840
don't come and we're just kidding, we're going to back up.

05:33:20.840 --> 05:33:29.400
I've seen them do that down here, but generally speaking, three plus five equals eight.

05:33:29.400 --> 05:33:31.240
Pretty profound, isn't it?

05:33:31.240 --> 05:33:36.440
That's what Kirchhoff came up with, and he made the textbook, you laugh, his name's

05:33:36.440 --> 05:33:39.720
in the textbook, my name's not.

05:33:39.720 --> 05:33:45.080
That's Kirchhoff's current law, and what Kirchhoff is saying is again the total current entering

05:33:45.080 --> 05:33:46.080
has to exit.

05:33:46.840 --> 05:33:52.520
And it's really a profound troubleshooting tool because what you could do, what you could

05:33:52.520 --> 05:34:00.960
do is I say, I've got three amps of current flowing at me and I've got eight amps flowing

05:34:00.960 --> 05:34:02.960
away from me.

05:34:02.960 --> 05:34:05.320
What does that tell me?

05:34:05.320 --> 05:34:09.760
I must have five more amps coming in from another direction that I'm not aware of and

05:34:09.760 --> 05:34:12.760
there's only one other circuit, so I must have five amps.

05:34:12.760 --> 05:34:19.440
And I tell you what, you could take that information to the bank, it's a law of physics, and it's

05:34:19.440 --> 05:34:26.560
so powerful in troubleshooting, it's extremely powerful in troubleshooting.

05:34:26.560 --> 05:34:32.320
There was a guy that was in my division, one of our techs in the Navy, goofy guy, I'll

05:34:32.320 --> 05:34:37.200
tell you some stories about him and his wife in the future.

05:34:37.200 --> 05:34:45.040
But this dude, it just, you know, every day was a mystery what you'd see this guy into.

05:34:45.040 --> 05:34:51.400
So military equipment is put together really, really, really well and we didn't have cordless

05:34:51.400 --> 05:34:55.160
screwdrivers, so you used to have to take stuff apart by hand.

05:34:55.160 --> 05:34:57.560
So I come in and I'm like, you know, what are you working on?

05:34:57.560 --> 05:35:01.320
He's like, yeah, we've got a problem with this unit here and I want to take this current

05:35:01.320 --> 05:35:05.200
reading, you know, and you know, in order to take a current reading I've got to open

05:35:05.200 --> 05:35:09.080
the circuit.

05:35:09.080 --> 05:35:14.360
So you're going to remove this access plate here with 64 screws and you're going to remove

05:35:14.360 --> 05:35:18.520
that, you're going to get in there and take that reading, you know, why don't you use

05:35:18.520 --> 05:35:21.880
this here which is called Kirchhoff's law, okay?

05:35:21.880 --> 05:35:25.320
You got this amount of current going this way, this amount of current coming in and

05:35:25.320 --> 05:35:30.560
the unknown is what you want to measure here, you're going to use Kirchhoff's law and determine

05:35:30.560 --> 05:35:35.160
with 100% accuracy how much current is flowing through that point, you don't have to take

05:35:35.240 --> 05:35:40.760
the panel off, you don't have to remove the screws, you don't even have to use a meter,

05:35:40.760 --> 05:35:46.760
you could use math, put the meter down, math, solve the problem and to be honest with you,

05:35:46.760 --> 05:35:51.480
these are the technicians that I look for, these are the technicians that I want to hire.

05:35:51.480 --> 05:35:57.120
If you start the troubleshooting process with the manual and then you're going through tracing,

05:35:57.120 --> 05:36:04.620
redrawing, applying these principles, these laws, before you go ripping into stuff, you're

05:36:04.660 --> 05:36:09.260
going to save yourself a lot of grief, a lot of grief.

05:36:09.260 --> 05:36:14.980
It's like going to work for Boeing, Boeing builds big airplanes, on the tail of their

05:36:14.980 --> 05:36:20.020
airplanes they put a light that blinks so other airplanes don't hit their airplane when

05:36:20.020 --> 05:36:25.740
it's flying, you know, I'm not making this stuff up, it's kind of like the light doesn't

05:36:25.740 --> 05:36:26.740
work.

05:36:26.740 --> 05:36:29.620
Well let's get a man lifting, get up there and take it apart and whatever, you get a

05:36:29.620 --> 05:36:34.300
man lift, you get all harnessed up, you know, your five stories in the air, you're manipulating

05:36:34.300 --> 05:36:39.580
the controls and all of a sudden, oops, you put a dent in the rudder.

05:36:39.580 --> 05:36:44.460
When you could have done some troubleshooting, probably through an access panel down below,

05:36:44.460 --> 05:36:48.740
using Kirchoff's law, how much current do I have flowing up there, what's going on,

05:36:48.740 --> 05:36:53.300
then make some determinations, is it really essential for you to get up there and take

05:36:53.300 --> 05:36:58.420
that assembly apart, get a man lift, harness yourself up, run the risk of plowing into

05:36:58.420 --> 05:37:02.920
the rudder by accident, I mean accidents happen, so always look at that kind of stuff.

05:37:02.920 --> 05:37:07.440
Is there an easier way of going about getting the reading that I want?

05:37:07.440 --> 05:37:14.320
That's the power of Ohm's law, that's the power of Kirchoff's law.

05:37:14.320 --> 05:37:22.600
Kirchoff's law also has a voltage application and Kirchoff says the algebraic sum of all

05:37:22.600 --> 05:37:26.860
voltages around a closed circuit equals zero.

05:37:26.860 --> 05:37:36.180
This is a fancy way of saying voltage rise equals voltage drop, and you know how much

05:37:36.180 --> 05:37:38.900
you're left over with, zero.

05:37:38.900 --> 05:37:41.560
We talked about this last week, didn't we?

05:37:41.560 --> 05:37:44.680
We talked about this last week.

05:37:44.680 --> 05:37:48.960
If you put 12 volts in, how many volts are going to get used, 12.

05:37:48.960 --> 05:37:53.700
If you're troubleshooting and you can only account for 11.5 volts, that half a volt

05:37:53.700 --> 05:37:57.660
is somewhere that it doesn't belong.

05:37:57.660 --> 05:38:00.540
You got 120 volts that are supposed to be coming out of these outlets.

05:38:00.540 --> 05:38:05.780
If you plug it in, you only get 98 volts, something's wrong.

05:38:05.780 --> 05:38:10.180
If you could go to that box and prove that you got 120 across each leg, but you go to

05:38:10.180 --> 05:38:14.580
an outlet in your home and you get 98, something's wrong.

05:38:14.580 --> 05:38:17.780
You find where the missing voltage is, you find the problem.

05:38:17.780 --> 05:38:21.220
So again, does this sound really basic?

05:38:21.220 --> 05:38:24.260
What goes in must come out.

05:38:24.260 --> 05:38:25.260
It is.

05:38:25.260 --> 05:38:30.180
But I'll tell you what, when you get to industry, you'll deceive me.

05:38:30.180 --> 05:38:33.180
You're going to get your head to all, ooh, wow, ooh, it's complex.

05:38:33.180 --> 05:38:36.660
I never worked on one of these before, oh, geez, it's got to be something really, it's

05:38:36.660 --> 05:38:40.060
got to be the flux capacitor must have failed.

05:38:40.060 --> 05:38:43.420
I missed that day when Joe talked about the flux capacitor.

05:38:43.420 --> 05:38:46.060
Keep it basic.

05:38:46.060 --> 05:38:47.660
Keep it basic.

05:38:47.660 --> 05:38:52.300
The fundamental parts of the circuit, the source, the load, the internal wiring, the

05:38:52.300 --> 05:39:00.300
controlling device, the protective device, you got to be able to prove every one of those

05:39:00.300 --> 05:39:05.660
parts, functional parts is functional.

05:39:05.660 --> 05:39:09.420
And how are you going to learn how to do that in the lab by doing your labs?

05:39:09.420 --> 05:39:13.060
Theoretically, how are you going to come to appreciate that by attending a lecture and

05:39:13.060 --> 05:39:15.020
doing your rent assignments?

05:39:15.020 --> 05:39:17.620
Because that's what this industry is about.

05:39:17.620 --> 05:39:20.100
It's about the written theory, which is kind of cool.

05:39:20.100 --> 05:39:26.260
Some of you had back-breaking jobs in the past, okay?

05:39:26.260 --> 05:39:29.300
I never worked a hard day in my life.

05:39:29.300 --> 05:39:31.580
Actually I did, but it was all mental.

05:39:31.580 --> 05:39:36.340
And I'll tell you what, there were days working on my system.

05:39:36.340 --> 05:39:38.700
That's the other thing too, you know, it's one of the reasons that we all try to treat

05:39:38.700 --> 05:39:40.660
you as professionals here in this program.

05:39:40.660 --> 05:39:42.940
When you go to industry, you're going to be professionals.

05:39:42.940 --> 05:39:46.700
If your equipment ain't broke, they don't care what you're doing.

05:39:46.700 --> 05:39:52.420
But when it's broke, they expect you to be there bringing it back from the dead.

05:39:52.420 --> 05:39:53.420
No questions asked.

05:39:53.420 --> 05:39:58.660
Well, I'm a union guy and do I get time and a half and fix the freaking gear?

05:39:58.660 --> 05:39:59.660
Get it up and running.

05:39:59.660 --> 05:40:01.300
That's all they care about.

05:40:01.300 --> 05:40:06.060
And actually there are some union maintenance jobs that, you know, do pay you well if you've

05:40:06.060 --> 05:40:08.620
got to put in that over time.

05:40:08.620 --> 05:40:12.940
But generally speaking, this is where you make your money.

05:40:12.940 --> 05:40:15.980
This is the most, I tell you what, I'm taking a lot of time with this chapter.

05:40:15.980 --> 05:40:18.940
This is one of the most important chapters of the book.

05:40:18.940 --> 05:40:24.140
It's one of the most important chapters of this entire program.

05:40:24.140 --> 05:40:27.340
I could talk for a week about just this chapter.

05:40:27.340 --> 05:40:30.340
And you know what the beauty of it is?

05:40:30.340 --> 05:40:31.340
You've all been here.

05:40:31.340 --> 05:40:32.740
This is your third week in this program.

05:40:32.740 --> 05:40:34.460
You understand what I'm saying?

05:40:34.460 --> 05:40:37.620
Do you understand what I'm saying?

05:40:37.620 --> 05:40:41.540
The message isn't going to get any worse.

05:40:41.540 --> 05:40:43.540
It's not.

05:40:43.540 --> 05:40:51.180
The most complex electronic systems could be rapidly troubleshot, keeping these fundamental

05:40:51.180 --> 05:40:52.900
skill sets in mind.

05:40:52.900 --> 05:40:57.580
Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's Law, five basic parts of a circuit.

05:40:57.580 --> 05:40:58.580
Is my source good?

05:40:58.580 --> 05:40:59.580
Is my load good?

05:40:59.580 --> 05:41:00.580
Is it the interconnects?

05:41:00.580 --> 05:41:01.780
Can I prove that?

05:41:01.780 --> 05:41:06.980
The other thing you've got to do as a technician is just pay attention to what can you check

05:41:06.980 --> 05:41:09.100
quickly?

05:41:09.100 --> 05:41:10.980
What can you check quickly?

05:41:11.740 --> 05:41:17.500
Again, like my former esteemed colleague on the submarine, Mike Wirep, was his name.

05:41:17.500 --> 05:41:21.340
Wirep, weird name.

05:41:21.340 --> 05:41:26.020
He'd be the kind of guy like, well, you know, I think it's the wiring, Joe.

05:41:26.020 --> 05:41:28.620
I want to look at the, I want to do continuity checks.

05:41:28.620 --> 05:41:31.940
I mean, you're talking these big multi-pin connectors and you're going to disconnect

05:41:31.940 --> 05:41:32.940
and check the continuity.

05:41:32.940 --> 05:41:36.260
It could take months.

05:41:36.260 --> 05:41:38.700
You really think that's the problem?

05:41:38.700 --> 05:41:44.420
You really think a wire like broke in the middle of the night behind that equipment

05:41:44.420 --> 05:41:45.420
rack?

05:41:45.420 --> 05:41:48.980
You know, I don't think so.

05:41:48.980 --> 05:41:52.900
I think it's, you know, maybe something like controlling device.

05:41:52.900 --> 05:41:57.060
Have you tried reloading the software, you know, the virgin version of software that

05:41:57.060 --> 05:41:58.060
we have in that safe?

05:41:58.060 --> 05:42:01.620
Why don't you try reloading the version of software?

05:42:01.620 --> 05:42:04.020
Controlling device is what I'm thinking, right?

05:42:04.020 --> 05:42:06.180
Reload the firmware, software.

05:42:06.180 --> 05:42:07.180
Reboot the system.

05:42:07.180 --> 05:42:08.740
That's what the problem manifests itself.

05:42:08.740 --> 05:42:11.460
Oh, Joe, most amazing thing happened.

05:42:11.460 --> 05:42:13.260
We loaded the software, started working.

05:42:13.260 --> 05:42:14.260
Wow.

05:42:14.260 --> 05:42:18.020
Good thing it didn't like take, you know, six months and check the continuity of all

05:42:18.020 --> 05:42:20.860
them wires in the back of the equipment rack.

05:42:20.860 --> 05:42:25.060
What would the odds have been?

05:42:25.060 --> 05:42:30.940
In summary, the electric circuit contains a voltage source, a load, a conductor, the

05:42:30.940 --> 05:42:35.220
two optional ones, controlling device, protective device.

05:42:35.220 --> 05:42:36.220
Don't second-guess those.

05:42:36.260 --> 05:42:41.580
Hey, you want another troubleshooting hint?

05:42:41.580 --> 05:42:47.020
Another type of protective device, it's called a resettable fuse.

05:42:47.020 --> 05:42:49.020
Resettable fuse.

05:42:49.020 --> 05:42:57.100
A lot of consumer electronic products, DVD players, VHS players, stuff like that, tuners,

05:42:57.100 --> 05:42:59.660
TV tuners, have these resettable fuses.

05:42:59.660 --> 05:43:04.540
And a lot of times what happens is the device will not work.

05:43:04.540 --> 05:43:05.540
So it's kind of funny.

05:43:06.180 --> 05:43:09.500
You know, my family, they all know, you know, Joe, and the family, he's the electronics

05:43:09.500 --> 05:43:10.500
guy.

05:43:10.500 --> 05:43:12.900
You've got a problem, you know, and they always call me with the problem.

05:43:12.900 --> 05:43:17.300
So it's amazing how many things I've fixed from afar.

05:43:17.300 --> 05:43:19.820
They tell me what the problem is, you know.

05:43:19.820 --> 05:43:24.620
And a lot of these have been with DVD, VHS players, things like that in the past.

05:43:24.620 --> 05:43:29.340
So what I'm going to have you do is I've got a ritual that I'm going to go through here

05:43:29.340 --> 05:43:30.340
on the West Coast.

05:43:30.340 --> 05:43:35.180
I want you to unplug that device, okay, and what's the most comfortable chair you have

05:43:35.180 --> 05:43:36.180
in the house?

05:43:36.180 --> 05:43:39.860
I want you to remove it and put it in the most comfortable chair of the house overnight.

05:43:39.860 --> 05:43:45.780
And I've got some rituals and some telepathic, you know, things that I'm going to do.

05:43:45.780 --> 05:43:48.860
And then I'm going to call you back in the morning and let you know when I'm done.

05:43:48.860 --> 05:43:50.420
Okay, and I'll go plug it in.

05:43:50.420 --> 05:43:51.420
Holy cow, it works!

05:43:51.420 --> 05:43:53.580
How did you do that, you know?

05:43:53.580 --> 05:43:59.660
It's all about chi, okay?

05:43:59.660 --> 05:44:01.780
Freakin' resettable fuse.

05:44:01.780 --> 05:44:04.620
For whatever reason, there was a glitch that tripped that.

05:44:04.620 --> 05:44:08.660
You got to unplug it, totally discharge the whole unit, plug it back in, it reboots thinking

05:44:08.660 --> 05:44:09.660
it's back at the factory.

05:44:09.660 --> 05:44:13.620
The first day it was ever made, problem goes away.

05:44:13.620 --> 05:44:16.420
You got to make sure you give it overnight to be able to do that.

05:44:16.420 --> 05:44:17.860
So I've brought back countless.

05:44:17.860 --> 05:44:23.340
I've had a lot of people come in here, colleagues, hey Joe, my amplifier, this amp doesn't work

05:44:23.340 --> 05:44:24.340
anymore.

05:44:24.340 --> 05:44:28.220
I can have, you could have it if you could fix it, okay, because I went out and bought

05:44:28.220 --> 05:44:29.220
a new one.

05:44:29.220 --> 05:44:31.060
I figured this thing is toast.

05:44:31.060 --> 05:44:34.980
I go plug it in, it works.

05:44:34.980 --> 05:44:39.820
By you unplugging it, you fix it, I don't even go on to it with people.

05:44:39.820 --> 05:44:42.860
We would be surprised the amount of stuff that you could fix by simply unplugging it

05:44:42.860 --> 05:44:46.380
for 24 hours, plug it overnight, not even 24 hours, plug it back in, you're good to

05:44:46.380 --> 05:44:47.380
go.

05:44:47.380 --> 05:44:49.900
Why does it take time?

05:44:49.900 --> 05:44:54.340
Because these resettable fuses, there's a time delay before they're actually solid

05:44:54.340 --> 05:44:58.620
state devices, before they physically reset and allow the circuit to function properly

05:44:58.620 --> 05:44:59.620
again.

05:44:59.620 --> 05:45:03.500
So you want to get it back to that neutral state of when it left the factory.

05:45:03.500 --> 05:45:09.860
I don't know, in mobile audio, did you encounter any of that stuff?

05:45:09.860 --> 05:45:14.180
Or by disconnecting it for a period of time, would fix the problem?

05:45:14.180 --> 05:45:20.620
Yeah, I mean, when you did a harder reset, touch positive, negative together, make sure

05:45:20.620 --> 05:45:28.620
the circuit's completely different on the EnerGuy, airbag lights, some control systems

05:45:28.620 --> 05:45:36.620
if you get a hard reset, would do that to make sure that everything just paints inside.

05:45:36.620 --> 05:45:39.620
So the fastest way would be to...

05:45:39.620 --> 05:45:40.620
Yeah.

05:45:40.620 --> 05:45:43.620
And that's the other thing that you can do even with a DVD player, if you just short

05:45:43.620 --> 05:45:47.660
it, not unplug it, make sure it's unplugged and then short it, keep the leads shorted

05:45:47.660 --> 05:45:50.780
together, then that's a kind of a fast track.

05:45:50.780 --> 05:45:54.620
But still, there are some capacitors we'll talk about in the future, store energy in

05:45:54.620 --> 05:45:58.500
the form of an electrostatic field that may keep stuff alive for a considerable amount

05:45:58.500 --> 05:45:59.500
of time.

05:45:59.500 --> 05:46:00.500
So...

05:46:00.500 --> 05:46:03.500
Flux capacitors.

05:46:03.500 --> 05:46:06.940
Flux capacitors.

05:46:06.940 --> 05:46:10.540
Current path, we talked about series circuits, parallel circuits and complex circuits, series

05:46:10.540 --> 05:46:11.540
parallel circuits.

05:46:11.540 --> 05:46:16.580
We talked about current flow, negative to positive, varied by changing the voltage or the resistance.

05:46:16.580 --> 05:46:22.060
We talked about Ohm's Law and also determining unknown quantities in a circuit as well as

05:46:22.060 --> 05:46:23.660
Kirchhoff's Law.

05:46:23.660 --> 05:46:29.460
For current, current is constant in a series circuit, Ohm's Law.

05:46:29.460 --> 05:46:33.460
All the current entering a node must exit the node, Kirchhoff's Law.

05:46:33.460 --> 05:46:41.860
Powerful, powerful stuff prevents you from removing 64 screws by hand to take one reading.

05:46:41.860 --> 05:46:44.300
He used to think I was an A-hole.

05:46:44.300 --> 05:46:46.900
This here is Kirchhoff's Law.

05:46:46.900 --> 05:46:48.660
I stayed awake during that class.

05:46:48.660 --> 05:46:52.620
You could use this here tool to prevent yourself from removing 64 screws.

05:46:52.620 --> 05:46:53.620
Chronic.

05:46:53.620 --> 05:46:55.620
Chronic, you're a freaking jerk.

05:46:55.620 --> 05:46:56.620
No.

05:46:56.620 --> 05:46:57.620
No, I'm not.

05:46:57.620 --> 05:47:03.020
I think the guy that's removing 64 screws and then is going to strip the screws, break

05:47:03.020 --> 05:47:04.660
the heads off.

05:47:04.660 --> 05:47:05.660
That's another story.

05:47:05.660 --> 05:47:08.780
There was a dude, a local company, can't make this stuff up.

05:47:08.780 --> 05:47:09.780
Broke heads of screws off.

05:47:09.780 --> 05:47:14.940
The product's ready for shipping, got freaking instant glue, glued the heads back on.

05:47:14.940 --> 05:47:18.580
First time it was out in the field and they took a panel off for maintenance, snap, snap.

05:47:18.580 --> 05:47:19.580
What the heck is this?

05:47:19.580 --> 05:47:20.580
What is that on there?

05:47:20.580 --> 05:47:21.580
They look at it.

05:47:21.580 --> 05:47:22.580
It's like this instant glue.

05:47:22.580 --> 05:47:23.580
Who worked on it last at a company?

05:47:23.580 --> 05:47:24.580
Why'd you do that?

05:47:24.580 --> 05:47:27.020
But, well, I didn't want to get in trouble.

05:47:27.020 --> 05:47:29.860
You're out of here, you know, that instant.

05:47:29.860 --> 05:47:32.540
You can't make stuff like this up.

05:47:32.540 --> 05:47:35.540
Try to avoid it.

05:47:35.540 --> 05:47:36.540
Questions?

05:47:36.540 --> 05:47:45.180
Yes, and that's basically what we're studying is the theory.

05:47:45.180 --> 05:47:46.740
Laws of physics.

05:47:46.740 --> 05:47:54.180
We have proven that although this is theory, these are laws of physics, voltage, the relationship

05:47:54.180 --> 05:48:00.300
between voltage current and resistance, the relationship between voltage current and power,

05:48:00.300 --> 05:48:02.300
Kirchoff's laws, they're laws of physics.

05:48:02.300 --> 05:48:09.300
We know that we could prove with 100% accuracy that this is how they behave.

05:48:09.300 --> 05:48:18.300
Also, in science, generally, a theory is something that is provable all to an infinitesimal

05:48:18.300 --> 05:48:23.860
degree and a postulate is something that's unproven.

05:48:23.860 --> 05:48:24.860
Very good.

05:48:24.860 --> 05:48:25.860
Thank you.

05:48:25.860 --> 05:48:26.860
Okay.

05:48:26.860 --> 05:48:30.380
Hey, before we wrap things up, because we've got another chapter to do, okay?

05:48:30.380 --> 05:48:34.660
Well, fortunately, one of the reasons that I took this amount of time here is this other

05:48:34.660 --> 05:48:38.340
chapter is not a chapter that I am going to lecture on.

05:48:38.340 --> 05:48:44.460
It's another chapter that you've got to watch some videos on.

05:48:44.460 --> 05:48:46.460
There are four videos.

05:48:46.460 --> 05:48:52.740
When you go to the Google site, it's going to say, follow this link to watch test equipment

05:48:52.740 --> 05:48:57.180
videos, okay?

05:48:57.180 --> 05:49:05.100
And there are four videos that I want you to watch and you're responsible for the information.

05:49:05.100 --> 05:49:11.860
I think all of you kind of figured out that I'm the kind of guy that likes lectures, okay?

05:49:11.860 --> 05:49:13.780
I like to have fun with lecture.

05:49:13.780 --> 05:49:18.460
Hopefully you're not falling asleep during my lectures, but I like lectures and it gives

05:49:18.460 --> 05:49:21.900
me quality face-to-face time with all of you.

05:49:22.300 --> 05:49:27.260
However, that being said, I also, I'm not the smartest guy, but I know that a picture

05:49:27.260 --> 05:49:29.380
is worth a thousand words.

05:49:29.380 --> 05:49:32.940
So if I could have you watch a 15-minute video, that's a lot of frames.

05:49:32.940 --> 05:49:34.060
That's a lot of pictures.

05:49:34.060 --> 05:49:35.740
That's a lot of data.

05:49:35.740 --> 05:49:39.380
More time than I have to preach to you about this stuff.

05:49:39.380 --> 05:49:40.660
The four videos.

05:49:40.660 --> 05:49:47.900
The first video is going to be a basic introduction to digital multimeters versus analog meters,

05:49:47.900 --> 05:49:48.900
okay?

05:49:48.900 --> 05:49:51.580
The analog, when I speak of analog, this is what I'm talking about here.

05:49:51.580 --> 05:49:56.500
We can, old school.

05:49:56.500 --> 05:50:01.340
The digital meter is going to be based on a Fluke 70 series meter that quite frankly

05:50:01.340 --> 05:50:07.660
all meters are really measured against.

05:50:07.660 --> 05:50:15.500
The second video is going to talk specifically about how to perform resistance and continuity

05:50:15.500 --> 05:50:22.740
measurements using an analog meter and a digital multimeter.

05:50:22.740 --> 05:50:26.420
Resistance and continuity.

05:50:26.420 --> 05:50:33.160
The third video is going to talk about measuring current and voltage.

05:50:33.160 --> 05:50:38.860
So by the end of those three videos, you're going to know how to measure resistance, current,

05:50:38.860 --> 05:50:44.860
and voltage.

05:50:44.860 --> 05:50:49.140
If you know how to do that, let me tell you, you've got it going on.

05:50:49.140 --> 05:50:50.780
You've got it going on.

05:50:50.780 --> 05:50:55.940
Because those are three of the big four properties that all of this is based on.

05:50:55.940 --> 05:50:57.660
So these are very, very important videos.

05:50:57.660 --> 05:51:01.860
One of the reasons that we have them on videos and upload it is so that you can watch over

05:51:01.860 --> 05:51:06.540
and over again to make sure you understand exactly what the process is.

05:51:06.540 --> 05:51:10.340
So by the time you get into the lab, you can apply that.

05:51:10.340 --> 05:51:12.220
Very, very critical.

05:51:12.220 --> 05:51:14.260
Like how to diffuse a nuclear bomb.

05:51:14.260 --> 05:51:18.380
You want to get it right the first time.

05:51:18.380 --> 05:51:23.180
The fourth video is produced by Fluke Corporation.

05:51:23.180 --> 05:51:25.940
How many of you know about Fluke?

05:51:25.940 --> 05:51:27.900
Fluke is the real deal.

05:51:27.900 --> 05:51:29.980
The real deal.

05:51:29.980 --> 05:51:32.340
Expensive local company.

05:51:32.340 --> 05:51:33.860
John Fluke.

05:51:33.860 --> 05:51:37.300
John Fluke, former submarine guy.

05:51:37.300 --> 05:51:38.900
Got to support his product.

05:51:38.900 --> 05:51:41.380
He was before my time.

05:51:42.380 --> 05:51:47.860
But yeah, John Fluke is a former submarineer.

05:51:47.860 --> 05:51:51.420
They produce this video and it kind of, it's a drama.

05:51:51.420 --> 05:51:52.420
Not a drama.

05:51:52.420 --> 05:51:55.700
Like, oh, I can't believe he's going to test the voltage.

05:51:55.700 --> 05:51:57.940
You know, it's got a story behind it.

05:51:57.940 --> 05:52:01.620
There's a kid who's working on the job and he blows up something and his boss is like,

05:52:01.620 --> 05:52:05.540
you know, you need to go out to the community college and talk with the electronics professor.

05:52:05.540 --> 05:52:11.540
And basically it reviews how to perform basic measurements, resistance, current, and voltage

05:52:11.540 --> 05:52:15.380
with a Fluke 70 Series DMM.

05:52:15.380 --> 05:52:16.740
That's the fourth video.

05:52:16.740 --> 05:52:19.220
So all of the information of those videos is testable.

05:52:19.220 --> 05:52:21.940
The link is on the Google sites.

05:52:21.940 --> 05:52:23.500
You can watch it at the privacy of your own home.

05:52:23.500 --> 05:52:29.620
You can watch it on these machines, but that is what we are doing in lieu of this chapter

05:52:29.620 --> 05:52:30.620
on test equipment.

05:52:30.620 --> 05:52:34.540
Does anybody have any questions on anything that I covered tonight?

05:52:35.540 --> 05:52:36.540
Yes.

05:52:38.540 --> 05:52:40.540
No, the Google site.

05:52:40.540 --> 05:52:42.540
It's the sites that were in the syllabus.

05:52:42.540 --> 05:52:43.540
Okay.

05:52:43.540 --> 05:52:44.540
This right here.

05:52:44.540 --> 05:52:49.900
If you go to that Google sites, the electronics, LWTC electronics, you're going to see a link

05:52:49.900 --> 05:52:50.900
in there.

05:52:50.900 --> 05:52:53.260
Follow this link for test equipment videos.

05:52:53.260 --> 05:52:58.980
You click on that and then it brings you to some server in Peru that we've uploaded those

05:52:58.980 --> 05:53:01.580
videos to.

05:53:01.580 --> 05:53:03.980
We got stuff all over the place.

05:53:03.980 --> 05:53:06.700
You know what the alternative is?

05:53:06.700 --> 05:53:09.060
You got to sit here and watch it all.

05:53:09.060 --> 05:53:10.060
We've really tried.

05:53:10.060 --> 05:53:14.980
I got my TAs working very, very hard to get as much stuff as we can uploaded to the web

05:53:14.980 --> 05:53:19.780
so that you could look at this stuff morning, noon, and night.

05:53:19.780 --> 05:53:23.940
Any other questions on anything in general?

05:53:23.940 --> 05:53:27.740
Make sure you get that video watched over the next 24, oh, those videos watched over

05:53:27.740 --> 05:53:29.740
the next 24 hours.

05:53:30.500 --> 05:53:32.000
All right.

05:53:32.000 --> 05:53:40.740
A chapter that I really like talking about is chapter seven because the title is Power

05:53:40.740 --> 05:53:43.500
and I like power.

05:53:43.500 --> 05:53:44.500
I like power.

05:53:44.500 --> 05:53:45.500
Remember what was it?

05:53:45.500 --> 05:53:46.500
Tim the tool man?

05:53:46.500 --> 05:53:47.500
Remember power?

05:53:47.500 --> 05:53:49.340
You could never have enough power.

05:53:49.340 --> 05:53:51.660
The gas-powered blender.

05:53:51.660 --> 05:53:53.500
I think it's a great idea.

05:53:53.500 --> 05:53:57.700
If you've ever mixed any frozen concoctions, having a little bit extra power to chop that

05:53:57.700 --> 05:54:03.220
ice up and get just the perfect consistency is not a bad thing.

05:54:03.220 --> 05:54:05.140
I've never driven a car.

05:54:05.140 --> 05:54:09.020
I've never driven a car that's had too much power.

05:54:09.020 --> 05:54:12.260
Actually, no, and I did have the opportunity.

05:54:12.260 --> 05:54:15.980
I went through Richard Petty's driving school two years on a row.

05:54:15.980 --> 05:54:18.900
This was probably about 10 years ago.

05:54:18.900 --> 05:54:21.380
I thought these cars would have governors on them.

05:54:21.380 --> 05:54:26.060
You go through and they're going to turn some goofball like me loose in a Winston Cup car

05:54:26.100 --> 05:54:27.100
at the time.

05:54:27.100 --> 05:54:28.100
No governors.

05:54:28.100 --> 05:54:29.980
That car had a lot of power.

05:54:29.980 --> 05:54:30.980
Putting the right hand.

05:54:30.980 --> 05:54:31.980
It's scary.

05:54:31.980 --> 05:54:37.180
I got the Drive Las Vegas Motor Speedway and I'll tell you the whole story sometime, but

05:54:37.180 --> 05:54:39.780
actually I got the fastest times of the day.

05:54:39.780 --> 05:54:44.460
I was at the top of the reader board, Joe Greenock, it was pretty freaking cool.

05:54:44.460 --> 05:54:49.780
So I was thinking about quitting my day job and becoming a NASCAR driver.

05:54:49.780 --> 05:54:55.140
Luckily I have good friends that woke me up to reality, but the power was fabulous.

05:54:55.140 --> 05:55:00.300
So I think as much as I love aviation and aerospace, I see the Blue Angels in town.

05:55:00.300 --> 05:55:05.500
I look at those F-18s and knowing my own piloting skills, and I think I'm a pretty good pilot,

05:55:05.500 --> 05:55:10.340
but knowing my own pilot skills, I probably last probably five or six seconds in one of

05:55:10.340 --> 05:55:13.780
those things before there'd be a fireball going down the runway, a little bit too much

05:55:13.780 --> 05:55:17.460
power for me.

05:55:17.460 --> 05:55:24.020
Power in electronics is in electrical is very, very important because it's the metric that

05:55:24.020 --> 05:55:27.220
we use to determine output.

05:55:27.220 --> 05:55:31.300
It's the metric that we use to determine efficiency.

05:55:31.300 --> 05:55:37.020
It's the metric that we use to show us how much energy we're converting into work.

05:55:37.020 --> 05:55:40.580
So this is a really big chapter.

05:55:40.580 --> 05:55:47.780
If you fully understand the implications of power, you're going to be a better technician.

05:55:47.780 --> 05:55:52.260
You truly are, because looking at inconsistencies in power output is going to start to paint

05:55:52.260 --> 05:55:58.340
a story, tell you a story, and paint you a picture of what's taking place with a system.

05:55:58.340 --> 05:56:03.660
So with that being said, let's jump and immerse ourselves into chapter seven power.

05:56:03.660 --> 05:56:07.940
After completing this chapter, we're going to be able to define power as it relates

05:56:07.940 --> 05:56:15.020
to electric circuits, state the relationship of current and voltage, solve for power consumption

05:56:15.020 --> 05:56:21.380
in electrical circuit, determine the total power consumption in a series parallel and

05:56:21.380 --> 05:56:24.980
a series parallel circuit.

05:56:24.980 --> 05:56:32.620
Now power relates to the rate at which work is being done.

05:56:32.620 --> 05:56:36.560
Relates to the rate at which work is being done.

05:56:36.560 --> 05:56:42.220
Work is done when a force causes motion.

05:56:42.220 --> 05:56:46.940
I'm sure my kids, I got three kids, three boys, they're all grown, the youngest is going to

05:56:46.940 --> 05:56:52.100
graduate, new dub here in June.

05:56:52.100 --> 05:56:55.140
Business finance, he's going to make me, he's going to make a bunch of money and then hire

05:56:55.140 --> 05:56:59.020
me to hang out with them.

05:56:59.020 --> 05:57:00.340
He's going to do really well.

05:57:00.340 --> 05:57:04.860
My kids probably all think I'm a jerk because I know stuff like this.

05:57:04.860 --> 05:57:10.220
We'd have family cleanup day around the yard, and I'm out in the front yard digging ditches

05:57:10.220 --> 05:57:15.300
and doing whatever, and the kids are in the back yard, it's supposed to be raking leaves.

05:57:15.300 --> 05:57:21.860
When I come around the corner and they're standing there leaning on the rake, what are

05:57:21.860 --> 05:57:22.860
you guys doing?

05:57:22.860 --> 05:57:23.860
We're working.

05:57:23.860 --> 05:57:29.780
No, you're not because work is done when a force causes motion, right?

05:57:29.780 --> 05:57:34.740
So by simply standing there bracing yourself against the rake, you're definitely not working

05:57:34.740 --> 05:57:41.420
to get back to raking, so obviously me knowing this stuff, they think I'm a jerk.

05:57:41.420 --> 05:57:45.540
So work is done when a force causes motion.

05:57:45.540 --> 05:57:51.420
Now check this out, force, voltage, current, motion.

05:57:51.420 --> 05:57:55.740
Voltage creates current causing electrons to move in a circuit.

05:57:55.740 --> 05:57:59.420
So if you've got a voltage and you've got current, you're doing work.

05:57:59.420 --> 05:58:03.940
May not be the work you want to get done, but you're doing work because a force causes

05:58:03.940 --> 05:58:09.260
motion, voltage causes current, and we know voltage is pressure, current is movement,

05:58:09.780 --> 05:58:14.420
it's got to be power, make sense?

05:58:14.420 --> 05:58:23.660
Now electric power rate is the instantaneous rate at which work is done, instantaneous.

05:58:23.660 --> 05:58:27.660
That means take a snapshot right now, how much work is being done right now?

05:58:27.660 --> 05:58:28.660
What's the pressure?

05:58:28.660 --> 05:58:29.660
What's the current?

05:58:29.660 --> 05:58:32.340
Right now, instantaneous value, make sense?

05:58:32.340 --> 05:58:36.460
Now that's not how the power company, it's actually odd the power company is called the

05:58:36.460 --> 05:58:39.820
power company, let's go back to that.

05:58:39.820 --> 05:58:44.580
Power relates to the rate at which work is being done, work is done when a force causes

05:58:44.580 --> 05:58:45.580
motion.

05:58:45.580 --> 05:58:49.620
How many of you here pay money on a monthly basis to the power company?

05:58:49.620 --> 05:58:51.180
Why are they called the power company?

05:58:51.180 --> 05:58:54.740
All they're really providing us with is voltage, you know who the power company is?

05:58:54.740 --> 05:58:55.740
It's you.

05:58:55.740 --> 05:58:59.740
It's to take money out of our wall, it's exactly.

05:58:59.740 --> 05:59:00.740
Who's the power company?

05:59:00.740 --> 05:59:04.820
You're actually the power company, you're providing the current path if you will for

05:59:04.820 --> 05:59:05.940
the current to flow.

05:59:05.940 --> 05:59:07.900
They're just providing you with the voltage.

05:59:07.900 --> 05:59:10.980
They should be called the voltage company, okay?

05:59:10.980 --> 05:59:13.300
I mean realistically, that's all they're doing.

05:59:13.300 --> 05:59:18.100
When you pay for electrical service to your home, all they're providing you with is a

05:59:18.100 --> 05:59:22.020
voltage, a electrical pressure at your box.

05:59:22.020 --> 05:59:26.020
It's up to you to hit the breakers, turn the circuits on, turn your lamps on, turn your

05:59:26.020 --> 05:59:28.580
appliances on, turn your loads on.

05:59:28.580 --> 05:59:33.500
That gives current a path to flow, now you're consuming power, power company.

05:59:33.740 --> 05:59:37.580
I always, you know, I see, I take this stuff to literal, which is one of the reasons that

05:59:37.580 --> 05:59:39.980
I'm here and you're there, okay?

05:59:39.980 --> 05:59:42.180
But it just doesn't make sense, does it?

05:59:42.180 --> 05:59:43.180
It really doesn't.

05:59:43.180 --> 05:59:48.620
Now the power company, the voltage company, charges you in watts.

05:59:48.620 --> 05:59:56.340
Actually, the power company charges you in what are called kilowatt hours, kilowatt hours.

05:59:56.340 --> 05:59:58.100
I'll talk about more of that in a second.

05:59:58.100 --> 05:59:59.100
Measure in watts.

05:59:59.100 --> 06:00:05.420
Wattage is greater when work is done in a short period of time than when the same amount

06:00:05.420 --> 06:00:11.620
of work is done in a longer period of time.

06:00:11.620 --> 06:00:16.740
Wattage is greater when work is done in a short period of time than when the same amount

06:00:16.740 --> 06:00:20.900
of work is done in a longer period of time, right?

06:00:20.900 --> 06:00:26.900
A mild example of this, it's an area of I enjoy motorsports in general, I enjoy mechanical

06:00:26.940 --> 06:00:28.580
things, you know?

06:00:28.580 --> 06:00:33.900
No offense to any of you here that are into any of the fine arts, but if I had a chance

06:00:33.900 --> 06:00:41.140
on a Sunday afternoon of going to the opera, which I've attended, the opera, the symphony

06:00:41.140 --> 06:00:47.900
orchestra, musicals, plays, not a big musical guy, no offense, but it's not how I roll,

06:00:47.900 --> 06:00:52.460
or going down a bowing field and standing at the edge of the fence and watching the

06:00:52.460 --> 06:00:54.020
heavy metal takeoff, okay?

06:00:54.020 --> 06:00:56.820
I'd probably be down a bowing field, it's just how I roll.

06:00:56.820 --> 06:00:59.700
So I've always been a big advocate of motorsports.

06:00:59.700 --> 06:01:05.180
One area of motorsports that I never was really that intrigued with, I respect it, but I'm

06:01:05.180 --> 06:01:11.540
not that intrigued with pursuing it, is drag racing, but I respect it immensely.

06:01:11.540 --> 06:01:17.860
Drag racing is about getting as much end power out of the engine and coupling it to the wheels

06:01:17.860 --> 06:01:24.180
and getting the car down the track, a quarter mile track as quickly as you possibly can.

06:01:24.180 --> 06:01:28.180
If any of you have ever watched drag racing, I mean some of the rockets, rockets, strap

06:01:28.180 --> 06:01:32.820
yourself in, go pow wow, quarter mile, you know, a matter of seconds and they're down

06:01:32.820 --> 06:01:34.420
that quarter mile track.

06:01:34.420 --> 06:01:39.820
I've always been, I've enjoyed NASCAR racing and Formula One is just, Formula One for me

06:01:39.820 --> 06:01:44.700
is, because they not only go down the track that fast, but they turn around and come back

06:01:44.700 --> 06:01:48.420
and they make some turns in between, so that's really amazing technology.

06:01:48.420 --> 06:01:53.500
But, follow what I'm saying, drag racing takes all of that power, couples it to the

06:01:53.500 --> 06:01:57.540
wheels, the tires, traction, and accelerates, okay?

06:01:57.540 --> 06:02:01.300
So they're consuming a huge amount of power and converting it into energy to get down

06:02:01.300 --> 06:02:02.300
the track.

06:02:02.300 --> 06:02:07.300
Would that be the same concept if you had a car that did 45 miles in one hour, versus

06:02:07.300 --> 06:02:12.300
a car that did 80 miles in one hour, and you would be consuming more power in the amount

06:02:12.300 --> 06:02:14.820
of an hour, would you get there faster?

06:02:14.820 --> 06:02:15.820
Absolutely.

06:02:15.820 --> 06:02:16.820
Yep.

06:02:16.820 --> 06:02:20.940
And to get that work done in a shorter period of time, it's going to take you more power.

06:02:20.940 --> 06:02:23.900
So that's one of the reasons that, you know, with gas prices going up, getting off that

06:02:23.900 --> 06:02:28.380
pedal, it does make a difference, it does make a difference.

06:02:28.380 --> 06:02:34.300
The epitome for me, and it's a toss-up, it's a toss-up, NASCAR was involved in both of

06:02:34.300 --> 06:02:35.300
them, right?

06:02:35.300 --> 06:02:36.300
Space Shuttle.

06:02:36.300 --> 06:02:41.420
Space Shuttle, or old, kicking at old school, NASCAR, the Saturn V rockets.

06:02:41.420 --> 06:02:47.780
Saturn V rockets, a little tiny capsule up on the top, big, huge freaking rocket, okay?

06:02:47.780 --> 06:02:48.780
Light it.

06:02:48.780 --> 06:02:51.380
The dude that lights it, lights it, and then goes like three miles away and goes into a

06:02:51.380 --> 06:02:53.820
concrete bunker, okay?

06:02:53.820 --> 06:02:57.060
And then literally with the Space Shuttle, it's the same thing, they light it, and then

06:02:57.060 --> 06:03:01.020
they like run three miles away, and you know, that thing goes off, right?

06:03:01.020 --> 06:03:04.060
Seven minutes later, they're in outer space.

06:03:04.060 --> 06:03:05.900
Seven minutes later, they're in outer space.

06:03:05.900 --> 06:03:10.620
NASA throws power at the problem to get the Space Shuttle into orbit, okay?

06:03:10.620 --> 06:03:15.380
So obviously we're talking about, if NASA could meter out that power, you know, you

06:03:15.380 --> 06:03:19.020
could probably light several cities for a good deal of time.

06:03:19.020 --> 06:03:24.340
Instead, they say, how can we get that power and concentrate it in liquid fuels, solid

06:03:24.340 --> 06:03:29.260
rocket boosters, and then be able to concentrate that energy so we could get that Space Shuttle,

06:03:29.260 --> 06:03:34.180
which is freaking huge, it's a big thing, into outer space in seven minutes.

06:03:34.180 --> 06:03:38.980
Not eight minutes, not nine minutes, but it's seven minutes, they're in orbit.

06:03:38.980 --> 06:03:39.980
Tremendous amount of power.

06:03:39.980 --> 06:03:42.340
Have any of you here ever seen a Space Shuttle launch?

06:03:43.340 --> 06:03:49.060
Yeah, I had the opportunity back in the 80s, I actually saw the Challenger, fortunately

06:03:49.060 --> 06:03:54.580
not the time that it had its malfunction, I saw it before that, and actually ironically

06:03:54.580 --> 06:04:00.940
Dick Scobey, who's from Auburn, Washington, I saw a mission that he flew prior to the

06:04:00.940 --> 06:04:07.140
catastrophic accident that they had, but I was in Titusville, Florida, and you're listening

06:04:07.140 --> 06:04:11.660
to the radio and you hear the countdown and everything, three, two, one, and you know,

06:04:11.660 --> 06:04:16.180
I don't know how many miles away you are, like 10 miles, 12 miles, you know, you see

06:04:16.180 --> 06:04:22.300
it going up, going up, and then all of a sudden the wall of sound hits you, and it's just

06:04:22.300 --> 06:04:27.660
a sound like I've never heard before, it's like, wow, that is freaking cool, you know,

06:04:27.660 --> 06:04:31.540
the next thing, you know, it's gone, man, it's in orbit, they're in orbit, over and

06:04:31.540 --> 06:04:36.340
around the Earth, tremendous amount of power, okay, so the same thing with electronics, same

06:04:36.340 --> 06:04:40.900
thing with electronics, the more power we throw at something, the more work we can do,

06:04:40.900 --> 06:04:45.420
so you know, basically, you know, if you're attending a concert, you know, the Pink Floyd

06:04:45.420 --> 06:04:52.100
Orchestra is performing in an auditorium, they are going to have to throw a lot of voltage

06:04:52.100 --> 06:04:57.700
and current at the problem to create a lot of acoustic energy to satisfy the masses, because

06:04:57.700 --> 06:05:06.340
that's what we've all grown accustomed to, is loud music, right, okay, what is the basic

06:05:06.340 --> 06:05:15.060
unit of power? That is not a question, it's a statement, what, what is the basic unit

06:05:15.060 --> 06:05:25.460
of power? It is literally equal to the voltage across a circuit multiplied by the current

06:05:25.460 --> 06:05:38.900
through the circuit, it represents the rate at which work is being done, and what is the

06:05:38.900 --> 06:05:46.300
guy that came up with it, and what he said, I think he gave this presentation down at

06:05:46.300 --> 06:05:55.580
the King Dome back in the day, 45,000 people, Ohm gave his spiel, right, remember that,

06:05:55.580 --> 06:06:02.660
V, V, V is equal to I, I, I times R, R, R, R, right, that was Ohm's deal, Watt got up

06:06:02.660 --> 06:06:10.260
there not to be outdone, and he said P, P, P is equal to I, I, I times V, V, V, and that's

06:06:10.260 --> 06:06:33.660
what he said, that's what he said, so again, P, I, V, triangle with a T in the center,

06:06:33.660 --> 06:06:37.940
power is equal to voltage times current, if I ask you how much voltage is there, and you

06:06:37.940 --> 06:06:42.660
know how much power there is, right, in current, then you can calculate out the voltage, if

06:06:42.660 --> 06:06:46.580
I ask you how much current is there, if you know the power and the voltage, you can calculate

06:06:46.580 --> 06:06:52.340
out the current, and of course power, current times voltage, that's all your variables,

06:06:52.340 --> 06:06:59.220
simple math, and this is called Watt's law, Watt's law, so so far, for those of you at

06:06:59.220 --> 06:07:04.180
home keeping track of what's going down, we've gone over Ohm's law, we've talked about Kirchoff's

06:07:04.180 --> 06:07:08.780
law and this is Watt's law, these are laws of physics, they allow us to calculate what's

06:07:08.780 --> 06:07:14.180
going to take place with 100% accuracy, very, very useful tools, we're not teaching you

06:07:14.180 --> 06:07:17.580
this stuff because I got nothing better to do with my time, we're teaching you this stuff

06:07:17.580 --> 06:07:23.420
because this becomes very valuable for an electronics technician, paints a picture, tells

06:07:23.420 --> 06:07:31.140
you what's going on, literally tells you what's going on, okay, a little known fact about

06:07:31.140 --> 06:07:38.220
yours truly, I used to work in radio, okay, I worked on the air, I was on the air personality

06:07:38.220 --> 06:07:42.820
for an AM radio station in Connecticut, and it was one of the things that got me interested

06:07:42.820 --> 06:07:48.220
in electronics, because I worked kind of hard and I didn't have a whole lot of job security,

06:07:48.220 --> 06:07:55.460
there was a guy at the station, the chief engineer, this guy, every year he'd buy a formula

06:07:55.460 --> 06:08:00.180
firebird, trade in the old one, get a new formula firebird, and he always kind of had

06:08:00.180 --> 06:08:04.900
a girlfriend with him that was kind of had it going on, if you know what I mean, okay,

06:08:04.900 --> 06:08:10.420
and he did very little, he came every week to the station and he'd get all of the readings

06:08:10.420 --> 06:08:14.420
that all the on the air people took from the transmitter, we were able to take the readings

06:08:14.420 --> 06:08:20.420
from the transmitter remotely, but we had to log in these voltages and these currents,

06:08:20.420 --> 06:08:25.940
and then he would come, he'd come with a calculator much like this, okay, and he'd sit there and

06:08:25.940 --> 06:08:31.260
he'd perform these calculations all the way down, and then he'd sign the logs, take them,

06:08:31.260 --> 06:08:35.580
stick them in a folder, and then they'd be held by the station.

06:08:35.580 --> 06:08:42.780
What he was doing is that the station, commercial station, was licensed by the Federal Communications

06:08:42.780 --> 06:08:48.340
Commission to only broadcast so much power, and the proof of how much power was being

06:08:48.340 --> 06:08:55.540
transmitted was the voltage of the final transmitter tube, the current flowing to that transmitter

06:08:55.540 --> 06:08:59.700
tube, if you knew those two you could calculate out the power, and then there was approved

06:08:59.700 --> 06:09:05.620
engineering design criteria for the antenna system, that the antenna system had certain

06:09:05.620 --> 06:09:11.540
number of losses, so you could prove to the FCC, you see, we were not broadcasting more

06:09:11.540 --> 06:09:17.380
power than we were allotted, we were not interfering with that station in Pennsylvania, okay, we

06:09:17.380 --> 06:09:21.460
couldn't have been, because we're only broadcasting out what you've allowed us to broadcast out,

06:09:21.460 --> 06:09:27.260
so it was a technician calculating this out through the current and voltage readings that

06:09:27.260 --> 06:09:32.460
I think it was every four hours we had to take, every four hours on the air personnel,

06:09:32.460 --> 06:09:35.940
and it was right there in the studio, it was an equipment rack and you could go and just

06:09:35.940 --> 06:09:41.180
sequence through, you know, and take the voltage readings, the current readings, and log those

06:09:41.180 --> 06:09:51.060
in and that became part of the permanent record, so it was kind of funny, it really was inspirational

06:09:51.060 --> 06:09:55.700
for me seeing this guy as the chief engineer, he was a chief engineer and he was assigned

06:09:55.700 --> 06:10:01.300
several radio stations in Connecticut on contract, the guy made really good money, you know,

06:10:01.300 --> 06:10:06.860
and I'm like how do I get his job, well you need an FCC license, you know, basically the

06:10:06.860 --> 06:10:11.460
general radio operators license to be able to maintain a commercial radio station like

06:10:11.460 --> 06:10:17.580
that, so anyway, I'm an examiner now for the FCC and I give that exam and I've never in

06:10:17.580 --> 06:10:22.940
my life owned a Formula Firebird, so I have had some girlfriends that kind of had it going

06:10:22.940 --> 06:10:30.740
on if you know what I mean, until it hits the fan, until the station gets hit by lightning,

06:10:30.740 --> 06:10:35.740
okay, and then it's like oh, and then you got the general manager, right, the program

06:10:35.740 --> 06:10:41.100
director, and all of that advertising dollars that were spent, right, you're losing that

06:10:41.100 --> 06:10:45.860
money because the station is off the air and that's how stations pay the bills is all the

06:10:45.900 --> 06:10:49.980
advertising, so when you're off the air, you're in a pickle, people will tune to another station

06:10:49.980 --> 06:10:55.660
or whatever, so it's kind of a big deal, ironically though, kind of behind the scene story like

06:10:55.660 --> 06:11:03.340
here, we had a woman in our program that completed this program and I got her an internship, she

06:11:03.340 --> 06:11:12.020
interned for a period of time at KISW and the engineer at the time over there, Brian, he hadn't

06:11:12.060 --> 06:11:16.820
had a vacation for three years because again, as a chief engineer, you just don't go on vacation,

06:11:16.820 --> 06:11:22.580
yeah, I'm taking my vacation next week, you know, you can't do that because if the station goes

06:11:22.580 --> 06:11:27.300
off the air, who's gonna, you know, so for the, there was nobody, nobody that he could hand the

06:11:27.300 --> 06:11:33.820
station over to, once she got in there and she built up some credibility, he actually went

06:11:33.820 --> 06:11:39.180
on vacation and gave her the keys and it's kind of like hey, you've got it, so you've got the

06:11:39.180 --> 06:11:43.580
station, she was a student here at Lake Washington Technical College, she was the acting chief

06:11:43.580 --> 06:11:51.420
engineer for KISW, also, also because all these engineers and all the radio stations, they're

06:11:51.420 --> 06:11:55.940
all in cahoots with each other, okay, so if the station goes off the air, you know, call Tony

06:11:55.940 --> 06:12:00.340
over at Cairo, he'll come over and help you out, you know, you've got all these engineers that will

06:12:00.340 --> 06:12:04.740
lend a hand, even though you're the competition on paper, if I need something, you'll help me out,

06:12:04.740 --> 06:12:08.780
if you need something, I'll help you out and it kind of goes, it's a, you know, unwritten law,

06:12:08.780 --> 06:12:15.540
if you will, and radio to help everybody else out, so kind of exciting. So anyway, this power

06:12:15.540 --> 06:12:20.900
reading is very, very critical, so that you could tell the performance of your equipment and it's

06:12:20.900 --> 06:12:24.940
something that, if any of you go into commercial broadcasting, you're gonna be doing the exact

06:12:24.940 --> 06:12:28.700
same thing, taking those power readings, how much energy are we, are we getting off the antenna,

06:12:28.700 --> 06:12:32.300
the only way to tell them is how much voltage you got, how much current you got, you got going,

06:12:32.300 --> 06:12:36.860
same thing, you come from an audio car, car audio background, same thing, you got a thousand watt

06:12:36.860 --> 06:12:44.260
amplifier, it's a math problem, okay, 1000 watts, you know what this is, okay, 12.6 volts DC, you

06:12:44.260 --> 06:12:48.540
know what this is, well, this is gonna tell you how much current it is, it's a math problem, you

06:12:48.540 --> 06:12:53.420
know, now it's a thousand watt amplifier, that's peak performance, and how often you're gonna be

06:12:53.420 --> 06:12:58.340
cranking out that peak performance, but you've got to design everything backwards to make sure that

06:12:58.340 --> 06:13:03.860
if you crank it up all the way, you're not gonna cause an electrical fire, it's a good meltdown,

06:13:03.860 --> 06:13:09.380
so you've got to design, and it all integrates, really it's a beautiful thing. Now the electric

06:13:09.380 --> 06:13:18.420
company, the electric company, the voltage company, they charge you, they charge you for kilowatt

06:13:18.420 --> 06:13:28.820
hours, kilowatt hours, that's a thousand watts, a kilowatt, right, per hour, so that you consuming

06:13:28.820 --> 06:13:34.660
a thousand watts over an hour, okay, I don't know if any of you go to the gymnasium periodically,

06:13:34.660 --> 06:13:41.060
the gym workout, some of the life cycles, stair steppers, these things, some of them have integrated

06:13:41.060 --> 06:13:47.300
in calories that you're consuming, some of them have a screen that you can go to for watts, okay,

06:13:47.700 --> 06:13:52.660
so I often thought I hate working out, I really do, it just, I'm not afraid of hard work, okay,

06:13:52.660 --> 06:13:56.980
if I got to dig a ditch in the backyard, I love doing it, you know, I'm all about hard work, but

06:13:56.980 --> 06:14:04.340
going to the gym and like, you know, for an hour just doesn't make sense, at least put the thing

06:14:04.340 --> 06:14:09.540
up to a generator, let me charge my cell phone or something, and you know, let me save a nickel or

06:14:09.540 --> 06:14:14.020
something, if you know, that makes more sense to me, but anyway, somebody's screens have watts,

06:14:14.020 --> 06:14:20.820
and if any of you have ever done that, how hard you have to work to generate a watt, I mean,

06:14:20.820 --> 06:14:27.700
it's amazing, so the electric company, the voltage company is selling us a thousand watts

06:14:27.700 --> 06:14:33.380
per hour, that's the unit of measure that they charge us, okay, so anybody know off the top of

06:14:33.380 --> 06:14:37.780
their head about what we're being charged here in the greater Seattle area, a kilowatt hour,

06:14:37.780 --> 06:14:44.340
zzz, wait, you're being ripped off, man, that's, that's chronic power and light,

06:14:46.420 --> 06:14:51.460
about eight cents, about eight cents, some of you, depending on your, on your, your scale,

06:14:51.460 --> 06:14:57.300
six and a half cents, seven cents per kilowatt hour, which is the thing that I kind of struggle with,

06:14:58.340 --> 06:15:07.140
I go, this year alone, since January, I got invited to attend a green energy conference,

06:15:07.140 --> 06:15:12.820
good jobs, green jobs in Washington DC, and then I was invited to be a guest speaker in Milwaukee

06:15:12.820 --> 06:15:18.980
at the green summit, so I, I'm some world-class speakers I get to be in the presence of, so I

06:15:18.980 --> 06:15:22.980
go to this like green summit in Milwaukee, and I get seriously jazzed, you know, like, yeah, I'm

06:15:22.980 --> 06:15:27.940
going to go home and I'm going to do an energy audit, I'm going to see, I'm going to get home,

06:15:29.220 --> 06:15:34.820
lost them six and a half cents per kilowatt hour, you know, how much effort do I have to put into

06:15:34.820 --> 06:15:39.220
really saving, and how much am I going to save, it really doesn't make sense, I mean, it really

06:15:39.220 --> 06:15:44.980
doesn't, there needs to be consumer incentive for you to, to really hunker down and save,

06:15:44.980 --> 06:15:49.700
because electricity here in the Northwest is very, very inexpensive, and that's a good thing,

06:15:49.700 --> 06:15:55.540
I'm not complaining about it, you know, and there are some things that you could do to save,

06:15:55.540 --> 06:15:59.380
save energy, but there's only so much that you could do, and we're really not paying that much

06:15:59.380 --> 06:16:06.260
for it, even like with electric cars, I know my colleague did some of the math with purely

06:16:07.220 --> 06:16:13.220
electric cars that we're coming out with, and really it equates for the price of gas at four

06:16:13.220 --> 06:16:20.340
bucks a gallon, it comes out to being that it's about 99 miles per gallon that you would get,

06:16:20.340 --> 06:16:27.220
equivalent to travel, travel 99 miles, then it would cost you to do that for that fill up,

06:16:27.300 --> 06:16:31.060
and that's what about what it equates to when you're paying six and a half seven cents per

06:16:31.060 --> 06:16:35.300
kilowatt hour, which is bad, you know, I wouldn't mind having a car that got 99 miles per gallon,

06:16:35.300 --> 06:16:42.420
100 miles per gallon, but is it worth the investment of me scrapping my, you know, my V8,

06:16:43.140 --> 06:16:48.100
I mean, because I don't, unless I'm having, unless I'm driving a Tesla, which is out of my range,

06:16:48.100 --> 06:16:53.540
you know, I don't think, I like that V8, you know, V8 Taurus, pour some fuel into the situation,

06:16:53.540 --> 06:16:59.220
a little bit of air, get out of the freeway, set the pace, I keep up with the flow of traffic,

06:16:59.220 --> 06:17:04.340
set the pace, and I have documentation, watching the state control of a little Tesla at math, okay.

06:17:11.060 --> 06:17:16.100
So, good analysis to determine the power dissipated by a component of voltage,

06:17:16.100 --> 06:17:22.500
drop, and time, so I'm talking about for a component now, okay, this works for loads,

06:17:22.580 --> 06:17:26.820
this works for like an amplifier, if you've got an electric load, an amplifier, a transmitter,

06:17:26.820 --> 06:17:32.980
you could do this, but this also works for individual components, so if you know how much

06:17:32.980 --> 06:17:35.940
current's going through the component, and you know the voltage across the component,

06:17:35.940 --> 06:17:43.300
then you could figure out exactly how much energy that component is dissipating. Now, remember resistors,

06:17:45.620 --> 06:17:50.500
remember resistors, resistors are devices designed to possess the property of resistance,

06:17:50.500 --> 06:17:56.820
resistance is that force which opposes the flow of electrons, the byproduct of resistance,

06:17:56.820 --> 06:18:03.220
when current encounters resistance, it generates heat, that's how we determine the power of that

06:18:03.220 --> 06:18:08.020
resistor, because all resistors are not created equal, there's ath watt resistors,

06:18:08.020 --> 06:18:12.260
quarter watt resistors, half watt resistors, one watt resistors, five watt resistors,

06:18:12.260 --> 06:18:17.540
how much energy could they dissipate, and literally, literally it's the voltage across the component,

06:18:17.540 --> 06:18:21.940
times the current going through the component, that's going to give you that power that's being

06:18:21.940 --> 06:18:29.140
consumed by it. If a resistor, if you ask too much of a resistor, it will fry, it will fail,

06:18:30.020 --> 06:18:36.340
if you exceed its rated capability, so all electronic components are really like that,

06:18:36.340 --> 06:18:40.660
you know the voltage, you know the current, we're going to talk about some exceptions in the future,

06:18:41.380 --> 06:18:45.620
they're not resistive components, they're called reactive components, that'll come later this

06:18:45.700 --> 06:18:50.580
quarter, we'll talk about that, and that they don't, these are components that don't consume

06:18:50.580 --> 06:18:56.980
energy in the form of heat, that's why they're called reactive, but something we'll talk about

06:18:56.980 --> 06:19:03.540
in the future. Hey, the neat thing with power, power dissipated in series or parallel is equal to

06:19:03.540 --> 06:19:09.140
the sum of the power dissipated by the individual components, power is always additive, it doesn't

06:19:09.140 --> 06:19:15.780
matter if it's series or parallel or whatever, power is always additive, I've got a 400 horsepower

06:19:15.780 --> 06:19:23.220
engine on my airplane, and I remove it and get another 400 horsepower engine amount, each engine

06:19:23.220 --> 06:19:29.540
on each wing, now 400 times two is up to 800 horsepower worth of power, as were before in a

06:19:29.540 --> 06:19:36.820
single engine aircraft, that was only up to 400 horsepower, okay, it's kind of funny, I know a

06:19:36.820 --> 06:19:41.300
little bit about airplanes, but the odd thing about airplanes is when you do that, instead of the

06:19:41.300 --> 06:19:47.140
airplane costing twice as much, it ends up usually costing you about three times as much,

06:19:47.140 --> 06:19:50.980
so for a twin-engine airplane you're going to pay through the nose, you know, much higher performance,

06:19:50.980 --> 06:19:58.340
a lot more going on with it, a lot more structural that they have to do, but power is always additive,

06:19:59.060 --> 06:20:02.020
that's why the space shuttle, right, solid rocket boosters on the space shuttle,

06:20:02.740 --> 06:20:08.260
all right, they have two, you know how much power that is, twice as much as one, okay,

06:20:08.260 --> 06:20:12.740
that's why they put two of them up, and actually from what I understand, I think the space shuttle

06:20:12.740 --> 06:20:17.380
can, I don't know if it could get a shallow orbit, if it's just on one solid rocket booster

06:20:18.020 --> 06:20:21.300
or not, but those things are literally like Roman candles, once they light up they're going for a

06:20:21.300 --> 06:20:27.140
ride, there's no shutting them down, uh-oh, we changed our mind, let's back it back to the pad now,

06:20:27.140 --> 06:20:33.380
you're going for a ride, power, so power is always additive, always additive,

06:20:33.380 --> 06:20:39.380
this is the thing like with your home, forget about what is energy conservation, a bunch of

06:20:40.340 --> 06:20:46.660
your home, every device that is on in your home right now that has a voltage across it

06:20:46.660 --> 06:20:52.900
and current flowing through it is consuming power, okay, there's a lot of phantom loads in your home,

06:20:52.900 --> 06:20:59.380
stuff that's plugged in but it ain't turned on, but it's still consuming power, why? You got voltage

06:20:59.380 --> 06:21:05.060
across it, it's got a current flowing through it, you're plugged in, how many have a nice flat

06:21:05.060 --> 06:21:10.340
screen TV at home, right, how many have it, is it turned on right now, do you leave it on 24-7

06:21:10.340 --> 06:21:16.340
or is it turned off, still consuming power, still consuming power, so that way when you go home and

06:21:16.340 --> 06:21:20.980
hit that remote, pow, that screen comes right up, if not there'd have to be a period of time with

06:21:20.980 --> 06:21:26.820
some electronics for it to warm up, come up, everybody wants instant gratification with systems,

06:21:26.820 --> 06:21:30.980
especially somebody old tube systems, right, those really consume a lot, you had to wait for the tubes

06:21:30.980 --> 06:21:36.740
to heat up and everything, but most electronics are really in a standby mode, your battery charger

06:21:36.740 --> 06:21:40.100
right now, your cell phone charger at home, if it's plugged in the wall and it's not plugged

06:21:40.100 --> 06:21:44.020
into your cell phone, it's still consuming some energy because it's got current flowing through

06:21:44.020 --> 06:21:52.260
a coil there, when you plug in your phone, it consumes more current, right, so a lot of these

06:21:52.260 --> 06:21:57.700
again are phantom loads that exist at your home, you're consuming energy, real small amount, real

06:21:57.700 --> 06:22:05.940
small amount, it all adds up, it all adds up, you know, as you want to things that give you a sales pitch

06:22:05.940 --> 06:22:11.220
for tomorrow's meeting, right, you can watch a documentary called Power Search, that was just on

06:22:11.220 --> 06:22:17.540
on public television, there's a talk a lot about that, you know, it all adds up, it's all about

06:22:17.540 --> 06:22:31.060
power, you know, I didn't hear about her, did she save money early, huh, I'm not gonna do that,

06:22:32.180 --> 06:22:36.420
all my plugs are like behind the couch and crown, I'm gonna climb back there, it's all the power

06:22:36.420 --> 06:22:42.340
stripper that on off, you know, that's it, in all honesty, that actually I thought about that,

06:22:42.340 --> 06:22:47.700
you know, my wife and I travel a lot and we, you know, we go away and really would make sense,

06:22:47.700 --> 06:22:53.380
just shut off that main breaker of the house, you know, leave for a month, come back and then,

06:22:53.380 --> 06:22:57.140
you know, you go get your electric bill, they still charge you the same, you know, they're just

06:22:57.140 --> 06:23:02.980
messing with you, gotta have your thucks in a row, man, you gotta pay attention to that meter, so

06:23:03.700 --> 06:23:09.860
now electronics, the power dissipated in a circuit is often less than one watt,

06:23:11.140 --> 06:23:15.700
electronics, microelectronics like you're studying here, typically the value is going

06:23:15.700 --> 06:23:22.020
to be less than a watt, typical values will be the milli watt, this is times 10 to the negative third

06:23:22.020 --> 06:23:24.740
or one-thousandth of a watt

06:23:27.380 --> 06:23:32.340
and the micro watt, one million micro watts equals one watt,

06:23:34.020 --> 06:23:38.580
so we're talking a millionth of a watt, that's typically what's consumed in

06:23:43.860 --> 06:23:47.700
some of you are working around with amateur radio, you want to get your amateur radio license and

06:23:47.700 --> 06:23:50.980
play around with some of that stuff, some of them are here for power transmitters,

06:23:51.060 --> 06:23:53.780
you need to make sure you have the available current and voltage

06:23:53.780 --> 06:23:58.020
signal on, you're not going to be able to do that, because again, you want to hear behind

06:23:58.660 --> 06:24:04.180
why power is equal to current and voltage, so if you're on a low voltage system,

06:24:06.100 --> 06:24:13.140
like a car, like a car or a boat or an airplane, and you want to start jacking this value up,

06:24:13.140 --> 06:24:17.620
that means you're going to have to start using a bigger cable, a physically bigger cable,

06:24:17.860 --> 06:24:23.860
you have more electrons that you're going to have to transport from the source to the load,

06:24:23.860 --> 06:24:27.060
and that's what you're measuring, okay, so the math doesn't lie,

06:24:28.980 --> 06:24:33.060
total power dissipated in a series or parallel circuit is equal to some of the power dissipated

06:24:33.060 --> 06:24:40.500
by the individual components, meaning power is additive, power is additive, there's no such thing

06:24:40.500 --> 06:24:49.300
as negative power, but this is putting power back in, you know, perpetual motion machine,

06:24:49.300 --> 06:24:53.700
you get something like that going, give me a call, okay, give me a call, I have my attorney

06:24:53.700 --> 06:25:00.180
contact, your attorney, and I'll personally fly you to Bimini, and you could watch the sunset

06:25:00.180 --> 06:25:04.580
drinking out of a coconut with one of those screwy straws, an umbrella on the top of your drink,

06:25:05.540 --> 06:25:11.940
okay, now all we do is consume voltage, we consume power, nothing puts things back in,

06:25:11.940 --> 06:25:15.460
so it's not, I guess it'd be like me getting an airplane engine, you know, mounting one,

06:25:15.460 --> 06:25:17.700
like going this way, and then the other end, you go this way,

06:25:23.460 --> 06:25:30.020
one, yeah, one, that one, you lift off, you know, so UFO, no, it's a doofus,

06:25:30.180 --> 06:25:36.820
it's a doofus, what's that guy doing? Does that make sense? All right, summary,

06:25:37.700 --> 06:25:44.980
power is the rate at which energy is delivered to a circuit, power is also the rate at which

06:25:44.980 --> 06:25:52.420
energy or heat is dissipated by the resistance in a circuit, this isn't, that second bullet

06:25:52.420 --> 06:25:55.620
statement there isn't something we dig, it's something we got to deal with, we don't want

06:25:55.620 --> 06:26:01.220
our electronic equipment to get hot, it's one of my, one of my, I got a lot of electronics in

06:26:01.220 --> 06:26:07.380
my family room, got my audio, I got surround sound, I got my plasma screen, TV, I've got,

06:26:07.380 --> 06:26:11.860
got all this equipment, I've got, I got several computers, I got a computer that monitors the

06:26:11.860 --> 06:26:16.820
weather at my house, why, because I'm just into that kind of stuff, I got my other main computer,

06:26:16.820 --> 06:26:24.100
I've got all my network gear from, for router, I got a switch that powers the other internet

06:26:24.100 --> 06:26:28.660
connections in the house, got all that stuff, in the summer, that room really gets freaking warm,

06:26:29.220 --> 06:26:33.860
okay, in the winter it's kind of cool, warm I mean, you know what I mean, you come in there and I got

06:26:33.860 --> 06:26:37.940
all this electronic stuff that's keeping that warm, really heavy and temperate, but you know,

06:26:37.940 --> 06:26:41.940
was it last year, two years ago, we had the heat wave, it was like, holy cow man, I had to start

06:26:41.940 --> 06:26:45.940
shutting stuff down, I'm like, you know how important it is to start shutting stuff down,

06:26:45.940 --> 06:26:50.100
so I don't have a Wi-Fi system in the house, not that that generates that much heat, but

06:26:50.100 --> 06:26:55.780
everything else in there does generate the heat, we don't want that, we don't want that,

06:26:55.780 --> 06:27:01.220
it's something we have to live with, so a lot of times when equipment is densely packed,

06:27:01.220 --> 06:27:07.540
that thermal profile tells us what's going on, former member of our advisory committee here

06:27:07.540 --> 06:27:12.820
at Lake Washington Technical College was the chief engineer for Channel 9 out of Seattle,

06:27:13.540 --> 06:27:17.780
and we went down there for a tour one day, their transmitter is located up on Capitol Hill,

06:27:18.740 --> 06:27:25.860
and he was showing me the air inlet temperature and then the exhaust temperature, right, the air

06:27:25.860 --> 06:27:30.180
that they're sucking in to run through the transmitter to Kula, and by looking at that,

06:27:30.180 --> 06:27:35.380
you know, this is the inlet air temperature, this is the exhaust, by looking at that difference,

06:27:35.380 --> 06:27:39.860
obviously if it's a warmer day, they go up like this, right, I mean it is what it is,

06:27:40.580 --> 06:27:45.620
by him looking at that, okay, if this stay stationary and then this one goes up,

06:27:45.620 --> 06:27:52.580
it immediately tells him what, the transmitter is consuming more power, that means there's a problem,

06:27:52.580 --> 06:27:56.500
because when it was brand spanking new, this is what it was, this is the inlet,

06:27:56.500 --> 06:27:59.860
that the difference between the two is a critical number, temperature,

06:28:00.660 --> 06:28:03.780
you raise the temperature, shows you something's not operating efficiently,

06:28:04.980 --> 06:28:09.140
plain and simple, one of the tricks, because I paid attention, I'm not that smart of a guy,

06:28:09.140 --> 06:28:13.300
but I did pay attention when I was in school, formal schooling like this, one of the things

06:28:13.300 --> 06:28:23.460
that I used to do is when I was in the Navy, we had very, very complex circuits, and there was

06:28:23.460 --> 06:28:30.900
this one board that had memory chips on it, and it used to fail, and running the diagnostics to

06:28:30.900 --> 06:28:37.460
determine which chip it was was just very, very laborious, and I've always kind of been a lazy

06:28:37.460 --> 06:28:43.460
guy, and I'm like, you know, there's got to be an easier way of doing this, you know, so what I did

06:28:43.460 --> 06:28:48.660
one day is just for giggles, and then we had to figure out what it was, I put it back in,

06:28:48.660 --> 06:28:52.820
it fired the whole system up, right, and then immediately shut the thing down, pulled the

06:28:52.820 --> 06:29:00.420
circuit card out, right, and I started going across the chips, got to the hot chip, and guess

06:29:00.420 --> 06:29:06.740
which chip was the hot chip, the fail component, so anyway, it was kind of funny, my colleagues

06:29:06.740 --> 06:29:11.140
thought like I was like into, you know, black magic, and like voodoo, and you know, because

06:29:11.140 --> 06:29:15.620
there'd be a problem with the chip, and then I'm like, okay, you know, I'll figure out which one

06:29:15.620 --> 06:29:19.620
it is, but you're all gonna have to leave, okay, and I actually started doing, I hit a little mojo

06:29:19.620 --> 06:29:24.180
bag with some bones in it, and a crow's foot, and I played the whole thing up, you know, and we'd

06:29:24.180 --> 06:29:29.540
shut the thing down, I'd come out, U44, I was like, how the heck did you do that? I was looking at

06:29:29.540 --> 06:29:34.020
which chip was getting hot, the one that gets hot is the one that failed, and it's generating more

06:29:34.020 --> 06:29:38.260
heat, and that's what the problem is, so you could really determine, use this trouble shooting tool

06:29:38.260 --> 06:29:42.900
later on, if something's getting hot, and if you know what the norm is, beyond that, now they've

06:29:42.900 --> 06:29:51.700
got stuff on the market, they've got thermal imaging, power company, actually uses thermal imaging,

06:29:51.700 --> 06:29:55.620
they'll go ahead with the thermal imaging gun and look at their power runs, and where two wires

06:29:55.620 --> 06:29:59.620
are joined together, if it starts to generate a lot of heat, they know there's a problem up there,

06:29:59.620 --> 06:30:04.420
okay, because if it's generating heat, that shows that that connection has too much

06:30:05.700 --> 06:30:11.780
resistance, because resistance generates heat, so you could analyze, you know, with thermal

06:30:11.780 --> 06:30:16.660
imaging, really see a picture of physically what's working, what's not working, so that's an advance

06:30:16.660 --> 06:30:22.580
that's taking place really, within the past decade, thermal imaging now is pretty much mainstream,

06:30:22.580 --> 06:30:28.340
you know, it's not that, heck, you could get a non-contact infrared, you could get one

06:30:29.940 --> 06:30:36.420
Harbor Freight tools, you know, from 1995 to later, and that would have shown you what, you know what

06:30:36.420 --> 06:30:41.460
I mean, I had used to burn my fingertips finding the hot chip, okay, now you could just use one of

06:30:41.460 --> 06:30:46.100
those and say, oh yeah, this chip is hotter than all the others that are doing the exact same job,

06:30:46.900 --> 06:30:52.660
where the failure is, power is measured in watts, watts is what power is measured in, it's not a

06:30:52.660 --> 06:30:59.540
question, it's a statement, power is literally the product of current and voltage, current times

06:30:59.540 --> 06:31:08.660
voltage, any questions on power, you were saying that to determine the total voltage drop, any

06:31:08.660 --> 06:31:14.420
component is a different formula than what it would be to calculate power, but in the book it says

06:31:15.380 --> 06:31:17.460
no, no, I'm just saying

06:31:18.900 --> 06:31:25.220
how much power is being consumed across a component, you need to use that voltage drop

06:31:25.220 --> 06:31:28.660
across the component, not total voltage value

06:31:32.100 --> 06:31:39.700
go ahead and take a 13 minute break and we're going to start off again at 635, 635

06:31:39.700 --> 06:31:51.140
chapter 8 dc the circuits, dc circuits, one of the things that you need to understand about

06:31:51.140 --> 06:31:59.700
this chapter is it's the concepts that we're going after, we want you to understand the basic

06:31:59.700 --> 06:32:04.820
concepts, you're not going to make a lot of money necessarily going out and working on circuits like

06:32:04.820 --> 06:32:10.740
this in industry, circuits that are made up of a power source and a bunch of resistors, but what

06:32:10.740 --> 06:32:20.020
this is designed to do is to show you an approach on circuit analysis, we are going to use circuits

06:32:20.020 --> 06:32:27.380
that contain a bunch of resistors in industry and those resistors are going to be used to establish

06:32:27.380 --> 06:32:36.260
voltage operating points around transistors or other semiconductor devices, so although you're

06:32:36.260 --> 06:32:41.940
never going to go out necessarily work on circuits exactly like this you have to absolutely,

06:32:41.940 --> 06:32:50.580
positively understand the steps and the competencies of circuit analysis as it pertains to dc circuits,

06:32:50.580 --> 06:32:55.460
okay that goes without saying and quite frankly we've already talked about these concepts,

06:32:55.460 --> 06:33:01.220
this is just the chapter where we pull it all together, after completing this chapter you're

06:33:01.220 --> 06:33:08.100
going to be able to solve for all, now let me emphasize the words all, unknown values, that

06:33:08.100 --> 06:33:16.020
means voltage, current, resistance, and power, all we solve for everything because if you know

06:33:16.020 --> 06:33:20.740
everything I could never ask you anything that you don't know because you know everything,

06:33:21.140 --> 06:33:30.660
in series circuits parallel and series parallel circuits, understand the importance of voltage

06:33:30.660 --> 06:33:37.460
dividers and design and solve for all unknown values in a voltage divider circuit,

06:33:39.860 --> 06:33:44.100
we are going to spend time on voltage dividers, some of the stuff I'm going to blast through,

06:33:44.100 --> 06:33:48.340
but voltage dividers are something that I'm going to spend some time on the board here to make sure

06:33:48.420 --> 06:33:53.860
you got a handle, it's quite frankly the book is okay but the author really drops the ball

06:33:53.860 --> 06:33:57.700
with voltage dividers, he pulls a couple numbers out of the air that I still don't have a clue

06:33:57.700 --> 06:34:03.620
where it comes from so I'm going to show you how to approach that, as you know a series circuit

06:34:03.620 --> 06:34:09.700
is a circuit that provides only one path for current flow, the simplest example of a series

06:34:09.700 --> 06:34:13.380
circuit, you ever have those holiday lights, the Christmas lights that a bulb burns out and the

06:34:13.380 --> 06:34:19.700
whole string goes out, it's a series circuit, because the filament of one bulb interrupts

06:34:19.700 --> 06:34:27.940
the flow of current to all the other bulbs, series circuit, if you've got a string that one bulb

06:34:27.940 --> 06:34:32.740
burns out and maybe 10 other bulbs go out, what does it tell you about those 10 other bulbs,

06:34:32.740 --> 06:34:39.780
they're all in series, the whole string may be a combination circuit but that individual section

06:34:39.780 --> 06:34:48.100
that went out is in series, so there's a lot of lessons behind looking at festival lighting

06:34:48.100 --> 06:34:54.260
and when it goes out what exactly is taking place there, factors governing the operation are the

06:34:54.260 --> 06:34:59.940
same current flows through each component, literally the same current, the same electrons,

06:34:59.940 --> 06:35:04.500
they only have one path to go, that's from negative to positive so they have to travel the entire route,

06:35:05.300 --> 06:35:10.340
total resistance in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistances,

06:35:11.460 --> 06:35:19.940
right, this is what chapter 3, 4 review, right, you got resistance, you add it up in series,

06:35:20.820 --> 06:35:28.100
always additive and that includes the resistance of a bad solder joint, the resistance of a bad

06:35:28.100 --> 06:35:32.820
splice, remember how I said the power company, the voltage company will actually use thermography

06:35:32.820 --> 06:35:36.900
and look and say wow we've got a splice up there and it's generating a lot of heat, we've got to

06:35:36.900 --> 06:35:41.700
shut that section down and replace that because it shouldn't be generating any heat if it's a good splice.

06:35:46.180 --> 06:35:50.340
The total voltage across a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage

06:35:50.340 --> 06:35:55.860
drops, meaning total voltage is equal to voltage across component 1 plus the voltage across component

06:35:55.860 --> 06:36:00.180
2 plus the voltage across component 3, this is a review, this is the same thing I quote,

06:36:00.180 --> 06:36:08.260
you could quote me, right, I love it when you quote me, right, voltage rise equals voltage drop,

06:36:09.060 --> 06:36:20.420
okay, so here voltage rise ET or VT if you prefer equals voltage drops, ER1, ER2, ER3,

06:36:20.420 --> 06:36:25.780
those three voltages better equal what I put into the circuit, if not you got a problem,

06:36:26.500 --> 06:36:29.540
if you find where the missing voltage is you probably found the problem,

06:36:30.740 --> 06:36:36.180
where was the missing voltage, where was it, oh it was on a bad splice, oh okay, you fix that

06:36:36.180 --> 06:36:44.020
problem, boom you're up and running. The voltage drop across a resistor in a series circuit is

06:36:44.020 --> 06:36:50.020
proportional to the size of the resistor, meaning the bigger the resistor, I'm talking about in ohms,

06:36:50.020 --> 06:36:56.660
I'm not talking about physical size, the more ohms the less current, the more ohms the higher

06:36:56.660 --> 06:37:02.980
the resistance the bigger the voltage drop across that resistor, I always think of a resistor, remember

06:37:02.980 --> 06:37:09.780
how I used Seattle traffic flow as an analogy, right, a big resistor is like a big accident,

06:37:09.780 --> 06:37:12.740
if you just got a fender bender is that going to slow the traffic down, yeah,

06:37:13.540 --> 06:37:17.460
fender bender they pull over the side, people start, you know, slow down or whatever,

06:37:17.460 --> 06:37:24.260
now you got a three five three five car pile up, it's a big accident, that's a big resistance,

06:37:24.260 --> 06:37:29.860
a big resistance is going to create, I gave it away already, a big backup, a big backup is a

06:37:29.860 --> 06:37:34.660
big difference in potential, a bunch of people here that want to get to work at a bunch of people

06:37:34.660 --> 06:37:40.980
here on the other side of the freeway that, an empty freeway basically, that's a big difference

06:37:40.980 --> 06:37:50.500
in potential, okay, I love flying in my airplane over traffic jams, as a matter of fact being a

06:37:50.500 --> 06:37:57.140
pilot owning an airplane, being stuck in a traffic jam drives me freaking nuts, like why am I stuck

06:37:57.140 --> 06:38:02.020
in this traffic jam, but from the air it's so obvious, where there's an accident or a problem,

06:38:02.020 --> 06:38:07.220
because all the traffic's backed up and then just a few cars are making it through, difference in

06:38:07.220 --> 06:38:19.220
potential, big resistance, make sense, it's a mistake, that's for parallel, you sure that's

06:38:19.220 --> 06:38:34.020
not parallel you're looking at, typo, typo, yeah, total power in a series circuit or parallel circuit

06:38:34.020 --> 06:38:39.940
or complex circuit, power's additive, pt is equal to pr1, pr2, pr3, pr4, just add up all the power

06:38:39.940 --> 06:38:46.100
and that's going to give you your total power, the bottom line, you want the bottom line or you

06:38:46.100 --> 06:38:53.060
want the bs, bottom line, in a series circuit the most important thing to remember about a

06:38:53.060 --> 06:39:00.900
series circuit is current is constant in a series circuit, period, the second most important thing

06:39:00.900 --> 06:39:10.420
to remember about a series circuit, series circuit is also synonymous with voltage divider, when I

06:39:10.420 --> 06:39:14.660
say series circuit I want you to think current's constant, I want you to think voltage divider,

06:39:14.660 --> 06:39:18.340
that's just how I want you to look at them, and if you're not looking at them that way, you ain't

06:39:18.340 --> 06:39:24.260
looking at them right, Houston we're going to have a problem, okay, those are the most important

06:39:24.260 --> 06:39:29.940
things, I'm going to have you repeat that back to me in the future, do not deceive me, okay, remember

06:39:29.940 --> 06:39:39.460
that stuff, the most important thing in a series circuit is current is constant, why is it constant,

06:39:39.460 --> 06:39:45.460
it's only got one path to flow so it better be constant, the second most important thing about

06:39:45.460 --> 06:39:52.980
a series circuit is a series circuit is also known as, right, aka, like in police lingo, aka also

06:39:52.980 --> 06:40:03.140
known as a voltage divider, voltage divider, in this particular circuit, I mean I look at it,

06:40:03.140 --> 06:40:08.660
and yeah I've been doing this since puberty, but I look at this and what do I see, I see a voltage

06:40:08.660 --> 06:40:14.340
source and three voltage drops, voltage rise and three voltage drops, three loads, I don't know what

06:40:14.340 --> 06:40:21.060
they are, but I know these loads are connected in series, and I know that all the current that

06:40:21.060 --> 06:40:25.620
flows out of the negative terminal of my voltage source has to travel this complete path,

06:40:27.140 --> 06:40:32.580
no place else for it to go, so the current's going to leave the negative terminal of the battery,

06:40:33.780 --> 06:40:36.660
it's going to make this corner, 90 degree corner at the speed of light,

06:40:38.340 --> 06:40:44.660
this is cool stuff ain't it, the speed of light, come on down through here the back stretch, hit

06:40:44.660 --> 06:40:52.980
resistor 3 and create a voltage drop, a difference in potential, current's going to finally make it

06:40:52.980 --> 06:40:59.700
through that obstruction, another 90 degree corner at speed of light, come up here to R2,

06:41:00.900 --> 06:41:04.900
it's going to create another voltage drop, because there's another obstruction, there's

06:41:04.900 --> 06:41:09.940
more resistance here, current's going to continue on, another 90 degree corner through R1, another

06:41:09.940 --> 06:41:14.420
voltage drop, this voltage drop, this voltage drop, this voltage drop have to equal this voltage

06:41:14.420 --> 06:41:19.700
rise, if anything's missing you got a problem, find where it's missing and you found your problem,

06:41:24.500 --> 06:41:34.980
power additive, resistance additive, what else is there, so anytime you've got, the other way I

06:41:34.980 --> 06:41:38.980
want you to look at it is anytime you've got one way into a circuit and one way out, what does that

06:41:38.980 --> 06:41:47.780
tell you, it's a series circuit, it's a series circuit, because I cannot, I cannot show you

06:41:47.780 --> 06:41:53.220
every possible series circuit ever invented, if you've got one way in and one way out it's a series

06:41:53.220 --> 06:41:59.700
circuit, even if it's one component, one component, could that be series, yeah, one way in, one way

06:41:59.780 --> 06:42:08.740
out, it's series, right, right, to solve for values in a circuit in order, the first thing I recommend

06:42:08.740 --> 06:42:15.620
you do is try to solve for that total resistance, once you determine RT total resistance in the

06:42:15.620 --> 06:42:27.620
circuit, then try to solve for total current in the circuit, IT, once you know IT, then you could

06:42:27.620 --> 06:42:33.620
determine what your individual voltage drops are, right, so solve for your total resistance,

06:42:35.940 --> 06:42:40.020
total resistance with your total voltage will show you how much current you're allowing into this

06:42:40.020 --> 06:42:45.860
circuit, current flowing through the circuit, encountering the resistance, v is equal to i

06:42:46.740 --> 06:42:52.340
times r, the total current, the same current that travels the entire path, times the amount of

06:42:52.340 --> 06:42:58.580
resistance there is in a circuit, so this is going to drop a portion of that voltage,

06:42:58.580 --> 06:43:04.020
this is going to drop a portion of that voltage, this is going to drop a portion of that voltage,

06:43:04.020 --> 06:43:09.140
these three portions better equal the voltage that's put into the circuit.

06:43:09.860 --> 06:43:18.980
In regards to the slide previous to this, uh-huh, this one, yeah, it doesn't say

06:43:20.100 --> 06:43:27.780
on the slide series or parallel, so these will, will they primarily cross out between the two

06:43:27.780 --> 06:43:34.100
applications? Yeah, but I gotta warn you, this here is just like generic, this is like generic,

06:43:34.820 --> 06:43:43.700
and the thing of it is, is when you get out into industry or in lab, I may give you this,

06:43:43.700 --> 06:43:52.500
I may give you this, I may give you this, but this is encased in epoxy, you can't even get to it,

06:43:52.500 --> 06:43:55.700
you can't even get a part number off of it, you can't even take a reading of it,

06:43:56.660 --> 06:44:02.100
so you're gonna have to use these laws and say, well, see, I remember Joe said that this is equal

06:44:02.100 --> 06:44:06.820
to this plus this plus this, I know what this is, I know what this is, I know what this is,

06:44:06.820 --> 06:44:11.860
but I don't know what this is, so then you could say this minus this minus this, the remainder

06:44:11.860 --> 06:44:17.380
is equal to this, and it's a safe assumption because you're using a law, Kirchoff's voltage law,

06:44:17.380 --> 06:44:21.300
basically to determine what the unknown is, and if you're using a law in industry

06:44:22.980 --> 06:44:27.940
to figure out what part you need to buy, whose money you need to spend, it's a pretty safe

06:44:27.940 --> 06:44:33.700
assumption, I mean it really is, so that's why we're teaching you this, so don't necessarily use

06:44:33.700 --> 06:44:37.860
this as a checklist and like, oh yeah, I took copious notes, I listened to what Joe Grinnekat

06:44:37.860 --> 06:44:44.500
said in lecture, I went home this weekend to try to do my homework and it didn't work because I

06:44:44.500 --> 06:44:49.060
couldn't determine total circuit current because I didn't know what this value was because Joe

06:44:49.060 --> 06:44:53.460
didn't say sometimes we might not know what this value is or we need to find it on the internet

06:44:54.420 --> 06:45:00.740
off of a data sheet from a manufacturer, so the bottom line I want all of you to realize with

06:45:00.740 --> 06:45:05.140
these circuits and analyzing the circuits, you always need to find at least two bits of information,

06:45:05.140 --> 06:45:08.580
if I only give you one piece of information you're not going to be able to get very far,

06:45:08.580 --> 06:45:13.940
but if you could extract two bits of information then you could reminipulate these three to suit

06:45:13.940 --> 06:45:22.260
your needs as long as you get the right answers, make sense? Okay, parallel circuits, I might as

06:45:22.260 --> 06:45:25.940
well get the cat out of the bag right from the get go, parallel circuit's the most important thing

06:45:25.940 --> 06:45:31.940
you need to remember about a parallel circuit, is voltage is constant across a parallel network,

06:45:32.580 --> 06:45:36.580
voltage is electrical pressure by being constant across a parallel network, what am I talking

06:45:36.580 --> 06:45:40.820
about? I'm saying that that voltage can be constant across all components that are connected in

06:45:40.820 --> 06:45:46.100
parallel, your house is wired in parallel, the freaking voltage coming out of the outlets better

06:45:46.100 --> 06:45:54.180
all be the same, if not you got a problem, you got a problem, voltage is constant across a

06:45:54.180 --> 06:45:59.220
parallel network, most important thing you need to remember, so when I say that what's most important

06:45:59.220 --> 06:46:03.380
thing about a parallel circuit like church you all repeat after me, voltage is constant across a

06:46:03.380 --> 06:46:10.820
parallel network, okay? The second most important thing about a parallel circuit is that a parallel

06:46:10.820 --> 06:46:20.420
circuit is also known as police lingo aka also known as what? If a series circuits a voltage

06:46:20.420 --> 06:46:26.020
divider what's a parallel circuit? It's a current divider, divides up current, some of the current

06:46:26.020 --> 06:46:29.860
goes one path, some of the current goes the other path, remember the Seattle traffic pattern last

06:46:29.860 --> 06:46:35.780
week? Was I here with talking to you folks about that or was it somebody else? Was it a dream I had?

06:46:35.780 --> 06:46:42.660
I had a dream, it was about current and that's what it is, so some of the current's going to take

06:46:42.660 --> 06:46:46.660
the 90, some of it's going to take the 520, some of it's going to take the north end of the lake,

06:46:46.660 --> 06:46:54.420
some of it's going to take the south end of the lake, make sense? I've been a commuter for 20 years,

06:46:54.420 --> 06:47:00.660
I know Seattle traffic, I've gotten out of here and gotten out of 990 and driven eastbound

06:47:00.660 --> 06:47:08.500
to get the Tacoma, the highway 18, just so I could avoid traffic, so I know a little bit about

06:47:08.500 --> 06:47:15.300
traffic, look at these circuits like that. Factors governing the operation of a parallel circuit,

06:47:15.300 --> 06:47:23.140
the same voltage, the same voltage, not an equivalent voltage, the same voltage exists across each

06:47:23.140 --> 06:47:30.900
branch of the parallel circuit and is equal to that of the voltage source, so literally this is

06:47:30.900 --> 06:47:34.180
what we're literally, this is what we're up against, total voltage is equal to voltage

06:47:34.180 --> 06:47:38.340
across component one, it's equal to voltage cross component two, it's equal to voltage cross

06:47:38.340 --> 06:47:46.420
component three, it's not only mathematically equal to, it's the same pressure, I'll show you

06:47:46.420 --> 06:47:54.900
in the schematic, same pressure. In that, in and of itself, will help you solve problems.

06:47:55.940 --> 06:48:00.820
If you know something's in parallel, you could assume, if it's connected in parallel, I should

06:48:00.820 --> 06:48:05.700
have the same voltage across that. Well, gee, the thing's still not working or it's working kind of

06:48:05.700 --> 06:48:11.540
goofy, it's hard to get to, well sometimes you have to remove that access plate, access panel,

06:48:11.540 --> 06:48:16.100
go in there and take the reading, holy cow, everything else in parallel is at 12 volts,

06:48:16.100 --> 06:48:21.620
this is only at 9 volts, I'm missing 3 volts, you find I'm missing 3 volts, you found the

06:48:22.420 --> 06:48:29.620
problem, it's that simple. One of the most powerful tools, how many of you here like tools?

06:48:29.620 --> 06:48:34.340
I got tools, I got like every tool known to man in my garage, just ask my wife, she'll tell you,

06:48:35.060 --> 06:48:39.620
okay, I like tools. One of the most powerful tools in your box is this stuff right here,

06:48:40.580 --> 06:48:44.980
the second most powerful tool you're going to have is the digital multimeter, because the digital

06:48:44.980 --> 06:48:49.780
multimeter is going to allow you to get out there and find the missing 3 volts, find the

06:48:49.780 --> 06:48:54.340
missing 3 volts, found the problem, found the problem, you save the day, you save the day,

06:48:54.340 --> 06:48:59.940
hit your boss up for a raise, he gives you a pink slip, cut you loose, just kidding,

06:49:00.820 --> 06:49:07.860
you get a promotion, life is good, make so much money, get married, start a family,

06:49:07.860 --> 06:49:12.980
get a girlfriend on the side, it's all good, and I don't mean that.

06:49:17.060 --> 06:49:23.060
The current through each branch of a parallel circuit is inversely proportional to the amount

06:49:23.060 --> 06:49:32.340
of resistance of the branch, I is equal to E over R, I is equal to E over R, so that means

06:49:32.900 --> 06:49:39.860
because R here, that means E over R, right, E over R, we use the slash here, but that means

06:49:39.860 --> 06:49:45.540
that this is on the bottom of the slash, so whatever we do to R is going to have an opposite

06:49:45.540 --> 06:49:53.220
effect on I, we call that an inverse proportional relationship, an inverse proportional relationship,

06:49:54.660 --> 06:49:59.300
so for resistance increases, current decreases, bigger accident, less flow of traffic,

06:50:00.100 --> 06:50:06.500
smaller accident, traffic flow increases, plain and simple, so keep that in mind,

06:50:07.540 --> 06:50:12.820
the value of least resistance in a parallel circuit will have the highest current flow through it.

06:50:14.820 --> 06:50:19.860
The total current in a parallel circuit is the sum, literally the sum of the individual branch

06:50:19.860 --> 06:50:28.260
currents, that's why we call parallel circuits current dividers, thank you current dividers.

06:50:30.180 --> 06:50:34.180
The reciprocal of the total resistance in a parallel circuit is equal to sum of the

06:50:34.180 --> 06:50:39.700
reciprocals of the individual resistances, this is a fancy way of saying when we put

06:50:39.700 --> 06:50:46.500
resistors in parallel with each other, we actually add up the, the reciprocals, we add up the

06:50:46.500 --> 06:50:52.660
conductance of those, of those pads, not the resistance of those pads, and the conductance

06:50:52.660 --> 06:51:00.180
of those pads literally is the reciprocal of the resistance, and as Simon came up with, right,

06:51:00.820 --> 06:51:09.780
that was his whole trip. The other formula that I want you to be aware of, and I know some of

06:51:09.780 --> 06:51:14.740
you are resistant, reluctant to use it, it's a product over some formula, if you've got two

06:51:14.740 --> 06:51:22.100
resistors or two resistances of parallel, use the product over some formula, product means

06:51:22.180 --> 06:51:29.700
R1 times R2 divided by the sum, R1 plus R2, and it's a real easy way, I mean it's what's the,

06:51:29.700 --> 06:51:34.980
you know, you got a half inch nut that you need to get loose, you know, you could either use,

06:51:34.980 --> 06:51:41.460
you know, the box end wrench, or you could use your teeth, use the easiest tool, the easiest tool

06:51:41.460 --> 06:51:45.540
is the product over some formula, well that's another formula we got to memorize, don't memorize

06:51:45.540 --> 06:51:51.460
these formulas, use them and learn them, you understand the difference, memorizing stuff

06:51:51.460 --> 06:51:56.500
never worked for me, I mean that's always my fear that I'm gonna get pulled, that's why I don't drink

06:51:56.500 --> 06:52:00.500
and drive, because like I get pulled over, even if I haven't been, or you know, if I'm not totally

06:52:00.500 --> 06:52:03.940
under the influence, they're gonna ask me to do the ABCs, and I'm probably gonna screw that up,

06:52:04.660 --> 06:52:08.820
they're gonna throw me in the husk out because I don't know my ABCs, because I never really

06:52:08.820 --> 06:52:14.420
memorized them, I kind of like learned them, saying backwards, I mean have you do that crap,

06:52:14.420 --> 06:52:19.780
can't freaking do that, what the heck are you doing, while hopping on one foot, you know,

06:52:19.780 --> 06:52:25.220
recite the alphabet backwards, no man officer, with all due respect, let's see you do that,

06:52:25.940 --> 06:52:33.060
huh, geez, you're killing me, total power consumed in a parallel circuit is equal to

06:52:33.060 --> 06:52:37.060
some of the power consumed by the individual resistors, no mystery here, we just talked about it

06:52:37.060 --> 06:52:49.220
last chapter, power is always, that's beautiful, correct, if you only have two components in

06:52:49.220 --> 06:52:54.900
parallel, two or more, you got to use your favorite formula, the reciprocal of the total

06:52:54.900 --> 06:52:58.180
resistance of parallel is equal to some of the reciprocals of the individual resistances,

06:52:59.620 --> 06:53:02.980
a lot of people like that one more than mine, mine is only good for two,

06:53:04.500 --> 06:53:10.580
also with that don't forget your thumb rules, remember your thumb rules, right, if it's equal

06:53:10.580 --> 06:53:15.860
resistance, you simply count up the number of resistors, that value of resistance and divide

06:53:15.860 --> 06:53:20.100
it by that number, if I have four 100 ohm resistors in parallel with each other, what's the total

06:53:20.100 --> 06:53:31.780
resistance, four 100 ohm resistors in parallel with each other, 100 divided by equals 25 ohms

06:53:31.780 --> 06:53:40.260
of resistance, the other thing for resistors in parallel, the total resistance will always be

06:53:40.260 --> 06:53:47.860
less than the value of least resistance, it'll always be less than the value of

06:53:47.860 --> 06:53:52.500
least resistance, thumb rules, okay, you pay attention to those thumb rules, your GPA is

06:53:52.500 --> 06:53:57.060
going to increase drastically, because you're going to have something to check yourself against,

06:53:57.060 --> 06:54:00.180
I don't know if I use the right formula, but I remembered you always said the value of least

06:54:00.180 --> 06:54:03.300
resistance will be less than the value of least resistance, my answer meets that,

06:54:03.620 --> 06:54:10.340
I'm comfortable with that answer and stick with that answer, power is additive, it's a parallel

06:54:10.340 --> 06:54:14.260
circuit, remember I always said voltages constant across parallel network, that's because this

06:54:14.260 --> 06:54:19.300
electrical pressure being exerted by this source is distributed equally across these three loads,

06:54:19.300 --> 06:54:24.500
period, it's the same, it better be the same, if it's not we got a problem,

06:54:26.420 --> 06:54:32.900
if it's not we got a problem, where's the missing voltage, this is how your house is wired,

06:54:32.900 --> 06:54:38.740
in parallel, the outlet in your bathroom better have the same voltage across as the outlet in

06:54:38.740 --> 06:54:43.300
your family room as the outlet in your garage, if not it's not wired properly, something's up,

06:54:48.340 --> 06:54:53.220
I got a big circuit like this at home, because I do everything big, that's how I roll,

06:54:54.260 --> 06:54:59.300
I made some significant improvements to my backyard about 10 years ago, my backyard used to come out

06:54:59.300 --> 06:55:06.020
and used to drop off a hill and it was just an unusable backyard, I wanted to like do stuff back

06:55:06.020 --> 06:55:14.020
there, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, so I was looking at, I had to build a

06:55:14.020 --> 06:55:20.660
retaining wall, pocket big bucks to put in a nice retaining wall, so I was looking at different options

06:55:21.380 --> 06:55:27.460
and I like to utilize the resources that are available to me, so I have a good friend of mine

06:55:27.460 --> 06:55:34.100
that worked for the railroad, Burlington Northern, and I said hey, you know you guys use those railroad

06:55:34.100 --> 06:55:39.220
ties, what are the chances of getting some of those railroad ties, what are you talking about,

06:55:39.220 --> 06:55:43.380
all like a truckload, those are hard to come by Joe, I ain't what it used to be,

06:55:45.060 --> 06:55:48.500
so for like three years I kept hitting them up for railroad ties and wasn't getting anywhere,

06:55:49.060 --> 06:55:54.020
and we had a great relationship, finally he said something, he was kind of hitting around about

06:55:54.100 --> 06:55:59.540
going for an airplane ride, you know, it's hitting me up for an airplane ride, and finally, and I'm not

06:55:59.540 --> 06:56:04.980
the quickest study, the smartest guy out there, sharpest tool in the shed, I finally like oh,

06:56:04.980 --> 06:56:09.300
I get it, so I gave him a call like hey Larry, what are you doing Monday night, you know,

06:56:09.300 --> 06:56:13.940
want to go for an airplane ride, pick them up in Arlington and we went out over the cascades,

06:56:13.940 --> 06:56:19.700
beautiful sunset, whatever landed, right, that Wednesday my cell phone's ringing, hey Joe,

06:56:20.020 --> 06:56:23.860
still want those railroad ties, yeah, I got clearance not only to give you the railroad

06:56:23.860 --> 06:56:28.740
ties, but I got clearance to use a Burlington Northern crane to load them on a truck for you,

06:56:28.740 --> 06:56:33.380
okay, you just got to get the flatbed, so I went out and rented a flatbed, I drove literally,

06:56:33.380 --> 06:56:37.460
it was funny it's a Burlington Northern, but it was a yard up in Burlington, so I had to drive

06:56:37.460 --> 06:56:43.700
all the way up there, he loaded them on 148 ties, long story short, I built a beautiful retaining

06:56:43.700 --> 06:56:49.300
wall, I actually had a former student of mine that was an engineer, he designed a wall for me,

06:56:50.340 --> 06:56:56.340
you know, did the prints and everything, built this wall and landscaped it, beautiful, so now I

06:56:56.340 --> 06:57:00.900
have a backyard, my neighbors, they weren't digging it, because now they're looking at like, you know,

06:57:00.900 --> 06:57:06.020
he's got a perfect yard, we still, you know, there's like a wall, you know, railroad ties,

06:57:07.540 --> 06:57:11.540
funny part of that story too, that entire, I built that by hand, 148 ties, I don't know if you've

06:57:11.540 --> 06:57:17.460
ever picked up a railroad tie, they are heavy, I built that by hand, back filled it by hand with

06:57:17.460 --> 06:57:23.460
a wheelbarrow, gravel, drainage by hand, you know how much weight I lost that summer, zero,

06:57:24.180 --> 06:57:28.980
probably had something to do with the pizzas and beer I was consuming while I did it, but anyway,

06:57:29.540 --> 06:57:34.020
what I wanted to do is I wanted, when it was all landscaped and everything, in the process,

06:57:34.020 --> 06:57:39.700
before landscaping, I wanted to put in low voltage lighting, low voltage lighting around the perimeter,

06:57:39.700 --> 06:57:44.740
so you know like these, the goofy lights you stick in and you know, but I wanted to put in conduit,

06:57:44.740 --> 06:57:51.860
I wanted to do this right, and as a pilot, I kind of want that almost to look like a runway,

06:57:51.860 --> 06:57:56.180
and you know, in airport, you know, the lights around the periphery, so I use these low voltage

06:57:56.180 --> 06:58:01.220
lights, I had a big power supply in my garage and equipment rack, dug conduit all the way back,

06:58:01.940 --> 06:58:06.580
did my calculations, and the other thing about calculations, determining what size wire you

06:58:06.580 --> 06:58:11.460
should use, the kind of wire that I use is the kind that falls off the back of a truck, you know,

06:58:11.460 --> 06:58:15.940
and the kind that contacts provide me with, so I went with this gauge of wire, it was a little bit

06:58:15.940 --> 06:58:19.940
substandard, but you know, I was like, ah, the math kind of works out and it's kind of good,

06:58:19.940 --> 06:58:25.860
so I've got all these low voltage lights, and ironically, ironically, I came out nice, came

06:58:25.860 --> 06:58:32.820
out really, really nice, nice backyard, but I could tell, if I brought you back there, you

06:58:32.820 --> 06:58:38.500
probably wouldn't, you probably wouldn't even notice it, but I could tell which light is the

06:58:38.500 --> 06:58:46.340
furthest from the power supply, just looking at it, and it kind of bothers me, it doesn't bother me

06:58:46.340 --> 06:58:52.740
enough to rip up the conduit and pull new cable, okay, but I know, I know by looking at it, and

06:58:52.740 --> 06:59:01.220
what does that tell me? That tells me that the load furthest down the line is not getting the

06:59:01.220 --> 06:59:08.660
same voltage as the load closest to the source, and gradually as you get further away from it,

06:59:08.660 --> 06:59:10.740
you just notice a little difference in illumination.

06:59:15.300 --> 06:59:18.020
Yes, that's my whole point. Why, it doesn't it?

06:59:18.900 --> 06:59:33.300
I needed, I needed to use basically a heavier gauge of wire in doing that, if I had done that,

06:59:33.300 --> 06:59:37.380
then I could, yeah, there's ways of faking, soldering, what are you doing out there? I'm

06:59:37.380 --> 06:59:42.740
soldering in resistors to these other laps, why'd I get it? My wife would probably finally really

06:59:42.740 --> 06:59:47.700
give me the boot, but it bothers me, it bothers me because I'm, I'm, I like doing things right,

06:59:47.700 --> 06:59:52.660
and I guess I did do it right, because you know how much that wire that I used cost me,

06:59:52.660 --> 06:59:58.740
you know, literally fell off the back of a truck, so you know, don't, don't judge me. I have a friend

06:59:58.740 --> 07:00:01.940
that's a police officer, I asked him, I said, you know, what's the whole deal like if I got

07:00:01.940 --> 07:00:05.860
something that fell off the back of the truck? He like sat up, and he's like, you know, I'd like,

07:00:05.860 --> 07:00:10.340
I'd love to drive the, cite the driver for driving an unsecured load, you know, so.

07:00:10.340 --> 07:00:16.420
Anyway, so this is a parallel circuit. Now, yes.

07:00:21.780 --> 07:00:25.540
You know, that's one of the other things I was kicking around, can I stick an inert gas in there,

07:00:25.540 --> 07:00:30.980
and, and you know, increase the, the dielectric properties, and you know, she'd throw me out,

07:00:30.980 --> 07:00:37.060
man, she'd throw me out. And you know what, I know you find it's hard to believe, maybe you won't,

07:00:37.060 --> 07:00:43.060
but I actually have a nitrogen bottle at home, doesn't everybody? And I don't necessarily use

07:00:43.060 --> 07:00:51.140
it for welding. Series parallel circuits, this is the easiest part of this entire chapter.

07:00:52.100 --> 07:00:56.340
Circuit thick, it's just about series and parallel circuits. To solve most series parallel circuits,

07:00:56.340 --> 07:01:01.300
simply apply the laws of rules of each type. There's no mystery, there's no silver bullet,

07:01:01.300 --> 07:01:06.500
there's no easy way for me to describe it to you. Use series formulas for the series parts of the

07:01:06.500 --> 07:01:12.740
circuit, use the parallel for the parallel parts, period. That's all it is, that's all the series

07:01:12.740 --> 07:01:17.780
parallel circuit is, that's what it looks like. R2 and R3 are in parallel with each other.

07:01:18.820 --> 07:01:25.540
You got to solve for that before you could solve the total resistance, because R2 and R3, one of

07:01:25.540 --> 07:01:31.860
things that I like to do is identify these points right here, these are called nodes. I'm going to

07:01:31.860 --> 07:01:38.020
call this node A and node B. The resistance between node A and node B is equal to the parallel

07:01:38.020 --> 07:01:46.980
resistance of R2 in parallel with R3. I'd use the product over some formula to determine what RAB

07:01:46.980 --> 07:01:54.340
is. Follow what I'm saying, RAB, the resistance between node A and node B. The total resistance

07:01:54.340 --> 07:02:02.660
in the circuit is equal to R1 plus RAB, that's what equals total current, excuse me, total

07:02:02.660 --> 07:02:08.980
resistance. Total current can be determined by that. Once I know what total current in the circuit is,

07:02:08.980 --> 07:02:12.100
total current is going to create a voltage drop across this resistor.

07:02:14.420 --> 07:02:19.540
Total current is going to create a voltage drop across this resistance.

07:02:19.540 --> 07:02:29.300
The resistance I'm talking about is the resistance of AB, which is the combination of two in parallel

07:02:29.300 --> 07:02:35.140
with three, make sense? So once you do that, it's just easy to slice and dice. The worst thing is,

07:02:35.140 --> 07:02:38.580
is when you see, I mean, you know, obviously we gave you some problems with the assignments of the

07:02:38.580 --> 07:02:45.460
book that are, you know, take time for you to solve. But the first thing you got to do is, is break

07:02:45.540 --> 07:02:51.380
it down. The other thing too, is if I had a resistor in series with another resistor here,

07:02:51.380 --> 07:02:57.940
I'd need to solve for these two first, because they're in series with each other, but in parallel

07:02:57.940 --> 07:03:04.500
with this. So then I need to solve for this section of the circuit, which is in series with this

07:03:04.500 --> 07:03:11.860
section of the circuit. So, you know, a lot of students get frustrated

07:03:14.340 --> 07:03:19.780
and think there's a checklist they could follow or a protocol. No, you just got to pay attention to

07:03:19.780 --> 07:03:25.860
the individual laws and rules that we established, but there are no two circuits alike. One of the

07:03:25.860 --> 07:03:30.980
things that I've heard over the years of teaching here, I got a lot of new students that come and,

07:03:30.980 --> 07:03:35.300
or quite frankly, a lot of people, they're working in industry already, and they want to come in,

07:03:35.300 --> 07:03:42.180
and they want to learn how to read schematics. Joe, if I come to your program, can I learn how

07:03:42.180 --> 07:03:48.980
to read schematics? Well, yeah, but we don't have a schematic reading class. There's no schematic

07:03:48.980 --> 07:03:55.460
reading class. And quite frankly, I wouldn't want to have a schematic reading class, even if I could

07:03:55.460 --> 07:03:59.460
fill the schematic reading class, because you wouldn't learn anything. What are you doing here by

07:03:59.460 --> 07:04:06.660
studying this? You're learning how to read a schematic. You're learning to differentiate between

07:04:06.660 --> 07:04:11.220
those sections of the circuit that are in parallel with each other and those sections that are series

07:04:11.220 --> 07:04:17.700
components. Later on, when we talk about transistors right now, those of you in the full-time program

07:04:17.700 --> 07:04:23.060
did a component ID test today to be able to recognize different types of components. You're

07:04:23.060 --> 07:04:29.140
going to see what happens when we put a transistor, a diode, a capacitor, different components in

07:04:29.140 --> 07:04:38.340
different configurations. If I put a capacitor in series, all as it is, is a capacitor in series.

07:04:38.340 --> 07:04:43.140
It's still a series circuit, and everything that we've talked about this week still applies.

07:04:44.340 --> 07:04:47.220
There's going to be some things that are going to be a little bit different with a capacitor in a

07:04:47.220 --> 07:04:52.740
circuit. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but it's still a capacitor connected in series.

07:04:53.860 --> 07:04:58.180
And there's really only three types of circuits that you're ever going to deal with in your entire

07:04:58.180 --> 07:05:06.580
career, and that is series, parallel, and complex. So if any of you this week have been grunting,

07:05:07.700 --> 07:05:18.420
groaning, outside, weeping, gnashing your teeth, you know what? It's all right, because once you

07:05:18.420 --> 07:05:24.980
master series, parallel, complex, there's nothing else I'm going to throw at you. There's nothing

07:05:24.980 --> 07:05:32.020
else that Peter's going to throw at you. Now that being said, we're going to have you look

07:05:32.020 --> 07:05:37.300
at some complex circuits in the future, and you know what? You will deceive me. As much as you

07:05:37.300 --> 07:05:42.500
could pass this test on series, parallel, complex circuits, you're going to forget about it in the

07:05:42.500 --> 07:05:46.900
future, because we're going to give you some schematic to read that's got some different

07:05:46.900 --> 07:05:51.620
components on it, or it's got some components drawn at weird angles or something, and you're

07:05:51.620 --> 07:05:58.340
going to get your freak on, and you're going to say, boy, they never taught me that. I don't know

07:05:58.340 --> 07:06:03.620
what to do. You know what you do? You fall back to the basics. The only circuit you're going to

07:06:03.620 --> 07:06:08.820
encounter in industry are series, parallel, and complex. And if it's complex, what laws do you

07:06:08.820 --> 07:06:12.740
use? Those are series and parallel. You just got to figure out which components are in series,

07:06:12.740 --> 07:06:17.140
which one are in parallel. I can't say it any stronger. If it's in series, there's one way in,

07:06:17.140 --> 07:06:23.060
there's one way out. If it's in parallel, that means there's interconnection of all the components.

07:06:24.500 --> 07:06:24.980
Make sense?

07:06:28.500 --> 07:06:34.340
Voltage dividers used to set a bias or operating point of various active electronic components.

07:06:34.900 --> 07:06:41.060
We use voltage dividers to create the voltages that turn on transistors and integrated circuits.

07:06:41.380 --> 07:06:47.860
They're used to divide a higher voltage to a lower voltage, and this process is often called

07:06:47.860 --> 07:06:56.340
scaling, because what are we doing? Voltage rise equals voltage drop, or voltage drops.

07:06:57.540 --> 07:07:03.940
So voltage drops will always be a fraction or scaling of the total voltage that we apply to the

07:07:04.500 --> 07:07:06.500
circuit. Does that make sense?

07:07:09.860 --> 07:07:13.220
We're going to use Ohm's Law to solve that. That's the current through his circuit. I'm not done

07:07:13.220 --> 07:07:18.020
with voltage dividers. Trust me, I'm not done. I'm done when the screen goes black. Now, no,

07:07:18.020 --> 07:07:21.860
I'm not done when the screen goes black. Then I'm going to show you some stuff on the board,

07:07:21.860 --> 07:07:26.820
so sit tight. That's not my spiel on voltage dividers. Ohm's Law to current through a circuit is

07:07:26.820 --> 07:07:31.700
directly proportional to voltage across the circuit, inversely proportional to resistance.

07:07:31.780 --> 07:07:39.060
Ohm's Law, i is equal to e over r. Current division, current is directly proportional to voltage

07:07:39.060 --> 07:07:43.220
across the circuit. If a voltage increases, current increases. If a voltage decreases,

07:07:43.220 --> 07:07:51.140
current decreases. The voltage drop is equal to the percentage of the dropping resistor to the

07:07:51.140 --> 07:07:55.700
sum of the dropping network. You know what? I'm giving you this formula. If you dig math,

07:07:56.100 --> 07:08:03.620
great. If this confuses you, just tune me out. Because everything could be solved with Ohm's

07:08:03.620 --> 07:08:09.380
Law and Watts Law. If you dig math, this is another tool in your box. Let me show you how this

07:08:09.380 --> 07:08:16.340
thing works. If I want to calculate out my voltage drop across a load, across a resistor,

07:08:17.300 --> 07:08:27.380
this voltage is going to be equal to my voltage source multiplied by the voltage drop

07:08:27.380 --> 07:08:35.300
divided by the voltage total. Let's keep this really, really simple so we can understand how

07:08:35.300 --> 07:08:44.180
this formula works. If I've got two 100 Ohm resistors, if I have two 100 Ohm resistors

07:08:44.180 --> 07:08:49.380
in series with each other. I want to know what voltage I'm dropping across one of those.

07:08:50.580 --> 07:08:54.260
I'm going to draw that. You know what I'm talking about? I should be able to use words because the

07:08:54.260 --> 07:08:58.740
test I give you, the quiz, is going to be words. That's why I try not to draw too much on the board.

07:08:58.740 --> 07:09:02.660
I'll draw some stuff on the board, but I want to draw too much because I, Joe, all week you've been

07:09:02.660 --> 07:09:06.740
drawing stuff on the board and then you ask me a bunch of words. You've got to pass the quizzes

07:09:06.740 --> 07:09:25.220
and their words, word problems. But if I've got this, if I've got this and I've got 100 volts,

07:09:25.220 --> 07:09:32.980
let's keep this real simple. What this formula is showing me is what is our drop here?

07:09:36.980 --> 07:09:53.620
V drop is equal to voltage total times our drop over our total.

07:09:55.860 --> 07:09:59.060
Okay, so let's take a look at that. Voltage total is going to be

07:09:59.700 --> 07:10:07.940
100 volts times our drop, which is one of these voltage drops, whichever one you're trying to

07:10:07.940 --> 07:10:15.140
calculate for. Let's say it's this one. It's going to be 100 divided by, what's my total

07:10:15.140 --> 07:10:27.860
resistance in a circuit? 200. Okay, what's 100 divided by 200? What is it? 0.5. 0.5. What does 0.5

07:10:27.860 --> 07:10:42.820
mean? What percentage? Half. It means 50%. So 100 times 50% equals what? 100 divided by 0.5. What

07:10:42.820 --> 07:10:47.220
does it equal? 50 volts. We could do this one in our head. That's why I want you to do this in your

07:10:47.220 --> 07:10:52.420
head so you understand the formula. You understand how the formula works? So if you know what this

07:10:52.420 --> 07:10:57.620
value of total is and you want to calculate out, let's say that I went ahead and I changed this

07:10:57.620 --> 07:11:09.380
now, that this is 500 ohms and this is 100 ohms and I'm asking you what voltage is going to be

07:11:09.380 --> 07:11:17.140
across this voltage drop here. 100 divided by 5, basically 1.5. 1.5. What percentage is 1.5?

07:11:20.260 --> 07:11:25.860
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20%. So that means 20% of my voltage is going to be dropped across this.

07:11:26.740 --> 07:11:35.220
If 20% is being dropped here, actually no, right? Because this is 100 over 600. So what percentage

07:11:35.220 --> 07:11:40.740
is that? I was off on my math. I'm sorry. You guys were buying it, man. I want to be your banker.

07:11:44.980 --> 07:11:53.620
What's 100 divided by 600? Because total resistance is 600. 17. So basically 17%

07:11:54.340 --> 07:11:59.700
is going to be dropped right here. 117 volts is going to be here. The remainder is going to be...

07:12:02.340 --> 07:12:06.340
Where's the remainder voltage going to be dropped? This is an easy question. Right here. It's got to

07:12:06.340 --> 07:12:13.700
be because this plus this has to equal this. Does that make sense? So this is just another formula

07:12:13.700 --> 07:12:19.540
for those of you with mathematics. One other tool. I like tools. Just ask my wife. I've got every

07:12:20.260 --> 07:12:24.500
tool. There's another tool for you. So if I'm giving you... I could sit here all day long and tell

07:12:24.500 --> 07:12:28.260
you how much voltage is dropped here, how much is here. It's a lot easier to use this formula.

07:12:28.260 --> 07:12:31.620
Although you could calculate the same thing using Stray Ohm's law. It's just going to take you a

07:12:31.620 --> 07:12:40.420
little bit longer to get to the answer. Make sense? All right. In summary, a series circuit provides

07:12:40.420 --> 07:12:45.860
only one path for current flow. Series circuit formulas include IT is equal to IR1, equal to IR2,

07:12:45.860 --> 07:12:53.460
equal to IR3, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RT is equal to R1 plus R2 plus R3, et cetera,

07:12:53.460 --> 07:12:59.940
et cetera, et cetera. Voltage. A series circuit is also known as a voltage divider. So therefore,

07:12:59.940 --> 07:13:04.820
the sum of the individual voltages must equal source voltage. I is equal to E over R. Well,

07:13:04.820 --> 07:13:09.540
that's Ohm's law. Power is additive in a series circuit. Power is additive in a parallel circuit.

07:13:09.780 --> 07:13:17.700
A parallel circuit provides more than one path for current flow. Parallel circuit formulas

07:13:17.700 --> 07:13:25.300
include IT is equal to IR1 plus IR2 plus IR3, the reciprocal formula for resistance. Voltage

07:13:25.300 --> 07:13:30.100
is constant across a parallel network. Again, I is equal to E over R. If you want to calculate

07:13:30.100 --> 07:13:35.380
how much current is flowing through an individual path, and power total is equal to PR1 plus PR2

07:13:35.380 --> 07:13:40.100
plus PR3, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Series parallel circuits are solved by using

07:13:40.100 --> 07:13:43.300
series formulas for the series parts of the circuit. Parallel formulas for the parallel

07:13:43.300 --> 07:13:48.980
parts of the circuit. We talked about voltage dividers, more to come. And we talked about

07:13:48.980 --> 07:13:54.260
current division, process of, excuse me, process of current division in a parallel circuit.

07:13:54.260 --> 07:13:59.380
Any questions on this? Okay, let's talk about voltage dividers.

07:13:59.940 --> 07:14:08.020
Kind of get emotional when I talk about voltage dividers. It's kind of like your first real

07:14:08.020 --> 07:14:12.260
circuit that really does something. Trust me, it'll be good.

07:14:16.980 --> 07:14:20.420
But I need some help, though, because we've got some electronic experts in here.

07:14:20.420 --> 07:14:26.980
I'm going to need some help. What kind of a circuit would I use to divide voltage?

07:14:28.980 --> 07:14:32.580
Series. You've got three to choose from. Multiple choice answer.

07:14:32.580 --> 07:14:36.340
Series circuits, parallel circuits are complex circuits. The correct answer is ding, ding,

07:14:36.340 --> 07:14:42.340
ding, ding, ding, series. Okay? So a series circuit is also known as a voltage divider,

07:14:42.340 --> 07:14:45.860
right? Y'all believe me? Okay, so let's go ahead and draw that.

07:14:51.300 --> 07:15:03.380
This is a voltage divider. Any questions?

07:15:08.580 --> 07:15:13.300
Unfortunately, this is a voltage divider, but unfortunately, this isn't going to do much for

07:15:13.300 --> 07:15:18.740
us. This will do a lot for us, but if we effectively want to use it, it really can't be

07:15:18.740 --> 07:15:24.500
represented like this. It can't be represented like this. First of all, we got to ask ourselves,

07:15:24.500 --> 07:15:30.580
why would we want to divide up voltage? We want to divide up voltage, like I said in here, to power

07:15:30.580 --> 07:15:36.980
transistors, to power integrated circuits, to power different types of loads, to power different

07:15:36.980 --> 07:15:50.820
types of devices. Make sense? Okay, so let's say as an example that I have a 48 volt power supply.

07:15:51.540 --> 07:15:59.620
This is a big rack mounted power supply that sits there and drones. It puts out 48 volts DC,

07:16:00.100 --> 07:16:08.500
but I've got some different appliances that I want to power from it. Okay? One of the devices that I

07:16:08.500 --> 07:16:23.940
want to power from it is a 12 volt radio, a simple 12 volt radio. Okay? And that 12 volt radio is a

07:16:24.020 --> 07:16:32.820
citizen band radio, CB radio. So what I need to do is I want to connect that radio

07:16:35.540 --> 07:16:44.740
to this resistor right here and have this resistor produce 12 volts across it. So when I go out

07:16:44.740 --> 07:16:51.620
here and connect my radio, which I'm going to represent, anybody know a symbol that I could

07:16:51.620 --> 07:17:04.660
use to represent a radio? What's that? R. Yeah, yeah. There's no special schematic. What I'm

07:17:04.660 --> 07:17:10.660
going to do here is I'm going to draw a resistor and that represents the load

07:17:12.580 --> 07:17:17.380
that a CB radio has. And I'm going to connect it in parallel.

07:17:17.700 --> 07:17:25.060
Do you agree that that's in parallel? So whatever voltage is here is going to be right here. Okay?

07:17:25.060 --> 07:17:31.060
When I did this, I just changed the dynamics of the circuit. I just changed the dynamics of the

07:17:31.060 --> 07:17:36.740
circuit. What I just did is I just loaded the voltage divider. So we're going to call this a

07:17:36.740 --> 07:17:41.780
loaded voltage divider now. And quite frankly, a voltage divider in and of itself without any

07:17:41.780 --> 07:17:47.300
the loads connected to it's kind of stupid. So you guys, guys, if you had read ahead and you

07:17:47.300 --> 07:17:50.580
really had mastery of it when I'm showing you the voltage divider, you could have said,

07:17:50.580 --> 07:17:54.260
Joe, that's stupid. What are you going to do is put three resistors, divide the voltage. What

07:17:54.260 --> 07:18:00.020
good is that? Okay? What you got to do to make it viable is connect the load to a loaded voltage

07:18:00.020 --> 07:18:03.060
divider. This is a real circuit. We're really going to do something here. We're really going to

07:18:03.060 --> 07:18:11.700
power a CB radio. Okay? So to figure out, we know that this is 12 volts because the manufacturer

07:18:11.700 --> 07:18:15.620
just said this is a 12 volt CB radio. You plug it in your cigarette lighter, you could wire it

07:18:15.620 --> 07:18:22.900
into your car, and you too could be breaker breaker 1-9. Makes sense? So we know the voltage

07:18:22.900 --> 07:18:32.580
is going to be 12 volts. The other piece of information that is critical for us is we have to

07:18:32.580 --> 07:18:43.860
know how much current is required by the CB radio to operate properly. So what we're going to do

07:18:43.860 --> 07:19:03.540
over here, okay? P-I-V. Okay? I know that the CB radio, a typical CB radio, is about five watts.

07:19:05.780 --> 07:19:11.060
And I know that that CB radio, because I got the box, and the salesperson at Radio Shack,

07:19:11.060 --> 07:19:15.540
we know how smart they are, said I could wire it up into my car. It's a 12 volt system. Okay?

07:19:15.540 --> 07:19:22.500
So this is going to be 12 volts. So how much current is going to be required to power that radio

07:19:22.500 --> 07:19:28.660
when I key the microphone and I broadcast out five watts? By the way, that's the maximum you'll

07:19:28.660 --> 07:19:33.220
ever consume in a CB radio. If it's a five watt radio, the maximum you're ever going to consume

07:19:33.220 --> 07:19:37.300
is when you're transmitting. If you're just receiving, that doesn't consume much energy at all.

07:19:37.300 --> 07:19:44.260
It's when you key that mic and transmit that you're going to start consuming the most power.

07:19:44.260 --> 07:19:50.020
So I'm thinking worst case scenario here. Okay? So all we need to do here, right, with your calculator,

07:19:51.380 --> 07:20:05.460
go five divided by 12. What do I come up with? 0.42, rounding off, right? 0.411, 0.416666.

07:20:07.380 --> 07:20:10.740
All right? That's what I got. Everybody get that? Everybody saw I came with that? Okay?

07:20:14.660 --> 07:20:21.700
That's assuming the radio is 100% efficient. You know what I mean? Like every ounce of current

07:20:21.700 --> 07:20:25.540
is going into generating that, which there's going to be losses. How do I know there's going to be

07:20:25.540 --> 07:20:32.340
losses? When I use the radio, it's going to get hot. All that energy is not going to get out the

07:20:32.340 --> 07:20:36.900
antenna. If you get that working, you get all the energy, getting out the antenna,

07:20:36.900 --> 07:20:41.940
give me a call. All right? I have my attorney contact. I personally fly at a bimini. I'll

07:20:41.940 --> 07:20:47.140
set you up. Pour you your first cocktail. Okay? I'll set the tab up for you.

07:20:50.580 --> 07:20:55.140
So what I'm going to do with this, just for the case of example, is I'm going to round this.

07:20:55.140 --> 07:21:02.500
Generally speaking, a CB radio is going to take a minimum of half an amp at 12 volts,

07:21:02.740 --> 07:21:08.420
a minimum half an amp. Probably it's going to be even more than that. But in order for it to

07:21:08.420 --> 07:21:13.380
transmit out 5 watts, you see the math. Does everybody see the math? Okay. So I am going to

07:21:13.380 --> 07:21:26.020
assume that this here is 0.5 amps. So we know everything about the CB radio now. It's a 12 volt,

07:21:26.020 --> 07:21:32.260
5 amps, 5 watt radio. I feel pretty good about it. We can calculate out the internal resistance

07:21:32.260 --> 07:21:36.660
of it if we want it to. I don't see the benefit of doing that now. We don't need to do that right

07:21:36.660 --> 07:21:48.260
now. Make sense? Okay. Voltage divider. Voltage divider. I've got another device. I've got another

07:21:48.260 --> 07:21:54.260
device. And this other device that I have is, by the way, we're not going to put this in your car

07:21:54.260 --> 07:22:00.180
anymore. We're going to put this CB radio on my boat. Why I want a CB radio on a boat? I do not know.

07:22:00.180 --> 07:22:05.300
It's a power thing, man. I want to talk with truckers because I'm going underneath the bridge. Ha-ha.

07:22:05.300 --> 07:22:11.540
You start the traffic. I'm going underneath it. Ha-ha. I'm on my boat. Okay. I'm going to install a,

07:22:12.980 --> 07:22:18.340
I'm going to install a radar system. And the radar system

07:22:22.580 --> 07:22:24.900
that I could represent with a resistor

07:22:25.620 --> 07:22:34.500
is going to be connected across these two resistors.

07:22:37.620 --> 07:22:44.420
The voltage of my commercial radar system is 24 volts DC.

07:22:48.100 --> 07:22:50.820
And it puts out 200 watts.

07:22:55.860 --> 07:23:03.620
How much current is going to be needed to go through this device in order to transmit out 200 watts?

07:23:03.620 --> 07:23:13.220
Again, if you get confused, draw the triangle, P, I, V, 200 watts divided by 24. What do you come up with?

07:23:13.540 --> 07:23:21.220
How much?

07:23:22.580 --> 07:23:24.100
0.12? 0.12?

07:23:28.260 --> 07:23:36.340
How much? We got a big disparity here. That makes sense, right? If a half an amp can power a CB radio,

07:23:37.940 --> 07:23:42.180
it's going to have to be more than a half an amp to power 200 watt transmitter, right?

07:23:43.380 --> 07:23:49.300
Even at, even at double the voltage. So all's I got to do here is power is 200

07:23:50.980 --> 07:23:55.540
divided by how much? What's our voltage? 24.

07:24:05.140 --> 07:24:07.380
8.33? And that assumes what?

07:24:07.380 --> 07:24:13.780
That assumes 100% efficiency. Do we get 100% efficiency out of this stuff?

07:24:13.780 --> 07:24:17.620
To be honest with you, if we're lucky if some of this stuff operates at 80% efficiency,

07:24:18.260 --> 07:24:24.900
20% of the energy gets consumed as heat. So just for the case of example,

07:24:26.020 --> 07:24:32.660
I'm going to say that this thing really in order for it to work properly is going to need 10 amps.

07:24:33.460 --> 07:24:40.660
And this might be what the placard data on the back of the radar says or the manual says,

07:24:41.300 --> 07:24:48.340
okay? But you understand that which one of these are real? If you do the math, this number could

07:24:48.340 --> 07:24:52.100
be good, this number could be good. And if that's the case, then we know that the answer is going to

07:24:52.100 --> 07:25:00.100
be 8.33 amps. But in reality, because of the losses, because of the property of resistance,

07:25:00.180 --> 07:25:08.180
we're probably going to be consuming really about 10 amps. Make sense? Okay. So now what I have

07:25:08.180 --> 07:25:13.620
is a circuit, a viable circuit. And by the way, if I want 24 volts here,

07:25:16.180 --> 07:25:21.700
and I am getting this voltage across these two resistors,

07:25:23.860 --> 07:25:27.540
what voltage must I be dropping across this resistor right here?

07:25:30.740 --> 07:25:33.300
How much? Why 12?

07:25:36.980 --> 07:25:44.180
Yeah. And I am connecting this radar unit in parallel. I love it when you talk that way.

07:25:44.980 --> 07:25:51.700
Parallel with these two resistors that are in a voltage divider network. Okay. So what we did

07:25:51.700 --> 07:25:57.380
is we just built a voltage divider, a loaded voltage divider. But we've got to analyze it now.

07:25:58.340 --> 07:26:03.380
We've got to analyze it. And this is where the author like pulled numbers out of his backside,

07:26:03.380 --> 07:26:06.420
and he really didn't justify it. And I don't even know where that's coming from. That's why

07:26:06.420 --> 07:26:23.460
we're having this lesson. Question? This, remember, this here, I bought this military surplus. This

07:26:23.460 --> 07:26:29.540
is a 48 volt power supply. Okay. So it converts my ship's power to 48 volts DC.

07:26:32.740 --> 07:26:39.860
Yeah. So if this is 48, and this is 12, and this is 12, what's this got to be? 24. Why?

07:26:44.820 --> 07:26:47.540
Come on, guys. Quote me what I've been quoting you.

07:26:47.940 --> 07:26:53.860
Rise has to, your drop has to equal the rise. Absolutely. Because the drops have to equal

07:26:53.860 --> 07:26:59.620
the rise. I'm putting 48 volt rise in. I'm getting 48 volts a drop. 12 here, 12 here, 24 here.

07:27:00.420 --> 07:27:05.620
All voltage drops present in the count of 4. Makes sense? Okay. So this is cool. It's really

07:27:05.620 --> 07:27:10.340
going to work like this. But we don't know the math. We don't know what values of resistance

07:27:10.340 --> 07:27:14.820
to use here. This is where it gets tricky. This is where there's another thumb rule.

07:27:14.820 --> 07:27:19.380
It's why you come to lecture. Okay. If the book was that good, the book was that good,

07:27:19.380 --> 07:27:23.060
you could be home in your underwear studying right now. And I could be home in my underwear

07:27:23.060 --> 07:27:27.140
correcting your work. Instead here, I'm dressed up wearing lab coats, you're wearing lab coats,

07:27:27.140 --> 07:27:36.420
and we're having this interactive lesson. The thumb rule is, you ready for this? The bleeder,

07:27:37.380 --> 07:27:46.020
the bleeder current needs to be one-tenth of the total load current.

07:27:48.740 --> 07:27:55.140
The bleeder current needs to be one-tenth of the total load current.

07:27:59.860 --> 07:28:05.700
How many of you buy that? You better buy it. I just sold it to you. Now the question is,

07:28:05.700 --> 07:28:10.980
what the heck is he talking about, bleeder current? The bleeder current is the current

07:28:10.980 --> 07:28:19.460
flowing through the first resistor that starts the voltage division process. So by me saying that,

07:28:19.460 --> 07:28:24.900
first of all, we've got to determine what is our total load current? What's our total load

07:28:24.900 --> 07:28:33.220
current in this circuit? 28? 48? Total load current. Current is measured in

07:28:34.180 --> 07:28:40.820
amps. What is my total load current in this circuit? 10.5. What? Pounds ounces, kilograms,

07:28:40.820 --> 07:28:46.260
amps. I love it when you talk that way. Total load current is 10.5 amps. Everybody see how we did

07:28:46.260 --> 07:28:51.620
that? The only loads in this circuit, this is a voltage divider. These are my loads. The only

07:28:51.620 --> 07:28:56.180
loads in the circuit here are, what the heck was this, a CB radio? Breaker, breaker, 1.9, CB.

07:28:57.380 --> 07:29:04.980
And then this was a radar system. Radar system consumes 10 amps. This consumes half an amp.

07:29:04.980 --> 07:29:13.380
So my total load current is 10.5 amps. Do you all agree with that? Okay. So I said

07:29:14.580 --> 07:29:19.460
the foam rule is that the bleeder current is one-tenth of the total load current. What's one-tenth

07:29:19.460 --> 07:29:39.140
of 10.5? Okay. So 10.5 divided by 10, 10.5 amps. Do you all agree with that?

07:29:41.140 --> 07:29:48.100
Get some puzzle to look. One-tenth of my total load. One-tenth of 10.5 is 1.05. Agree with that?

07:29:48.900 --> 07:29:54.580
So that's how much current, I'm going to do something here to change the color to make it stand

07:29:54.580 --> 07:30:01.780
out. Okay. It's going to be passing through this first resistor. Very good. Okay. And this is going

07:30:01.780 --> 07:30:13.460
to be 1.05 amps. And again, that's where, where's that coming from?

07:30:19.220 --> 07:30:25.220
So at least remember my, my deal. So right there, we just unlock the entire circuit.

07:30:26.180 --> 07:30:32.660
We just unlock the entire circuit because what we've got here is 1.05 amps coming up out of this

07:30:32.660 --> 07:30:39.140
node. How much current do we have coming up through here? Where'd that number come from?

07:30:41.780 --> 07:30:47.460
Thank you. The paperwork. Okay. Or your calculation based on, if the paperwork left out the current

07:30:47.460 --> 07:30:51.060
demand, you know it's a five watt radio. And again, as long as you can prove it,

07:30:51.700 --> 07:30:57.220
got to be able to prove it to somebody. Okay. So we called that 0.5. So we've got 0.5 amps

07:30:59.300 --> 07:31:00.260
coming up through here.

07:31:02.900 --> 07:31:08.260
All the current that comes up through the radio is going to come here into this node right here.

07:31:08.260 --> 07:31:15.300
So I got 0.5 amps coming in from this angle. I got 1.05 coming in from this angle. Can any

07:31:15.300 --> 07:31:24.900
tell me about how much current's going to be going through this? How'd you come up with that?

07:31:31.220 --> 07:31:34.740
And how'd you come up with that? Is that just, is that, is that a notion?

07:31:35.940 --> 07:31:42.420
It's a current divider. It is a current divider. Okay. But again, what's going to bring tears to

07:31:42.420 --> 07:31:49.140
my eyes is if you quote me laws. Are there any laws that govern what's happening here in this node?

07:31:49.140 --> 07:31:55.620
What is it? Absolutely. Kirchoff's law. I got 1.05 coming up here. I got 0.5 here. We got

07:31:55.620 --> 07:31:59.220
a traffic cop standing in the middle of that intersection. How much current's driving away

07:31:59.220 --> 07:32:09.380
from them? 1.55 amps. It's got to. It's got to. If this thing's functioning, it's got to work like

07:32:09.380 --> 07:32:17.140
this. So I've got 1.55 amps coming up through here. Okay. How much current is coming up through

07:32:17.140 --> 07:32:30.260
this load? How do we know that? Plackered data, technical documentation, calculation utilizing

07:32:30.260 --> 07:32:37.780
Watt's law. I don't know. Because Joe said so. Actually, I didn't. All I gave you is that 24 volts

07:32:37.780 --> 07:32:45.300
in the 200 watts. You folks really calculated that out. The only curveball that I shot you in any of

07:32:45.300 --> 07:32:51.380
this was the efficiency bit. I'm talking about efficiency. The book doesn't even talk about that.

07:32:51.380 --> 07:32:56.980
But you just, you don't get 100% of anything. You don't. There's nothing that's 100% efficient.

07:32:58.500 --> 07:33:04.020
So I got 10 amps coming up through my radar system. That means that 10 amps makes a 90 degree corner at

07:33:04.020 --> 07:33:22.340
the speed of light. Okay. 10 amps. 11.55 amps. How'd you get an extra amp with Watt?

07:33:28.020 --> 07:33:32.260
What was the rule here? What was the whole thing on unlocking this entire circuit?

07:33:32.340 --> 07:33:34.260
What did I call this resistor? The

07:33:36.260 --> 07:33:41.060
bleeder resistor. And that's what's starting the whole process. We have to have some current going

07:33:41.060 --> 07:33:46.580
through that to create. And the reason that we use 1.10, so is that these loads come on and offline?

07:33:46.580 --> 07:33:50.660
The circuit's going to have stability because that CB is not always going to be on. And when we

07:33:50.660 --> 07:33:55.940
turn the CB off, we don't want the whole circuit to go cattywampus. We want it to be somewhat

07:33:55.940 --> 07:34:01.060
balanced. Same thing with the radar system. So it's a thumb rule. It's not an absolute. It's a

07:34:01.060 --> 07:34:07.380
thumb rule that should give us consistency of operation for this circuit. Makes sense?

07:34:08.100 --> 07:34:11.380
So we know that we have 11.55 amps coming up through here.

07:34:12.340 --> 07:34:17.380
Boom. If I've got 11.55 amps flowing into my power supply, how many amps must I have flowing

07:34:17.380 --> 07:34:27.780
out of my power supply? The same. Okay. So that means I've got 11.55 amps flowing into this node.

07:34:27.780 --> 07:34:34.100
If I've got 11.55 amps flowing into this node and 1.05 amps flowing out of this node,

07:34:34.100 --> 07:34:39.940
how much current do I have flowing in this direction? How much?

07:34:43.140 --> 07:34:50.580
10.5 amps. Do you agree with that? If I've got 10.5 amps flowing

07:34:50.580 --> 07:34:55.700
into this node and I got 0.5 flowing in this node, how much current am I going to have flowing

07:34:55.700 --> 07:35:04.020
in this direction? Isn't that the same number we started off with?

07:35:04.020 --> 07:35:09.700
So I just prove that this works. I just traced all the current through this circuit in doing this.

07:35:09.700 --> 07:35:14.580
Now, the easy part of the analysis,

07:35:20.340 --> 07:35:28.180
VIR, let's calculate out resistance, voltage over current. Voltage over current, right?

07:35:28.820 --> 07:35:37.700
Voltage 12 over 1.05. 12 over 1.05 is going to give me this value of resistance. R is going to be equal to

07:35:39.700 --> 07:36:07.220
11.428 ohms. That's what I came up with. Are we going to find a 11.428 ohm resistor?

07:36:10.020 --> 07:36:17.460
Can we find something close? Maybe we could find one with tolerance as a 10 ohm resistor that's

07:36:17.460 --> 07:36:22.420
on the high side, 20 percent tolerance. We could find one that's within that, right?

07:36:22.420 --> 07:36:27.620
Because a 10 ohm resistor could be anywhere from 12 ohms to 8 ohms. So yeah, we might be able to

07:36:27.620 --> 07:36:36.100
find something close to that. It's not going to be that critical. You're going to get less

07:36:36.100 --> 07:36:42.100
of a voltage drop there because that is kind of critical. The bigger the resistor,

07:36:42.100 --> 07:36:47.540
the bigger the voltage drop. The smaller the resistor, the smaller. So we could do the same

07:36:47.540 --> 07:37:02.820
thing up here, right? 12 volts divided by 1.55 amps, 7.7 ohms, and then finally here up at the top,

07:37:02.820 --> 07:37:17.300
24 divided by 11.55, 2.08 ohms.

07:37:26.180 --> 07:37:29.140
And this is how you analyze a loaded voltage divider.

07:37:33.060 --> 07:37:42.180
It's really nothing unique. All we did is apply Ohm's law, Watt's law, Kerchoff's law.

07:37:44.180 --> 07:37:46.820
You know, one of the other things that's kind of fun that I could do with this circuit,

07:37:46.820 --> 07:37:51.300
I think it's fun. You'll probably think I'm horrible for doing that kind of stuff.

07:38:02.820 --> 07:38:31.300
What is it?

07:38:33.300 --> 07:38:38.580
It's the exact same circuit. And to be honest with you, this is how this thing would really be

07:38:38.580 --> 07:38:44.740
connected. This is how it'd be really connected. Your 48 volt power supply would be connected to

07:38:45.860 --> 07:38:51.700
what kind of ground? Electrical ground. Not necessarily earth ground, electrical ground,

07:38:51.700 --> 07:38:56.580
which is typically a chassis ground or a frame of a vehicle or a boat, the hull of a ship,

07:38:57.540 --> 07:39:04.020
the frame of a train car. This is how it's going to be done because we're going to use the frame

07:39:04.020 --> 07:39:08.980
as a conductor. Circuits are going to operate exactly the same. We're going to get the

07:39:11.940 --> 07:39:16.660
bottom of the circuit here, the bleeder resistor, connect that also to ground, chassis ground.

07:39:17.860 --> 07:39:23.460
We're going to connect the negative lead of our radio directly to chassis ground. We're going to

07:39:23.460 --> 07:39:29.060
connect the negative lead of our radar. The radar's kind of out of an unusual position, you know?

07:39:29.060 --> 07:39:32.580
I got that, you know, the pulpit up there, I drive the boat, I want the low radar there.

07:39:32.580 --> 07:39:36.100
So I'm going to have to run quite a bit of cable, but I'm still going to connect it to

07:39:37.140 --> 07:39:43.620
chassis ground. And this is the exact same circuit that you just analyzed. I just made it more

07:39:43.620 --> 07:39:49.140
complex, complicated looking by putting these grounds in. Basically, when you see this in a

07:39:49.140 --> 07:39:57.140
circuit, you know that electrically all of these are interconnected. Don't let me screw you up with

07:39:57.140 --> 07:40:04.740
this kind of stuff. And it's assumed that you know how to interpret this type of stuff. Questions?

07:40:19.620 --> 07:40:22.980
10.5 divided by 10.

07:40:25.620 --> 07:40:32.580
One tenth is 10, right? One tenth is 10. Make sense? 10.5?

07:40:36.660 --> 07:40:40.820
1.05. You can multiply it by 0.1, you get the same answer.

07:40:41.140 --> 07:40:49.380
Another question? No? Questions?

07:40:52.580 --> 07:40:56.660
So you could sit here, and again, that's a thumb rule, but you could use it for analysis.

07:40:56.660 --> 07:40:59.940
And then if somebody asks you, how the heck did you come up with that? How did you, what,

07:41:00.740 --> 07:41:04.660
you want me to buy these parts? Well, how'd you come up with that? Well, I used it as a thumb rule

07:41:04.660 --> 07:41:08.900
that I want my bleeder current, okay, as opposed to the author, who just, again, I don't know where

07:41:08.900 --> 07:41:12.580
those numbers came from. I don't know, I don't want to know, it is what it is.

07:41:15.220 --> 07:41:19.780
So in the future, use that one tenth. I use that one tenth, you're not even going to get the,

07:41:19.780 --> 07:41:23.300
I mean, you'll get the, you won't get the answer that the author gets in the book.

07:41:23.940 --> 07:41:27.700
I don't know what, you got to do it wrong to get the number that the author gets in the book.

07:41:28.340 --> 07:41:32.900
So there's, in the future, when you see loaded voltage dividers, use that one tenth rule,

07:41:33.700 --> 07:41:38.500
unless you're told otherwise. You know, there might be an engineer that knows a lot more

07:41:38.500 --> 07:41:44.500
math than we know. They say, no, we want you to assume 15%, or 20%, or whatever.

07:41:45.700 --> 07:41:51.700
But you need some guidance. We're not engineers. Guys, remember that? You know that? We're not

07:41:51.700 --> 07:41:57.700
engineers. Anybody here want to be an engineer? Honestly? No offense, honestly? Okay, if you

07:41:57.700 --> 07:42:01.940
want to be an engineer, that's, you know, that's good. You're going to immerse yourself more in

07:42:01.940 --> 07:42:05.940
the world of theory. We immerse ourselves more in the world of reality.

07:42:06.580 --> 07:42:11.940
So we're going to do what we're told to do. Actually, I had a meeting today with an engineer,

07:42:11.940 --> 07:42:16.180
we're looking at some engineering, starting some engineering classes here at Lake Washington,

07:42:16.180 --> 07:42:20.260
a parallel program to pursue your engineering degree. And the way he was talking about it,

07:42:20.260 --> 07:42:24.260
too, like a pyramid. It's like a pyramid. You get to research science, a handful of

07:42:24.260 --> 07:42:28.500
research people up here at the top of a pyramid. Then you've got engineers designing this stuff.

07:42:28.500 --> 07:42:33.380
And then you got technicians making the stuff work. So there's a lot more technician jobs out

07:42:33.380 --> 07:42:39.780
there to support engineering. And the engineering supports R&D. You know, Boeing only has a handful

07:42:39.780 --> 07:42:46.100
of people that sit around and think about weird crap all day long. Thank God, right? Because then

07:42:46.100 --> 07:42:50.500
what they do is they farm it out to the engineers and say, hey, make this work. Make this work.

07:42:51.220 --> 07:42:54.020
And then the engineers figure it out and the calculations and everything. And then they

07:42:54.020 --> 07:42:59.380
give the technicians and they say, make this work. And then we are the last line of defense.

07:42:59.380 --> 07:43:06.180
And the only thing that we have to fall back on are the laws of physics and the theory of operation.

07:43:06.180 --> 07:43:09.620
That's all we have to fall back on. And if you're going to apply that, then you're going to be ahead

07:43:09.620 --> 07:43:19.940
of the game. So no question about it. No question about it. This actually worked out pretty well

07:43:19.940 --> 07:43:28.420
for us with last week doing seven and eight and then saving chapter nine for this week.

07:43:29.780 --> 07:43:33.220
Because that's the only thing that we're going to do tonight is going to be chapter nine,

07:43:33.780 --> 07:43:40.340
magnetism. And this is a huge chapter. I don't think there's any other property that has

07:43:41.140 --> 07:43:47.860
had such a profound impact on society as magnetism, as you're soon going to see.

07:43:48.500 --> 07:43:55.300
I mean, if it weren't for the property of magnetism, electronics and electricity would not be

07:43:55.300 --> 07:44:03.060
what it is today. It's really that simple. So with that introduction, let's forge ahead with

07:44:03.060 --> 07:44:07.700
chapter nine, magnetism. After completing this chapter, you're going to be able to identify

07:44:07.700 --> 07:44:15.460
three types of magnets, describe the basic shapes of magnets, describe the difference between

07:44:15.460 --> 07:44:20.900
permanent magnets and temporary magnets, describe how the earth functions as a magnet,

07:44:21.540 --> 07:44:28.980
state the laws of magnetism, explain magnetism based on the theory of atoms and electron spin,

07:44:29.700 --> 07:44:36.020
explain magnetism based on the domain theory, identify flux lines of their significance,

07:44:36.660 --> 07:44:42.340
define permeability, describe the magnetic effects of current flowing through a conductor,

07:44:42.980 --> 07:44:48.180
describe the principle of an electromagnet, describe how to determine the polarity of an

07:44:48.180 --> 07:44:56.420
electromagnet using the left hand rule, define magnetic induction, define retentivity and residual

07:44:56.420 --> 07:45:02.100
magnetism, define a magnetic shield, describe how magnetism is used to generate electricity,

07:45:02.660 --> 07:45:07.460
state the basic laws of magnetism, describe how the left hand rule for generators can be

07:45:07.460 --> 07:45:12.820
used to determine the polarity of induced voltage, describe how AC and DC generators

07:45:12.820 --> 07:45:18.260
convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, describe how a relay operates as an

07:45:18.260 --> 07:45:23.700
electromechanical switch, discuss the similarities between a doorbell in a relay, discuss the

07:45:23.700 --> 07:45:29.780
similarities between a solenoid in a relay, describe how a magnetic phonograph cartridge

07:45:29.780 --> 07:45:36.260
works, describe how a loudspeaker works, describe how information can be stored and retrieved using

07:45:36.260 --> 07:45:43.860
magnetic recording and describe how a DC motor operates. I don't think we've had any chapter

07:45:43.860 --> 07:45:50.020
up to this point that has had so many objectives and this just shows us the far-reaching hand

07:45:50.020 --> 07:45:57.060
of the property of magnetism. It's everywhere. All the magic that's done in today's society is

07:45:57.060 --> 07:46:08.020
brought to us really by magnetism. I'm not bragging about it. It's really what takes place.

07:46:09.540 --> 07:46:17.860
Magnets. There's really several different types, three types. Natural magnet is derived from

07:46:17.860 --> 07:46:25.540
magnetite and it just so happens that I've got a couple pieces of magnetite in my pocket.

07:46:25.540 --> 07:46:31.140
These are natural magnets. It's like found in the earth's crust. Here it is. We'll pass this

07:46:31.140 --> 07:46:38.660
around and we'll let you play with polished magnetite. That's kind of cool stuff.

07:46:39.620 --> 07:46:43.140
So that's found in the earth's crust and it's just a natural magnet.

07:46:43.140 --> 07:46:49.540
Artificial magnet could be created by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a piece of magnetite.

07:46:49.540 --> 07:46:56.100
So if you've got a piece of soft iron and I see underneath what the heck are you doing under there,

07:46:56.660 --> 07:47:03.140
I'm creating an artificial magnet by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a piece of magnetite.

07:47:03.140 --> 07:47:06.980
And what it's going to do is it's going to pull that magnetic property off of the magnetite and

07:47:06.980 --> 07:47:13.540
transfer it to your piece of soft metal. Actually, that's a trick with a lot of mechanics. If you

07:47:14.340 --> 07:47:19.540
magnetize the tip of a screwdriver, it comes in handy for picking up things that you drop

07:47:20.180 --> 07:47:27.220
into odd places. Finally, the third type of a magnet is an electromagnetic magnet.

07:47:27.220 --> 07:47:33.220
This is created by current flowing through a coil of wire. Basically, when we pass current

07:47:33.220 --> 07:47:39.380
through a coil of wire, we're going to develop a magnetic field. And in concentrating that,

07:47:39.380 --> 07:47:44.180
that's how we have an electromagnet. So electromagnets range in size from very,

07:47:44.180 --> 07:47:49.380
very small to, if you've ever seen like at a junkyard, a scrapyard, on a crane,

07:47:49.380 --> 07:47:54.180
they've got an electromagnet. You turn it on, it like, you know, picks up a car or whatever.

07:47:54.180 --> 07:47:59.940
Actually, my favorite application, I'm a big James Bond fan. Remember that Jaws dude? It was like,

07:47:59.940 --> 07:48:04.260
you know, like biting things, like train cars and stuff. And you know, they turned on the big

07:48:04.260 --> 07:48:09.940
electromagnet, boom, pal. You get pulled right up to the ceiling on that. So that was a giant

07:48:09.940 --> 07:48:17.940
electromagnet. I'd hate to have your credit cards anywhere near that as your credit cards have

07:48:17.940 --> 07:48:25.140
magnetic strips on it and a strong electromagnet will probably desensitize those cards. Here's

07:48:25.140 --> 07:48:31.700
some examples of some magnets coming variety. It's my personal collection. Just kidding. This is

07:48:31.700 --> 07:48:38.820
torrid core, meaning it's a donut shaped. It's circular. This is a standard bar magnet. This

07:48:38.820 --> 07:48:43.140
would be like a horseshoe magnet because it kind of looks like a horseshoe. The thing to remember

07:48:43.140 --> 07:48:48.260
is that all these magnets are going to have a north pole and a south pole, even that magnetite

07:48:48.260 --> 07:48:54.660
that we're passing around there. If you try holding it unusual, it won't even attach each other.

07:48:54.660 --> 07:49:00.660
Basically, the reason that those four pieces of magnetite are attracted to each other is because

07:49:00.660 --> 07:49:05.540
the north pole is attracted to the south pole of the other magnet, which is attracted to the north

07:49:05.540 --> 07:49:11.220
pole, the south pole of the other magnet. North and north ain't going to work. Permanent magnets

07:49:11.220 --> 07:49:18.340
retain their magnetic properties. That's why they're called permanent magnets. Temporary magnets

07:49:18.340 --> 07:49:23.940
are only going to retain a small portion of their magnetic properties. That's why they're called

07:49:24.020 --> 07:49:31.380
temporary. Over time, that magnetic field may deteriorate or be altered. Permanent magnet

07:49:31.380 --> 07:49:37.700
will retain the magnetic properties. Now, this is kind of cool, and I'm sure it's no surprise to

07:49:37.700 --> 07:49:46.340
any of you. The earth is a giant freaking magnet. It has to do with the core of the earth and then

07:49:46.340 --> 07:49:56.020
the crust. We basically have a giant north pole and we have a giant south pole. The problem about

07:49:56.020 --> 07:50:01.060
the north pole and the south pole, I got to give you a geography lesson here. If I wanted to go

07:50:01.060 --> 07:50:11.220
find Santa Claus, where would I look and how would I get there? How could I navigate my way to this

07:50:11.220 --> 07:50:19.540
place? With a compass, and where am I trying to get to? Okay, so you want me to use a compass

07:50:19.540 --> 07:50:26.100
to try to get to the north pole to try to find Santa Claus? To get to the magnetic north pole.

07:50:26.980 --> 07:50:32.420
If I get to the magnetic north pole, am I going to find Santa Claus? No, nowhere to be found.

07:50:32.980 --> 07:50:37.060
In order for me to find Santa Claus, what am I going to have to do? I'm going to have to go to the

07:50:37.540 --> 07:50:48.820
north pole, or the north geographic pole, which is literally the top of the earth.

07:50:50.660 --> 07:50:53.940
Anybody want to take a wild guess what the best way of getting up there might be?

07:50:56.500 --> 07:50:56.980
What's that?

07:50:59.460 --> 07:51:01.540
Well, I'm talking about means of transportation.

07:51:01.940 --> 07:51:18.420
Submarine. Yeah, you could be in a short sleeve shirt and go up there, surface at the north pole,

07:51:18.420 --> 07:51:22.340
because it's underneath the Arctic Ocean. So you could surface at the north pole.

07:51:22.340 --> 07:51:28.020
So I just happened to flaunt that. I actually have never been to the north pole. My submarine has

07:51:28.020 --> 07:51:35.460
been to the north pole. At home, I've got water from the north pole in a vial from my submarine

07:51:35.460 --> 07:51:39.060
that went to the north pole. My submarine actually delivered, believe it or not,

07:51:39.060 --> 07:51:45.220
Al Gore to the north pole. It was after I was off the sub, but they did a mission

07:51:45.220 --> 07:51:52.020
and went to the north geographic pole. Typically on the ice, they've put a lot of research camps

07:51:52.980 --> 07:51:59.140
to conduct research, magnetic research. I mean, that's the place to do it.

07:51:59.860 --> 07:52:06.100
So the north magnetic pole is, this is this illustration. It's an artist depiction. It's

07:52:06.100 --> 07:52:13.700
not very accurate. The north geographic pole is going to be somewhere up here up north of Labrador,

07:52:14.740 --> 07:52:20.980
and it moves about two kilometers per year, and it's actually moving in a northwestern lead

07:52:21.060 --> 07:52:27.940
direction. And the variance, the magnetic variance. Anybody know the magnetic variance?

07:52:27.940 --> 07:52:32.260
The difference here between the north pole geographic pole and where the north magnetic

07:52:32.260 --> 07:52:38.260
pole is? I know because I'm a pilot, and it's kind of important, okay? Because if I start flying

07:52:38.260 --> 07:52:43.620
northbound or whatever, which am I going geographic north or am I going magnetic north?

07:52:43.620 --> 07:52:49.460
And the difference here in the Seattle area is between 19 and 20 degrees difference.

07:52:50.020 --> 07:52:57.300
It's pretty significant. So this hallway right out here in this wing is aligned pretty much with

07:52:57.300 --> 07:53:01.860
the north geographic pole. If you could walk straight, which none of us could do, we've got

07:53:01.860 --> 07:53:06.580
a dominant leg, and you walked out this hall and just kept walking north. Eventually you're going

07:53:06.580 --> 07:53:11.620
to get to the north pole flying Santa Claus. It's all going to be good. If you had a compass and you

07:53:11.620 --> 07:53:18.100
stepped outside the door here and you looked, that north magnetic pole is going to be literally

07:53:18.820 --> 07:53:23.540
over in this direction here. So it's very important because again in the aircraft,

07:53:23.540 --> 07:53:31.860
you've got a compass, you set your gyro compass for that magnetic heading. And I bet you folks never

07:53:31.860 --> 07:53:37.060
realized magnetic properties had such a profound impact on all these different things. If any of

07:53:37.060 --> 07:53:48.020
you are familiar with airports, airport runways are designated based on their magnetic heading.

07:53:48.900 --> 07:53:54.580
So C-TAC airport, C-TAC airport's got three runways, but they're all parallel with each other.

07:53:54.580 --> 07:54:02.500
So they all have the same numbers. If you're headed southbound, typically when we have crappy

07:54:02.500 --> 07:54:06.500
weather here in Seattle, if you look up and you see an airplane going on the C-TAC, what he's

07:54:06.500 --> 07:54:12.580
going to do is he's going to fly out over like Magnolia, then turn inbound, and then what he's

07:54:12.580 --> 07:54:20.500
going to do is land on runway 16. Because if you rounded that, it's on a compass heading of 160.

07:54:21.380 --> 07:54:24.820
So how do you make sure you're, you know, since there's three runways down there, because we

07:54:24.820 --> 07:54:28.340
all remember those of us that have lived in the area a while, that third runway when they put

07:54:28.340 --> 07:54:36.740
it in, it was very controversial. It's 16 left, 16 center, and 16 right. That's how they designate

07:54:36.740 --> 07:54:43.140
which runway you're cleared to land on. Add 180 degrees to that, and you end up with what?

07:54:44.420 --> 07:54:55.700
Runway, no, 16 plus 180 degrees, runway 34. So if you're landing northbound at C-TAC airport,

07:54:55.700 --> 07:55:03.620
you're cleared to land on runway 34 center, 34 left, or 34 right. Okay. Ironically, and the

07:55:03.620 --> 07:55:09.300
reason that they select runways is they do wind studies to determine where the prevailing winds

07:55:09.300 --> 07:55:14.260
are. You want to take off into the wind, and you want to land into the wind. So primarily here in

07:55:14.260 --> 07:55:21.060
central Puget Sound, that's pretty much how all the runways are. Auburn airport, 1634,

07:55:21.060 --> 07:55:30.900
Renton airport, 1634. C-TAC, 1634. Boeing field is a little bit different. It's runway 31 northbound,

07:55:30.900 --> 07:55:37.300
so there's going to be a slight variance in runway 13 in the opposite direction. That's just how the

07:55:37.300 --> 07:55:44.500
winds are kind of funneled there by the location of Boeing field. But Renton airport used to

07:55:46.740 --> 07:55:53.860
be runway 33, but because of that magnetic procession, what they've had to do is they've

07:55:53.860 --> 07:55:57.060
had to renumber. Do you think, oh, it's no big deal. You send a guy out there with a can of paint,

07:55:57.060 --> 07:56:01.060
and you paint the new number on the runway. It's not that easy. All of the procedures,

07:56:01.060 --> 07:56:05.620
all of the approach procedures, all of the publications, all of the databases all have

07:56:05.620 --> 07:56:10.740
to be updated. It's really a big thing. So eventually, all runways are going to have to

07:56:10.740 --> 07:56:15.700
change their number as that north magnetic pole continues to fluctuate. Why am I telling you

07:56:15.700 --> 07:56:21.220
this in an electronics class? A lot of you are going to go to work in industries that are associated

07:56:21.220 --> 07:56:26.020
with electronic navigation. And you got to know this. I mean, you don't have to memorize it. I'm

07:56:26.020 --> 07:56:31.460
not going to quiz you on this magnetic procession in the 1920 degrees variance here in Seattle.

07:56:31.460 --> 07:56:35.140
But a lot of you are going to go to work in electronic navigation systems, and you need

07:56:35.140 --> 07:56:43.140
to understand the difference between the two. Makes sense? The laws of magnetism. I think most

07:56:43.140 --> 07:56:49.060
of you probably remember this from elementary school. Unlike magnetic poles attract each other,

07:56:49.060 --> 07:56:53.460
right? Unlike a track. So north is going to be attracted to a south. The south is going to be

07:56:53.460 --> 07:56:59.460
attracted to a north. Like magnetic poles repel each other. North and a north, they're going to

07:56:59.460 --> 07:57:04.660
push each other away. South and a south, push each other away. This is actually kind of interesting

07:57:04.660 --> 07:57:12.180
too, because it has some applications now, like magnetic levitation. Some of these rail systems

07:57:12.180 --> 07:57:16.740
that they're actually, the whole train, levitates magnetically. That's how they're doing it. That's

07:57:16.740 --> 07:57:21.860
how you get a whole train to levitate. Because north pole and the north pole, they'll basically push

07:57:21.940 --> 07:57:28.020
each other away. And then once you've got something floating like that, it doesn't take a whole lot

07:57:28.020 --> 07:57:33.060
of energy to move a train. I mean, think about that. That's, I don't know if you've ever even

07:57:33.060 --> 07:57:40.420
thought about why do we use trains. I mean trains, that wheel on a rail, very little friction.

07:57:40.420 --> 07:57:47.220
So it takes very little energy to move a bunch of stuff, right? If you could kick it up even a

07:57:47.220 --> 07:57:53.220
notch further. I mean, we still have to overcome the friction of the bearings and the axle and

07:57:53.220 --> 07:57:58.420
the wheels on the track. Now, if you could levitate the entire train magnetically,

07:57:58.420 --> 07:58:02.820
then just give it a little push and that thing's going to be able to move with hardly any energy.

07:58:02.820 --> 07:58:08.580
So these are a lot of the advancements that we probably want to stay tuned for, because in the

07:58:08.580 --> 07:58:15.540
name of efficiency, we're trying to play with a lot of this stuff. Color code for magnets. Color

07:58:15.540 --> 07:58:22.260
code for magnets. Red is the color code that we use for north pole. Blue is the color code that

07:58:22.260 --> 07:58:30.980
we use for the south pole. So if we were going in search of Santa Claus and we got to the north

07:58:30.980 --> 07:58:36.260
geographic pole, what, how would we know we got there? What would we see?

07:58:36.580 --> 07:58:44.900
There'd probably be reindeer, but what color pole would there be?

07:58:45.780 --> 07:58:49.700
Red and white, very good. Red and white pole. We know that. Candy cane, right?

07:58:49.700 --> 07:58:52.100
If you were at the south pole, what color would the pole be?

07:58:54.580 --> 07:58:58.980
Blue and white. Striped pole, right? I mean, if you got to follow that same tradition.

07:59:00.020 --> 07:59:03.860
If you're outside a place that has a pole that's red, white, and blue, where are you?

07:59:04.820 --> 07:59:08.340
Bingo. Excellent. Very good. I got students that just...

07:59:10.500 --> 07:59:13.220
Same students that don't know what a barbershop is.

07:59:15.220 --> 07:59:18.580
I like the barbershop. That's how I roll. That's my thing.

07:59:19.540 --> 07:59:24.820
So yeah, that's the color code for magnets. Magnetism, the property of magnetism,

07:59:24.820 --> 07:59:32.820
can be traced to the atom. As electrons orbit the nucleus, they also spin on their axis.

07:59:33.940 --> 07:59:41.940
This electrostatic charge produces a magnetic field. So even these electrons are going to

07:59:41.940 --> 07:59:51.300
have magnetic properties. The direction of the magnetic field is the same as the electrons'

07:59:51.300 --> 08:00:01.620
direction of spin. So even at a subatomic level, we're going to have properties of magnetism.

08:00:04.100 --> 08:00:10.100
Ferromagnetic materials, ferro, meaning materials that contain ferrite,

08:00:10.100 --> 08:00:16.660
this is the stuff that will rust. If the metal will rust, it contains a high amount of ferrite.

08:00:16.660 --> 08:00:24.420
So any ferromagnetic materials are materials that respond to magnetic fields. Any of you have

08:00:25.140 --> 08:00:32.100
magnets at home stuck to your refrigerator? Your refrigerator is made out of a ferromagnetic

08:00:32.100 --> 08:00:38.740
material. If it were not painted, it would rust, plain and simple. If not, the magnets wouldn't stick

08:00:38.740 --> 08:00:43.700
to it. It's actually the old trick too, if you're going and buying a used car or whatever and you're

08:00:43.700 --> 08:00:49.700
looking for Bondo, right? Put a magnet over it and obviously if it sticks, you know that that's

08:00:49.700 --> 08:00:54.980
all original with no Bondo. You know, you all of a sudden get to an area and that magnet doesn't

08:00:54.980 --> 08:01:00.580
want to stick. Don't try this with a Corvette. Of course, Corvette is a fiberglass. And actually,

08:01:00.580 --> 08:01:06.580
with all the cars now, with all the plastic on them, magnets aren't going to stick well to plastic.

08:01:08.020 --> 08:01:15.460
Atoms combine into domains or groups. When un-magnetized, the domains are random.

08:01:15.460 --> 08:01:19.940
This is what we're looking at here in this illustration. This is random domains, okay?

08:01:19.940 --> 08:01:26.180
This is an un-magnetized piece of ferromagnetic material.

08:01:26.340 --> 08:01:36.340
As soon as we magnetize it, watch, this is kind of cool, boom. When magnetized, the domains align in a

08:01:36.340 --> 08:01:44.340
common direction and the material becomes a magnet. So if you've got my magnetite that we're passing

08:01:44.340 --> 08:01:51.620
around and you rub a screwdriver up against that, this is ultimately what's going to happen.

08:01:51.620 --> 08:01:55.380
You're going to align those domains and it's going to become magnetic.

08:01:58.980 --> 08:02:01.540
What would it do between a ferro and non-ferro metal again?

08:02:03.380 --> 08:02:09.860
Ferro contains ferrite and that's the iron content that makes stuff rust, basically.

08:02:15.300 --> 08:02:20.580
Now a magnetic field. A magnetic field. This is kind of where you got to hit the I believe

08:02:20.580 --> 08:02:29.860
button, right? It's invisible lines of force that surround a magnet. These invisible lines are called

08:02:29.860 --> 08:02:36.420
flux lines. We got to be careful because those of you in ELEC 115 are learning about flux, right?

08:02:36.420 --> 08:02:42.420
It's a different kind of flux. There's two types of flux in electronics. There's magnetic flux that

08:02:42.420 --> 08:02:48.980
we're talking about tonight and there's also flux that we use as a cleaning agent for soldering,

08:02:49.860 --> 08:02:54.660
okay? You're not going to use a magnetic field for cleaning and soldering to the best of my

08:02:54.660 --> 08:03:00.340
knowledge and magnetic field has never been used as a cleaning agent. Flux, however, is used as a

08:03:00.340 --> 08:03:06.260
cleaning agent, different type of flux. So this word has two meanings in electronics and don't forget

08:03:06.260 --> 08:03:10.180
one of the reasons that you're here is to learn the language of electronics. I wish I had had

08:03:10.180 --> 08:03:14.660
me as an instructor because I was kind of like flux and I was like, why are we going to use magnetic

08:03:14.660 --> 08:03:21.780
lines of force to clean something and make it more soluble? Nobody ever explained that to me

08:03:21.780 --> 08:03:27.620
and I wasn't the smartest student. These flux lines have polarity and that polarity is north

08:03:27.620 --> 08:03:37.540
to south, north to south and it always forms a complete loop. They do not cross each other

08:03:37.540 --> 08:03:50.260
and they tend to form the smallest possible loop. Some of you may have done this like in

08:03:50.260 --> 08:03:56.820
third grade. You've got a magnet, bar magnet, you've got a piece of paper and on top of that piece

08:03:56.820 --> 08:04:03.780
of paper you sprinkle iron filings. The iron filings will actually form a pattern and that

08:04:03.780 --> 08:04:12.020
pattern that you see is the invisible lines of force. It is the flux lines. That's exactly what

08:04:12.020 --> 08:04:20.340
you're doing by spreading those iron filings on that is seeing the lines of flux as a visual aid,

08:04:20.340 --> 08:04:29.540
if you will. Permiability, there's a new word for you, permeability is the ability of a material

08:04:29.620 --> 08:04:36.980
to accept magnetic lines of force. An example of something that has a high level of permeability

08:04:36.980 --> 08:04:43.300
would be your refrigerator at home if you've got magnets stuck to it.

08:04:45.700 --> 08:04:51.300
My last refrigerator that I bought and you never, how many of you here like buy a refrigerator because

08:04:51.300 --> 08:04:56.100
like you got nothing better to do and how many of you like buy a refrigerator because your food

08:04:56.100 --> 08:05:01.540
is all spoiled and your old one died. I mean that's normally how you go about it. My last

08:05:01.540 --> 08:05:11.620
refrigerator I was like in a panic and I found one and they never fit right. They've actually

08:05:11.620 --> 08:05:16.980
made them bigger so if you want one to fit into the small hole you got to get a custom refrigerator.

08:05:17.860 --> 08:05:24.980
A smaller custom refrigerator costs more than the big one that doesn't fit right. So I just got the

08:05:24.980 --> 08:05:29.620
big one it doesn't fit right. It's bigger whatever but I get home and I paid a lot of money for this

08:05:29.620 --> 08:05:34.420
thing and then I get my magnets and I got you know the magnets to put juniors work up on and

08:05:34.420 --> 08:05:38.660
everything else and my favorite pizza place. Magnets won't even stick to this thing because

08:05:38.660 --> 08:05:43.620
it's like this designer facade so you could, what the heck is this? I mean you know so you got to

08:05:43.620 --> 08:05:48.100
put the magnets on the side. You got to put them on the side because the front is so that you could

08:05:48.100 --> 08:05:53.940
make it you know I don't know. I just want something to keep my stuff cold. That's all I want.

08:05:55.540 --> 08:06:00.900
So permeability is a material that readily accepts these lines of force.

08:06:00.900 --> 08:06:05.620
If a magnet will stick to it it has a high level of permeability.

08:06:07.620 --> 08:06:12.900
Now there's a direct correlation between electricity and magnetism probably why we're

08:06:12.900 --> 08:06:19.060
talking about it tonight right in electronics program. A magnetic field is generated when

08:06:19.060 --> 08:06:29.140
current flows through a wire period. Period. Let me say that again a magnetic field is generated

08:06:29.140 --> 08:06:36.340
when current flows through a wire period. So when you plug something into an extension cord

08:06:36.340 --> 08:06:45.700
is it generating a magnetic field? You bet you. When you have, when you connect a speaker up to

08:06:45.700 --> 08:06:50.260
an amplifier and you've got current flowing through that wire to the speaker are you generating

08:06:50.260 --> 08:06:58.660
a magnetic field? Yeah okay. Anytime current flows through a conductor you generate a magnetic field.

08:06:59.700 --> 08:07:04.340
So if you could see magnetic fields and you had an energized piece of equipment you would see all

08:07:04.340 --> 08:07:08.740
of these lines of flux that are being formed by simply turning a piece of electronics on.

08:07:09.700 --> 08:07:16.340
By simply turning a piece of electronics on or an electrical circuit on you're generating lines of

08:07:16.340 --> 08:07:21.300
flux. Sometimes it's something that we need to be aware of other times it's something we need to

08:07:21.300 --> 08:07:26.660
discount. An example would be in your home okay. Typically how your house is wired up the magnetic

08:07:26.660 --> 08:07:32.820
fields that are generated by your home are not sufficient enough to cause you any worries.

08:07:32.820 --> 08:07:38.260
They're not going to demagnetize your credit cards. They're not going to you know screw up your

08:07:38.260 --> 08:07:45.700
brain. You know it's but still they are generating magnetic fields. There's no way around it.

08:07:52.500 --> 08:07:57.860
Yeah and again with some computer screens there's some higher frequencies that are used and I mean

08:07:57.860 --> 08:08:04.100
it's the same thing. You know is it harmful or harmless? I don't know. There's also some laws

08:08:04.100 --> 08:08:10.740
on the books about building schools underneath power lines. You know so if there was nothing there

08:08:10.740 --> 08:08:15.940
why are there laws on the book about that? You know I've never had an interest of well my only

08:08:15.940 --> 08:08:21.620
interest of living underneath a power line would be able to perhaps tap into that magnetic field

08:08:21.620 --> 08:08:26.580
and lower my power bill which of course would be illegal and not above board and I would never do

08:08:26.580 --> 08:08:31.060
that but I never really had a whole lot of interest of like living underneath power lines.

08:08:31.700 --> 08:08:37.380
You know because it's just an unknown. You just you just don't know because those high voltage

08:08:37.380 --> 08:08:43.700
wires they move a lot of current through it. I mean you create huge magnetic fields. I don't know

08:08:43.700 --> 08:08:48.660
if you you realize this but there if you get a fluorescent tube and you go underneath a lot of

08:08:48.660 --> 08:08:52.580
these high voltage wire you could you could excite the gases inside the fluorescent tube and light

08:08:52.980 --> 08:08:59.700
look mom it's lighting up with no strings attached so if it could ionize gas inside a fluorescent

08:08:59.700 --> 08:09:04.260
tube you know what's it doing to your you know I don't know about you you know but I've had a

08:09:04.260 --> 08:09:08.500
pretty good life I got a lot of good memories I do not want to scramble those memories so I'm

08:09:08.500 --> 08:09:13.460
going to keep my brain away from magnetic fields and anything else that will alter some of these

08:09:13.460 --> 08:09:31.300
fond memories that I have from my youth so this is exactly what it would look like here

08:09:31.300 --> 08:09:37.300
we have current flowing through a conductor and we're going to generate this magnetic field around

08:09:37.300 --> 08:09:53.540
the outside um if the magnetic field is strong enough stuff would stick to it normally the

08:09:53.540 --> 08:10:00.900
magnetic field is is not that strong so stuff won't necessarily stick to it like iron filings are

08:10:00.900 --> 08:10:06.820
not necessarily going to be attracted you know to a low energy circuit that's energized but

08:10:07.620 --> 08:10:11.700
that being said there's still a magnetic field there it's just not strong enough to

08:10:11.700 --> 08:10:18.980
you know attract an iron filing you know to to stick to the circuit thank goodness you know or

08:10:18.980 --> 08:10:26.420
whenever we turned anything on it would be you know now yeah it would it would have to be a

08:10:26.420 --> 08:10:31.940
significant enough field to attract you know current to do that the current going through it

08:10:31.940 --> 08:10:36.740
would have to be sufficient enough to create a big enough magnetic field to attract an iron filing

08:10:38.180 --> 08:10:44.900
electromagnets composed of many turns of wire close together because as I as I just said one

08:10:44.900 --> 08:10:50.420
piece of wire may not be strong enough what happens if you get that and then you wrap it around again

08:10:50.420 --> 08:10:56.020
now you just doubled it you do it a third time you tripled it fourth time quadrupled it the

08:10:56.020 --> 08:11:01.780
math is simple the math is is that simple so every time with a winding you add a winding you're

08:11:01.780 --> 08:11:07.460
increasing it that magnetic field that you're generating by it so the principle of an electromagnet

08:11:07.460 --> 08:11:16.660
when wire is twisted into a loop the flux lines are brought together the flux lines are then

08:11:16.660 --> 08:11:25.300
concentrated at the center of the loop and we establish a north and south pole anytime you

08:11:25.380 --> 08:11:30.020
create a magnetic field you're creating both a north pole and a south pole

08:11:33.220 --> 08:11:40.100
the strength of the magnetic field can be increased three ways the more turns of wire the more

08:11:40.100 --> 08:11:44.980
flux lines are going to be added together and concentrated the greater the current

08:11:46.420 --> 08:11:51.620
the greater the number of flux lines that are going to be generated okay this only carries you

08:11:51.620 --> 08:11:56.340
so far though because what happens you're passing current through what

08:11:58.900 --> 08:12:02.500
a piece of wire what property does wire have associated with it

08:12:03.220 --> 08:12:10.100
resistance so you just can't keep increasing the current because if you keep increasing the

08:12:10.100 --> 08:12:16.260
current eventually what's going to happen it's going to become a fuse I mean even if the wire is

08:12:16.260 --> 08:12:20.420
this thick you have enough current go through wire that's this thick eventually you're going to

08:12:20.820 --> 08:12:28.500
part that wire okay and it's going to begin to get hot and so it could cause an electrical fire

08:12:28.500 --> 08:12:33.940
so you just can't keep saying it let me take another step back you know what kind of wire

08:12:33.940 --> 08:12:39.300
we're going to use to make these coils we're going to use what's called magnetic wire and

08:12:39.300 --> 08:12:46.260
magnetic wire is not wire that's inherently magnetic magnetic wire is wire that's used to make

08:12:46.260 --> 08:12:53.460
windings and what it is is thin copper wire but it has a a lacquer coating on the outside

08:12:53.460 --> 08:13:00.420
there's an example right there outstanding that's magnetic wire okay and it looks like copper wire

08:13:00.420 --> 08:13:06.340
and it is copper wire but on the outside is a thin lacquer coating that lacquer coating

08:13:06.340 --> 08:13:12.820
acts as an insulator an electrical insulator to prevent the wire from shorting because if I wound

08:13:13.380 --> 08:13:18.740
wire over itself why would current want to go all the way keep going through the wire it would

08:13:18.740 --> 08:13:25.860
just short right out okay so we have to keep it insulated by by using that lacquer on it so

08:13:25.860 --> 08:13:29.780
let's get back to this bullet statement here the greater the current the greater the number of

08:13:29.780 --> 08:13:34.740
flux line generated I'm going to get to a point that I cramped so much current through that coil

08:13:34.740 --> 08:13:39.540
it's going to begin to get hot if any of you have ever done paint removal you know that that

08:13:39.620 --> 08:13:44.020
paint removal when you're using a heat gun works really really good for removing paint

08:13:44.020 --> 08:13:50.500
it works good on removing lacquer too so once you ask have too much current go through that coil

08:13:50.500 --> 08:13:55.300
you're going to compromise that lacquer coating and that's the end of your coil by the way if

08:13:55.300 --> 08:14:02.020
any of you have ever smelt a coil that's the end of the coil by the time you smell it it's over

08:14:02.020 --> 08:14:08.180
with you've already compromised the integrity of it it'll never work right again transformers

08:14:08.180 --> 08:14:14.020
motors coils any of that stuff any of that stuff if you smell it if it gets that hot forget it

08:14:15.860 --> 08:14:24.020
another way that we could increase the magnetic field is we could insert a ferromagnetic

08:14:24.020 --> 08:14:29.860
core into the center of the coil usually iron iron has a high level of permeability

08:14:29.860 --> 08:14:34.740
by putting it into the center of the coil and unwrapping the coil around it it's going to

08:14:34.740 --> 08:14:41.060
enhance the magnetic characteristics so by putting in a ferromagnetic core it's going to enhance

08:14:41.700 --> 08:14:52.820
the characteristics now magnetic induction is the effect a magnet has on an object without physical

08:14:52.820 --> 08:15:01.700
contact the effect the magnet has on an object without physical contact this is the cool thing

08:15:01.700 --> 08:15:06.980
and i think some of you were playing around even with these uh with these magnets here right

08:15:06.980 --> 08:15:10.100
and how they're not even touching

08:15:13.780 --> 08:15:14.340
but yeah

08:15:17.220 --> 08:15:21.140
it's having an effect on the other magnet that's magnetic induction

08:15:21.300 --> 08:15:32.420
on residual magnetism is the magnetic field that remains when an object is separated from a magnet

08:15:38.180 --> 08:15:41.620
we used to have literally a big problem with residual magnetism

08:15:43.300 --> 08:15:47.140
this is something that i might i don't know if any of you want to make a wild guess at this here

08:15:47.140 --> 08:15:53.700
i'm thinking of a very very large object that developed magnetic properties

08:15:56.100 --> 08:16:00.420
and those magnetic properties needed to be removed or it could compromise the position

08:16:00.980 --> 08:16:06.900
of this large steel cylindrical object

08:16:09.220 --> 08:16:16.020
submarine submarine big big big problem in submarineing

08:16:16.980 --> 08:16:23.300
because the submarine being made out of a ferromagnetic material would pick up the earth's

08:16:23.300 --> 08:16:30.260
magnetic field and gradually it would become magnetized and the problem was

08:16:32.260 --> 08:16:37.940
there was equipment that would detect the magnetic anomaly so there's no way of seeing

08:16:37.940 --> 08:16:41.940
a submarine and some of our submarines are so quiet you would never even hear the submarine

08:16:42.660 --> 08:16:48.660
but if you're flying in an anti-submarine warfare aircraft and you pick up a magnetic

08:16:48.660 --> 08:16:57.380
anomaly a large submerged contact that's creating a magnetic variation chances are

08:16:57.380 --> 08:17:05.060
you found a submarine so this is exactly what if any of you ever go up around would be island and

08:17:05.060 --> 08:17:13.780
you see those uh the big four engine turboprop aircraft p-3s no not those those are awaks those

08:17:13.780 --> 08:17:20.020
are like airborne command posts the p-3 orion is a submarine hunter and off the back of it

08:17:20.020 --> 08:17:24.980
you'll see like this little thing that looks like a stinger and that's what that is is called mad

08:17:24.980 --> 08:17:31.060
gear magnetic anomaly detection so when you're flying around typically what they they just wouldn't

08:17:31.060 --> 08:17:37.140
be looking for a magnetic anomaly what they would typically do is have a circular scan radar on

08:17:37.140 --> 08:17:43.380
radar so when they stick up a periscope all of a sudden they get a blip blip if it's a good radar

08:17:43.380 --> 08:17:49.620
operator that's all it takes are two two blips and then he'll shut the radar down so what they'll

08:17:49.620 --> 08:17:55.620
do is they'll continue to fly and then he'll go to a sector scan okay so from a circular scan blip

08:17:56.260 --> 08:18:00.660
blip then he'll shut it off then he'll get he'll he knows where he's looking for because he saw it

08:18:00.660 --> 08:18:06.660
on the radar screen he'll go to a sector scan right sector scan is back and forth like this so

08:18:06.660 --> 08:18:12.660
then off it's gonna be and then he'll shut the radar off and then he'll drive his cursor over to

08:18:12.660 --> 08:18:18.260
where he had that contact and hit enter autopilot will bring the airplane to that point in the ocean

08:18:18.260 --> 08:18:23.780
and then the operator is looking at the mad gear and then all of a sudden they start to get a magnetic

08:18:23.780 --> 08:18:30.420
anomaly at that point they pop a flare out over the target if you're at war at that point the

08:18:30.420 --> 08:18:35.700
aircraft is going to go into a bank start to open the bomb bay doors fly right over that point put

08:18:35.700 --> 08:18:40.740
a torpedo in the water it's a smart torpedo it's going to find the target and blow it up that's how

08:18:40.740 --> 08:18:48.020
you die in a submarine in a combat situation okay the only thing that we would know my job was to

08:18:48.020 --> 08:18:54.260
detect that so i was good at picking up the blip blip but again the good guys the good operators

08:18:54.260 --> 08:19:00.260
two sweeps two sweeps and they'd pick you up the british came out with a radar that basically 400

08:19:00.260 --> 08:19:05.700
miles away could spot a beer can floating in the water so it's kind of like when i saw that technology

08:19:05.700 --> 08:19:09.700
can't come out i'm like you know i think it's time for me to move on to a different career

08:19:09.700 --> 08:19:14.660
because if this turns into a shooting war we're dead really quick you know really really quick

08:19:15.300 --> 08:19:21.620
so to get rid of this residual magnetism um if any of you aren't the boating or fishing and you

08:19:21.620 --> 08:19:26.500
ever have the opportunity to get on hood canal don't get too close to the submarine base because

08:19:26.500 --> 08:19:31.060
they have gun boats and stuff and it's all restricted area but over at the sub submarine base

08:19:31.060 --> 08:19:36.820
in banger they've got a giant pier it's a degausing pier and what they'll do is pull an entire trident

08:19:36.820 --> 08:19:43.700
submarine into it and pull off that magnetic field and get it back to just an un-magnetized

08:19:44.420 --> 08:19:50.260
piece of of steel but over time that magnetic field will build up again and it needs to be

08:19:50.260 --> 08:19:54.980
stripped off periodically or you're going to have a real profound magnetic signature

08:19:59.700 --> 08:20:04.420
correct yeah i told you i'd have to kill you

08:20:07.940 --> 08:20:11.860
a lot of it depends where you operate to and what the magnetic you know i mean if you're doing a

08:20:11.860 --> 08:20:15.620
lot of stuff up north and there's some stronger magnetic variants you're going to pick that up

08:20:15.620 --> 08:20:25.540
a lot quicker yeah because then if you keep track of what boats go in and it begins to paint an image

08:20:30.500 --> 08:20:31.540
earth's magnetic field

08:20:31.700 --> 08:20:37.540
earth's magnetic giant magnetic field

08:20:47.860 --> 08:20:52.660
and then again we see this manifest itself like with the aurora borealis if any of you

08:20:52.660 --> 08:20:58.980
ever seen the aurora borealis i had the opportunity in february i went up to fairbanks

08:20:59.540 --> 08:21:06.900
and they say that if you're up there between october and april for three nights basically you

08:21:06.900 --> 08:21:13.060
stand a 90 chance of seeing the aurora borealis so we were up there for the flight up there we saw

08:21:13.060 --> 08:21:17.300
him from the airplane the first two nights i mean it was it was phenomenal i mean we couldn't have

08:21:17.300 --> 08:21:21.860
planned it any better because there was a huge solar flare and that's exactly that earth's magnetic

08:21:21.860 --> 08:21:28.420
field is attracting the charged particles so as soon as they get the upper regions of the atmosphere

08:21:28.420 --> 08:21:34.900
they ionize so literally it's like a neon light except that's in the sky so i should bring in

08:21:34.900 --> 08:21:38.820
some pictures and show you i mean just it was breathtaking just phenomenal you're just standing

08:21:38.820 --> 08:21:46.100
there minus 23 degrees um it warmed up the the week prior it was like minus 47 or whatever and

08:21:46.740 --> 08:21:51.140
i seriously even though i had gloves on and everything i had to take off my gloves to manipulate

08:21:51.140 --> 08:21:56.500
the camera i ended up burning the tips of my fingers and it took about a week for me to get the

08:21:56.500 --> 08:22:03.620
feeling back and it's very very dangerous but way cool you know way cool to see this and you

08:22:03.620 --> 08:22:08.740
know people spend thousands and thousands of dollars to go up there and and and see that

08:22:10.020 --> 08:22:16.340
but it's the magnetic field it's actually attracting that near the poles retentivity

08:22:16.340 --> 08:22:22.500
is the ability of a material to retain its magnetic field after the magnetizing force

08:22:22.500 --> 08:22:29.540
is removed so unfortunately a submarine hull has a high level of retentivity and um that magnetic

08:22:29.540 --> 08:22:36.020
signature you want to strip that off because it's not desirable to have a submarine magnetized

08:22:37.060 --> 08:22:43.060
now magnetic shields are made of low reluctance materials they're used to protect electronic

08:22:43.060 --> 08:22:52.260
equipment from magnetic flux lines okay sometimes we need to protect the equipment from these

08:22:52.260 --> 08:23:03.140
lines of of flux um because they could cause interference or even worse um let me kind of

08:23:03.140 --> 08:23:08.420
back up for a second and then see if you could connect the dots on this we all understand that

08:23:08.420 --> 08:23:18.180
when we apply current to a conductor we create a magnetic field right so bear with me if we have a

08:23:18.180 --> 08:23:23.380
magnetic field that happens to pass through a conductor what do you think we're going to do

08:23:28.020 --> 08:23:35.220
i'm going to create current yeah so basically if current creates a magnetic field an electromagnetic

08:23:35.220 --> 08:23:40.900
field can create current um this is one of the things that they kind of figured out the hard

08:23:40.900 --> 08:23:47.780
way when we started lighting off nuclear weapons one of the side effects of a nuclear weapon

08:23:48.260 --> 08:23:56.740
was an emp an electromagnetic pulse and this electromagnetic pulse was a giant magnetic pulse

08:23:56.740 --> 08:24:03.860
that would go through the atmosphere and when it contacted came in contact with a conductor

08:24:03.860 --> 08:24:12.740
it induced a current where current didn't belong fry radios back in the day when they first light

08:24:12.740 --> 08:24:19.540
started lighting off nukes um basically we all use tubes and tubes are high voltage devices and

08:24:19.540 --> 08:24:25.300
it would cause some interference and some wacky symptoms and that was about it with us going to

08:24:25.300 --> 08:24:31.380
micro chips now and integrated circuits that amount of current is going to fry that's our

08:24:31.380 --> 08:24:36.980
technical term for the night fry these circuits okay because we're dealing with minute amounts of

08:24:36.980 --> 08:24:42.740
current to get the job done so all of a sudden you have an emp you're gonna fry stuff and um

08:24:44.260 --> 08:24:50.180
quite frankly it really concerns me i know enough about this where you know basically if you had

08:24:50.180 --> 08:24:54.580
you know everybody's afraid of a dirty bomb and everything and yeah that's that's really bad news

08:24:54.580 --> 08:25:02.900
but i tell you what one strategically placed high altitude nuke going off over the central us

08:25:02.900 --> 08:25:08.340
it's going to totally wipe us out and set us back into the stone age okay and it's the high altitude

08:25:08.340 --> 08:25:13.540
ones that really screw things up because they're far reaching because of the line of sight and um

08:25:13.540 --> 08:25:19.140
yeah i mean can you imagine a world you know in a world that your atm doesn't work in a world that

08:25:19.140 --> 08:25:26.340
your grocery store which uses a computer to order new food and supplies from the distribution center

08:25:26.340 --> 08:25:32.580
doesn't work your cell phones don't work your internet doesn't work your computers don't work

08:25:32.580 --> 08:25:37.460
your car computers don't work the only people that are going to be driving around the old people

08:25:37.460 --> 08:25:42.660
kick an old school diesel where you know compression and fuel and you've got the diesel engine running

08:25:42.660 --> 08:25:50.900
okay science fiction no pure science this is how it works so um these magnetic shields are actually

08:25:50.900 --> 08:25:57.700
used in some military applications for hardening the the sites because we know that this emp is

08:25:57.700 --> 08:26:02.500
going to cause problems none of the consumer stuff that we use is hardened air force one

08:26:03.300 --> 08:26:08.820
what the president flies around in is hardened okay they brought that down to kirtland air force

08:26:08.820 --> 08:26:14.980
base outside albuquerque new mexico and that's where they do the cmp testing and basically prove

08:26:14.980 --> 08:26:20.020
what it's able to withstand and again that's all really highly classified information um the same

08:26:20.020 --> 08:26:24.980
thing with the autopilots the uh you know now it's all fly by wire technology

08:26:25.860 --> 08:26:31.380
so this electromagnetic interference could cause big problems i don't know if any of you um

08:26:32.260 --> 08:26:36.900
remember years ago there was a problem with the airbus well there's always been a problem with

08:26:36.900 --> 08:26:43.380
airbus um just different problems as time progresses but this was the problem with airbus was

08:26:43.380 --> 08:26:50.820
was with the a320 aircraft and the a320 was the first commercial aircraft to use what was called

08:26:50.820 --> 08:26:57.300
fly by wire technology and it's actually funny i like messing with people um that are flying on a

08:26:57.300 --> 08:27:02.980
lot of people don't realize that up in the cockpit there's no control yoke like this on an a320

08:27:02.980 --> 08:27:07.300
they're flying with a joystick and you know the pilot's seat and he's got the instrument panel

08:27:07.300 --> 08:27:12.020
in front and right off to his left here is a joystick and that's how the pilot captain

08:27:12.020 --> 08:27:19.220
it's got his on the left the copilot's got his on the right so there was a um an air show that

08:27:19.940 --> 08:27:25.460
they were doing a fly by and what happened is the the airplane came died to the you know the

08:27:25.460 --> 08:27:30.580
symbolic low pass and then kept going and going and going right into the trees at the end of the

08:27:30.580 --> 08:27:34.420
runway and there was a huge fireball and explosion a bunch of people got killed but there were a

08:27:34.420 --> 08:27:39.940
bunch of people including the pilot that survived and he was like man he's i don't know what happened

08:27:39.940 --> 08:27:45.380
you know i was pulling up the whole time the aircraft was not responding so in the in the

08:27:45.380 --> 08:27:50.500
basically the investigation they determined at this big air show in europe there were military

08:27:50.500 --> 08:27:57.540
aircraft that were present they had their high energy weapons fire control radars turned on

08:27:57.540 --> 08:28:02.100
and they think that high energy got into the computers and basically put current where current

08:28:02.100 --> 08:28:07.780
and it got confused so he's pulling up on the stick you know to pull up and you know dip the wing

08:28:07.780 --> 08:28:11.300
and you know you know the maneuver at least i know the maneuver it's classic maneuver

08:28:11.380 --> 08:28:16.180
instead he's pulling up and just right into the freaking trees you look that up on youtube

08:28:16.180 --> 08:28:22.980
a 320 crash and you know they they they very well documented crash um they added a lot more

08:28:22.980 --> 08:28:29.140
magnetic shielding to it um bowings first air planted dabble with fly by wire was the triple

08:28:29.140 --> 08:28:32.980
seven and it was kind of a gamble military aircraft have used it for years but military

08:28:32.980 --> 08:28:36.180
aircraft are kind of a different animal you know if you got a problem in the military

08:28:36.180 --> 08:28:40.580
aircraft you know eject eject eject pow you punch out and you know you live to fight another day

08:28:40.580 --> 08:28:44.980
in a commercial airliner you got hundreds of people behind you there's no eject eject eject

08:28:44.980 --> 08:28:49.620
it's like you got to ride it out and you fix the problem so bowings first airplane with fly by

08:28:49.620 --> 08:28:54.900
wire technology was the triple seven was the triple seven and believe it or not was kind of funny

08:28:54.900 --> 08:29:00.980
because bowing opted for standard controls not the joystick they could have done the joystick

08:29:00.980 --> 08:29:04.980
because basically the standard controls are controlling the equivalent of a joystick but it

08:29:04.980 --> 08:29:09.540
makes a pilot feel like they're kicking at old school and uh they're not kicking at old school

08:29:09.540 --> 08:29:15.140
it's they're still putting in inputs that create small currents to feed a computer and then the

08:29:15.140 --> 08:29:22.020
computer controls the control surfaces of the aircraft so in a lot of cases like that suffice

08:29:22.020 --> 08:29:27.380
to say you reckon bowings got some really good magnetic shielding on their flight control systems

08:29:27.380 --> 08:29:35.940
fly by wire absolutely it's to prevent current from being where current doesn't belong in any time

08:29:35.940 --> 08:29:41.060
there is a magnetic field you run the risk of putting current where current doesn't block

08:29:43.620 --> 08:29:50.260
absolutely absolutely and that was actually one of the other problems too that bowing had you

08:29:50.260 --> 08:29:55.220
know every commercial airliner statistically gets struck by lightning once a year so next

08:29:55.220 --> 08:29:58.900
time you go on your dream vacation or whatever you got on that airplane suffice to say that

08:29:58.900 --> 08:30:04.420
airplane was probably struck by lightning in the past year as bowing went to and for most

08:30:04.420 --> 08:30:08.820
aircraft it's not that big of a deal because what happens is when an aircraft is struck by

08:30:08.820 --> 08:30:13.060
lightning it follows what's called skin effect and that current passes over the skin of the

08:30:13.060 --> 08:30:17.380
aircraft i mean it could scare the dickens out of you if you're on board it's going to be a big

08:30:17.380 --> 08:30:21.620
you know and in some cases fireball coming through the cabin and you know it's going to scare the

08:30:21.620 --> 08:30:26.100
dickens out of you but it's not going to bring the airplane down one of the manufacturing trends

08:30:26.100 --> 08:30:32.100
now with aircraft though is not to build airplanes out of aluminum it's to build it out of composites

08:30:32.100 --> 08:30:40.260
okay if you're using carbon they're not always using carbon they're just using various composites

08:30:40.260 --> 08:30:44.500
so one of the things that they're doing on aircraft now especially control surfaces

08:30:45.380 --> 08:30:51.220
flaps ailerons that control the role of the aircraft and such these would typically be made

08:30:51.220 --> 08:30:55.700
out of composites so you get struck by lightning it's quite simple the lightning gets in there

08:30:55.700 --> 08:31:01.140
has nowhere to go it blows the the the control surface apart not good if you're in the airplane

08:31:01.140 --> 08:31:04.340
okay because now you're going to lose control because you don't have the ability to control the

08:31:04.340 --> 08:31:10.260
aircraft anymore so Boeing actually started doing is that by put basically putting in a conductive

08:31:11.140 --> 08:31:18.340
layer into the composites so that will allow current from a lightning strike a place to dissipate

08:31:19.060 --> 08:31:26.340
so kind of get rid of the aluminum only to put a conductor back into the composite so it's still

08:31:26.340 --> 08:31:31.460
highly efficient and lighter and stronger and everything else i guess lighter and stronger

08:31:32.100 --> 08:31:36.340
i don't know when they fail they fail big but i guess aluminum when aluminum fails it fails

08:31:36.340 --> 08:31:43.220
big too so i don't know i like kicking her old school electromagnetic induction is the principle

08:31:43.220 --> 08:31:47.460
behind the generation of electricity and i think all of you know where i'm going with this because

08:31:47.460 --> 08:31:52.500
we just talked about emp magnetic field passing through a conductor is going to induce current

08:31:53.220 --> 08:31:57.860
current is produced when a conductor passes or is passed by a magnetic field

08:31:58.740 --> 08:32:04.660
as the conductor passes through the magnetic field a deficiency of electrons is going to be

08:32:04.660 --> 08:32:10.580
created this results in a difference of potential between the ends of the conductor

08:32:11.300 --> 08:32:16.900
so again if you've got a long piece of wire you pass a magnetic field through it you're going to

08:32:16.900 --> 08:32:23.860
induce current many years ago i think the space shuttle um conducted an experiment like that

08:32:23.860 --> 08:32:28.740
and literally what they did is they trailed a long wire loop and what their goal was to try to

08:32:28.740 --> 08:32:34.260
track it through the earth's magnetic field and see if they could you know generate current from

08:32:34.260 --> 08:32:40.260
that um basically they vaporize the wire that's how much current they generated from the earth's

08:32:40.260 --> 08:32:45.620
magnetic field so if there was a way of harnessing the earth's magnetic field as a generator you

08:32:45.620 --> 08:32:53.220
know our energy woes would be over but i don't think there's a you know adequate way of of harnessing

08:32:53.220 --> 08:33:01.380
it at this point basically trail the wire and pull it through the earth's magnetic field and vaporize

08:33:01.380 --> 08:33:08.180
the wire so when the conductors remove from the magnetic field the free electrons return

08:33:08.180 --> 08:33:12.340
to their parent atom so what we're doing is we're getting electrons to move in a conductor

08:33:12.340 --> 08:33:19.300
by getting electronic electrons to move in a conductor we call that current call that current

08:33:19.300 --> 08:33:28.820
so we're creating current faraday's law the induced voltage in a conductor is directly

08:33:28.820 --> 08:33:34.980
proportional to the rate at which the conductor cuts the magnetic lines of force okay gonna make

08:33:34.980 --> 08:33:41.460
this real simple if you'd understand faraday's law here okay envision up here that i have a big

08:33:41.460 --> 08:33:47.620
north pole big magnet sitting here boom big giant and here i have a big south pole you all agree

08:33:47.620 --> 08:33:52.100
that i've got lines of flux that are going from the north pole to the south pole and all that stuff

08:33:52.100 --> 08:33:56.900
that i talked about earlier the straightest line the shortest distance right so in between here i'm

08:33:56.900 --> 08:34:01.060
gonna have a strong magnetic field if i had a giant magnet right here do you agree with that

08:34:01.060 --> 08:34:09.140
okay faraday's law says that if i my conductor if i got a conductor this is a conductor when i say

08:34:09.140 --> 08:34:13.860
conductor i'm not talking just a piece of wire i'm talking about a piece of wire that has a loop

08:34:13.860 --> 08:34:19.620
in it so the current's got to have somewhere to go it has to have a load right if i get this and i

08:34:19.620 --> 08:34:27.380
move it perpendicular to the lines of flux i'm going to generate my maximum amount of current

08:34:27.380 --> 08:34:33.140
because i'm doing what i'm cutting the lines of flux if i get the conductor and i move it

08:34:33.140 --> 08:34:38.820
parallel to the lines of flux nothing's going to happen i mean nothing is going to happen

08:34:38.820 --> 08:34:43.700
because the lines of flux are going north pole to south pole so me with the conductor moving

08:34:43.700 --> 08:34:48.420
it like this all day long nothing's going to happen all of a sudden i move it like this i'm

08:34:48.420 --> 08:34:54.260
moving it right through those lines of flux perpendicular so i'm going to get maximum

08:34:54.260 --> 08:34:58.980
effect of cutting those lines of flux so that's in essence faraday's law

08:35:03.940 --> 08:35:08.260
it's it's me cutting those lines of flux so i'm still going to have a strong effect by

08:35:08.260 --> 08:35:13.700
simply cutting it now if i'm doing it at a 45 degree angle what am i going to be doing

08:35:15.140 --> 08:35:22.260
i'm really half effective it's not this and it's not this it's going to be half at 45 degrees

08:35:24.180 --> 08:35:32.580
faraday's law but i'm cutting it at a 45 degree angle so i'm not cutting the maximum

08:35:33.540 --> 08:35:37.700
lines of flux by by cutting it at 90 i'm getting the maximum out of it

08:35:39.860 --> 08:35:44.980
so that's faraday's law this here don't try this in your car on the way home somebody will think

08:35:44.980 --> 08:35:51.620
you're like doing gang signs or something you know yo yo i'm an electronic student yo

08:35:53.300 --> 08:35:59.300
this is called the left hand rule and the way that this thing works is that your your finger

08:35:59.380 --> 08:36:02.820
points in the direction of flux which way does flux go

08:36:06.900 --> 08:36:11.620
which way does flux go from where to where positive to negative east to west

08:36:15.380 --> 08:36:21.060
north to south i said that earlier right flux goes north to south north pole south pole

08:36:21.060 --> 08:36:26.180
so this means north to south that's the direction that the flux is is pointing in makes sense

08:36:30.260 --> 08:36:35.540
my thumb is going to point in the direction of motion so as an example let's go back to me with

08:36:35.540 --> 08:36:41.460
this wielding the yardstick here is this the yard this is the yardstick 36 inches

08:36:42.740 --> 08:36:46.740
that's one of the reasons that i'm real happy that we're not on the metric system or we weren't

08:36:46.740 --> 08:36:53.060
when i grew up because having attended a catholic church for school for a period of time the nuns

08:36:53.060 --> 08:36:59.380
if the nuns had been equipped with meter sticks as opposed to yard sticks there's a good chance i

08:36:59.380 --> 08:37:04.420
wouldn't be here with you today okay because that additional three inches would have been just enough

08:37:04.420 --> 08:37:13.380
probably for them to connect and uh yes i was beaten by the nuns anyway so i've got a north pole here

08:37:13.940 --> 08:37:19.780
a south pole here remember that north here south here okay so that means the lines of

08:37:19.860 --> 08:37:25.140
flux are which going which way north to south so i got to do what

08:37:31.380 --> 08:37:37.620
makes sense i'm going in this direction okay so the left hand rule now my thumb is going to

08:37:37.620 --> 08:37:45.620
point in the direction of motion so this means the conductor is moving down through this scenario

08:37:46.180 --> 08:37:48.500
and if that's the case

08:37:53.460 --> 08:37:58.020
if that's the case my middle finger is pointing towards me which way does current flow

08:38:00.100 --> 08:38:08.100
this is not a trick question folks negative to positive so that means i am positive with respect

08:38:08.100 --> 08:38:14.420
to my finger negative the positive current to blow towards me okay to make it easier let's

08:38:14.420 --> 08:38:20.580
make this the north pole let's make this the south pole and let's move our conductor let's move our

08:38:20.580 --> 08:38:30.340
conductor down by moving the conductor down current now is going to be flowing away from me negative

08:38:30.340 --> 08:38:39.700
to positive make sense so again will you ever use this in industry i doubt it but this is a way of

08:38:39.700 --> 08:38:48.420
determining which direction we're going to induce current in a generator based on relative motion

08:38:51.940 --> 08:38:59.140
now magnetic and electromagnetic applications probably the biggest and most important is the

08:38:59.140 --> 08:39:06.740
ac generator ac generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy by utilizing the

08:39:06.740 --> 08:39:13.140
principle of electromagnetic induction and this is the most popular way of producing electricity

08:39:14.740 --> 08:39:22.020
now whether we turn this ac generator we're going to turn it by the shaft right whether we turn

08:39:22.020 --> 08:39:32.420
that shaft from steam and a turbine that's generated from coal oil nuclear hydroelectric

08:39:32.420 --> 08:39:38.260
it's irrelevant the key is that we're turning the shaft and turning the shaft we turn the generator

08:39:38.260 --> 08:39:43.620
that's what produces the electricity now if we take that another step are there are there

08:39:43.620 --> 08:39:49.620
means that are more efficient than others are there means that are more ecologically minded

08:39:49.620 --> 08:39:55.140
than others are there you know what we watched last week in our program meeting on wednesday

08:39:56.020 --> 08:40:01.060
i mean even that dude you know who was uh you know pretty much a tree hugging kind of guy saying hey

08:40:01.060 --> 08:40:07.940
i've rethought nuclear you know and although nuclear is is dangerous and it's something we need to be

08:40:07.940 --> 08:40:16.100
aware of you know polluting the environment with coal is worse so um things for us to think about

08:40:16.100 --> 08:40:21.540
but the key here is by turning that shaft we generate ac electricity with an ac generator

08:40:22.100 --> 08:40:27.140
this is how it works this is how an ac generator works and the thing that i want to point out to

08:40:27.140 --> 08:40:34.340
you here is that these are the magnets and these magnets could be permanent or they could be

08:40:36.100 --> 08:40:41.380
electromagnets they could be permanent or they could be electromagnets as a matter of fact this

08:40:41.380 --> 08:40:49.300
is exactly what is taking place in your alternator in your car okay and your alternator in your car

08:40:49.300 --> 08:40:56.740
are these those permanent magnets or are they electromagnets does anybody know alternator in

08:40:56.740 --> 08:41:06.100
your car which produces produces voltage for us the generator are they permanent magnets or are

08:41:06.100 --> 08:41:13.300
they electromagnets are they electromagnets that's my question to you what's that

08:41:15.220 --> 08:41:23.060
no no because there's a power going to it and what do you call what do you call that if some

08:41:23.060 --> 08:41:26.660
of you've ever played around with an alternator you might remember as soon as i say you're going

08:41:26.660 --> 08:41:33.300
to know if you've played around with it before called your field windings your field windings

08:41:33.300 --> 08:41:40.980
your field windings produce an electromagnetic field this is why if you're you know how you

08:41:40.980 --> 08:41:47.300
can push start a car you can push start a car if it's dead you can push start a car if it's

08:41:47.300 --> 08:41:53.220
if your battery is totally dead you're not going to push start a car somebody older vw's are different

08:41:53.220 --> 08:41:58.900
different magnetos different system okay different on my aircraft my aircraft doesn't have a system

08:41:58.900 --> 08:42:05.780
like that it has a a magneto so if i get that prop rotating i'm creating a spark that will

08:42:05.780 --> 08:42:12.260
support the combustion combustion process okay kickstart motorcycle

08:42:14.980 --> 08:42:21.460
so your car if your battery is totally dead if you if you remove your battery and try to jump

08:42:21.780 --> 08:42:28.340
start push start your car pop start it it ain't going to work okay if your battery is kind of dead

08:42:28.900 --> 08:42:33.940
not enough to crank the starter but enough to go click click click click click that's probably

08:42:33.940 --> 08:42:40.900
enough to create enough of a magnetic field so when you push the car pop the clutch start the

08:42:40.900 --> 08:42:45.380
combustion process get the engine turning immediately you're going to start to put

08:42:45.380 --> 08:42:50.980
you know increase the voltage to these windings so these windings could be very i don't really

08:42:50.980 --> 08:42:56.580
know of any applications they use permanent magnets here most all use windings the same

08:42:56.580 --> 08:43:02.260
thing for a power generating plant like at grand coulee dam they got to start off with a little

08:43:02.260 --> 08:43:08.420
bit of voltage to create the magnetic field and then get the generation process going they're not

08:43:08.420 --> 08:43:17.700
permanent magnets okay so this here this loop of wire this is an artist depiction this loop of wire

08:43:18.660 --> 08:43:24.100
has a light side and a dark side this is just so you could see it for the purposes of illustration

08:43:24.980 --> 08:43:27.300
but this here is actually a loop of wire

08:43:29.940 --> 08:43:37.620
the loop the armature here is connected to these slip rings these slip rings allow the

08:43:37.620 --> 08:43:48.740
armature to stay connected 360 degrees of the rotation so if we look at this right now

08:43:49.460 --> 08:43:56.820
north pole south pole north pole south pole the armature right here with the winding here at

08:43:56.820 --> 08:44:02.900
the top and the winding at the bottom is the winding right now parallel to the lines of flux

08:44:02.900 --> 08:44:11.860
or perpendicular lines of flux parallel it's right at the top you see how it's right at the apex

08:44:11.860 --> 08:44:18.260
here the top so right at this moment in time it's parallel to the lines of flux how much current

08:44:18.260 --> 08:44:25.780
do we generate when we're parallel to the lines of flux faraday's law how much zero and look what

08:44:25.780 --> 08:44:34.100
we're generating right here zero when we rotate that armature now we're going to rotate it we're

08:44:34.100 --> 08:44:38.820
going to connect the shaft to this and we're going to blow on it and make the shaft turn through a

08:44:38.820 --> 08:44:44.100
wind turbine or we're going to steam and rotate you know the shaft through a steam turbine or

08:44:44.100 --> 08:44:49.460
whatever but when we rotate the shaft now how many degrees have i rotated it from my peak

08:44:49.540 --> 08:44:57.940
90 so right now is the armature parallel or perpendicular perpendicular what does faraday's

08:44:57.940 --> 08:45:07.220
law say when i'm perpendicular to the lines of flux i generate my maximum amount of current well

08:45:07.220 --> 08:45:13.700
look what we did when we rotated it 90 degrees now i'm at my maximum peak value

08:45:14.340 --> 08:45:20.900
when i rotate my armature another 90 degrees see how i started out here at the top then i rotated

08:45:20.900 --> 08:45:27.620
it 90 now i rotate it another 90 so i'm actually 180 degrees from where i started off am i parallel

08:45:27.620 --> 08:45:36.900
or perpendicular to the lines of flux parallel what does faraday's law say zero what am i generating

08:45:37.220 --> 08:45:42.900
what am i generating zero i rotate it another 90 degrees now i'm coming up on the backside 270

08:45:44.180 --> 08:45:52.500
parallel or perpendicular perpendicular what am i going to do generating faraday's law maximum

08:45:52.500 --> 08:45:59.140
cutting my maximum field i'm right here i complete that cycle i've just created 360 degrees of a

08:45:59.140 --> 08:46:07.860
sinusoidal waveform this is an ac generator half of this is positive half of this is negative if

08:46:07.860 --> 08:46:14.340
you're actually an electron if you're actually an electron caught in this whole thing basically

08:46:14.340 --> 08:46:19.940
what happens is you get moved x amount in this direction then you go back to zero and then you

08:46:19.940 --> 08:46:27.860
get moved x amount in this direction and then you go back to zero you never really go anywhere

08:46:27.860 --> 08:46:33.060
but you do get shaken back and forth back and forth back and forth make sense

08:46:34.820 --> 08:46:40.980
it's an ac generator a dc generator it actually by the way does anybody know who the father of

08:46:40.980 --> 08:46:47.700
the ac generator was who do we give credit to ac generation tesla very good nicola tesla

08:46:48.820 --> 08:46:56.980
he said ac was the way to go there was another guy big in history who said dc is the way to go

08:46:56.980 --> 08:47:02.100
anybody know who that dude was edison actually more of a household name everybody knows thomas

08:47:02.100 --> 08:47:08.660
edison actually when i first entered this industry i nobody even knew tesla tesla recently has gained

08:47:08.660 --> 08:47:16.580
some acclaim or a cult following depending on how you want to look at it but thomas edison

08:47:16.580 --> 08:47:22.260
he wanted to wire up everything in dc if you go back to new york city which is actually the power

08:47:22.260 --> 08:47:29.060
company back there is consolidated edison con edison um really started off by edison edison

08:47:29.060 --> 08:47:35.060
got the first contract to wire up the um new york city and he wired up a lot of the buildings for

08:47:35.060 --> 08:47:40.900
dc and again i we're not going to get into it here in class you could look at youtube edison

08:47:40.900 --> 08:47:46.900
experiments electrocuting animals you know um tesla experiments and they were they'd get like

08:47:46.900 --> 08:47:51.540
an elephant and like you know electrocute it and like you know kill it dead and say you see this is

08:47:51.540 --> 08:47:56.100
why you don't want to use dc this is why you want to use ac ac is much safer you know and

08:47:56.100 --> 08:48:00.980
sort of like killing animals and stuff on you know so you can look that up on your own youtube we're

08:48:00.980 --> 08:48:05.780
not going to do it here but i mean it was these dudes were at each other because that meant world

08:48:05.780 --> 08:48:14.020
domination you know who's going to get the contracts and um again uh tesla was right

08:48:14.020 --> 08:48:21.060
ac is much more efficient to transmit we'll talk about that later on so dc never really caught on

08:48:21.060 --> 08:48:27.620
but a dc generator this is how uh what a dc generator looks like again you've got an armature

08:48:28.500 --> 08:48:36.660
but what note here as we rotate this we're coming in contact here with this is called a commutator

08:48:37.620 --> 08:48:42.580
and the commutator only makes contact for 180 degrees

08:48:42.660 --> 08:48:51.060
so what happens is as we rotate the armature through we're going to generate a positive pulse

08:48:51.860 --> 08:48:55.780
then what's going to happen is we're going to break that electrical connection because the

08:48:55.780 --> 08:49:01.460
commutator only makes contact for 180 degrees and then what we're going to do is harness another

08:49:01.460 --> 08:49:06.100
positive pulse so it's positive pulse positive pulse positive pulse

08:49:06.260 --> 08:49:09.780
it's a definition of dc

08:49:12.100 --> 08:49:19.780
definition of dc ac is half positive half negative alternation this is positive

08:49:19.780 --> 08:49:26.340
positive positive this is almost like a battery not quite this is a pulsating dc

08:49:26.340 --> 08:49:32.580
as where a battery would be constant dc created chemically so the big thing you need to remember

08:49:32.580 --> 08:49:40.180
is that an ac generator has slip rings and it maintains contact for 360 degrees of the

08:49:40.180 --> 08:49:46.660
rotation of the armature a dc generator has a commutator and it maintains contact for

08:49:48.500 --> 08:49:56.020
180 degrees but the same principle is applied we're either cutting the lines of flux or we're not

08:49:56.020 --> 08:50:08.100
now a relay a relay anybody here have any experience working on any relays okay relays are

08:50:10.260 --> 08:50:18.100
are popular then they still are popular because for handling high amounts of current

08:50:19.060 --> 08:50:26.420
still a very viable way of control a relay is an electromagnetic switch

08:50:27.460 --> 08:50:36.660
that opens and closes with an electromagnetic coil so real simple with a relay i create an

08:50:36.660 --> 08:50:45.620
electromagnetic field with a coil what i have is an armature above that coil and that armature has

08:50:45.620 --> 08:50:54.740
a contact on it and it has a spring that basically when the electromagnetic field is energized it pulls

08:50:54.740 --> 08:51:02.020
the armature down making an electrical contact when i de-energize it it has a spring that opens a backup

08:51:04.100 --> 08:51:10.900
energize makes electrical contact de-energize opens up the circuit or i could do it the opposite

08:51:10.900 --> 08:51:15.780
way i could be making electrical contact and when i energize the electrical circuit it's going to

08:51:17.460 --> 08:51:25.780
open the circuit relays also could have multiple ganged contacts so when i energize it i'm opening

08:51:25.780 --> 08:51:34.340
and closing a bunch of contacts but a relay is an electromechanical switch it's using

08:51:34.340 --> 08:51:41.220
electromagnetism to move that armature up and down the good news is it's an electromechanical

08:51:41.220 --> 08:51:45.620
switch it's going to fail often and you're going to need highly qualified competent technicians

08:51:45.620 --> 08:51:52.820
to go in and troubleshoot it it's called job security they replace that with something that's

08:51:52.820 --> 08:51:59.060
solid state it's not going to need to be replaced so as long as there are relays there's stuff for

08:51:59.060 --> 08:52:07.620
us to fix we use relays when it's desirable to have one circuit control another circuit

08:52:07.620 --> 08:52:12.660
typically one low power circuit controlling another high power circuit

08:52:15.940 --> 08:52:20.100
these lights would be an example although i don't know if we've got a relay integrated and i know

08:52:20.100 --> 08:52:24.820
that there's a relay that's integrated with the motion sensor so when the switch is energized

08:52:24.820 --> 08:52:28.980
that motion sensor you'll actually hear if you walk in here and the lights are off especially over

08:52:28.980 --> 08:52:34.100
here you hear the click when that obnoxious somebody's looking for a project rewire this thing to

08:52:34.100 --> 08:52:38.420
keep that thing from ever shutting off when you're in the lab becomes pretty obnoxious

08:52:43.780 --> 08:52:49.860
it's also used to control several circuits some distance away so an example of like a relay would

08:52:49.940 --> 08:52:55.860
be anybody here play with model trains at all model trains are nothing more than a small example

08:52:55.860 --> 08:53:02.420
of the real thing if you look at a freight yard on how they switch and build trains they basically

08:53:02.420 --> 08:53:09.860
have switches that move an entire it's a motor that will move an entire railroad track so that

08:53:09.860 --> 08:53:15.220
trains you know could be built on different sightings and such well how do you control that

08:53:15.220 --> 08:53:20.660
you know the switch alone would be like a Frankenstein you know switch you can't do that

08:53:20.660 --> 08:53:26.980
typically in a switching yard you'll have a up in a control tower a small switch that they throw

08:53:26.980 --> 08:53:33.460
that sends a small signal out to a big relay that could chunk makes connection and allows

08:53:33.460 --> 08:53:39.780
all that current to flow and turn the motor which boom switches the track it wouldn't be practical

08:53:39.780 --> 08:53:46.180
to have you know wire this thick going to a control tower knocking you know that it would

08:53:46.180 --> 08:53:56.340
pull the control tower down wouldn't make sense so it's used to electrically isolate the two circuits

08:53:58.100 --> 08:54:03.780
make sense okay example of this would be a doorbell

08:54:03.780 --> 08:54:12.500
small signal voltage bringing about a large change large changes you get and woke up out

08:54:12.500 --> 08:54:19.860
of sound sleep because the delivery man's outside delivering a package here are some examples of relays

08:54:25.140 --> 08:54:31.540
some of these relays are actually encapsulated so they could be put in a explosive environment

08:54:32.340 --> 08:54:37.060
because when you open and close that contact what are you doing there could be a spark

08:54:39.060 --> 08:54:43.380
there could be a spark so if you're working at an oil refinery you probably don't want that

08:54:43.380 --> 08:54:47.060
spark you want that spark to be contained so it's going to be in a sealed relay

08:54:48.660 --> 08:54:53.380
this one right here you could probably see the contacts there's two contacts here

08:54:53.380 --> 08:54:56.580
and that thing is going to open close big sparks

08:55:02.500 --> 08:55:08.900
now a solenoid is a coil when energized pulls a plunger that does some mechanical work

08:55:09.780 --> 08:55:16.020
an example of this might be door chimes i'm talking about the old school ding dong ding

08:55:16.020 --> 08:55:23.620
dong right those are physically little hammers hitting chimes now most of the stuff even like

08:55:23.620 --> 08:55:28.260
clocks if you buy a clock that has chimes it's not chimes it's a recording of chimes

08:55:29.060 --> 08:55:35.140
synthesized okay there's very few examples of real chimes being struck by solenoids

08:55:36.340 --> 08:55:40.820
another example is your automotive starter when you turn the key typically you turn the key

08:55:41.460 --> 08:55:49.860
that energizes a starter relay the starter relay energizes the starter solenoid the starter solenoid

08:55:49.860 --> 08:55:54.820
on your car is probably about the thickness of this laser pointer and on the top is going to be a big

08:55:54.820 --> 08:56:00.180
piece of metal that when you energize it it's going to pull that metal down and make a big

08:56:00.180 --> 08:56:04.900
electrical connection that big electrical connection basically takes all of the energy

08:56:04.900 --> 08:56:11.780
from your battery and dumps it into your starter there has to be physically a lot of metal present

08:56:11.780 --> 08:56:22.820
to make that electrical connection so a relay has a moving armature a solenoid has a moving

08:56:22.900 --> 08:56:28.740
plunger a moving core if you will if any of you have ever played a pinball machine the flippers

08:56:28.740 --> 08:56:34.900
solenoids when you hit the button the flipper it's energizing a solenoid that solenoid

08:56:35.540 --> 08:56:40.100
is attached physically to the flipper that's going to move back and forth back and forth

08:56:40.100 --> 08:56:48.180
energize the energize energize the energize energize energize the energize pinball anybody

08:56:48.180 --> 08:56:52.180
you're like pinball it's the bomb it's pure it's it's the pure game

08:56:57.380 --> 08:57:02.180
look for a project there you go restore a pinball machine you could restore a pinball machine

08:57:02.180 --> 08:57:08.500
contemporary pinball machine it's got everything electrical mechanical you've restored one

08:57:09.860 --> 08:57:16.580
early there you go there's projects there's projects right there what what era

08:57:18.820 --> 08:57:24.580
really uh i've got one i've got a 14 top cat

08:57:26.820 --> 08:57:31.780
the real deal man if you remember that one i had the big gumballs on the top red white blue

08:57:32.340 --> 08:57:35.940
when you get it into the advanced levels those things light up it's actually considered the most

08:57:35.940 --> 08:57:40.420
obnoxious pinball machine ever created because if you're in a bar you know those freaking lights

08:57:40.420 --> 08:57:44.420
you know looks like a police car park there whatever when you get into the you know multi-ball

08:57:45.220 --> 08:57:49.940
it's pretty slick what's that Williams yeah

08:57:52.340 --> 08:57:56.500
good stuff um 87

08:58:04.020 --> 08:58:07.780
one of my other favorites i've been keeping my eyes open if i find one if i find one bring

08:58:07.780 --> 08:58:11.380
home my wife will kill me because that one pinball machine she's freaking

08:58:12.260 --> 08:58:15.700
why aren't you gonna get rid of that thing never i mean it's so freaking cool man

08:58:16.340 --> 08:58:21.780
and i keep it operational you know um but the other one i'm always looking for a cyclone

08:58:21.780 --> 08:58:28.340
and if you remember cyclone and it was a big uh big you know during the cold war ronald reagan

08:58:28.340 --> 08:58:33.460
and actually there's a cyclone roller coaster and then the front car is ronald and nancy reagan

08:58:33.540 --> 08:58:42.820
holding on for dear life great pin great pin anyway pinball brought to you by the amazing

08:58:42.820 --> 08:58:52.740
solenoid and relays i love the applications for these things actually one of the things too with

08:58:52.740 --> 08:59:00.260
um with relays it's kind of fun is um some airports have what's called pilot control lighting

08:59:00.900 --> 08:59:05.540
and one of the local airports here is uh bremerton bremerton national and i don't you know

08:59:05.540 --> 08:59:09.860
probably a lot of you don't even know bremerton national you land a 737 over there okay it's

08:59:09.860 --> 08:59:14.020
big airport you know they don't have any commercial traffic in and out they've actually

08:59:14.020 --> 08:59:17.780
tried in the past but it's just bremerton's not that big of a market but it's a big runway

08:59:18.340 --> 08:59:23.700
pilot control lighting so one of the things that i've been known to do in the past if i'm

08:59:23.700 --> 08:59:29.220
bringing somebody that's not accustomed to aviation is what i'll do is i'll start the approach and i'm

08:59:29.220 --> 08:59:35.300
flying the instrument approach so i'm following an invisible glide path down to the runway so when

08:59:35.300 --> 08:59:40.100
the lights are turned off at the airport it's just a black hole you're just descending into this black

08:59:40.100 --> 08:59:46.180
void and then usually about a half a mile out what i'll do is i'll dial in the frequency and then

08:59:46.180 --> 08:59:50.340
i'll hit the code and basically it's a matter of me just turning my transmitter on and off on and

08:59:50.340 --> 08:59:54.420
off on and off five times turns it to high intensity so all of a sudden you're descending

08:59:54.420 --> 09:00:00.020
into this black hole and then before you this runway appears with the chaser lights and everything

09:00:00.020 --> 09:00:05.060
and it's kind of a power trip you know i think it's kind of cool you know by me simply you know

09:00:05.060 --> 09:00:10.900
clicking my radio i just turned on you know this huge airport you know five thousand feet of runway

09:00:10.900 --> 09:00:17.220
lights um that's all brought to you by well there's the pilot control lighting aspect of the radio

09:00:17.220 --> 09:00:23.860
but what really makes it happen is relays it was really you know really relays it was actually

09:00:23.860 --> 09:00:30.420
fun with relays too also called and could be called an industrial contactor industrial contactor

09:00:31.540 --> 09:00:35.620
i used to be really in the i guess i've gotten old and i'm out of a swing of things with holiday

09:00:35.620 --> 09:00:40.020
lighting i used to cover every right angle of my house i mean it looked like you know christmas

09:00:40.020 --> 09:00:47.380
vacation material um and uh it was kind of funny because my next star neighbor he worked for bowing

09:00:47.380 --> 09:00:51.620
his electrical engineer for bowing the guy across the street was electrical engineer for the federal

09:00:51.620 --> 09:00:56.660
aviation administration so these guys you know i'm out there kind of messing with them and stuff

09:00:56.660 --> 09:01:00.660
and you know you see them i'm plugging in an extension cord and the bush lights up and you

09:01:00.660 --> 09:01:05.780
know you plug in another extension cord another you know the the roof line lights up and with me

09:01:05.780 --> 09:01:11.220
i wanted to control everything at simultaneously so i got this big industrial contactor that fell

09:01:11.220 --> 09:01:17.300
off the back of a truck and what i have are four separate circuits each circuit is up to 20 amps each

09:01:17.300 --> 09:01:22.260
so what i did is i put in i basically rewired my home and i have separate circuits for the

09:01:22.260 --> 09:01:26.580
outside lights and then i have a have it on a timer i mean i could connect it to the freaking

09:01:26.580 --> 09:01:32.980
you know clap clapper if i want the two right so simply when that turns on boom everything is on

09:01:32.980 --> 09:01:37.700
at once it's like how did you do that this here's an industrial contactor you know it's kind of a

09:01:37.700 --> 09:01:52.500
cool system yeah yep absolutely yep yep and actually what one of the things that brings that

09:01:52.500 --> 09:01:58.340
about and it's it was kind of where i was segwaying into is um normally for a first quarter student

09:01:58.340 --> 09:02:06.180
you'd be taking the plc class el ec 116 plc basically is an industrial computer that controls

09:02:06.260 --> 09:02:12.580
opening closes basically relays for industrial control so after taking that el ec 116 class

09:02:12.580 --> 09:02:19.860
if you wanted you could buy a plc and basically set up a christmas display on par with with you

09:02:19.860 --> 09:02:24.420
know what that what we've seen on video is that with the light synchronized to music and everything

09:02:24.420 --> 09:02:33.140
really easy to do with plcs really easy to do well not easy but doable with plcs

09:02:36.580 --> 09:02:40.020
phonograph pickups sure some of the younger students are sitting in here and saying what

09:02:40.020 --> 09:02:44.900
is a phonograph right you know what what's this with the scratching right that's what

09:02:44.900 --> 09:02:50.340
they're scratching on a phonograph right uses an electromagnetic principle believe it or not

09:02:50.340 --> 09:02:59.780
a magnetic field is produced by a permanent magnet attached to a stylus the stylus tracks

09:02:59.780 --> 09:03:07.620
through the groove of a record in response to the audio signal recorded basically um

09:03:08.660 --> 09:03:12.420
back in the day some of you are probably familiar with this like a a musical group

09:03:12.420 --> 09:03:19.700
were cutting an album and literally what they were doing was cutting a groove into a blank

09:03:20.340 --> 09:03:25.380
and they're cutting an album they're recording an album okay this is how it was done back in the day

09:03:25.940 --> 09:03:30.340
then what that would be is a negative then with the positive you could start stamping out albums

09:03:30.340 --> 09:03:35.380
all day long and you know getting them to radio stations play your music and start selling it

09:03:35.380 --> 09:03:41.380
and that's how you'd make the big time well with the mp3 that's all changed uh we won't we won't

09:03:41.380 --> 09:03:46.660
comment on that but the stylus literally tracks through that groove in the record in response

09:03:46.660 --> 09:03:55.220
to the audio signal the movement creates a small voltage that varies at the audio signal response

09:03:56.180 --> 09:04:03.460
to replicate the wave pattern that originally created it the induced voltage is then amplified

09:04:03.460 --> 09:04:09.540
and used to drive a loudspeaker producing the audio effect similarly of the audio signal that

09:04:09.540 --> 09:04:16.340
produced it and um you know if anybody here own any albums do you have the ability okay anybody

09:04:16.340 --> 09:04:22.260
here have a means of playing any of those albums actually bought a phonograph a couple years ago

09:04:22.260 --> 09:04:27.940
because i had some older records and um you know all the stuff's available as mp3 now but you know

09:04:28.740 --> 09:04:35.860
they don't they don't you know and only for that full experience you need a phonograph player to

09:04:35.860 --> 09:04:40.100
play it so kind of a classic old-school retro way of going but

09:04:44.820 --> 09:04:47.300
no it's almost too clear

09:04:47.300 --> 09:04:54.020
i tell you some of the stuff i have a hard time because again growing up growing up in kinetica

09:04:54.020 --> 09:04:57.860
you know i had my little late transistor radio we'd go down to the beach in kinetica shore

09:04:57.860 --> 09:05:02.180
road island mesquamica beach we'd go down there and whatever and you're listening to the new

09:05:02.180 --> 09:05:08.900
york radio station you're listening to the hits the top 40 hits you know and um i you know now i

09:05:08.900 --> 09:05:13.060
listened to some of the high quality recordings it's kind of like is this a remake or it doesn't

09:05:13.060 --> 09:05:16.820
sound like the original you know the original because the original was listening to out of a

09:05:16.820 --> 09:05:22.260
little speaker like this you know he transistors mono you know now the stereo version of it it's

09:05:22.260 --> 09:05:26.900
a little bit different and of course i was on a limited budget so i wasn't always going out and

09:05:26.900 --> 09:05:32.340
buying the albums or certain albums that you had and that was high fidelity back in the day so how

09:05:32.340 --> 09:05:39.140
a record player would work magnetic magnetic that little stylus tracking in there magnetic cartridge

09:05:39.140 --> 09:05:47.700
loud speaker basically the opposite constructed of a moving coil around a permanent magnet so

09:05:47.700 --> 09:05:52.660
basically if any of you've ever bought speakers before one of the attributes you're looking basically

09:05:52.660 --> 09:06:00.020
he or she who has the the the heaviest magnet the biggest magnet wins because that's the permanent

09:06:00.020 --> 09:06:07.060
magnet and what that means is that you could throw more energy in there to create either an

09:06:07.060 --> 09:06:15.940
attraction or a repulsion and move the cone of the speaker back and forth rapidly replicating

09:06:15.940 --> 09:06:22.500
the original sound that created it so that's how a loud speaker works so the key components the size

09:06:22.500 --> 09:06:31.380
of the magnet the coil how much energy how much energy measured in watts acoustic energy but again

09:06:31.380 --> 09:06:45.380
it's a magnetic device that's how it works magnetic recording uses the electromagnetic

09:06:45.380 --> 09:06:52.260
principle to store information a signal is stored on tape or disc with a record head

09:06:52.820 --> 09:06:59.460
to be read back later with a playback head some can be combined in one package that means record

09:06:59.460 --> 09:07:08.260
head and playback head on on the same head the way that this works and it's kind of important

09:07:08.260 --> 09:07:14.580
that you understand this basically it's like getting a piece of tape and sprinkling a bunch

09:07:14.580 --> 09:07:23.380
of iron filings on that piece of tape by passing that tape over record head when I when I speak

09:07:23.380 --> 09:07:31.940
into a microphone I'm creating a signal in the wire because the microphone which also is a magnetic

09:07:31.940 --> 09:07:39.060
device the vibration the air molecules moving back and forth create that vibration the microphone

09:07:39.060 --> 09:07:44.340
picks it up and transforms that in the small electrical signal that goes in gets amplified and

09:07:44.340 --> 09:07:50.740
gets connected to the record head the record head is going to fluctuate its magnetic field

09:07:51.220 --> 09:07:57.780
putting those iron filings on the tape into a unique pattern into a unique pattern

09:07:59.620 --> 09:08:05.060
that pattern will be stored on that tape not indefinitely because if it's stored here on

09:08:05.060 --> 09:08:11.620
planet earth what's one of the things that it could be under the influence of the earth's magnetic field

09:08:13.220 --> 09:08:18.100
if you put it in close proximity to any other electromagnetic device it could alter that

09:08:18.100 --> 09:08:25.540
so magnetic recordings will not last forever as a matter of fact a magnetic recording every time

09:08:25.540 --> 09:08:32.260
you play it back and you try to read that that that fluctuation in the particles that was put

09:08:32.260 --> 09:08:40.100
on there it loses a little bit of what it was originally remember how the video stores and

09:08:40.100 --> 09:08:44.660
get younger students know what's a video store well back in the day we used to have to go to

09:08:44.740 --> 09:08:52.020
places and rent vhs tapes okay um why would you have to rent tapes when it's just get it on demand

09:08:52.020 --> 09:08:59.460
well that didn't exist back then you have to rent it on tapes right be kind of rewind absolutely

09:08:59.460 --> 09:09:07.860
okay those were the good old days they really were um i think um those tapes they used to sell

09:09:07.860 --> 09:09:12.020
they'd only get so many uses out of them and then they would sell them as previously viewed

09:09:12.580 --> 09:09:16.580
you know and i used to capitalize and add to my library if there's a movie i really liked

09:09:16.580 --> 09:09:23.460
buy it previously viewed but you know what the quality was always on its way out because

09:09:23.460 --> 09:09:29.220
every time you use that play that tape you'll lose a little bit of it so like for high end

09:09:29.220 --> 09:09:35.860
production and video what they would do is um uh let's say you're making a documentary for the

09:09:35.860 --> 09:09:40.420
discovery channel and you're shooting it on video now there's some different ways of doing

09:09:40.500 --> 09:09:44.580
if you're shooting it on videotape what they would do is they'd go out and they'd shoot

09:09:45.380 --> 09:09:49.860
you know the helicopter and these beautiful shots or whatever they'd get the original tape

09:09:49.860 --> 09:09:56.660
they'd make one copy for the purposes of editing editing then they'd put the originals in a vault

09:09:56.660 --> 09:10:01.060
and they wouldn't touch the originals then they would figure out what we want to edit this scene

09:10:01.060 --> 09:10:05.380
we want to edit that scene we want to do this once they figured out where all the edits were then

09:10:05.380 --> 09:10:10.500
they'd go back to the master tapes and they would make a recording of the segments that they want

09:10:10.500 --> 09:10:17.460
and produce a video production knowing that every time they run that tape through the machine

09:10:17.460 --> 09:10:24.340
they're lessening the video quality of what was on that tape so videotape any magnetic recording

09:10:24.340 --> 09:10:29.860
media will over time lose its integrity there's no way around it

09:10:35.220 --> 09:10:41.860
yep if you're burning them you're it with basically um uh traditionally it it it's not

09:10:41.860 --> 09:10:48.820
magnetic per se but over time it will deteriorate the best method is what's um known as actual ram

09:10:48.820 --> 09:10:54.660
like dvd ram and that's for archival purposes you want to you know do dvd ram so that's one

09:10:54.660 --> 09:10:59.300
of the problems that i actually as soon as they had a dvd burner that was on the market that was

09:10:59.300 --> 09:11:04.580
reasonable like vhs to dvd because when my kids growing up i shot a lot of home movies and stuff

09:11:04.580 --> 09:11:08.660
and over time i knew those tapes were going to diminish every time i watched them those tapes

09:11:08.660 --> 09:11:13.860
are going to diminish so i got them and then transferred them but to be honest with you i

09:11:13.860 --> 09:11:20.580
should have transferred them to um dvd ram ram and it's kind of a niche niche thing but that's

09:11:20.580 --> 09:11:25.300
going to last the best and it won't experience degradation all these other forms of media even

09:11:25.300 --> 09:11:29.380
if you're burning your own dvds um they will degrade over time

09:11:33.540 --> 09:11:39.060
so the way that magnetic tape works that tiny gap between the ends of the core is a magnetic field

09:11:39.140 --> 09:11:43.940
a piece of material covered with iron oxide basically iron filings is pulled across the

09:11:43.940 --> 09:11:52.340
record head magnetizing it information is written in a magnetized pattern to play back or read the

09:11:52.340 --> 09:11:58.900
information the material is moved past the gap in a playback head the magnetic field induces a small

09:11:58.900 --> 09:12:07.220
voltage into the coil winding when amplified the information is reproduced and this really

09:12:07.220 --> 09:12:13.460
revolutionized the recording industry being able to i mean i remember back in the day i'm dating

09:12:13.460 --> 09:12:19.620
myself but wow could actually own a cassette recorder and i could speak in real microphone

09:12:19.620 --> 09:12:24.660
and record my voice on magnetic tape and then you could put it in and at a later date and hear

09:12:24.660 --> 09:12:32.340
yourself wow that was really the big deal now we have cell phones that we talk into and digitally

09:12:32.420 --> 09:12:40.340
record that examples that used this technology on tape would be cassette recorders video

09:12:40.340 --> 09:12:44.980
recorders reel-to-reel recorders that were used in a lot of production studios and such

09:12:46.260 --> 09:12:52.980
floppy disk drives floppy disk drive is nothing more than a a disk with particle on it with the

09:12:52.980 --> 09:12:58.660
iron iron iron particles on it and believe it or not hard disk drives if you've got a hard drive

09:12:58.660 --> 09:13:05.460
in your computer using the same technology a little bit better no a lot bit better okay because

09:13:05.460 --> 09:13:11.940
now you're you could go out and buy a terabyte drive for forty nine dollars and the reliability

09:13:11.940 --> 09:13:17.940
of that data is extremely high and if it's properly maintained you're really not going to lose

09:13:17.940 --> 09:13:23.620
integrity of that data and that's really as far as i'm concerned this is really that's the best

09:13:23.620 --> 09:13:29.620
method of storage my wife and i really enjoy amateur digital photography and when we go out

09:13:29.620 --> 09:13:36.260
and shoot something when it's on the card we're at risk as soon as we plug that card in and we

09:13:36.260 --> 09:13:44.580
copy it to one drive i primary drive okay then what i do is i mirror that on a secondary drive

09:13:44.580 --> 09:13:51.380
and i mirror that on a tertiary drive and i also pay for a service to go back to that primary drive

09:13:51.380 --> 09:13:58.900
and back it up offsite okay let me tell you in the middle of february in the middle of february

09:13:59.460 --> 09:14:05.380
all right i fly to to fairbanks alaska minus 23 degrees to see see the aurora borealis to get

09:14:05.380 --> 09:14:10.340
some pictures i don't want to lose those pictures because my hard drive fails so i want to make sure

09:14:10.340 --> 09:14:17.220
i have backups to backups to backups so as long as you do that you're good with me just transferring

09:14:17.220 --> 09:14:25.860
a home movie to a dvd i could lose integrity of that over time if it's backed up digitally on a

09:14:25.860 --> 09:14:34.580
hard drive and you could again mirror that then then you're good dc motor operation depends on a

09:14:34.580 --> 09:14:40.980
principle that a current carrying conductor placed in and at right angles to a magnetic field tends

09:14:40.980 --> 09:14:44.500
to move at right angles in the direction of the field basically what we're saying is if we could

09:14:44.500 --> 09:14:54.020
rotate a shaft and create dc why can't we apply a voltage to a winding and create motion

09:14:57.220 --> 09:15:02.580
so the difference between a dc motor and a dc generator

09:15:05.940 --> 09:15:13.220
is perception most cases they could be used either way it's actually one of the things that

09:15:13.220 --> 09:15:18.980
they use for power management over at the grand coulee dam i don't know if any of you have any

09:15:18.980 --> 09:15:23.780
of you go recreating over in central washington you ever go camping or anything out there it's

09:15:23.780 --> 09:15:27.460
really amazing if you have a chance to go out there this is stuff again they were thinking

09:15:27.460 --> 09:15:36.180
about in the early 1900s okay you got the columbia river they built a dam on it not just any dam the

09:15:36.180 --> 09:15:41.380
grand coulee dam okay and what they did behind the dam is they created lake roosevelt

09:15:43.620 --> 09:15:52.340
for the purposes of irrigation and to store energy to store energy during low demand times

09:15:53.220 --> 09:15:58.580
what they did is they have the generator's turn you can't stop the columbia river it's a river you're

09:15:58.580 --> 09:16:02.420
going to kill all the fish so you can't just shut the river off you got to keep the water flowing

09:16:02.420 --> 09:16:10.180
but if it's low demand time get that harness the electricity then with the electricity drive pumps

09:16:11.140 --> 09:16:17.540
drive pumps and they pump the water from lake roosevelt up to banks lake

09:16:19.220 --> 09:16:25.140
banks lake very popular for water skiing and recreating banks lake goes to feed agriculture

09:16:25.860 --> 09:16:33.220
and then during peak demand times what they could do is turn it backwards and catch the energy flowing

09:16:33.220 --> 09:16:39.940
back to lake roosevelt producing energy and then catch it falling back into the columbia river

09:16:39.940 --> 09:16:45.940
and harnessing it twice so basically you're using the water to store the energy by simply pumping

09:16:45.940 --> 09:16:55.300
it to a higher elevation during that low demand time brilliant brilliant you know and again they

09:16:55.300 --> 09:17:02.260
figured this stuff all out in the early 1900s so that's what they've got between lake roosevelt

09:17:02.260 --> 09:17:09.460
and banks lake basically our motor generators that you can turn either way and you know either

09:17:09.460 --> 09:17:14.900
turn it backwards pump the water up or catch the water falling and generate electricity

09:17:25.140 --> 09:17:31.460
and this is simply the process of creating a magnetic field that attracts and opposes and

09:17:32.580 --> 09:17:36.980
creating motion instead of motion being used to create a magnetic field

09:17:37.220 --> 09:17:41.700
now we're harnessing the magnetic field to create motion with a dc motor

09:17:42.580 --> 09:17:48.100
another area that uses electromagnetic fields tv radar computer terminals what we're talking

09:17:48.100 --> 09:17:53.540
about is the old school monitor like that old school monitor like that basically in the back

09:17:53.540 --> 09:17:59.300
of a monitor like that there's an electron gun so you get to get to go home tonight what did

09:17:59.300 --> 09:18:03.220
you learn about in school my instructor was talking about them they're electron guns

09:18:04.020 --> 09:18:08.980
it's gonna zap us now an electron gun basically sits in the back of a cathode ray tube and shoots

09:18:08.980 --> 09:18:16.740
an electron beam out towards the screen that electron beam is going to be controlled through

09:18:16.740 --> 09:18:23.540
deflection windings the deflection windings are horizontal and vertical and that's what's

09:18:23.540 --> 09:18:30.100
going to be used to basically paint the image on the screen it's your x-axis and your y-axis

09:18:30.660 --> 09:18:37.860
so that's how we'd use that to paint an image now with flat screen monitors we're doing things a

09:18:37.860 --> 09:18:43.300
little bit different but it's kind of an evolutionary process based on what we were doing with that

09:18:43.300 --> 09:18:50.980
magnetic field in summary we talked about magnets natural magnets

09:18:53.300 --> 09:18:59.060
unnatural magnets artificial magnets and electromagnets come in many shapes and sizes

09:18:59.060 --> 09:19:04.900
big thing to remember unlike poles a track like poles repel two theories of magnetism

09:19:04.900 --> 09:19:11.700
electron spin and domains flux lines are those invisible forces that we can't see

09:19:14.500 --> 09:19:19.780
you know this lecture wouldn't be complete if we didn't talk about you know anomalies

09:19:19.780 --> 09:19:26.580
you've all heard of the bermuda triangle right well science or science fiction

09:19:26.580 --> 09:19:32.980
i mean they've got some really good hard evidence of magnetic anomalies that occur there so

09:19:32.980 --> 09:19:41.460
if you're navigating solely by compass and you encounter unusual magnetic fields

09:19:41.460 --> 09:19:45.380
or you're flying an airplane that's again has a gyro compass in it

09:19:48.020 --> 09:19:53.460
it could cause problems big problems for you magnetic disturbances there's actually on aeronautical

09:19:53.460 --> 09:19:58.980
charts they put down areas that have big magnetic disturbance areas that they're that they're used

09:19:58.980 --> 09:20:03.460
to the bermuda triangles one of them it's actually one of the things it's kind of interesting too

09:20:03.460 --> 09:20:10.500
that i see a lot of these like ghost hunters using um is equipment to basically sense magnetic fields

09:20:11.380 --> 09:20:16.100
and there you know there's there's um you know a school out there that basically says that

09:20:16.100 --> 09:20:22.020
you know spirits possess this energy and this energy manifests itself as a magnetic field so if

09:20:22.020 --> 09:20:26.260
you have sensitive enough equipment and you know i've i don't know anybody watching those shows on

09:20:26.260 --> 09:20:30.900
tv you know i've watched enough that something's going on something's going on and actually quite

09:20:30.900 --> 09:20:37.620
frankly i think we're very we're very naive if if you know we only believe what we could see

09:20:37.620 --> 09:20:45.140
with our five senses you know so um you know i think there's probably some truth in some of this

09:20:45.140 --> 09:20:51.460
stuff we talked about the magnetic field determining direction of flux lines we talked about

09:20:51.460 --> 09:20:58.900
electromagnets strength polarity retentivity electromagnetic induction we talked about Faraday's

09:20:58.900 --> 09:21:06.660
law right parallel perpendicular we not only talked about the left hand rule for generators but i

09:21:06.660 --> 09:21:13.060
gave you a specific warning and not doing that in your car in your drive home as someone might think

09:21:13.060 --> 09:21:19.140
you're giving a gang signs we talked about ac and dc generators big thing to remember about an ac

09:21:19.140 --> 09:21:28.100
generator right slip rings dc generator commutator ac generator makes a wave that's half positive half

09:21:28.100 --> 09:21:35.460
negative dc generator makes pulsating positive waves relays basically electromechanical switches

09:21:37.380 --> 09:21:43.140
a moving armature or a series of ganged armatures contacts on armature

09:21:43.940 --> 09:21:48.980
we talked about how we could use this for doorbell solenoids phonograph pickups loud

09:21:48.980 --> 09:21:55.620
speakers magnetic recordings and then finally we talked about dc motors and yes meters that dr is

09:21:55.620 --> 09:22:00.980
involved meter movement is nothing more than a permanent magnets and a coil when you pass

09:22:00.980 --> 09:22:04.660
current through that coil you either attract or oppose causing the needle move

09:22:05.540 --> 09:22:13.620
and then finally we talked about the electron beams created by electron guns

09:22:14.580 --> 09:22:22.980
to the back of a crt that's how we used to create television signals radar displays oscilloscopes

09:22:22.980 --> 09:22:28.740
and computer terminals and we have any questions on anything that we covered in this chapter there's

09:22:28.740 --> 09:22:35.220
a lot of new terms to familiarize yourself with this less math more remembering new terms

09:22:36.420 --> 09:22:50.980
question i have the flux capacitor in back to the future i have no idea what that is

09:22:51.540 --> 09:22:57.620
and i probably wouldn't recognize it you know if i if i saw it so um yeah

09:22:58.740 --> 09:23:03.060
there's no reference to the flux capacitor it's just a completely made up thing that they came

09:23:03.060 --> 09:23:08.340
up with pretty much i don't know if there's any wikipedia references to it you know it could

09:23:08.340 --> 09:23:28.020
be a fun project to try to build one i reckon well you guys are stomping me tonight

09:23:29.300 --> 09:23:33.140
uh i don't know that's what they've always caused it yeah it should be like an electron beam

09:23:33.140 --> 09:23:42.420
tube cathode ray tube cathode sends out an electron ray and it's a vacuum tube cathode ray tube

09:23:44.100 --> 09:23:48.100
electron beam i don't know got me good question

09:23:50.420 --> 09:23:53.540
yeah let me tell you if i was the pope of electronics all of this stuff would have been

09:23:53.540 --> 09:23:58.980
called something easier simpler you know some of the stuff you just got to hit the i believe button

09:23:58.980 --> 09:24:04.900
but suffice to say like say magnetism it is really really critical um that's actually one of things

09:24:04.900 --> 09:24:09.780
too that i don't know if you um i can't confirm or deny but the the movie hunt for right october

09:24:10.740 --> 09:24:23.220
you know um that was basically a hydrodynamic drive that was based on magnetic field and um

09:24:24.260 --> 09:24:28.580
you know you could look at that and say science fiction science or science fiction i of course

09:24:28.580 --> 09:24:34.500
cannot comment on it um but if you research that type of technology the japanese and the japanese

09:24:34.500 --> 09:24:39.860
of course is an island nation they're very dependent and always have been dependent on trade

09:24:39.860 --> 09:24:44.820
they've played around with that technology on barges to see if they could you know move a barge

09:24:44.820 --> 09:24:50.500
using this you know hydrodynamic drive system and um you know again it's not mainstream but

09:24:50.500 --> 09:25:06.500
they've played around enough with it so

09:25:11.300 --> 09:25:19.380
yeah and to be honest with you um you know and i haven't i haven't wrote a nuclear submarine

09:25:19.380 --> 09:25:25.620
in over 20 years um i know that we had submarines out there that were so quiet you wouldn't hear

09:25:25.620 --> 09:25:31.620
the submarine what you would hear is the submarine blocking biological noise behind it

09:25:31.620 --> 09:25:37.460
so it's like if you had something big going past your your ear you know something is there

09:25:37.460 --> 09:25:43.300
because it's blocking the sound so i mean that was 20 plus years ago so we've never had a problem

09:25:43.300 --> 09:25:49.620
keeping quiet and keeping keeping things real quiet um but performance is another issue see if

09:25:49.620 --> 09:25:53.860
you want to go fast underwater you're going to make some noise and that that will give a location

09:25:53.860 --> 09:26:02.980
you know give your your your tell basically so any questions any other questions comments concerns

09:26:03.060 --> 09:26:16.180
all right the long anticipated lecture chapter 10 inductance

09:26:20.180 --> 09:26:27.220
this is uh this is going to be an unusual property for us to discuss compared to what

09:26:27.220 --> 09:26:32.420
we've talked about up to this point what we've talked about up to this point really is

09:26:33.620 --> 09:26:41.220
conductance resistance period in discussing inductance you're going to see that things with

09:26:41.220 --> 09:26:50.580
inductance change over time okay the property actually changes the influence it has in a circuit

09:26:50.580 --> 09:26:58.420
changes over time so you're going to see that this is uh very dynamic literally dynamic component

09:26:58.420 --> 09:27:04.980
and property chapter 10 inductance after completing this chapter you're going to be able to explain

09:27:04.980 --> 09:27:11.300
the principles of inductance identify the basic units of inductance identify different types of

09:27:11.300 --> 09:27:21.060
inductors determine the total inductance in series parallel circuits explain l r time constants and

09:27:21.060 --> 09:27:30.740
how they relate to inductance now the property of inductance is that characteristic of an

09:27:30.740 --> 09:27:39.540
electrical conductor that opposes a change in current flow opposes a change in current flow

09:27:42.020 --> 09:27:48.420
the symbol that we use is the capital letter l so in a circuit if you see on a schematic

09:27:48.420 --> 09:27:57.220
diagram l equals that means inductance is equal to whatever specific amount is identified

09:27:59.060 --> 09:28:06.180
now an inductor is a specific device designed to possess this property of inductance

09:28:06.500 --> 09:28:17.300
an inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field and it's important for us to

09:28:17.300 --> 09:28:21.700
understand this property because we're going to counter this next chapter when we talk about

09:28:21.700 --> 09:28:28.340
capacitance right i'll let the cat out of the bag capacitance is an electrostatic field

09:28:29.140 --> 09:28:36.100
inductance is an electromagnetic field that's what's the magic behind an inductor

09:28:38.660 --> 09:28:43.300
now once current is moving through a conductor inductance helps to keep it moving

09:28:45.860 --> 09:28:52.580
as the magnetic flux lines build up they create an opposition to the flow of current

09:28:53.140 --> 09:28:57.540
an opposition to the flow of current

09:29:00.180 --> 09:29:10.260
lens's law talks about that lens's law states an induced emf in any circuit

09:29:11.300 --> 09:29:17.940
is always in a direction to oppose the effect that produced it the amount of counter emf is

09:29:17.940 --> 09:29:22.820
proportional to the rate of change the faster the rate of change the greater the counter emf

09:29:23.460 --> 09:29:29.460
so what this means let's go back last chapter that we talked about remember magnetism

09:29:30.660 --> 09:29:35.540
remember when we pass current through a conductor we create a magnetic field

09:29:35.540 --> 09:29:48.820
lens's law says if the current was going data way it's going to create an electromagnetic

09:29:48.820 --> 09:29:59.220
field like this make sense if we shut the circuit off that electromagnetic field is going to

09:30:00.180 --> 09:30:08.180
collapse and it's going to produce a counter electromotive force that goes

09:30:09.540 --> 09:30:16.660
that way the opposite way of what created it so if the emf goes that way and it creates some

09:30:16.660 --> 09:30:21.140
magnetic field like this magnetic field collapses it creates a counter emf that goes in the opposite

09:30:21.140 --> 09:30:26.660
direction so the second part there talks about the rate of change

09:30:29.220 --> 09:30:35.140
the faster we turn that on and off on and off on and off expand collapse expand collapse

09:30:35.140 --> 09:30:38.980
the more the faster we do it the more pronounced that effect is going to be

09:30:40.740 --> 09:30:47.060
if you connect one of these one of them there inductors to a dc circuit it's going to happen

09:30:47.060 --> 09:30:53.940
once when you close the circuit and energize it and when you de-energize it that field's

09:30:53.940 --> 09:30:57.620
going to collapse and create that counter current so it's only going to happen once it's going to

09:30:57.620 --> 09:31:04.820
expand once and it's going to collapse once now i'm going to let out a little secret because

09:31:04.820 --> 09:31:15.140
you guys have all read ahead ac what's one thing that's constant about ac it's constantly

09:31:16.100 --> 09:31:23.060
changing very good constantly changing so the higher the ac frequency is that we apply to one

09:31:23.060 --> 09:31:26.980
of these devices the more pronounced this effect is going to be does that make sense

09:31:28.260 --> 09:31:34.180
it goes back to lenses law and again anytime that in class i i say anything about a law

09:31:35.300 --> 09:31:38.580
we should like ring a bell dim the lights hit some chimes

09:31:39.460 --> 09:31:48.500
and hit a gong because laws you could take to the bank

09:31:50.900 --> 09:31:57.380
you answer a question on your quiz using a law on an exam using a law you approach a project

09:31:58.020 --> 09:32:01.940
or a lab assignment using a law you're going to get good results

09:32:02.420 --> 09:32:09.780
now inductance is measured by the henry and this was invented by a guy whose name was

09:32:10.980 --> 09:32:11.460
george

09:32:14.260 --> 09:32:17.700
guy by the name of joe henry my main man

09:32:19.940 --> 09:32:22.900
henry ironically is abbreviated with the letter h

09:32:23.860 --> 09:32:33.780
and one henry is the amount of inductance required to induce an emf of one volt

09:32:34.900 --> 09:32:41.060
when the current in the conductor changes at a rate of one amp per second

09:32:42.660 --> 09:32:50.100
so one henry is equal to one volt of emf at one amp per second one is equal to one over one

09:32:50.180 --> 09:32:54.100
one over one second

09:32:57.380 --> 09:33:01.860
now in electronics the typical values that we're going to see

09:33:04.260 --> 09:33:10.580
will be the mille henry times ten to the negative third the micro henry times ten to the negative

09:33:10.580 --> 09:33:16.020
sixth in some high power applications you may see henry's

09:33:20.100 --> 09:33:24.660
but generally speaking most of the stuff that we're working with in micro electronics mille

09:33:24.660 --> 09:33:33.780
henry's micro henry's now inductors are those specific devices designed to possess the property of

09:33:34.340 --> 09:33:41.460
inductance so they're designed to have a specific inductance that's why come they be invented

09:33:42.020 --> 09:33:53.620
they consist of a conductor coiled around a core remember if we got like x amount of magnetism

09:33:53.620 --> 09:34:00.740
by creating one turn how much would we get if we make two turns twice as much it's that simple

09:34:00.740 --> 09:34:07.940
it's easy math consists of a conductor coiled around a core and it's classified by the type of

09:34:07.940 --> 09:34:13.860
core material whether it's magnetic or non magnetic if we use a magnetic core material

09:34:13.860 --> 09:34:17.940
we're going to get a higher amount of inductance out of it if we use non magnetic we're going to

09:34:17.940 --> 09:34:25.060
get a little bit lower out of it so sometimes they'll use that core material to get it just

09:34:25.060 --> 09:34:35.860
not too much not too little but just right this is the schematic diagram for a fixed inductor

09:34:38.180 --> 09:34:41.940
and for those of you out there that want to go home and roll your own you could do that

09:34:42.820 --> 09:34:52.580
you just need magnetic wire magnetic wire is basically thin copper wire solid core that has

09:34:52.580 --> 09:34:57.700
a lacquer coating on it if you've ever looked into a transformer or motor and you see the windings

09:34:58.820 --> 09:35:04.500
that's magnetic wire it's all you need some cases you don't even need magnetic wire

09:35:04.500 --> 09:35:09.540
because you could you could roll a coil and as long as the wires aren't touching each other

09:35:09.540 --> 09:35:16.660
you're using air as an insulation you could roll your own i've been known to roll my own on a few

09:35:16.660 --> 09:35:26.340
times with mixed results i have no idea what i'm talking about actually i know exactly what i'm

09:35:26.340 --> 09:35:36.020
talking about this is a variable inductor created with an adjustable core material now the way they

09:35:36.020 --> 09:35:41.300
they come up with this is pretty fascinating what they'll do is they'll get a a ferromagnetic

09:35:42.260 --> 09:35:52.100
core material typically like powdered iron and then they they basically form it into a material

09:35:52.100 --> 09:35:57.700
precedent material and then they thread it and then they thread the center of the core

09:35:57.700 --> 09:36:05.700
and what you could actually do with it right is righty tighty lefty lucy screw it in and as you

09:36:05.700 --> 09:36:12.100
screw it in what are you doing you're you're increasing the magnetic influence of the iron core

09:36:14.420 --> 09:36:19.780
so by simply adjusting that this is used for fine tuning in a lot of circuits that contain these

09:36:19.780 --> 09:36:26.420
very fine subtle tuning another thing that you could do and i used to see this old school not as

09:36:26.420 --> 09:36:36.660
much now they would use a brass insert and when you screw brass in what are you doing brass has a

09:36:36.660 --> 09:36:43.060
high level of reluctance so it's going to oppose that magnetic field so by screwing it in you're

09:36:43.060 --> 09:36:49.620
lowering the amount of inductance if it was iron core and you screwed it in you'd be increasing

09:36:50.100 --> 09:36:59.060
so it's counter-intuitive and it gets worse because what would happen is typically the

09:36:59.060 --> 09:37:04.660
questions that i used to be asked in a lot of my military navy equipment schools what we would

09:37:04.660 --> 09:37:09.860
have were circuit card extenders so you would do is take the circuit card out put it in the

09:37:09.860 --> 09:37:14.660
extender and then now the circuit card was was mounted above the rest so that you could get in

09:37:14.660 --> 09:37:20.340
there and adjust make adjustments a lot of times you'd have to make the adjustments from the back

09:37:20.340 --> 09:37:26.020
side they'd have a little hole physically in the in the board that you could put your adjustment

09:37:26.020 --> 09:37:33.540
alignment tool in so then they'd ask if approaching it from the back side which direction needs you

09:37:33.540 --> 09:37:42.020
turn the inductor to see a decrease in inductance so it's one of those things that you know you kind

09:37:42.100 --> 09:37:49.300
of let's see if i'm turning it clockwise from the top that's going to be counterclockwise from the

09:37:49.300 --> 09:37:58.820
backside but it's it's brass core so as i'm turning it counterclockwise i'm really moving i mean it's

09:37:58.820 --> 09:38:04.340
just these questions that like you thought your head was going to explode but you know what you

09:38:04.340 --> 09:38:10.340
kind of had a well i don't see how that really ever helped me in life knowing that stuff because

09:38:10.340 --> 09:38:14.900
basically when you got out to the fleet you put a circuit you set up your test fixture and basically

09:38:14.900 --> 09:38:20.180
as soon as you start turning it the wrong way you see needles go the wrong way and you turn it back

09:38:20.180 --> 09:38:24.180
and you get it to where it needs to be and you're done with it you don't sit there and well let's

09:38:24.180 --> 09:38:30.500
see if i approach and if i'm using a mirror i'm actually seeing the inverse i mean just crazy

09:38:30.500 --> 09:38:35.700
stuff but think about that because these still and some of you may work on some legacy equipment

09:38:35.700 --> 09:38:41.700
it's fun to repair legacy equipment to retrofit to do things like that

09:38:43.060 --> 09:38:49.380
so you may end up finding some of this stuff this is my personal collection of inductors

09:38:52.180 --> 09:38:53.540
guys actually believe me

09:38:56.420 --> 09:39:02.900
this is an air core inductor this is a fixed value inductor and that's all it is this wire

09:39:02.900 --> 09:39:11.780
wound around a magnetic core it's all it is all of these can type here are adjustable and actually

09:39:11.780 --> 09:39:18.980
if you could look here this almost looks like this takes a hex head right like an allen an allen head

09:39:22.740 --> 09:39:30.500
whatever you do don't use an allen wrench to try to adjust this because typically the allen wrench

09:39:30.500 --> 09:39:40.100
in your toolkit is made out of iron steel ferromagnetic material so as soon as you get it in close

09:39:40.100 --> 09:39:46.500
proximity and you adjust it and get it just so you're going to remove part of the magnetic

09:39:46.500 --> 09:39:54.340
influence and your numbers are going to go caddywampus so all of these need to be adjusted with

09:39:54.340 --> 09:40:02.340
non-magnetic alignment tools i've got a i've got a roll a tool roll at home from back in the day

09:40:02.340 --> 09:40:07.460
i should bring it in as an example it's this big tool roll it's like every alignment tool known to

09:40:07.460 --> 09:40:15.220
humankind and they're basically all plastic heads the other thing too is uh you know you stick your

09:40:16.020 --> 09:40:21.780
a hex head in there you stand a chance of damaging that and even if you break off a little bit of

09:40:21.780 --> 09:40:27.940
material that amount of material was designed engineered to be there to create x amount of

09:40:27.940 --> 09:40:35.540
magnetic field so you kind of got to you kind of got to get it right so don't start if you don't

09:40:35.540 --> 09:40:41.380
have the right tool don't touch this stuff so it's typically called an alignment tool or actually a

09:40:41.380 --> 09:40:49.940
tweaker in the classical sense of the word a tweaker and you could always tell who the technicians

09:40:49.940 --> 09:40:56.100
were you know because they'd always have the tweaker in their pockets and you knew it's kind

09:40:56.100 --> 09:41:00.980
of funny back in uniform submarine base in connecticut i'd be walking around i'd see you with

09:41:00.980 --> 09:41:06.180
tweaker in your pocket you know at the at the at the deli or whatever and i knew exactly what you

09:41:06.180 --> 09:41:10.500
did for a living the only guys running around only goofballs running around with tweakers in

09:41:10.500 --> 09:41:14.660
their freaking pocket were electronics techs that were regularly aligning equipment

09:41:19.060 --> 09:41:28.580
air core this is an inductor well not without core material because it has air in the core that's

09:41:28.580 --> 09:41:37.300
why it's called air core it's used for values up to five millihenries of inductance wrapped on

09:41:37.300 --> 09:41:42.740
ceramic or phenolic core in this case it was probably wrapped around a dowel or something

09:41:42.740 --> 09:41:48.260
and then removed and it has form in and of itself this is actually a really good photograph because

09:41:48.260 --> 09:41:52.900
you could see the magnetic wire here and you could see where the insulation has been stripped

09:41:52.900 --> 09:41:58.500
this is bare wire and then this is insulated a lot of times people see this and they think that

09:41:58.500 --> 09:42:05.940
it's bare wire it's not bare wire it's insulated one of the best ways of getting this insulation

09:42:05.940 --> 09:42:12.740
off if you're going to do a lot of this is with a chemical stripper chemical stripper

09:42:14.660 --> 09:42:17.940
and basically it's it's like a thinning agent you dip it in

09:42:19.940 --> 09:42:26.100
paint thinner paint a remover and it removes that right down to the the metal and it makes

09:42:26.100 --> 09:42:30.420
it solderable you have to put a neutralizing agent on it but that's the best way of doing it

09:42:30.420 --> 09:42:34.740
other than that you know you're going to get your wire strippers and your wire strippers are just

09:42:34.740 --> 09:42:42.340
basically going to scratch the stuff off it's not going to really because this is a lacker coating on it

09:42:45.860 --> 09:42:50.340
but that's this is an inductor believe it or not just a piece of wire making those five turns

09:42:50.900 --> 09:42:54.820
it's going to give you x amount of inductance might be enough for you to get the job done

09:42:54.820 --> 09:42:59.700
question on the last air core picture that you had there was a piece of metal going through it

09:43:04.740 --> 09:43:12.820
this piece right here i think somehow this is mounted this this serves as a a form somehow to

09:43:12.820 --> 09:43:20.340
keep that the shape of it i really don't know usually they're hollow though yeah oh yeah yeah

09:43:20.340 --> 09:43:25.940
this is not here to influence the magnetic or all it's either there for aesthetics or to help the

09:43:25.940 --> 09:43:31.700
way that's mounted or what have you it's a good observation some of these things are actually

09:43:31.700 --> 09:43:35.940
pretty cool looking again anyway when you get into some of that older equipment they made it with a

09:43:35.940 --> 09:43:42.660
certain level of elegance you know and um this would be an example of that if you opened up an old

09:43:42.660 --> 09:43:49.860
in a 1930s radio you'd probably find that inductor that looks like that in there it's 1970s radio no

09:43:49.860 --> 09:44:00.980
you're not going to find that in there iron core iron core could be either ferrite or powdered iron

09:44:01.780 --> 09:44:07.860
it's a typo not ion ion core captain the ion core is melting down

09:44:11.540 --> 09:44:18.740
damn damn you scotty that's why i'm not into drama right not a very dramatic kind of guy

09:44:20.420 --> 09:44:28.260
it's iron core used for values of 200 millihenrys of inductance typically up to 200 millihenrys of

09:44:28.260 --> 09:44:34.100
inductance schematic symbol shows these two parallel lines next to the coil that shows that

09:44:34.100 --> 09:44:46.340
there's an iron core next to the coil torrid core these are donut shape but do not try to eat them

09:44:49.780 --> 09:44:56.100
they offer a high inductance for a small size these are very prolific in a lot of contemporary

09:44:56.100 --> 09:45:02.260
electronic applications because the magnetic field is contained in the core offers a very

09:45:02.260 --> 09:45:09.540
high inductance for very small size if you opened up a computer power supply you'd find

09:45:09.540 --> 09:45:15.620
a bunch of these inside a lot of inductance for a relatively small package

09:45:18.100 --> 09:45:23.300
i've had graduates have gone to work for companies and they had to do this part of their job roll

09:45:23.300 --> 09:45:29.220
their own they're giving the blank core spool of wire and you sit there and you

09:45:29.220 --> 09:45:34.420
thread it through and tighten it up thread it through tighten it up clean the leads

09:45:34.420 --> 09:45:38.420
solder it in the boards actually pretty good job most of the people that are playing around with

09:45:38.420 --> 09:45:44.500
this stuff are for rf applications radio frequency high energy radio frequency mr. ground what's

09:45:44.500 --> 09:45:47.860
going on man i had a question you just backed their waving man take

09:45:52.820 --> 09:45:53.300
what's up

09:45:53.300 --> 09:46:04.100
up

09:46:07.220 --> 09:46:13.620
yeah yep so it's not wasting that field going outside it's containing it basically

09:46:14.900 --> 09:46:16.100
increases the efficiency

09:46:18.100 --> 09:46:19.300
which makes it more better

09:46:23.940 --> 09:46:30.580
this is a shielded core shield of core have a shield of magnetic material to protect them from

09:46:30.580 --> 09:46:36.020
the influence of other magnetic fields because if you've got a couple of these in close proximity

09:46:36.020 --> 09:46:42.420
to each other one field could influence another device now if you just saw this if you didn't

09:46:42.420 --> 09:46:48.580
know any better what would you think this device was now looks like a transformer and the only

09:46:48.580 --> 09:46:54.980
tell that there is on this is there's only two wires if you look on the other side you wouldn't

09:46:54.980 --> 09:47:01.540
find any other wires but it would look exactly like a transformer as a matter of fact you can

09:47:01.540 --> 09:47:08.420
use a transformer as an inductor if you don't connect the secondary leads the primer if you

09:47:08.420 --> 09:47:17.540
only use just the coil you could use a transformer as an inductor for some applications that's why

09:47:17.540 --> 09:47:23.620
i've got a garage full of junk because i won't throw a transformer away because someday i may

09:47:23.620 --> 09:47:34.340
want to use it as an inductor this is laminated core and again if you didn't know any better

09:47:34.340 --> 09:47:40.820
you'd think it was a transformer we know it's an inductor because there's only two wires coming

09:47:40.820 --> 09:47:51.060
out of it and the top is stamped 4.5 henry's 4.5 h and this was going to vary from 0.1 henry's all

09:47:51.060 --> 09:48:04.580
the way up to 100 henry's this is also sometimes referred to as a choke as a choke used as a choke

09:48:04.660 --> 09:48:13.940
in automotive applications noise filters meaning to choke off a change it's going to choke the change

09:48:20.340 --> 09:48:25.460
just like resistors inductors could be connected in series parallel or series parallel

09:48:25.940 --> 09:48:34.180
when you're dealing with inductors measured in henry's in series you treat them exactly like

09:48:34.180 --> 09:48:43.460
resistors plain and simple if i've got two henry's and i put it in series with four henry's two plus

09:48:43.940 --> 09:48:53.220
four equals six i now i now get six henry's worth of inductance in parallel you treat them like

09:48:55.140 --> 09:49:01.060
resistors in parallel so the total inductance will always be less than the value of least

09:49:03.620 --> 09:49:07.860
as long as you're dealing with the property measured in henry's

09:49:07.860 --> 09:49:15.140
now this is where things get interesting everything else i've been talking up to this

09:49:15.140 --> 09:49:23.940
point it's just been kind of hey it's trying to get to know you this the real deal this

09:49:25.460 --> 09:49:28.100
dis is what it's all about

09:49:28.420 --> 09:49:37.620
it's a series circuit it's a series circuit i've got a switch that has two positions one is called

09:49:37.620 --> 09:49:42.820
the growth mode and the other is the decay mode okay so this switch i could toggle from either

09:49:42.820 --> 09:49:51.460
growth to decay when it's in the growth mode i have a simple series circuit do i not and the

09:49:51.460 --> 09:49:58.660
circuit contains an inductor actually what an iron core inductor because i see the parallel

09:49:58.660 --> 09:50:08.420
lines the inductor in series with a resistor makes sense when i close the switch

09:50:10.580 --> 09:50:16.820
as soon as i close the switch it's going to allow current to flow through this circuit do you agree

09:50:16.820 --> 09:50:24.020
with me what's going to happen is that current is going to come racing through the circuit

09:50:24.020 --> 09:50:29.700
negative the positive all of a sudden it's going to hit this curly piece of wire and that curly

09:50:29.700 --> 09:50:34.900
piece of wire it's hitting is an inductor an inductor is a specific device designed to possess

09:50:34.900 --> 09:50:42.100
the property of inductance inductance is that property which tries to oppose a change in current

09:50:42.740 --> 09:50:49.780
so current was at zero it wants to go to 100 percent and this device is going to say uh-uh

09:50:50.580 --> 09:50:54.740
i want you to stay at zero why because you've been at zero and i like it like that

09:50:58.180 --> 09:51:02.820
but eventually as the current continues to come that magnetic field builds

09:51:02.820 --> 09:51:08.100
and current eventually goes to maximum it goes to 100 percent for this circuit

09:51:09.060 --> 09:51:15.620
but the inductor because of its property of inductance is going to fight the whole time

09:51:16.420 --> 09:51:22.100
to try to prevent that change from occurring but eventually it's going to lose

09:51:25.620 --> 09:51:30.820
so close the switch turn the circuit on the inductor is going to fight fight fight fight

09:51:30.820 --> 09:51:34.740
fight fight and eventually give up and current's going to be at 100 percent flowing through this

09:51:34.740 --> 09:51:40.500
circuit and by the way by the way when current is at 100 percent flowing through this inductor

09:51:41.700 --> 09:51:45.540
electrons are like what's up with that it's a piece of curly wire

09:51:47.780 --> 09:51:52.260
after a period of time the electrons it's like why am i going through a piece of curly wire

09:51:52.900 --> 09:51:55.700
it just has no effect on them whatsoever

09:51:56.660 --> 09:52:05.700
and the circuit runs and runs and runs soon as we get the switch and move the switch from the

09:52:05.700 --> 09:52:13.700
growth mode to the decay mode the magnetic field that was built up around inductor l1

09:52:14.420 --> 09:52:18.340
is going to collapse and it's going to collapse

09:52:18.740 --> 09:52:26.100
into itself when it collapses into itself what is it going to do

09:52:29.540 --> 09:52:35.460
it's going to act like a what happens when a magnetic field passes through a conductor

09:52:40.740 --> 09:52:46.500
we induce we induce current if we move a conductor through a magnetic field we induce current

09:52:46.500 --> 09:52:51.140
if the if the if the conductor is stationary and the magnetic field moves through a conductor

09:52:52.420 --> 09:52:59.220
we're going to generate current right so as soon as i move this to the decay mode this magnetic

09:52:59.220 --> 09:53:06.820
field is going to collapse into itself creating a counter current lenses law remember the opposite

09:53:06.820 --> 09:53:12.740
of the force that created it and then that current is basically going to flow through the circuit

09:53:13.620 --> 09:53:14.740
until it dissipates

09:53:18.740 --> 09:53:22.820
but if this was just a series circuit made up of a resistor a resistor and a switch

09:53:22.820 --> 09:53:30.420
you turn it on boom you go to a hundred percent you turn it off pow you go to zero now with an

09:53:30.420 --> 09:53:37.700
inductor in here you turn it on it's going to come up and eventually get to a hundred percent

09:53:37.700 --> 09:53:42.180
you turn it off the magnetic field's going to collapse and eventually it's going to get down

09:53:42.180 --> 09:53:48.180
to zero percent you follow what i'm talking about you guys know what i'm talking about i'm beating

09:53:48.180 --> 09:53:55.220
around the bush what am i talking about time constants time constants the time required

09:53:55.220 --> 09:54:03.460
for current through a conductor to increase to 63.2 percent so if i apply 100 to it and that first

09:54:03.460 --> 09:54:11.780
time constant it's going to rise 63.2 percent in the next time constant it's going to gain

09:54:11.780 --> 09:54:18.820
63.2 percent of that's what is what's remaining the next time constant 63.2 percent of what's

09:54:18.820 --> 09:54:24.820
remaining the next time constant 63.2 percent of what's remaining the next time constant basically

09:54:24.820 --> 09:54:30.260
after five time constant we say enough is enough it's a hundred percent but is it really at 100

09:54:30.260 --> 09:54:38.100
percent no because it's nonlinear so really it never reaches 100 percent we say after five time

09:54:38.100 --> 09:54:46.540
constant's reached 100%. It's good enough for what we do. To calculate out this

09:54:46.540 --> 09:54:53.020
time constant, it's actually relatively easy. Lr is the symbol used for the

09:54:53.020 --> 09:54:59.340
time constant of an RL circuit, and the formula is t is equal to l divided by r,

09:54:59.340 --> 09:55:04.220
period. It's that simple. Take the amount of inductance divided by the amount of

09:55:04.220 --> 09:55:12.580
resistance that's going to give you the time constant. Measured in seconds. That's

09:55:12.580 --> 09:55:17.900
what we use as our base unit of measurement in electronics, the second.

09:55:18.660 --> 09:55:36.700
t is equal to l over r. Yes. If I gave you four inductors, you'd have to calculate out

09:55:36.700 --> 09:55:42.380
the total inductance and plug that in the circuit right there. So I could give you

09:55:42.380 --> 09:55:47.220
some real nightmare circuits right now. Think about it. It'd be fair game. I could

09:55:47.220 --> 09:55:51.260
give you a circuit that's got, you know, 13 inductors and combination series

09:55:51.260 --> 09:55:56.980
parallel and 22 resistors, combination and series parallel. The bottom line is

09:55:56.980 --> 09:56:03.780
it's equivalent to this circuit here. You've got to figure that out. But you

09:56:03.780 --> 09:56:09.980
should be able to do so without a whole lot of fuss. This is what a time constant

09:56:09.980 --> 09:56:13.580
curve looks like.

09:56:18.180 --> 09:56:25.540
Here's that first time constant. 63.2%. 63.2% of what's remaining. 63.2% of

09:56:25.540 --> 09:56:33.540
what's remaining. 63.2% of what's remaining. What's remaining. And what is it

09:56:33.540 --> 09:56:37.740
that I'm actually looking at here? What is this in blue? Is this voltage? What is

09:56:37.740 --> 09:56:46.220
this? It's a current. Current. Number one, because the slide says so. But number two,

09:56:46.220 --> 09:56:55.340
most importantly, because it's current that's going from zero, the inductors

09:56:55.340 --> 09:56:58.700
trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the

09:56:58.700 --> 09:57:01.660
change, trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the change, trying to

09:57:01.660 --> 09:57:09.780
prevent the change. Alright. Current wins. Then as soon as you set that circuit off,

09:57:09.780 --> 09:57:14.180
current's going to try to go from 100% to zero, but because that magnetic field

09:57:14.260 --> 09:57:19.620
is collapsing, I don't want to decrease. I want to keep it 100%, but I can't. Oh,

09:57:19.620 --> 09:57:24.820
crap. Oh, all the way down to zero. But because that field is collapsing, it's

09:57:24.820 --> 09:57:30.580
going to try to prevent that change. That's why we use these. That's why we use

09:57:30.580 --> 09:57:39.700
these. Absolutely. If we're affecting current, definitely we'll have an effect

09:57:39.700 --> 09:57:46.740
on voltage. In summary, inductance is the ability to store energy in a magnetic

09:57:46.740 --> 09:57:54.460
field. Just remember the key word for inductance is magnetic. That's how they

09:57:54.460 --> 09:57:59.420
do their magic. The unit for measuring inductance is the Henry, measured by the

09:57:59.420 --> 09:58:07.860
capital letter H. The letter L represents inductance. Inductors have specific

09:58:07.940 --> 09:58:17.820
inductances. That's why they're designed. The symbol for a fixed inductor is down

09:58:17.820 --> 09:58:23.140
here at the bottom. Symbol for a variable inductor has an arrow going through it.

09:58:23.140 --> 09:58:29.380
The arrow means it's adjustable. Types of inductors include iron core, ferrite or

09:58:29.380 --> 09:58:37.380
powdered iron core, torrid core, shielded core, laminated core. Formula for adding

09:58:37.380 --> 09:58:41.380
up in series is like the same formula for adding up resistors in series. The only

09:58:41.380 --> 09:58:47.380
thing you need to be aware of, you're adding up inductance measured in

09:58:47.380 --> 09:58:55.740
Henry's. If it's not in Henry's, can't use this formula. The formula for total

09:58:55.740 --> 09:59:00.100
conductance in inductors in parallel is a reciprocal formula. Use it same as you

09:59:00.120 --> 09:59:11.420
would for resistors in parallel. Time constant formula T is equal to L over R. You

09:59:11.420 --> 09:59:15.740
run this calculation, it shows you what one time constant is worth. I need to

09:59:15.740 --> 09:59:20.460
multiply that by how many to figure out how long it's going to take to get to 100%?

09:59:20.460 --> 09:59:27.780
Five. Five. Because it takes five time constants to reach 100%. So understand

09:59:27.820 --> 09:59:32.940
that when you do this math, you only end up with one time constant. It takes five to

09:59:32.940 --> 09:59:39.940
get the job done. Or as it says here, five time constants required to fully build

09:59:39.940 --> 09:59:46.980
up or collapse the magnetic field of an inductor. Any questions on anything that

09:59:46.980 --> 09:59:48.980
we discussed for the inductors? Yes.

09:59:58.980 --> 10:00:02.860
Yup. And that's it. We have inductors because they create inductance. And

10:00:02.860 --> 10:00:08.460
inductance is that property which tries to oppose the change in current. So we're

10:00:08.460 --> 10:00:16.020
going to have a lot of different components that are going to want to

10:00:16.020 --> 10:00:20.500
bring about a change in current in a circuit. And if we put an inductor in

10:00:20.500 --> 10:00:25.860
there, an inductor could help stabilize that current flow because of that

10:00:25.860 --> 10:00:29.460
electromagnetic property. So it's going to help stabilize current levels in a

10:00:29.460 --> 10:00:36.460
circuit. The majority of applications that we're going to use inductors for is

10:00:36.460 --> 10:00:45.100
really going to be filtration. Because once we're not there yet, some of you may

10:00:45.180 --> 10:00:52.180
have read it far enough ahead, that when we apply an inductor to an AC circuit,

10:00:52.180 --> 10:00:58.180
it starts doing some wacky stuff. And by harnessing that wacky property called

10:00:58.180 --> 10:01:07.180
inductive reactance, we can use that to filter. We could use it in audio

10:01:07.180 --> 10:01:13.700
applications where we want only certain frequencies to go to certain speakers.

10:01:13.780 --> 10:01:18.780
And that's why we're going to be doing that wacky stuff. I knew a guy that was

10:01:18.780 --> 10:01:25.780
getting some interference on one of his cable channels back in the day. And

10:01:25.780 --> 10:01:33.780
because this friend of mine had extensive electronics background, he didn't

10:01:33.780 --> 10:01:38.780
want to call the cable company and have them waste their time and come out and

10:01:38.860 --> 10:01:46.860
call. Exactly. So this friend of mine built a filter circuit to filter out the

10:01:46.860 --> 10:01:52.860
garbage signal that somebody was putting on this pay-per-view channel. And by

10:01:52.860 --> 10:01:57.980
filtering out the garbage that got put on the channel, the reception was

10:01:57.980 --> 10:02:07.980
enhanced and made the station viewable. And the key component in that hole, so

10:02:08.060 --> 10:02:15.060
I'm told, project as an inductor. And ironically, it was an inductor that was

10:02:15.060 --> 10:02:24.060
like three turns of wire. One, two, three turns of wire was adequate enough for

10:02:24.060 --> 10:02:33.060
the reception to be enhanced. Mind-boggling, so I'm told. Question.

10:02:33.060 --> 10:02:43.060
Yeah.

10:02:43.060 --> 10:02:53.060
Oh, really? Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And a little did you realize that?

10:02:53.060 --> 10:03:00.060
Yeah. Nobody knew why, but it worked. Now you know.

10:03:00.060 --> 10:03:06.060
All right, let's go ahead and take a break. And at about 6.20, we'll start up with

10:03:06.060 --> 10:03:14.060
chapter 17. Y'all ready for this?

10:03:14.060 --> 10:03:22.060
Chapter 11. Capacitance. Capacitance. If you believed what I sold you last

10:03:22.060 --> 10:03:30.060
chapter, this should not be a stretch for you. Because it's kind of like the same

10:03:30.060 --> 10:03:34.060
thing is happening, but with a different property.

10:03:34.060 --> 10:03:40.060
It's really what it's all about. Well, capacitance is actually kind of cool.

10:03:40.060 --> 10:03:44.060
We'll talk about it. A lot of uses for capacitance. After completing this

10:03:44.060 --> 10:03:49.060
chapter, the student, you, the student, will be able to explain the principles of

10:03:49.060 --> 10:03:54.060
capacitance, identify the basic units of capacitance, identify different types of

10:03:54.060 --> 10:03:59.060
capacitors, determine total capacitance in series and parallel circuits, explain

10:03:59.060 --> 10:04:06.060
RC time constants, and how they relate to capacitance. Capacitance is the ability

10:04:06.060 --> 10:04:14.060
of a device to store electrical energy. Capacitance is the ability of a device

10:04:14.060 --> 10:04:21.060
to store electrical energy. Let me stop. The ability of a device to store electrical

10:04:21.060 --> 10:04:42.060
energy. What does that sound like the definition of?

10:04:42.060 --> 10:04:50.060
Mr. Carter. That sounds like the definition of a battery, doesn't it? The ability

10:04:50.060 --> 10:04:56.060
to store electrical energy. So there's really not that big of a difference

10:04:56.060 --> 10:05:02.060
between a capacitor and a storage cell. Typically, a storage cell is a small

10:05:02.060 --> 10:05:11.060
amount of current over a long period of time. Unless you're a car battery.

10:05:11.060 --> 10:05:16.060
But a capacitor generally is a large amount of current over a short period of time

10:05:16.060 --> 10:05:21.060
that it's designed to expend, if you will. But the definitions are very, very,

10:05:21.060 --> 10:05:31.060
very similar, very close. The key word on how a capacitor works is that

10:05:31.060 --> 10:05:37.060
electrostatic field, electrostatic field. Remember inductors, they were

10:05:37.060 --> 10:05:45.060
electromagnetic. This is electrostatic. Electrostatic. Talk about that

10:05:45.060 --> 10:05:51.060
properly a little bit more in a bit. The letter C stands for capacitance. So inside

10:05:51.060 --> 10:05:59.060
a schematic diagram, if you see a letter C equals its capacitor. If you see C22,

10:05:59.060 --> 10:06:09.060
it's capacitor number 22 in the circuit. C47, capacitor number 47. A capacitor

10:06:09.060 --> 10:06:15.060
is a device that possesses a specific amount of capacitance. How these things

10:06:15.060 --> 10:06:22.060
are made are two conductors separated by an insulator. Two conductors separated

10:06:22.060 --> 10:06:28.060
by an insulator. What does that sound like the definition for? Close your eyes

10:06:28.060 --> 10:06:31.060
and think about it. Two conductors separated by an insulator. What does that

10:06:31.060 --> 10:06:39.060
sound like? Banner. You made that up, man. What would the definition of an

10:06:39.060 --> 10:06:47.060
extension cord be? Two conductors separated by an insulator. What would

10:06:47.060 --> 10:06:55.060
speaker wire be? Yeah, so you know what? There are going to be a lot of things

10:06:56.060 --> 10:07:03.060
that have capacitive properties because there are two electrical conductors

10:07:03.060 --> 10:07:08.060
separated by an insulator. And a lot of these things that have capacitance is

10:07:08.060 --> 10:07:14.060
stray capacitance and capacitance that we don't necessarily want. Engineers

10:07:14.060 --> 10:07:21.060
don't want, but we have to deal with it because it's two conductors separated

10:07:21.060 --> 10:07:25.060
by an insulator. Anytime you do that, you're going to end up with the property

10:07:25.060 --> 10:07:32.060
of capacitance. Anytime you coil up your welding wire, your welding leads,

10:07:32.060 --> 10:07:37.060
electro leads, you're going to create some inductive properties.

10:07:43.060 --> 10:07:46.060
Yup.

10:07:46.060 --> 10:07:54.060
Yup. And that actually, believe it or not, that style of twin lead antenna cable,

10:07:54.060 --> 10:07:59.060
it was some of the most efficient. When properly installed, it had higher

10:07:59.060 --> 10:08:05.060
efficiency than coaxial cable. The only thing is people would get that nice

10:08:05.060 --> 10:08:10.060
ribbon cable and then back in the day, growing up in Connecticut, we had aluminum

10:08:10.060 --> 10:08:15.060
windows and you'd run it through the window and slam the window down on it.

10:08:15.060 --> 10:08:19.060
There goes any advantage that you had. But when you use the proper standoffs

10:08:19.060 --> 10:08:24.060
and you use the proper bend radius and everything else directly to the back of

10:08:24.060 --> 10:08:29.060
the set that had higher efficiency, it would get more RF energy into the back

10:08:29.060 --> 10:08:36.060
of that television set than using coaxial cable. But it was two conductors

10:08:36.060 --> 10:08:43.060
separated by a thick dielectric, thick insulator material. So that's one of the

10:08:43.060 --> 10:08:46.060
things that really want you to come out of these lectures with is understanding

10:08:46.060 --> 10:08:52.060
that, you know, this is not a lecture about capacitors. It's a discussion about

10:08:52.060 --> 10:08:59.060
capacitance and capacitors. But the biggest thing is when you get into somebody

10:08:59.060 --> 10:09:05.060
advanced classes like Peter Welty and his PCB design class, it's one of the

10:09:05.060 --> 10:09:12.060
biggest challenges is determining stray capacitance inside a circuit.

10:09:12.060 --> 10:09:21.060
When we're physically trying to create capacitance, we're going to call the

10:09:21.060 --> 10:09:28.060
conductors plates. And we're going to call the insulator dielectric. So two plates

10:09:28.060 --> 10:09:35.060
separated by a dielectric. Now that, Mr. Carter, is the definition of a capacitor.

10:09:35.060 --> 10:09:41.060
Schematic diagram up at the top is a fixed capacitor, meaning what you see is

10:09:41.060 --> 10:09:53.060
what you get within tolerances, of course. Down below is a variable capacitor. There's

10:09:53.060 --> 10:09:57.060
actually different ways that they're going to be able to vary the capacitance. One is

10:09:57.060 --> 10:10:00.060
going to be varying the distance between the plates. We'll talk about this more in

10:10:00.060 --> 10:10:04.060
a bit. And the other is meshing the plates where they don't physically touch, but

10:10:04.060 --> 10:10:10.060
they're just closer proximity, more and closer proximity to each other, less and

10:10:10.060 --> 10:10:17.060
less proximity to each other. Make sense?

10:10:17.060 --> 10:10:27.060
Treat all capacitors as though they were charged. Never touch both leads of a

10:10:27.060 --> 10:10:36.060
capacitor with your hands. I've got a capacitor. Where the heck it went? I got to

10:10:36.060 --> 10:10:39.060
get my stash better organized. Stuff disappears on here. I actually had a

10:10:39.060 --> 10:10:44.060
student network for one of the biomedical companies, Medtronic, named the

10:10:44.060 --> 10:10:50.060
Starter. Jumper kits for when you die. It's great. I see them. They got like Costco,

10:10:50.060 --> 10:10:58.060
you know. You just got $680 worth of stuff in your cart at Costco. They revive you on

10:10:58.060 --> 10:11:05.060
the spot. Make sure you pay your bill. Airlines got them now. We're going to charge

10:11:05.060 --> 10:11:10.060
you $25 for that bag to check it. You know, you have a heart attack. They revive you.

10:11:10.060 --> 10:11:16.060
So let me die here. Anyway, had a student network there, evening student of mine,

10:11:16.060 --> 10:11:22.060
and he brought me a capacitor that was a key component in that. And right on the

10:11:22.060 --> 10:11:30.060
capacitor was a label. The energy stored in this device could be lethal. The energy

10:11:30.060 --> 10:11:35.060
stored in this device could be lethal. So if that capacitor is charged up and I

10:11:35.060 --> 10:11:42.060
toss it until you touch it, it'll kill you dead. Because you're building up all of

10:11:42.060 --> 10:11:47.060
that charge and then rapidly discharging it through your body, which is not designed

10:11:47.060 --> 10:11:52.060
to do. Capacitor can hold that charge potential indefinitely if it doesn't have

10:11:52.060 --> 10:11:59.060
a discharge path. A theoretically perfect capacitor will hold the charge forever.

10:11:59.060 --> 10:12:05.060
Because of manufacturing flaws and defects and stuff, eventually that current will

10:12:05.060 --> 10:12:12.060
dissipate. I remember when they were, I've been here for a while. Not when they were

10:12:12.060 --> 10:12:17.060
building this building. Not when they were building that building, the new one. Not

10:12:18.060 --> 10:12:23.060
when they were building this building, but when they were building that building, like

10:12:23.060 --> 10:12:28.060
20 years ago. And there's actually a time capsule buried out there somewhere. And they

10:12:28.060 --> 10:12:33.060
were looking for ideas from, you know, I'm like, let's charge up a capacitor and put it

10:12:33.060 --> 10:12:38.060
in the time capsule. I mean, as an electronics guy, I think that'd be cool. Like, great,

10:12:38.060 --> 10:12:43.060
let's take it out of its protective covering and see if any voltages still present. I

10:12:43.060 --> 10:12:47.060
mean, I would have gotten a kick out of there all looking at me like I'm a goofball, you

10:12:47.060 --> 10:12:50.060
know. I mean, I'll just think that would have been an outstanding freaking idea.

10:12:57.060 --> 10:13:04.060
Because of the chemicals, a chemical cell will eventually dissipate. So it has a

10:13:04.060 --> 10:13:12.060
shelf life. Lithium batteries have the longest shelf life. I mean, those, what are they,

10:13:12.060 --> 10:13:16.060
the Energizer, whatever that you could buy, Lithium, best batteries they could buy, very

10:13:16.060 --> 10:13:20.060
great product, innovative product, if you absolutely positively have to have a part of

10:13:20.060 --> 10:13:26.060
electronic device work operate under extreme temperature conditions, whatever. Great shelf

10:13:26.060 --> 10:13:31.060
life, use those batteries. So I just bought some and I think that it's good to the year

10:13:31.060 --> 10:13:35.060
2025 or something on it. It's like, wow, that's a shelf life.

10:13:36.060 --> 10:13:43.060
The basic unit of capacitance is the ferrad. A ferrad is the amount of capacitance that can

10:13:43.060 --> 10:13:51.060
store one coulomb. Remember the coulomb? 6.24 x 10 to the 18th electrons of charge when a

10:13:51.060 --> 10:13:56.060
capacitor is charged to one volt. So you've got a couple different things going on there.

10:13:56.060 --> 10:14:01.060
You've got these two plates and what you're doing is you're charging it and what it's

10:14:01.060 --> 10:14:09.060
doing is you're physically loading those plates up with a large number of electrons. And then

10:14:09.060 --> 10:14:15.060
you're building up an electrostatic field across those two plates. So when you build up

10:14:15.060 --> 10:14:21.060
one coulomb across the plates, we're able to store one coulomb of charge and bring the

10:14:21.060 --> 10:14:29.060
capacitor up to one volt, we call that a ferrad. Now, typically the most important thing

10:14:30.060 --> 10:14:36.060
that we're going to work with in electronics are going to be centered around the micro

10:14:36.060 --> 10:14:44.060
ferrad. The typical value of measurement of capacitance is the micro ferrad, which is

10:14:44.060 --> 10:14:52.060
times 10 to the negative 6th. And also the pico ferrad, which is times 10 to the negative

10:14:52.060 --> 10:15:04.060
12th. So we go from the 6th to the 12th. What's between 6 and 12? Nano. You know, for the

10:15:04.060 --> 10:15:08.060
longest time I used to put out in lecture, you will never see a nano ferrad capacitor

10:15:08.060 --> 10:15:12.060
because they didn't use to make nano ferrad. Actually, you know what they used to call

10:15:12.060 --> 10:15:23.060
nano ferrad capacitors? Millie micro. Millie micro. Three places past. Millie. No, micro.

10:15:23.060 --> 10:15:29.060
Millie micro. Three places past micro, which would be nano. So we call that, they'd call

10:15:29.060 --> 10:15:36.060
it millie micro ferrad, MMF, millie micro ferrad. Or they would call it tens of thousands

10:15:36.060 --> 10:15:46.060
of pico ferrad. I don't know if it was a small letter N that just like freaked them out. Seriously.

10:15:46.060 --> 10:15:51.060
I mean, sometimes it boils down to that. It was, you know, they'd have this congress that would meet

10:15:51.060 --> 10:15:56.060
and analyze this stuff and they just wouldn't. So I used to put it out in lecture. You will never

10:15:56.060 --> 10:16:00.060
see a nano ferrad capacitor. Whenever I put out absolute, somebody feels compelled to prove

10:16:00.060 --> 10:16:05.060
geogrenic wrong. So the next day I was doing, hey, you know, I found this, my company is

10:16:05.060 --> 10:16:10.060
using these. What's this? You know, it showed it to me. It was like a 20 nano ferrad capacitor.

10:16:10.060 --> 10:16:19.060
Great. You're doing it. It should be a 20,000 pico ferrad capacitor. Or a 20 millie micro

10:16:19.060 --> 10:16:29.060
ferrad capacitor. But, and I'm intentionally talking to you about this because traditionally

10:16:29.060 --> 10:16:35.060
capacitor values have been all over the place. As far as how they label them and how they

10:16:35.060 --> 10:16:45.060
identify them and sometimes determining what size capacitor is, it is, is very, very difficult.

10:16:45.060 --> 10:16:52.060
And what a manufacturer labels it as. I mean, resistors were easy with color code. Sometimes you got to

10:16:52.060 --> 10:16:56.060
trust the packaging on these things. What's up?

10:16:56.060 --> 10:17:01.060
Do you remember what the ferrad rating of the capacitor the guy brought in from the distributor was?

10:17:01.060 --> 10:17:02.060
No.

10:17:02.060 --> 10:17:04.060
Hi.

10:17:04.060 --> 10:17:12.060
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, enough to kill you. But yeah, you could really, don't do the stuff here.

10:17:12.060 --> 10:17:17.060
I mean, that's one of the things. Again, we take safety seriously. But some of those big

10:17:17.060 --> 10:17:22.060
capacities charge up, leave that there or, you know, in the Navy, which was different. We were

10:17:22.060 --> 10:17:27.060
government property, you know, always used to do that crap, you know, charge it up and say,

10:17:27.060 --> 10:17:36.060
hey, check this out, you know, here, catch. You know, stuff freaking hurt, man. It wasn't funny.

10:17:36.060 --> 10:17:40.060
Go up to somebody with a charge capacitor and stick it on their neck.

10:17:40.060 --> 10:17:53.060
Yeah, these people weren't trusted with our nuclear arsenal.

10:17:53.060 --> 10:17:58.060
Basically, that's a high discharge device. You're using capacitors and inductors in there to create a high

10:17:58.060 --> 10:18:07.060
voltage to make someone compliant.

10:18:07.060 --> 10:18:12.060
A capacitor is either fixed or variable. A fixed capacitor has a definite value that cannot be

10:18:12.060 --> 10:18:19.060
changed. It's made a certain way, if you will. A variable capacitor is one whose capacitance can be

10:18:19.060 --> 10:18:24.060
changed by varying the space between the plates or by varying the amount of meshing between two

10:18:24.060 --> 10:18:30.060
sets of plates. Although they say mesh, the plates never touch. They have to be kept electrically

10:18:30.060 --> 10:18:39.060
isolated with an insulator in between, and that insulator could be air.

10:18:39.060 --> 10:18:47.060
Factors affecting capacitance. Now, this is kind of important to understand these. If you understand these,

10:18:47.060 --> 10:18:59.060
the math makes a lot of sense. The area of the plates, right? The bigger the area, well, actually,

10:18:59.060 --> 10:19:08.060
let me put that formula up on the board. C is equal to Q over V. Remember that? Capacitance

10:19:08.060 --> 10:19:14.060
measured in Farads is equal to Coulomb brought to a volt. One Coulomb brought to one volt equals

10:19:14.060 --> 10:19:20.060
one Farad. It makes sense. So, area of the plate. What effect is that going to have? Is that going to

10:19:20.060 --> 10:19:26.060
affect Q or is that going to affect V? Q. The bigger the plate, the more electrons that could

10:19:26.060 --> 10:19:32.060
park on the plate physically, right? Because even though electrons are electrons, they still take up

10:19:32.060 --> 10:19:39.060
space. They still are comprised of matter. So, very good. So, the bigger the plates, what effect

10:19:39.060 --> 10:19:50.060
does that have on capacitance? Bigger plate? More capacitance. Smaller plate? Smaller

10:19:50.060 --> 10:19:58.060
capacitance, right? Because Q and C are directly proportional, right? Because Q is sitting up on

10:19:58.060 --> 10:20:05.060
top of this here. Distance between the plates. Distance between the plates. What's that going to

10:20:05.060 --> 10:20:17.060
affect? So, what's that going to affect? Q or V? Think of the distance between the plates as like

10:20:17.060 --> 10:20:23.060
regapping a spark plug. That's the distance between the electrodes. This is the distance between the

10:20:23.060 --> 10:20:30.060
plates. The further that you move those plates away from each other, the higher the voltage you could

10:20:30.060 --> 10:20:36.060
store on those plates. And that's where engineers have to determine what am I trying to do here? Am I

10:20:36.060 --> 10:20:43.060
trying to store a lot of electrons? Am I trying to, you know, have a high voltage that I'm trying to

10:20:43.060 --> 10:20:51.060
build up across it? What am I trying to do? So, engineers have to take that into account. So, if I

10:20:51.060 --> 10:20:59.060
separate the two plates, that means my voltage that I could store will go up. If my voltage goes up,

10:20:59.060 --> 10:21:06.060
what's my capacitance going to do? It's going to drop. So, engineers are faced with this compromise.

10:21:06.060 --> 10:21:11.060
Higher voltage I could store, but I'm going to get less capacitance out of it. Why is capacitance

10:21:11.060 --> 10:21:16.060
going to go down too? Well, when I separate those plates, that electrostatic field is going to diminish

10:21:16.060 --> 10:21:23.060
because the plates are physically further away from each other. So, you separate the plates, get a

10:21:23.060 --> 10:21:29.060
higher voltage on it, higher voltage, lower the capacitance. The type of dielectric material,

10:21:29.060 --> 10:21:36.060
what effect is that going to have? Or what's that going to affect? There's a type of dielectric

10:21:36.060 --> 10:21:50.060
material. Is that going to affect the Q or the V? Or the C? Well, I think it's going to affect the C.

10:21:50.060 --> 10:22:03.060
Yeah. Why? Because of Q or V. Think about this one. What's it going to affect? Q, B, Z.

10:22:03.060 --> 10:22:18.060
It's going to affect the voltage. Because if I've got two plates separated by air, and then now instead

10:22:18.060 --> 10:22:27.060
of the air, I slip in a piece of mica. Mica has a higher dielectric constant than air, does it not?

10:22:27.060 --> 10:22:32.060
Remember what I, you guys are deceiving me, man. Remember those lectures, early in the quarter?

10:22:32.060 --> 10:22:37.060
We talked about different types of insulators. Mica was at the top of the chart. So, if I slip a piece

10:22:37.060 --> 10:22:41.060
of mica between those two plates now, I could actually have those plates real close to each other

10:22:41.060 --> 10:22:48.060
and slip some mica in there and really get a high voltage across those plates. Get a higher voltage

10:22:48.060 --> 10:22:57.060
for the distance, because I'm using a dielectric material that has better dielectric properties.

10:22:57.060 --> 10:23:04.060
So, that's how that's going to affect V. Effect V, it's going to affect C. And then temperature.

10:23:04.060 --> 10:23:13.060
How is temperature going to affect this?

10:23:13.060 --> 10:23:28.060
What changes with temperature? Yeah, but we're not talking about resistance here, so.

10:23:28.060 --> 10:23:33.060
It's actually simpler than that. Something probably that you all knew even before you walked in here.

10:23:33.060 --> 10:23:41.060
Things expand and contract with temperature. That's why there's expansion joints on bridges.

10:23:41.060 --> 10:23:48.060
Because bridges expand and contract, and if not, they'd break. Oh no, it got over 70 degrees today.

10:23:48.060 --> 10:23:53.060
The bridge broke. No, expansion joints, because things expand and contract.

10:23:53.060 --> 10:24:01.060
Capacitors are going to expand and contract. So, as the plates expand, it can hold or affect Q

10:24:01.060 --> 10:24:09.060
as the distance between the two changes, it's going to affect V. So, the bottom line is the amount of capacitance

10:24:09.060 --> 10:24:17.060
will vary with temperature. For some circuits, like at room temperature, it's not that big of a deal.

10:24:17.060 --> 10:24:24.060
For some stuff, I don't think in your wildest hallucinations, you've ever really thought it through

10:24:24.060 --> 10:24:32.060
where a lot of electronic systems are used. I mean, it's a pretty harsh environment.

10:24:32.060 --> 10:24:41.060
My favorite aircraft of all time, military aircraft, of all time, I just get so jazzed when I see one,

10:24:41.060 --> 10:24:49.060
is the F-15 Fighting Falcon. These things were designed as high-altitude interceptors.

10:24:49.060 --> 10:24:55.060
The closest to us right here are Portland, Oregon, the Oregon Air National Guard.

10:24:55.060 --> 10:25:00.060
So, if you've ever flown commercially in and out of Portland or been down there, you might be on an Alaska Airlines jet

10:25:00.060 --> 10:25:06.060
that has to give way to two F-15s that are taken off in front of you.

10:25:06.060 --> 10:25:15.060
The F-15 still holds the unclassified time-to-climb record, 45,000 feet in one minute.

10:25:15.060 --> 10:25:21.060
That basically means you're sitting at the end of the runway at Portland International Airport.

10:25:21.060 --> 10:25:27.060
They give you the thumbs up, clear for takeoff. You advance the throttle as you kick in the afterburner.

10:25:27.060 --> 10:25:33.060
And next thing, one minute later, 60 seconds later, you're passing through 45,000 feet.

10:25:33.060 --> 10:25:37.060
These things are so good, they used them last summer when President Obama was in town.

10:25:37.060 --> 10:25:41.060
And there was a small plane that penetrated the airspace up here.

10:25:41.060 --> 10:25:45.060
The guy was flying into Kenmore in a float plane.

10:25:45.060 --> 10:25:50.060
And they're watching them on radar, and they got concerned.

10:25:50.060 --> 10:25:53.060
So, they called up the Oregon Air National Guard, and they said,

10:25:53.060 --> 10:25:56.060
we know you've got a couple of fighters there and ready to stand by.

10:25:56.060 --> 10:26:00.060
I think it's time to scramble them. And these guys were like, woo-hoo!

10:26:00.060 --> 10:26:06.060
Because what they did is they not only got to take off, but they got to go supersonic.

10:26:06.060 --> 10:26:10.060
They had to go on an intercept call. So, what they did is they went supersonic.

10:26:10.060 --> 10:26:17.060
I'm sure you all heard about it, with the windows getting knocked out and the sonic booms.

10:26:17.060 --> 10:26:24.060
Where I'm going with this, though, is imagine that airplane sitting on the runway down there in the middle of summer.

10:26:24.060 --> 10:26:29.060
Sitting on the tarmac, 115, 120 degrees.

10:26:29.060 --> 10:26:35.060
And then 60 seconds later, he's at 45,000 feet, where it's negative 45.

10:26:35.060 --> 10:26:41.060
If electronics are not all in heated areas of that aircraft,

10:26:41.060 --> 10:26:47.060
so if you've got a capacitor that is in an area that is prone to temperature change,

10:26:47.060 --> 10:26:49.060
you're going to get different results.

10:26:49.060 --> 10:26:53.060
Hopefully, that's not part of a targeting system on that aircraft,

10:26:53.060 --> 10:26:57.060
where all of a sudden, you know, the military is smarter than that.

10:26:57.060 --> 10:27:04.060
The reason temperature that it always strikes a chord with me, I was not always the best student.

10:27:05.060 --> 10:27:08.060
Especially when I was in a lot of military schools.

10:27:08.060 --> 10:27:12.060
I went to over 4500 hours of military schools, different systems.

10:27:12.060 --> 10:27:15.060
I was in a great position, because as soon as the Russians came up with something,

10:27:15.060 --> 10:27:19.060
we had to come up with something to detect it and counter it, and I was constantly in school.

10:27:19.060 --> 10:27:24.060
I traveled to 46 of the 50 states on official business going to school, a lot of factory schools, a lot of stuff.

10:27:24.060 --> 10:27:28.060
Long schools, and it was not a school day like yours. These are 8-hour days.

10:27:28.060 --> 10:27:31.060
8-hour days, 5 days a week.

10:27:31.060 --> 10:27:36.060
And it was back in the day, old school, so we used to go out for liquid lunches.

10:27:40.060 --> 10:27:45.060
I used to sit in the back, and I was sitting there one day, and I'm like, you know,

10:27:45.060 --> 10:27:48.060
falling asleep and hopefully not snoring too loud.

10:27:48.060 --> 10:27:51.060
And I wake up, and the instructor is showing me this, you know,

10:27:51.060 --> 10:27:57.060
they have the presentation, and they had, not PowerPoint, they had the view foils.

10:27:57.060 --> 10:28:01.060
And they're showing this oven-ready light coming on.

10:28:01.060 --> 10:28:06.060
And I'm like, oven-ready light, oven-ready light.

10:28:06.060 --> 10:28:11.060
I like, I'm in electronic intercept and analysis.

10:28:11.060 --> 10:28:15.060
Why is he talking about an oven-ready light coming on?

10:28:15.060 --> 10:28:19.060
I mean, if this is like, I picked the wrong time to wake up,

10:28:19.060 --> 10:28:22.060
because I don't have a freaking clue what he's talking about.

10:28:22.060 --> 10:28:25.060
An oven-ready light, and I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it.

10:28:25.060 --> 10:28:29.060
And actually what happened is this equipment was so sensitive,

10:28:29.060 --> 10:28:35.060
it was very secret special equipment for measuring these very specific emissions from Soviet equipment,

10:28:35.060 --> 10:28:43.060
that they put key sensitive temperature components in what was called an oven.

10:28:43.060 --> 10:28:49.060
And what it was is a small metal box inside the piece of equipment.

10:28:49.060 --> 10:28:53.060
And it had a heating coil, and it had a thermostat,

10:28:53.060 --> 10:28:57.060
and it would keep that temperature stable,

10:28:57.060 --> 10:29:01.060
so that the readings would be stable.

10:29:01.060 --> 10:29:05.060
And if that oven-ready light was not on,

10:29:05.060 --> 10:29:08.060
that told the technician that the oven wasn't on,

10:29:08.060 --> 10:29:12.060
and the numbers, the results, could not be trusted.

10:29:12.060 --> 10:29:15.060
So that was a big thing before you use that equipment,

10:29:15.060 --> 10:29:17.060
is verifying that oven-ready light was on.

10:29:17.060 --> 10:29:20.060
It was like, it's funny, because even though I slept through the lecture,

10:29:20.060 --> 10:29:23.060
I still remember it like it happened yesterday.

10:29:23.060 --> 10:29:26.060
This is not an endorsement to fall asleep in class.

10:29:26.060 --> 10:29:29.060
But it was a blue light, it was this blue light.

10:29:29.060 --> 10:29:31.060
And I always remember, because I'll tell you what,

10:29:31.060 --> 10:29:34.060
we had, our labs were written tests,

10:29:34.060 --> 10:29:37.060
and then we had practical labs that you had to go in and troubleshoot that equipment.

10:29:37.060 --> 10:29:40.060
And I remember that the day I went into, you know,

10:29:40.060 --> 10:29:42.060
I was basically being evaluated.

10:29:42.060 --> 10:29:44.060
I had two instructors standing in there with clipboards,

10:29:44.060 --> 10:29:48.060
and you know, let's see how Petty Officer Greenock evaluates this problem here.

10:29:48.060 --> 10:29:54.060
So I walked in, and the first thing I noticed is the blue oven-ready light was not on.

10:29:54.060 --> 10:29:57.060
So I knew immediately where the problem was.

10:29:57.060 --> 10:30:01.060
And I, you know, I told them, oven-ready light's not on.

10:30:01.060 --> 10:30:03.060
There's a problem with that circuitry, it got in there,

10:30:03.060 --> 10:30:05.060
and basically it was like a fuse that was blown,

10:30:05.060 --> 10:30:08.060
replace the fuse, boom, fix the problem.

10:30:08.060 --> 10:30:11.060
If you're not a vigilant technician paying attention to that,

10:30:11.060 --> 10:30:17.060
oh yeah, you could run through all the tests, oh everything's working okay.

10:30:17.060 --> 10:30:25.060
So some key components like capacitors that are in real critical roles in circuits

10:30:25.060 --> 10:30:29.060
may be put in a circuit or in a box called an oven

10:30:29.060 --> 10:30:32.060
where they keep that temperature really stable.

10:30:32.060 --> 10:30:35.060
For most stuff like this, you know, inside buildings and, you know,

10:30:35.060 --> 10:30:39.060
whatever industrial controls, it's normally not an issue.

10:30:39.060 --> 10:30:43.060
Normally even an automotive application, I've never heard about anybody, you know.

10:30:43.060 --> 10:30:48.060
And actually cars are pretty freaking robust when you think about it.

10:30:48.060 --> 10:30:53.060
I mean from, you know, I've been down in Arizona in the summer, you know,

10:30:53.060 --> 10:30:59.060
it's like stuff is melting, plastic is melting, you know,

10:30:59.060 --> 10:31:03.060
tires are melting on the cars, just nuts, you know.

10:31:03.060 --> 10:31:06.060
And I went up to Alaska here in February,

10:31:06.060 --> 10:31:11.060
and you know, that was like the week before I was up there, it was negative 47.

10:31:11.060 --> 10:31:15.060
So you go to Fairbanks Airport, you land, you're going to rent a car,

10:31:15.060 --> 10:31:19.060
and it's buried in snow, but you just follow the extension cord from the post

10:31:19.060 --> 10:31:22.060
and it's all on a block heater, you dust it all off.

10:31:22.060 --> 10:31:25.060
It's all powder snow up there because it's so cold and so dry.

10:31:25.060 --> 10:31:27.060
Turn the key, fire it up.

10:31:27.060 --> 10:31:30.060
Every place you go, the hotel's all have a place to plug into though,

10:31:30.060 --> 10:31:34.060
I mean it's just, you know, but still that extreme cold is like, wow,

10:31:34.060 --> 10:31:40.060
the electronics work reasonably well from Arizona to Alaska.

10:31:41.060 --> 10:31:45.060
Keep these four factors in mind, they're critical.

10:31:45.060 --> 10:31:50.060
Dielectric constant, this is the measure of the effectiveness of a material as an insulator.

10:31:50.060 --> 10:31:55.060
Some materials of dielectric constant, paper, has a dielectric constant between two and three.

10:31:55.060 --> 10:31:59.060
Typically what they're talking about here is wax paper.

10:31:59.060 --> 10:32:04.060
Wax paper, wax paper used to be used as the dielectric, as the insulator

10:32:04.060 --> 10:32:08.060
in a lot of capacitors prior to World War II.

10:32:08.060 --> 10:32:12.060
I've actually restored many an antique radio by simply going in,

10:32:12.060 --> 10:32:15.060
removing the paper caps that have deteriorated,

10:32:15.060 --> 10:32:19.060
and putting in mica caps of the same value.

10:32:19.060 --> 10:32:21.060
Right, just that easy, remove it.

10:32:21.060 --> 10:32:25.060
Everybody always gets an old radio, and oh yeah, it must be them, they're tubes.

10:32:25.060 --> 10:32:29.060
Them tubes there need to be replaced.

10:32:29.060 --> 10:32:32.060
Every start a handful of radios haven't replaced one tube.

10:32:32.060 --> 10:32:36.060
Got in there, replaced the capacitors, why paper capacitors?

10:32:36.060 --> 10:32:39.060
What happens to paper over time, deteriorates?

10:32:39.060 --> 10:32:44.060
If deteriorates, loses its dielectric constant, capacitor shorts out, doesn't work.

10:32:44.060 --> 10:32:50.060
Micah, dielectric constant between five and six.

10:32:50.060 --> 10:32:54.060
This should be tantalum, not titanium.

10:32:54.060 --> 10:33:00.060
Titanium, they're using that in golf clubs, in Soviet submarines.

10:33:00.060 --> 10:33:02.060
This is tantalum.

10:33:02.060 --> 10:33:06.060
Tantalum is a material that has a high dielectric property.

10:33:06.060 --> 10:33:11.060
So by putting it in a tantalum capacitor, it gives you a big bang for the buck.

10:33:11.060 --> 10:33:16.060
Some of the best capacitors that money will buy, tantalum.

10:33:16.060 --> 10:33:20.060
Electrolytic capacitors, these are large capacitance for size and weight.

10:33:20.060 --> 10:33:24.060
Consist of two metal foils separated by fine gauze saturated with a chemical paste

10:33:24.060 --> 10:33:27.060
called an electrolyte.

10:33:27.060 --> 10:33:31.060
They're polarized, having a positive and negative lead.

10:33:31.060 --> 10:33:41.060
If you put an electrolytic capacitor into a circuit backwards, it will explode.

10:33:41.060 --> 10:33:44.060
Literally.

10:33:44.060 --> 10:33:48.060
If you put one of these in a circuit backwards, it will explode.

10:33:48.060 --> 10:33:55.060
Some of the smaller caps actually have, where like there's an X etched on the top

10:33:55.060 --> 10:34:00.060
so when it blows, it'll blow outward and not necessarily build.

10:34:00.060 --> 10:34:04.060
I knew a guy that played around with explosives and stuff in the past.

10:34:04.060 --> 10:34:06.060
It's all about keeping it compressed.

10:34:06.060 --> 10:34:10.060
Those gases are compressed and it's going to give you a bigger bang.

10:34:10.060 --> 10:34:13.060
Some of those small caps that don't have a little release mechanism on it,

10:34:13.060 --> 10:34:15.060
you can throw some shrapnel.

10:34:15.060 --> 10:34:18.060
Some of the big caps actually have a release valve on it.

10:34:18.060 --> 10:34:20.060
So if you put it in backwards, pow.

10:34:20.060 --> 10:34:23.060
But I've seen smoke pouring out on like a smoke bomb.

10:34:23.060 --> 10:34:26.060
If you ever want to blow up caps, let Peter and myself know.

10:34:26.060 --> 10:34:29.060
And we want to do it in a controlled, contained environment.

10:34:29.060 --> 10:34:31.060
You just do it for kicks in the lab.

10:34:31.060 --> 10:34:33.060
Somebody could lose an eye. Seriously.

10:34:33.060 --> 10:34:36.060
You know, there's a little metal cans and you put it in backwards.

10:34:36.060 --> 10:34:38.060
These things blow.

10:34:38.060 --> 10:34:41.060
Shrapnel is going to go flying.

10:34:41.060 --> 10:34:43.060
You guys actually have to pull the area?

10:34:43.060 --> 10:34:46.060
I've done it before out in the back.

10:34:46.060 --> 10:34:49.060
You know, we rope off an area and it was actually funny.

10:34:49.060 --> 10:34:51.060
We were doing that one evening, years ago.

10:34:51.060 --> 10:34:53.060
Blown up capacitors, you know.

10:34:53.060 --> 10:34:55.060
And pow, pow, pow.

10:34:55.060 --> 10:34:59.060
Put them in series of parallel and doing all kinds of wacky stuff, you know.

10:34:59.060 --> 10:35:05.060
And literally, I had, we were doing it in the back here.

10:35:05.060 --> 10:35:08.060
And you know the second floor up above the restaurant,

10:35:08.060 --> 10:35:11.060
that patio area between the two buildings?

10:35:11.060 --> 10:35:14.060
I had debris raining down on that.

10:35:14.060 --> 10:35:19.060
So nobody really cared about it until I went to the custodians

10:35:19.060 --> 10:35:24.060
and I asked for like some, you know, brooms and stuff to clean it up.

10:35:24.060 --> 10:35:27.060
And then it was kind of like, well, they all got puzzled and stuff

10:35:27.060 --> 10:35:29.060
because they were like, oh, union here?

10:35:29.060 --> 10:35:32.060
And they were like, if it's a mess, you know, we need to clean it up.

10:35:32.060 --> 10:35:35.060
It's like, well, my students made this freaking huge mess out here

10:35:35.060 --> 10:35:36.060
from blowing up crap.

10:35:36.060 --> 10:35:38.060
No, no, we'll clean it up, you know.

10:35:38.060 --> 10:35:41.060
Oh, I'm sorry, you know, it's file of grievance

10:35:41.060 --> 10:35:44.060
because we're going to clean up the mess we made, you know.

10:35:44.060 --> 10:35:45.060
It was just an odd time.

10:35:45.060 --> 10:35:48.060
I guess it's still an odd time, you know, here.

10:35:48.060 --> 10:35:51.060
But my personal collection of capacitors.

10:35:51.060 --> 10:35:53.060
These are all electrolytic capacitors.

10:35:53.060 --> 10:35:56.060
And on the electrolytic capacitors,

10:35:56.060 --> 10:35:58.060
you've got to look for the markings here

10:35:58.060 --> 10:36:00.060
to find which lead is the negative lead

10:36:00.060 --> 10:36:02.060
and which one's the positive lead.

10:36:02.060 --> 10:36:05.060
And there will be some discerning mark on it.

10:36:05.060 --> 10:36:07.060
Some manufacturers identify the negative lead,

10:36:07.060 --> 10:36:09.060
some identify the positive lead.

10:36:09.060 --> 10:36:11.060
You just got to pay particular attention.

10:36:11.060 --> 10:36:13.060
This here, like with the band on it,

10:36:13.060 --> 10:36:15.060
that would signify the negative lead.

10:36:15.060 --> 10:36:17.060
See that solid band?

10:36:17.060 --> 10:36:20.060
You just got to look and be observant.

10:36:20.060 --> 10:36:22.060
Put it in backwards.

10:36:22.060 --> 10:36:25.060
It will explode.

10:36:25.060 --> 10:36:29.060
Paper and plastic caps, construction by a rolled foil technique.

10:36:29.060 --> 10:36:33.060
Plastic film is often used more often.

10:36:33.060 --> 10:36:37.060
Basically, if you went and got two rolls of aluminum foil

10:36:37.060 --> 10:36:42.060
and a roll of wax paper or a roll of saran wrap, right,

10:36:42.060 --> 10:36:45.060
laid out one roll, put the insulator on top of it,

10:36:45.060 --> 10:36:47.060
laid the other roll out, we rolled it all up,

10:36:47.060 --> 10:36:49.060
dipped it in wax, attached leads to it,

10:36:49.060 --> 10:36:54.060
dipped it in wax, you just made yourself a capacitor.

10:36:54.060 --> 10:36:57.060
So if you want to roll your own, you can roll your own.

10:36:57.060 --> 10:37:00.060
You make it out of paper, same thing.

10:37:00.060 --> 10:37:03.060
And that's exactly what paper caps were.

10:37:03.060 --> 10:37:07.060
Two pieces of foil with wax paper between them,

10:37:07.060 --> 10:37:11.060
the leads attached, dipped in wax.

10:37:11.060 --> 10:37:15.060
And that wax didn't prevent that paper

10:37:15.060 --> 10:37:19.060
from deteriorating over time.

10:37:19.060 --> 10:37:22.060
These are plastic caps here.

10:37:22.060 --> 10:37:25.060
Basically, if you sliced that open with an exacto knife,

10:37:25.060 --> 10:37:29.060
you'd find nothing but rolls of aluminum foil

10:37:29.060 --> 10:37:33.060
wrapped around plastic.

10:37:33.060 --> 10:37:35.060
Ceramic disc capacitors are popular

10:37:35.060 --> 10:37:37.060
because they're inexpensive to produce.

10:37:37.060 --> 10:37:40.060
They're used for values 0.1 microfarad and smaller.

10:37:40.060 --> 10:37:42.060
Ceramic is the dielectric.

10:37:42.060 --> 10:37:46.060
They're reliable general-purpose capacitors.

10:37:46.060 --> 10:37:50.060
This is my personal collection.

10:37:50.060 --> 10:37:55.060
I get all my ceramics from Mexico.

10:37:55.060 --> 10:38:00.060
A lot of them manufactured there.

10:38:00.060 --> 10:38:05.060
It's not electrolytic.

10:38:05.060 --> 10:38:09.060
Ceramic, these don't have a positive or negative lead.

10:38:09.060 --> 10:38:14.060
It's only the electrolytic that does.

10:38:14.060 --> 10:38:15.060
Check out the value of this.

10:38:15.060 --> 10:38:17.060
This is 3KV.

10:38:17.060 --> 10:38:19.060
It'll hand up to 3,000 volts.

10:38:19.060 --> 10:38:22.060
You exceed that, you destroy the capacitor.

10:38:22.060 --> 10:38:27.060
You operate all day long underneath that.

10:38:27.060 --> 10:38:29.060
Variable capacitors are also known as

10:38:29.060 --> 10:38:34.060
patterns, tremors, or tuners.

10:38:34.060 --> 10:38:37.060
This is a tuning capacitor.

10:38:37.060 --> 10:38:46.060
This is something you'd find in a 1960s, 50s, 60s, 70s radio.

10:38:46.060 --> 10:38:49.060
Elegant.

10:38:49.060 --> 10:38:50.060
Elegant in design.

10:38:50.060 --> 10:38:53.060
They don't make stuff like this no more.

10:38:53.060 --> 10:38:57.060
How many of these went to the landfill?

10:38:57.060 --> 10:38:59.060
A lot of these, the shaft right here,

10:38:59.060 --> 10:39:03.060
this would actually be a ball bearing movement right there

10:39:03.060 --> 10:39:04.060
with a heavy grease in there,

10:39:04.060 --> 10:39:06.060
and you turn it ever so slightly.

10:39:06.060 --> 10:39:08.060
And actually what they would do with this,

10:39:08.060 --> 10:39:10.060
they'd put a big pulley on here,

10:39:10.060 --> 10:39:14.060
and then there'd be a string that was attached to your tuning dial.

10:39:14.060 --> 10:39:16.060
So when you move that knob just a little bit,

10:39:16.060 --> 10:39:19.060
it would ever so slightly move that tuning cap.

10:39:19.060 --> 10:39:21.060
And that's how you would adjust,

10:39:21.060 --> 10:39:25.060
by adjusting the capacitance, you would tune your radio.

10:39:25.060 --> 10:39:29.060
Now it's done all electronically.

10:39:29.060 --> 10:39:36.060
So this is something kind of from a bygone era.

10:39:36.060 --> 10:39:40.060
Which is good and bad in some ways, I don't know.

10:39:40.060 --> 10:39:44.060
I don't think these new tuners have the sensitivity

10:39:44.060 --> 10:39:45.060
that those old tuners had.

10:39:45.060 --> 10:39:47.060
And I saw the transition of the military.

10:39:47.060 --> 10:39:50.060
When I first got into electronic intelligence gathering,

10:39:50.060 --> 10:39:52.060
they were manually operated tuners.

10:39:52.060 --> 10:39:56.060
I used to have to sit there and manually tune through,

10:39:56.060 --> 10:40:00.060
find a target of interest, intercept the analyzer.

10:40:00.060 --> 10:40:03.060
I saw the transition to computer operated systems,

10:40:03.060 --> 10:40:05.060
and it boggled my mind.

10:40:05.060 --> 10:40:07.060
I was actually, I rode my submarine out here,

10:40:07.060 --> 10:40:09.060
and my sub was going to get a new system.

10:40:09.060 --> 10:40:12.060
So I rode it here, the work was being done in Bremerton,

10:40:12.060 --> 10:40:14.060
then they flew me back to Connecticut for the summer.

10:40:14.060 --> 10:40:15.060
I actually drove.

10:40:15.060 --> 10:40:18.060
It was kind of funny, I used to tell the Navy I had a fear of flying.

10:40:18.060 --> 10:40:19.060
That's why I'm in the Navy.

10:40:19.060 --> 10:40:22.060
So because I rode to so many schools,

10:40:22.060 --> 10:40:24.060
they would always, they'd pay me to travel.

10:40:24.060 --> 10:40:27.060
So it was like, I don't know, 300 miles a day,

10:40:27.060 --> 10:40:29.060
per diem and hotels and whatever.

10:40:29.060 --> 10:40:34.060
So I used to get like 14 days off the drive to Connecticut.

10:40:34.060 --> 10:40:37.060
So I'd like go to San Diego and goof off for a week and a half.

10:40:37.060 --> 10:40:43.060
And I like marathon across the country or whatever, you know.

10:40:43.060 --> 10:40:46.060
But anyway, I was getting sent to this school

10:40:46.060 --> 10:40:50.060
where there's going to be computer controlled receivers.

10:40:50.060 --> 10:40:53.060
And my computer controlled receivers,

10:40:53.060 --> 10:40:56.060
I mean, it was like, it's like some robotic arm is going to come out

10:40:56.060 --> 10:40:58.060
and like tune the dial.

10:40:58.060 --> 10:41:00.060
I mean, how do you do that?

10:41:00.060 --> 10:41:01.060
I mean, I'm serious.

10:41:01.060 --> 10:41:04.060
I was just, I had no freaking clue what they were talking about.

10:41:04.060 --> 10:41:08.060
And that's not what they were talking about.

10:41:08.060 --> 10:41:12.060
But I just don't think we ever had the sensitivity

10:41:12.060 --> 10:41:15.060
that those old manual tuners had.

10:41:15.060 --> 10:41:18.060
The newer systems, of course, were much more efficient.

10:41:18.060 --> 10:41:20.060
And they, you know, once you integrate computers,

10:41:20.060 --> 10:41:21.060
you can process the data.

10:41:21.060 --> 10:41:24.060
The data is only getting processed as well as it was programmed.

10:41:24.060 --> 10:41:31.060
But yeah, those old tuners, boy, I could listen to some stuff way out,

10:41:31.060 --> 10:41:32.060
way out there.

10:41:32.060 --> 10:41:34.060
We'd be a way to heck out in the middle of nowhere

10:41:34.060 --> 10:41:38.060
and I could tune stuff in with a good antenna and good receiver.

10:41:38.060 --> 10:41:40.060
Series capacitors.

10:41:40.060 --> 10:41:42.060
Yeah, you're not looking at a tight ball.

10:41:42.060 --> 10:41:50.060
When you have capacitors in series, you treat them like resistors in parallel.

10:41:50.060 --> 10:41:53.060
Does anybody know why that is?

10:41:53.060 --> 10:41:58.060
Why do you suppose?

10:41:58.060 --> 10:42:04.060
It's a good try.

10:42:04.060 --> 10:42:09.060
Okay, these three capacitors are in series, are they not?

10:42:09.060 --> 10:42:11.060
What am I really limited to here?

10:42:11.060 --> 10:42:15.060
I'm limited to this plate area here, am I not?

10:42:15.060 --> 10:42:18.060
And this plate area here.

10:42:18.060 --> 10:42:21.060
What am I actually doing?

10:42:21.060 --> 10:42:23.060
I'm increasing the distance between the plates,

10:42:23.060 --> 10:42:25.060
which means that my voltage goes up,

10:42:25.060 --> 10:42:28.060
that means my capacitance has to go down.

10:42:28.060 --> 10:42:29.060
Makes sense?

10:42:29.060 --> 10:42:33.060
That's why that formula works.

10:42:33.060 --> 10:42:39.060
Plus, I got now, I've gotten one, two, three times the insulated material,

10:42:39.060 --> 10:42:41.060
as opposed to one time the insulated material.

10:42:41.060 --> 10:42:42.060
Makes sense?

10:42:42.060 --> 10:42:45.060
So everything always goes back to this formula.

10:42:45.060 --> 10:42:47.060
Everything in electronics always is explained away with the formula.

10:42:47.060 --> 10:42:59.060
In parallel...

10:42:59.060 --> 10:43:02.060
What am I doing here?

10:43:02.060 --> 10:43:05.060
I've got this plate, this plate, and this plate.

10:43:05.060 --> 10:43:09.060
Now here, I triple the size of my plates.

10:43:09.060 --> 10:43:14.060
I triple the size of my electrostatic field that I could build up across the two.

10:43:14.060 --> 10:43:15.060
So what am I doing?

10:43:15.060 --> 10:43:21.060
I'm increasing my Q, which increases my C.

10:43:21.060 --> 10:43:24.060
That's why that formula works.

10:43:24.060 --> 10:43:26.060
So, I don't know if that helps you,

10:43:26.060 --> 10:43:29.060
but it helps me remember formulas if I understand how the formula works.

10:43:29.060 --> 10:43:34.060
If I just give you a formula, C is equal to Q over V.

10:43:34.060 --> 10:43:36.060
Okay, I'll remember that.

10:43:36.060 --> 10:43:38.060
That's not going to do you any good.

10:43:38.060 --> 10:43:40.060
If you remember, C is equal to Q over V.

10:43:40.060 --> 10:43:42.060
Increase the area of the plates.

10:43:42.060 --> 10:43:44.060
I could store more Q.

10:43:44.060 --> 10:43:45.060
Q goes up.

10:43:45.060 --> 10:43:48.060
C goes up.

10:43:48.060 --> 10:43:51.060
Distance between the plates increases.

10:43:51.060 --> 10:43:52.060
V goes up.

10:43:52.060 --> 10:43:53.060
C goes down.

10:43:53.060 --> 10:43:55.060
Inverse proportional relationship.

10:43:55.060 --> 10:43:57.060
Makes sense?

10:43:57.060 --> 10:44:03.060
RC time constant reflects the time required for a capacitor to charge 63.2% of the applied voltage

10:44:03.060 --> 10:44:06.060
or to discharge down 63.2%.

10:44:06.060 --> 10:44:08.060
It's not a tight boat.

10:44:08.060 --> 10:44:10.060
It's the way I worded it intentionally on this slide.

10:44:10.060 --> 10:44:13.060
You're decreasing down 63.2%.

10:44:13.060 --> 10:44:20.060
236.8%.

10:44:20.060 --> 10:44:22.060
This is what the circuit's going to look like.

10:44:22.060 --> 10:44:23.060
This is the formula.

10:44:23.060 --> 10:44:25.060
T is equal to R times C.

10:44:25.060 --> 10:44:27.060
It's going to take five time constants.

10:44:27.060 --> 10:44:30.060
And physically, what's happening with this?

10:44:30.060 --> 10:44:33.060
What kind of circuit is this?

10:44:33.060 --> 10:44:34.060
Series.

10:44:34.060 --> 10:44:37.060
Series RC circuit.

10:44:37.060 --> 10:44:39.060
It's a series RC circuit.

10:44:39.060 --> 10:44:44.060
And when I close this switch, this capacitor here is going to be at zero volts,

10:44:44.060 --> 10:44:48.060
and it's going to start charging up to 100%.

10:44:48.060 --> 10:44:51.060
How long is it going to take to get to 100%?

10:44:51.060 --> 10:44:53.060
Five time constants.

10:44:53.060 --> 10:44:56.060
How do I figure out what one time constant is equal to?

10:44:56.060 --> 10:44:58.060
T is equal to R times C.

10:44:58.060 --> 10:45:07.060
When this capacitor is at 100%, what voltage is going to be across R1?

10:45:08.060 --> 10:45:13.060
When capacitor C1 is at 100% after the passage of five time constants,

10:45:13.060 --> 10:45:16.060
what voltage is going to be present across R1?

10:45:16.060 --> 10:45:17.060
Zero.

10:45:17.060 --> 10:45:19.060
Zero.

10:45:19.060 --> 10:45:28.060
When 63.2% of the voltage is across C1, where's the remaining voltage going to be?

10:45:28.060 --> 10:45:29.060
R1.

10:45:29.060 --> 10:45:30.060
Across R1.

10:45:30.060 --> 10:45:34.060
So basically, as the capacitor is increasing in voltage,

10:45:34.060 --> 10:45:38.060
the resistor is decreasing in voltage.

10:45:38.060 --> 10:45:44.060
Because this is not only a series circuit, it's also a voltage divider.

10:45:44.060 --> 10:45:47.060
It's a voltage divider.

10:45:47.060 --> 10:45:51.060
After five time constants, this voltage will be equal to this voltage.

10:45:51.060 --> 10:45:56.060
Voltage rise, voltage drop.

10:45:56.060 --> 10:46:02.060
After five time constants, this is equal to this, which means there's zero left over.

10:46:02.060 --> 10:46:04.060
Kirchoff's voltage law.

10:46:04.060 --> 10:46:07.060
Everything always goes back to what we talked about.

10:46:07.060 --> 10:46:11.060
I'm really not talking about a whole lot of new stuff here.

10:46:11.060 --> 10:46:14.060
I'm getting paid to talk about the same old stuff.

10:46:14.060 --> 10:46:17.060
Just every week I introduce a new word.

10:46:17.060 --> 10:46:20.060
This week it was inductance.

10:46:20.060 --> 10:46:22.060
Capacitance.

10:46:22.060 --> 10:46:24.060
What is it five times?

10:46:24.060 --> 10:46:25.060
Why?

10:46:25.060 --> 10:46:27.060
Why not B2?

10:46:27.060 --> 10:46:33.060
Because in five times, you basically get close to 100%.

10:46:33.060 --> 10:46:35.060
That's why we call it five times.

10:46:35.060 --> 10:46:37.060
It's really between five and six times.

10:46:37.060 --> 10:46:40.060
Some books say six time constants.

10:46:40.060 --> 10:46:43.060
Some say five.

10:46:43.060 --> 10:46:47.060
But you're so close to 100%.

10:46:47.060 --> 10:46:55.060
Because the six would be 63% of 99.3% for the sixth constant.

10:46:55.060 --> 10:47:03.060
Because on the fifth constant, it would be 99.6%, right?

10:47:03.060 --> 10:47:06.060
After five time constants, we call it even.

10:47:06.060 --> 10:47:11.060
The books that you say do sometimes have a sixth time constant.

10:47:11.060 --> 10:47:16.060
If you're dealing with real high power stuff, that could be a difference.

10:47:16.060 --> 10:47:20.060
If it was high power and a high voltage, it could be the difference of a couple of volts.

10:47:20.060 --> 10:47:22.060
That's a small percentage.

10:47:22.060 --> 10:47:25.060
But generally, it's accepted five time constants.

10:47:25.060 --> 10:47:30.060
Every exam you take here, it would be five time constants.

10:47:30.060 --> 10:47:36.060
In summary, capacitance is that property that stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field.

10:47:36.060 --> 10:47:41.060
A capacitor is a specific device designed to possess the property of capacitance.

10:47:41.060 --> 10:47:43.060
Fixed capacitor symbol.

10:47:43.060 --> 10:47:46.060
On the top, variable capacitor symbol on the bottom.

10:47:46.060 --> 10:47:52.060
Capacitance is measured in farads, developed by a guy by the name of Joe Farad.

10:47:52.060 --> 10:47:57.060
Microfarads, picofarads are typically the most often used values.

10:47:57.060 --> 10:48:03.060
Instead of nano, you may see milli-micro, or you may see tens of thousands of picot.

10:48:03.060 --> 10:48:08.060
The letter C represents capacitance, four factors affect capacitance.

10:48:08.060 --> 10:48:13.060
Area of the plates, distance between the plates, types of materials, and temperature.

10:48:13.060 --> 10:48:18.060
Capacitor types include electrolytic, paper, plastic, ceramic, or variable.

10:48:18.060 --> 10:48:24.060
To add up capacitance in series, you use the parallel formula.

10:48:24.060 --> 10:48:29.060
To add them up in parallel, you use the series formula.

10:48:29.060 --> 10:48:34.060
And to determine capacitive time constants, we use the formula T is equal to R times C.

10:48:34.060 --> 10:48:40.060
Any questions?

10:48:40.060 --> 10:48:46.060
Alright, let's go ahead and take about a ten minute break.

10:48:46.060 --> 10:48:52.060
And when we come back, section two of the book, AC circuits.
