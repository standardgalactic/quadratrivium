1. **Capacitance**: The ability of a capacitor to store charge and energy in an electric field. It is measured in farads, with common submultiples like microfarads (μF) or picofarads (pF).

2. **Properties of Capacitors**:
   - They are devices that possess the property of capacitance.
   - Capacitance depends on four factors: area of the plates, distance between the plates, types of materials used, and temperature.
   - Types of capacitors include electrolytic, paper, plastic, ceramic, or variable.

3. **Adding Capacitance**:
   - To add capacitances in series, you use the formula for parallel circuits (1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ...).
   - To add capacitances in parallel, you use the formula for series circuits (Ctotal = C1 + C2 + ...).

4. **Time Constant**: The time it takes for a charge or discharge of a capacitor in an RC circuit to reach 63.2% of its final value. It is calculated by the formula T = R × C, where R is the resistance and C is the capacitance.

5. **RC Charging/Discharging**:
   - In a series RC circuit, it takes five time constants for the capacitor to charge to approximately 99% of the supply voltage or to discharge to approximately 1% of its initial value.
   - During charging, the voltage across the resistor decreases, while the voltage across the capacitor increases. Conversely, during discharging, the voltage across the capacitor decreases as it releases charge, while the voltage across the resistor increases.

6. **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: Explains that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop must equal zero. This principle is important in analyzing the voltage distribution in both charging and discharging RC circuits.

7. **Upcoming Topic**: AC circuits, which will be covered after the break.

Remember to take a ten-minute break, and upon returning, you'll delve into the concepts of alternating current (AC) circuits.
