0	11760	Okay, since you know who I am and you know how I operate, I'm all about protocols, not
11760	15480	putting the proverbial cart before the horse.
15480	20920	That being said, tonight, one night, one night only, we're going to put the cart before the
20920	22760	horse.
22760	29560	The way that I want you to approach ELEC 110, and this is a recipe for success, because
29560	32520	like I said, I've been doing this for a couple of years, I know what works and I know what
32520	33520	doesn't.
33520	41440	And I guarantee you, I guarantee you, if you follow the syllabus, if you do all the assignments
41440	45920	that you're given, if you follow that recipe for success, you will be successful, you'll
45920	47840	pass this class.
47840	48840	Guarantee it.
48840	54080	I don't know if any of you also know, Lake Washington Technical College has a guarantee
54080	59840	that if you graduate our program, go into industry, and your local, whoever you go to
59840	64520	work for says you don't know what you're talking about, we will re-educate you for free to
64520	68520	get you to the standard that industry says, you know, how many students have been sent
68520	70480	back to the electronics program?
70480	71480	Zero.
71480	72480	Zero.
72480	75160	So I know it's working.
75160	81200	So keep in mind, the way that this is supposed to work, I think this really is the best recipe
81200	88760	for success, is I like to read through the chapter very quickly.
88760	94120	And what that does is like format your hard drive for what you're about to receive.
94120	99360	That of course is a given that you've already reviewed the syllabus.
99360	104080	In reviewing the syllabus, that shows you specifically, like on page one they start,
104080	109160	the course outcomes and objectives, and then you look at how those course outcomes and
109160	115160	objectives of the syllabus, which is really the training contract between you and I, how
115160	123040	closely the book and the chapter works meet those objectives.
123040	128520	So read through the objectives in the syllabus first, then read through chapter one, or chapter
128520	132080	17, whatever chapter you're on, just like a book.
132080	133960	But this isn't a book, it's a textbook.
133960	136360	So when you get to the end, it's not going to be like, oh, I never knew it was going
136360	137960	to turn out like that, okay?
137960	140240	I mean, this is a textbook.
140240	143360	It's a text slash reference book.
143360	147960	After you've read through the chapter, then go through it with a fine tooth comb.
147960	154600	Whenever you come to an example or a problem, take out your calculator and do the math and
154600	158280	follow along and do every practice problem.
158280	162960	Keep note of that because that's going to be part of your written assignment.
162960	166680	Then when you're all done with the chapter, then I'd read through it again very, very
166680	171080	quickly just to make sure you retained all that information.
171080	178000	Some of the stuff that we're going to talk about tonight in chapter one like atoms, molecules,
178000	179560	you probably have heard before, right?
179560	180560	The periodic table.
180560	182680	A lot of you have heard that already before.
182680	188100	So keep that in mind that if you're going through the book and the book is talking about stuff
188100	192480	that you already know, you don't need to beat that to death.
192480	196640	And that's actually good because it's going to draw you to focus your attention on those
196720	199920	areas that you don't understand.
199920	204920	And you're going to be able to dump all of your energy into the stuff you don't understand.
204920	205920	Does that make sense?
205920	210840	I mean, it sounds really basic when you think about it like that, but that's really what's
210840	214200	going to be the most effective means of traversing this.
214200	222640	Normally, I will not lecture on a chapter until you've read the chapter, done your homework,
222640	233440	and gotten together in your teams and completed a peer review, right, of your homework.
233440	239520	Once your homework has gone through that process and then you've got completed homework, then
239520	243640	come into lecture because you know what I want to spend my time and lecture, lecturing
243640	245080	on?
245080	247240	What you didn't get out of the book.
247240	250280	What you didn't get out of the assignments.
250320	253160	That's how I want to spend the majority of my time in lecture.
253160	255160	Fair enough?
255160	256800	Okay.
256800	258200	Let's get started.
258200	261680	These slides here actually follow the book.
261680	267640	And these slides, by the way, are available online on the Google site.
267640	270360	The TAs helped you out on how to get that site.
270360	273640	The links are right there in your syllabus.
273640	279760	So what you could do is you could download these from the site to your computer and then
279760	282840	put them on your laptop or home computer and have the same slides that I'm showing you
282840	283840	tonight.
283840	292000	Also, there are audio files of this lecture, an MP3 format, that you could download, Joe
292000	296680	Greenock on MP3, right, and listen to me when you're working out at the gym or running
296680	302200	from the police or whatever it is you do when you listen to MP3s.
302200	307400	And then also, we're going to be adding to this now videotape of the lecture that we've
307400	309800	got our TAs back there working on right now.
309800	312680	So ultimately, we'll be able to upload that.
312680	318920	And the reason that I go out of my way with recordings, with the slides, I've got nothing
318920	319920	to hide.
319920	320920	I've got nothing to hide.
320920	325440	As a matter of fact, I want to give you as much information as I possibly can so that
325440	329240	you could benefit from that information.
329240	330520	And you know what?
330520	335840	How many of you here own any DVDs, your favorite movies?
335840	338400	Why would you own a copy of a movie?
338400	339400	Why would you do that?
339400	342680	Isn't seeing it once good enough?
342680	347080	Why would you go out and buy DVDs of a movie?
347080	348080	Because they're cheap.
348080	352120	Unless they're given away, so it costs money.
352120	353120	What's that?
353120	354120	Yeah.
354120	363200	If you could watch it any time you want, but why specifically would you purchase a particular
363200	364200	movie?
364560	366560	Because it encompasses your interest.
366560	367560	Exactly.
367560	369400	It encompasses your interest.
369400	374560	And for those of you that have movies, how many of you have watched a movie the second
374560	378600	time and picked up stuff out of it the second time around that?
378600	381640	There's some movies I've seen in the theater that I'm like, I got to go out and get that
381640	384000	DVD because I want to see this again.
384000	388600	Yeah, I know how it ends up, but I want to see it because I missed something in the beginning
388600	391840	and I want to look for that thing that I missed in the beginning or whatever.
391840	396360	So it's perfectly natural for you to want to hear this lecture over and over again.
396360	398320	For some of you, once might be good enough.
398320	403560	I go to church on Sunday, my pastor normally, he gets up there and he preaches.
403560	405560	I get it right the first time.
405560	407280	I don't need to hear it again.
407280	412200	For some other people though, and actually at my church they do audio recordings and
412200	414520	then people can listen to that content.
414520	416640	They want to hear it again.
416640	418920	Normally I get it the first time that's the kind of guy that I am, that's the type of
418920	420280	learner that I am.
421240	422440	Look at that.
422440	425440	That's the other thing too with taking notes.
425440	428000	Some of you, it's been a while since you've been in school.
428000	430480	Try to hone your note-taking skills.
430480	435680	When I emphasize something, I'm usually emphasizing it for a reason and that reason is you may
435680	442600	see it again in the future on a quiz, on an exam, but most importantly, you may see it
442600	446840	in industry because one of the things I don't want to do is teach you the exam, teach you
446840	447840	the quiz.
447840	449720	That's not what it's all about.
449720	455000	One of the things that I want to share with you is I'm not really concerned.
455000	457520	I mean, I want all of you to pass my quizzes.
457520	458920	I want you to all pass my exam.
458920	462360	I want you to all pass this class, but to be totally honest with you, do you know how
462360	464920	I measure your success?
464920	472160	I measure your success as to where are you going to be five years from now?
472160	476400	Did I give you anything out of this course that helps you in that position you're in
476400	477840	in five years?
477840	479480	In ten years.
479480	486520	The payoff for me is when you call me and say, Joe, I'm in town or I'm passing through.
486520	488480	I'd like to buy you lunch.
488480	490680	I like lunch.
490680	491840	Swing by, buy me lunch.
491840	492840	Tell me what's going on.
492840	497960	Tell me what you're doing now and how I had an impact on that.
497960	503880	I actually, I went on a cruise over Spring Break, Caribbean.
503880	509280	I was just getting ready to get on the ship and I get all my emails forwarded to my phone
509480	516240	and I got an email from a student that I had in 1993 and he introduced himself and he says,
516240	518040	I don't know if you remember me.
518040	522160	My response back to him, of course I remember you, you know, because again, we established
522160	525280	a relationship, a professional relationship, but he graduated.
525280	527840	He went down to California, kind of dropped off the radar.
527840	531920	He was going to be in the area and was wondering if I'd be available next Friday to get together
531920	535720	and we could visit and I said, Alice, she's unfortunately I'm out of town and, you know,
535720	541200	that is how I measured the success.
541200	543320	Number one, that he remembered me.
543320	548800	Number two, what he learned here is part of his present reality.
548800	550440	So that's what I want all of you to think about.
550440	553600	Yeah, you want to pass the quiz, you want to pass the exam, you want to pass the class,
553600	555680	but where are you really going to use this stuff?
555680	560720	Anyway, kicking things off here, this is section one of the book, section one of the book.
560720	566400	Every of the texts that deals with what are called DC circuits, DC stands for direct
566400	571360	current and we're going to talk about the difference between direct current and alternating
571360	573240	current throughout this.
573240	585040	Chapter one deals with the fundamentals of electricity and I got to tell you that these
585040	592520	first few chapters are like sacred chapters, you know.
592520	598200	We should like ring bells and like hit gongs and chimes or whatever when we speak of some
598200	602880	of this stuff because if you want to be successful in electricity and electronics, these things
602880	609920	that we're going to speak of are critical attributes of what makes stuff work.
609920	616480	As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag from the get go.
616480	626680	The four, the big four things that we're looking at that drive this entire industry are four
626680	635440	properties, the properties are voltage, current, resistance, and power.
635440	638800	Voltage, current, resistance, and power, voltage, current, resistance, and power.
638800	642160	My cell phone works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.
642160	646120	My car computer works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.
646120	648720	Satellite TV works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.
648720	651760	Anything electrical or electronic works because of those four.
651760	657740	So what we really need to ensure is that these four properties that we're going to discuss,
657740	661680	we fully understand up one side and down the other.
661680	666880	As I said earlier, I've been doing this like since puberty, so you would think that I know
666880	673960	everything there is to know about voltage, current, resistance, and power, no, I do not.
673960	678600	Occasionally I get questions from students that are associated with those properties
678600	682160	that I can't quite answer, even though I've been doing this for so long.
682160	686480	So I'm on a continual journey to learn as much as I can about those four properties.
686480	690040	So we're going to kick things off of chapter one here, dealing with the fundamentals of
690040	695680	electricity, but pay special attention to those four properties, voltage, current, resistance,
695680	698960	and power, the big four, I like to call them the big four, because they are the big four.
698960	704040	It's what everything is based on.
704040	706520	If you know what's going on with voltage, current, resistance, and power, you know what's
706520	710280	going on inside the circuit, we're going to talk about that.
710280	714600	So kicking things off, fundamentals of electricity.
714600	720080	One of the things that I do at the start of every lecture is I review the objectives.
720080	728680	The objectives that I review are the same objectives that are on the syllabus.
728680	733160	That's a pretty good reason why I selected this textbook to use.
733160	736280	Although there's errors in this textbook, although it's not the best textbook on the
736280	745440	face of the planet, the objectives in the textbook reflect the objectives in the syllabus.
745440	751520	One of the other things I want you to fully understand is I don't teach the textbook.
751520	753720	I teach the curriculum.
753720	757520	The curriculum is contained in the syllabus.
757520	766400	The curriculum is derived through input from our local industry advisory committee.
766400	770920	This is a group of volunteers that get together on a regular basis, sit down and tell us what
770920	775280	we need to be doing for this program to stay competitive.
775920	779800	This book works really good because you're going to do all the chapters in it, but occasionally
779800	783520	in the future you may get some textbooks that the instructor is going to say you don't need
783520	784520	to do this chapter.
784520	785520	Why?
785520	786600	It's not part of the curriculum.
786600	791440	Local industry really doesn't think it's important that you learn that aspect of it.
791440	794160	So does that make sense?
794160	798200	One of the reasons that I review the objectives as well is to prepare you for what you're
798200	799200	about to receive.
799200	803640	It's like formatting your hard drive so that when I start talking about this stuff, you're
803640	808080	kind of like ready to store that information away on your hard drive, your mental hard
808080	811120	drive, your brain.
811120	813320	So let's take a look at this here.
813320	817040	Objectives after completing this chapter, the student will be able to define matter,
817040	819760	element, and molecule.
819760	822600	There's three questions right off the quiz.
822600	825440	Define matter, define element, define molecule.
825440	826960	It's an objective.
826960	830600	I hope at the end of this chapter you can define those.
830600	832080	Notice the parts of an atom.
832080	841040	Define the valence shell of an atom and identify the unit for measuring current.
841040	847040	Draw the symbol used to represent current flow in a circuit.
847040	852080	Describe the difference between conductors and insulators and semiconductors.
852080	856400	Define difference of potential, electromotive force, and voltage.
856400	857400	Voltage.
857400	859640	Wasn't that one of the big four?
859640	864640	So again, if this was like church would be ringing bells or gong, you know, we'll talk
864640	865800	about projects later.
865800	869880	Some of you may want to build sound effects so that we could, you know, whenever we do
869880	877800	that stuff, or dim the lights, voltage.
877800	880520	Draw the symbol used to represent voltage.
880520	883440	Identify the unit used to measure voltage.
883440	885680	To measure voltage.
885680	888600	Define resistance, gong.
888600	891000	For the big four.
891000	895920	Identify characteristics of resistance, gong, in a circuit.
895920	902320	Identify the unit for measuring resistance and draw the symbol used to represent resistance
902320	909440	in a circuit.
909440	917600	Everything you are about to learn as it pertains to electricity and electronics is traceable
917600	921400	back to matter.
921400	924880	Do any of you here know anything about matter?
924880	929280	Do you know what matters?
929280	938200	Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight.
938200	946600	Does anybody know where we could find the absence of matter?
946600	948000	Does anybody know?
948000	955320	Can we create this condition here on planet Earth?
955320	956320	Vacuum.
956320	958920	And I'm not talking about the auric five pound upright.
958920	960880	I don't think that's what you're talking about, right?
960880	963480	What kind of vacuum are you talking about?
963480	967100	It's called industrial vacuum.
967100	976560	And in essence, what we're talking about is pumping all of the matter out of a vessel.
976560	984560	So that all is that's left inside is space, empty space.
984560	987600	It's used a lot, a lot of you that go into high tech careers, you're going to see this
987600	993120	process used in the manufacturing process because it allows us to only put into the
993120	998840	chamber what we want to be into the chamber.
998840	1004280	Where can we find a large abundance of an absence of matter?
1004280	1005280	Space.
1006280	1012880	And you know the odd thing about it is that's why it's called space.
1012880	1015240	Because there's no matter.
1015240	1017080	There's no matter.
1017080	1022000	Now if you're in a spaceship traveling through space and you roll the window down and you
1022000	1029960	stick your butterfly net out and you pick up some cosmic debris in your butterfly net,
1029960	1033600	pretty odd thing to do, down a space suit if you're going to roll the window down in
1033600	1034600	the spaceship.
1034760	1043160	But if you find any cosmic debris in your net, that means that you have found matter.
1043160	1052440	Because if it's something and it occupies space and it has weight, therefore it's matter.
1052440	1055520	Have any of you heard of antimatter?
1055520	1059320	We will not be talking about that here in this program.
1059320	1064280	I used to think it was science fiction until I was talking about it in a lecture like this
1064280	1068960	and I had a student raise their hand and we're not going to talk about it because I don't
1068960	1073000	know anything, you know, the absence of matter, antimatter, the opposite of matter.
1073000	1080160	And he brought in an article the next week about a NASA project and these NASA teams
1080160	1081880	are all about funding.
1081880	1085960	So all these PhDs and all these scientists, it's all about getting money for them to continue
1085960	1087440	their research.
1087440	1091760	Well NASA was running out of money and there was a particular group that was doing research
1091760	1096400	and they were going to get their operation shut down.
1096400	1100320	So as soon as they all were basically put on notice, you all are no longer going to
1100320	1102120	have a job at NASA.
1102120	1106080	They're like, oh geez, you know, that's too bad, you know, that's really bad.
1106080	1108160	Well, why is it so bad?
1108160	1116480	Well, we just discovered a cloud of antimatter and we think it's headed this way, you know.
1116480	1120960	So right away, you know, NASA gives them more money to continue the research and somewhere
1120960	1126400	in my archives, I've actually got a picture of this antimatter cloud that, you know, I
1126400	1131600	mean who knows if it even exists, but obviously if antimatter collides with matter, they cancel
1131600	1132840	each other out.
1132840	1137560	So if there was antimatter cloud that inundated our solar system, we'd be gone.
1137560	1142240	You know, I don't know where we'd go, but this is what they say.
1142240	1145440	Enough said, we won't be talking about antimatter in this class.
1145440	1148480	We're more concerned about matter.
1148480	1154880	Now the basic building block of all matter that we're aware of, and this is really interesting,
1154880	1158600	is what's known as an element.
1158600	1162720	An element can be found on the periodic table.
1162720	1164280	I must not be a real professor.
1164280	1168040	If I was a real professor, I'd have one of those pull down charts that's got the periodic
1168040	1170600	table in all the squares, you know.
1170600	1171880	That's the sign of a true professor.
1171880	1173200	I don't have one of those.
1173200	1176800	I could probably call it up on my computer screen, but it wouldn't be the same of having
1176800	1179880	one of those pull down charts where you go with the pointer, right?
1179880	1181200	And you've all seen that.
1181200	1183000	You all know what I'm talking about, right?
1183000	1186320	Probably saw it back in elementary school.
1186320	1190740	Elements of the basic building block in nature cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by
1190740	1193480	chemical means.
1193480	1204360	And believe it or not, there are only about a hundred known elements in existence, period.
1204800	1219640	That means me, you, that desktop, the chair, a cow, a monkey, a sports car, an airplane,
1219640	1228720	were all made up of a hundred of the same ingredients, period.
1228720	1230360	Isn't that amazing?
1230360	1234520	When I was one of the things they really didn't know about going to the moon, were they going
1234520	1238320	to go to the moon and find some new element?
1238320	1242160	They went to the moon and they found the same stuff we got here on Earth.
1242160	1248720	So basically, the assumption is in the scientific community that really, the entire universe
1248720	1252040	is made up of about a hundred of the same ingredients.
1252040	1257640	I mean, I got more crap in my pantry at home, spices, seasonings, you know, I got all kinds
1257640	1259920	of stuff all over the place.
1259920	1265640	But the fundamental essence of it all, a hundred plus elements, period.
1265640	1268760	Everything's made up of those same hundred plus ingredients.
1268760	1277000	Now, we're really focused on the parts of an atom.
1277000	1282440	So when we have an element, the smallest particle that we could break that element down into
1282440	1288880	and have it retain its identity is an atom.
1288880	1293120	So I know you think I'm going all wacky like chemistry, onion, everything, okay?
1293120	1294120	Bear with me.
1294120	1298080	We have to understand the essence of matter so that we get electricity out of matter.
1298080	1300000	That's where we're going with this.
1300000	1304880	The first part of the atom you need to understand is called the nucleus and the nucleus is not
1304880	1305880	even really a part.
1305880	1307600	I misspoke that.
1307600	1316760	It's not a part, it's a place and that place is simply the center of the atom.
1316760	1325560	The first true subatomic particle that we're going to talk about is the proton.
1325560	1331840	Proton is a positively charged particle that's located in the nucleus, okay?
1331840	1335600	And I just said something that's very, very significant.
1335600	1339840	I just said the word positively charged.
1339840	1346040	For the first time in this program, we just spoke of something that has an electrical
1346040	1350760	characteristic, a positive charge.
1350760	1353560	So proton has a positive charge.
1353560	1362160	The other subatomic particle that's located in the nucleus of an atom is called the neutron.
1362160	1370560	And neutrons are uncharged particles, meaning no charge.
1370560	1381040	One of the ways that I remember it always is proton, positively charged.
1381040	1388480	Both start with the letter P. Neutron, no, no, no, no, no, neutrally charged, okay?
1388480	1393800	They're not positive or negative, they're uncharged, they're neutrally charged.
1393800	1396120	That's where they're called neutrons.
1397120	1401640	Electrons, well, that's the other subatomic particle.
1401640	1409720	And if one's charged positive and one is neutral, then therefore the electron must be negatively
1409720	1413640	charged particles.
1413640	1423000	The electron actually orbits the nucleus where the protons and the neutrons are located.
1423000	1425600	This is a very, very significant slide.
1426160	1428400	Remember earlier I shared with you a little bit about my background?
1428400	1433720	I wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.
1433720	1441480	And as a matter of fact, when I was in the Navy on active duty, my uniform, the Navy,
1441480	1446040	even if you sail on a cruise ship, you have a symbol that identifies what division you're
1446040	1447640	part of.
1447640	1454320	And for me, I had on my arm my chevrons, you know, that signified, you know, my rank.
1454320	1459880	But then I had a helium atom on my arm.
1459880	1465520	And that helium atom was to signify matter.
1465520	1471200	And the helium atom with the electron orbiting around the outside was to signify electrons
1471200	1473440	orbiting the nucleus.
1473440	1474440	Why?
1474440	1477240	Because I was an electronic technician.
1477240	1481000	And I basically went for like three years of my career before I realized, why is there
1481000	1484200	like an atom on my arm, okay?
1484200	1485480	What does that mean?
1485480	1491800	What it means is the electrons orbiting the nucleus because I was a subject matter expert,
1491800	1496200	a technician on the behavior of electrons.
1496200	1498120	That's what you're all here to learn.
1498120	1504560	If you're here to learn about electronics, you're here to study the behavior of the electron.
1504560	1507680	And that's what we're really going to talk about.
1507680	1509840	Makes sense?
1509840	1513720	One of the things I do not want you to study while you're here in this program.
1513720	1515240	And I'm pretty open-minded.
1515240	1518360	If you want to go off and do some projects and stuff like that, I'm all about it.
1518360	1523720	One of the things I really don't want you doing is anything with the nucleus of the
1523720	1527400	atom, okay?
1527400	1532520	And if you plan on doing anything with the nucleus of the atom, give me fair warning.
1532520	1536200	And I think I'll stay in federal way that day, okay?
1536200	1541000	And then you can have at it and try to split the atom or do whatever it is you're going
1541000	1542000	to do.
1542000	1545920	But when you start playing around with the nucleus of the atom, bad things happen.
1545920	1550800	As electronics professionals, we're only going to play around with electrons.
1550800	1553520	As a matter of fact, we're only going to play around with certain electrons.
1553520	1560080	I'm going to share what those electrons are with you in a moment.
1560080	1565760	This is kind of sort of what it looks like, maybe.
1565760	1572200	This is an artist's depiction, and the scale is really, really off.
1572200	1576440	The proton is a very big particle.
1576440	1578040	The neutron is a very big particle.
1578040	1580440	So the nucleus, this is kind of working, okay?
1580440	1583480	This is kind of working for me.
1583480	1587920	The electron, though, is not the same physical size as the proton.
1587920	1593060	The electron would be like the spot of my laser pointer.
1593060	1599260	But in actuality, if this truly was the neutron and the proton, I don't think the spot of
1599260	1602720	my laser pointer would even be in the room anymore.
1602720	1607260	That's how far the orbit is around the nucleus.
1607260	1609980	I heard it once explained as like a cathedral.
1609980	1617980	If you had the size of a grapefruit in the center of the cathedral, the electrons orbiting
1617980	1620460	would actually be like on the outer walls.
1620460	1622820	It'd be, you know, really, really far out there.
1622820	1628500	So the scales here are off, but this gives you an idea of what's going on.
1628500	1636820	One thing I want you to understand also is that all matter, when in its neutral, natural
1636820	1645060	state, has an equal number of protons and electrons.
1645060	1648260	Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged.
1648260	1650780	They're equal numbers, so they cancel each other out.
1650780	1655100	That means that matter is in a neutral, natural state.
1655100	1658580	Did that answer your question?
1658580	1665020	You had a balanced, so there's an equal number of electrons and protons in atoms until we
1665020	1666020	do something to it.
1666020	1668860	We're going to talk about that in a minute, too, because we're not just going to let everything
1668860	1670860	stay in a neutral, natural state.
1670860	1673780	If we did, we wouldn't have, we'd be out of jobs.
1673780	1674780	We wouldn't have current flow.
1674780	1679700	It'd be a drag.
1679700	1684380	A couple of the numbers that you need to familiarize yourself with.
1684380	1689820	And one of the things that I want to stress to you is that all of you are here taking
1689820	1691340	electronics courses.
1691340	1695580	You're here to learn the language of electricity and electronics.
1695580	1696580	That's really what it is.
1696580	1697740	It's like taking a second language.
1697740	1701700	I've actually had a lot of students that speak different languages, and English is a second
1701700	1704420	language, and they wonder if they could come in and do it, and say, yeah, you could come
1704420	1705860	in and do it.
1705860	1709980	Because you know what, what I'm talking about here is another language.
1709980	1715220	So one of the technical terms that we may use in the future is a number called atomic
1715220	1716980	number.
1716980	1723060	An atomic number simply is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom.
1723060	1728020	And every one of those hundred plus elements that I talked to you about earlier has a unique
1728020	1729980	number of protons.
1729980	1733420	You don't have two different elements that have the same number of protons.
1733420	1737580	So the scientific community embraced this, and they said, you know what?
1737580	1743180	Why don't we just use the number of protons, and that's going to give it its position on
1743180	1744660	the periodic table.
1744660	1745660	Make sense?
1745660	1746660	Okay.
1746660	1751820	The next number I want you to familiarize yourself with is the atomic weight.
1751820	1755300	And the atomic weight deals with the mass of the atom.
1755300	1756300	It's weight.
1756300	1757300	It's physical weight.
1757300	1761700	And remember when I said that protons and neutrons were big, and they were contained
1761700	1766140	in the nucleus, and the electron was just like a little tiny subatomic particle orbiting
1766140	1767140	way outside.
1767140	1774340	Basically, to end up with atomic weight, all you do is count up the total number of protons
1774340	1776620	and neutrons in the nucleus.
1776620	1777620	Count that up.
1777620	1779460	That gives you the atomic weight.
1779460	1786460	Every weight of every element on the periodic table is unique.
1786460	1790700	And basically, the mass of the electron is so insignificant, we don't even take that
1790700	1796020	into account in determining the atomic weight.
1796020	1797020	Make sense?
1797020	1803780	Now, this is where things get interesting.
1803780	1805660	First term, shell.
1805660	1810220	This isn't the kind of shell you find by the seashore.
1810220	1817020	What we're talking about here for shells is simply an orbital path around the nucleus.
1817020	1819360	This is where the electrons orbit.
1819360	1824860	They form concentric circles around the nucleus, and they're filled in sequence.
1824860	1829080	Have any of you here been to a parking garage, like down at SeaTac Airport or Bellevue Square
1829080	1834480	or, you know, I don't know about you, and I'm, again, not the smartest guy, but normally
1834480	1838840	I want to park at, like, the first level like I find a space at.
1838840	1842640	So what I'll do is I'll go to the first level and I'll drive around, and if I can't find
1842640	1846080	a parking space, where do I go?
1846080	1848480	Up to the next level, okay?
1848480	1853600	And then I drive around, and if I can't find a space there, where do I go?
1853600	1855840	The next level, and I keep doing that.
1855840	1860220	This is how shells are filled in atomic structure.
1860220	1867280	When the first shell gets filled, then electrons start going out to the second shell, and then
1867280	1869440	the next shell, and then the next shell.
1869440	1878120	So our most complex atoms in existence have electrons in shells that are way out there,
1878120	1881680	because they have the highest number of electrons.
1881680	1887600	And the higher the number of electrons, the higher the number of protons, because remember
1887600	1891120	they have to be equal.
1891120	1894200	Make sense?
1894200	1903200	Now, the shell that most, should most concern you is this valence shell.
1903200	1905600	This is the outermost shell.
1905600	1908620	If it's a complex atom, it may be way out there.
1908620	1913520	If it's a simple atom, it's going to be real close to the nucleus.
1913520	1919800	And I'll talk to you in a minute why that's, it's important for two different reasons.
1919800	1927760	The number of electrons contained in the valence shell also refers to the term valence.
1927760	1937760	Now, this is the scheme that they came up with in naming the shells.
1937760	1944320	If we have a simple atom, let's say we've got an atom that contains one electron.
1944320	1948560	That one electron is going to be parked in the lowest level.
1948560	1951840	And we're not going to call it the lowest level, no, that'd be too easy.
1951840	1955880	We're not going to, we're not going to park it in what's called the first shell, because
1955880	1958440	that would be too easy.
1958440	1962560	You're here to attend college, okay, to get educated.
1962560	1966800	So we've got to not call this the first shell or the A shell.
1966800	1970960	We're going to call this innermost shell the K shell.
1970960	1971960	Why?
1971960	1972960	I don't know.
1972960	1978040	It helps us educated people justify our existence.
1978040	1982680	After the K shell comes the, this, this is the part that actually makes sense to me.
1982680	1989880	After K comes L, M, N, O, P, Q, so I did okay with the alphabet, so it kind of makes sense.
1989880	1997280	So what this means is the Q shell, the most complex element that we have found in the
1997280	2003040	universe contains electrons in the Q shell.
2003040	2005520	Does that make sense?
2005520	2013080	If it's a simpler element, an element with a lower atomic number, that means it's going
2013080	2016720	to have electrons maybe only in some of these shells.
2016720	2021320	But we have to fill a sequence first, fill this K shell before we bump an electron up
2021320	2022320	into the L shell.
2022320	2026160	When L gets filled, and some of you that have maybe taken chemistry and some physics classes
2026160	2029800	know there's a certain number, I don't want you to memorize that.
2029800	2032080	That's not going to help you become an electronics professional.
2032080	2037000	And just remember there is a limit of how many electrons you could park in a shell before
2037000	2046440	the electrons have to go into the outer shell.
2046440	2049520	Now why am I talking to you about all of this stuff?
2049520	2055960	Again, this was a question that plagued me for about three years since I was educated,
2055960	2058600	like why were they teaching me about all the subatomic stuff?
2058600	2061080	I'm not going to be some mad scientist, you know?
2061080	2063000	Why do I need to know about the periodic table?
2063000	2065280	Why do I need to know about subatomic structure?
2065280	2070280	You know, I want to learn how to use a multimeter to take voltage readings.
2070280	2072920	I want to know how to use an oscilloscope to take readings.
2072920	2074920	Why do I have to understand subatomic shrubber?
2074920	2079960	Two reasons you need to understand subatomic structure.
2079960	2087280	Number one is so you could identify the properties of materials that we use in electronics.
2087280	2089680	That's first and foremost.
2090440	2093960	Secondly, you need to understand where voltage comes from.
2093960	2096160	And we're going to talk about that in a minute.
2096160	2101680	First let's talk about some of these materials and their properties.
2101680	2102680	Conductors.
2102680	2105000	How many of you are familiar with conductors?
2105000	2106160	Conductors.
2106160	2111680	That's the guy that runs the train, right, that's the conductor.
2111680	2113280	Actually saw that the other night.
2113280	2114280	What's that?
2114280	2115280	Movie?
2115280	2116280	Unstoppable?
2116280	2117280	How many of you have seen the movie Unstoppable?
2117280	2118280	Train?
2118280	2119280	It was actually a pretty good movie.
2119280	2120280	You haven't seen that one?
2120280	2121280	Yeah, it was good.
2121280	2122280	Wasn't it?
2122280	2123280	Train?
2123280	2124280	Running out of control?
2124280	2125280	Based on true stories.
2125280	2127480	It was based on a true story, you know.
2127480	2131480	Let's set the throttle and jump off the train and switch the track and jump back on it.
2131480	2133680	It just didn't work out very well.
2133680	2136400	Anyway, that's not even what we're talking about.
2136400	2137400	Conductors.
2137400	2138400	We're not talking about train conductors.
2138400	2142880	We're talking about conductors, electrical conductors.
2142880	2150560	Materials that readily accept the flow of electrons or electricity, if you will.
2150560	2158800	Categorically, the textbook says they're materials that contain a large number of free electrons.
2158800	2162480	However, I want you to think of it in a different way.
2162480	2172560	When I speak of conductors, I am speaking of materials that have three or fewer electrons
2172560	2177760	in the valence shell.
2177760	2185600	And by the way, in this class, in this program, the only shell that you will ever work with
2185600	2189960	for safety reasons is the valence shell.
2189960	2196160	If you plan to experiment beyond the valence shell, again, let me know, and I'll probably
2196160	2199000	stay home that day, okay?
2199000	2201240	So it's only the valence shell.
2201240	2206840	So if you've got an element that has three or fewer electrons in the valence shell, it's
2206840	2209800	going to potentially be a good conductor.
2209800	2221160	Now, in order of precedence, the material that has the best conductivity or conductance
2221160	2224160	is that of silver.
2224160	2226560	Silver, believe it or not, that's the best, found in nature.
2226560	2231160	Out of all the elements, silver is the best.
2231160	2242320	Gold by copper, gold, aluminum, tungsten, iron, nichrome, okay?
2242320	2243400	Silver is the best.
2243400	2251880	If silver is the best, why when you buy a stereo, why when you buy audio-video equipment, do
2251880	2256880	they try to sell you gold-plated patch cords?
2256880	2257880	Okay?
2257880	2260080	We've got one response, they're money, yeah?
2260120	2262080	They could get more money out of you.
2262080	2268080	It's corrosion, it's, silver has a higher corrosive potential than gold.
2268080	2269080	Absolutely.
2269080	2270080	Absolutely.
2270080	2278800	And copper is a little bit more corrosive than gold, but not as much as silver.
2278800	2287880	So basically, gold is the least likely to oxidize and corrode.
2287880	2295320	So when we get copper wire and plate it with gold, we get a good conductor, because gold
2295320	2298400	is still a good conductor, but it won't oxidize.
2298400	2305480	If you're scuba diving in the Caribbean and you find a treasure chest full of gold that's
2305480	2311040	been sunken, hundreds of years underwater, and you dig it out of the sand and you open
2311040	2316320	it up underwater, salt water, hundreds of years, you open it up, you would know that
2316320	2324080	you found gold, because it would look as good as the day that that treasure chest fell off
2324080	2327720	the pirate ship.
2327720	2336520	If you found a treasure chest under the ocean in the Caribbean and it was filled with silver
2336520	2340480	and you pried it open, you'd be like, oh, what happened in there?
2340480	2341480	Because it's all oxidized.
2341480	2345320	Of course, there's still good silver in there, but the exterior would be oxidized.
2345320	2350820	So that is why we use gold-plated connectors.
2350820	2352080	Don't oxidize.
2352080	2357560	We live in an oxygen-rich environment, so if I could have gold-plated connector to connector
2357560	2361080	and I could mate the two, I'm going to get the best possible electrical connection that
2361080	2362080	I can.
2362080	2365440	Now, do you really need to go out and buy those gold-plated audio-video connectors?
2365440	2367640	It's actually kind of funny, because I've seen a lot of people go out and spend good
2367640	2373520	money on those, and then they plug it into the back of a dusty amplifier.
2373520	2377240	It would have been better for you to go out and get some technical-grade alcohol, clean
2377240	2382680	the male-female connectors, connect them, and you'd get a better electrical connection.
2382680	2390520	Now, in a perfect world, a totally clean gold to totally clean gold, clean, nice, no dust,
2390520	2393160	is going to give you a superior connection.
2393160	2396960	We actually learned a lot of this was developed in the space program, because think about
2396960	2402400	it, to basically send people to the moon and have them get back and have those electronic
2402400	2405360	circuit boards needed to be highly reliable.
2405360	2408600	This is where NASA started playing around with everything is interconnected.
2408600	2411080	You can't permanently wire everything up.
2411080	2415840	You have to have boards and sockets, and everything is interconnected like that.
2415840	2419520	NASA did a lot of research, and I said, hey, we played the stuff with gold.
2419520	2426880	We'll be golden, you know, and literally that started that whole trend in electronics.
2426880	2431720	A lot of the circuit boards and stuff that you buy, your computer motherboard, your video
2431720	2436080	card have gold plating on it, so they make that connection, and it's a highly reliable
2436080	2441600	connection.
2441600	2445800	Big thing I want you to remember, though, three or fewer electrons in a valence shell.
2445800	2449120	Insulators are materials that prevent the flow of electricity.
2449120	2456320	The textbook says they're stabilized by absorbing valence electrons.
2456320	2467120	The material found on planet Earth that has the highest insulative quality in nature is
2467120	2468120	mica.
2468120	2470880	Any of you know what mica is?
2470880	2472440	It's found in rock formations.
2472440	2473860	It's very fragile.
2473860	2476560	It's a good thermal insulator, and it's a good electrical insulator.
2476560	2483400	A lot of times it's found in quartz formations, and it's almost like paper, like you can kind
2483400	2484400	of peel.
2484400	2488800	There's one layer and another layer and another layer, but it's highly fragile.
2488800	2493080	That for thickness is the best insulator that we have found in nature.
2493080	2497560	That's why it's at the top of the list.
2497560	2500000	That's what we compare everything to.
2500000	2507240	Glass is high, but not as high as mica, followed by Teflon paper, wax paper, which is used
2507240	2510280	in the manufacturing of some of the electronic components.
2510280	2512200	Rubber, bake light.
2512200	2514200	I know what bake light is.
2514200	2520400	Bake light is like the handle on your toaster oven, and when you drop it, it chips it, and
2520400	2522200	you can't glue it back together.
2522200	2526120	It's not only a good electrical insulator, it's a good thermal insulator.
2526120	2530120	It's that black stuff that, again, you chip on your pots and pans, and you can't fix.
2530120	2532160	Isn't that the original form of plastic?
2532160	2533160	They started now?
2533160	2534160	Yes.
2534160	2539720	It is one of the original forms of plastic, if you will, that they used as a composite,
2539720	2541720	if you will.
2541720	2542720	Oils.
2542720	2545360	A lot of oils are used.
2545360	2552160	They used to use a lot of oils that had a lot of poison in them for electrical transformers,
2552160	2555400	but we kind of got out of that because oil is an insulator.
2555400	2559720	It's nice because oil will draw heat away from circuits.
2559720	2566640	If you had a circuit submerged in oil, if any, what do you call them, computer heads
2566640	2572040	here, PC files, you know.
2572040	2577200	One of the big problems we know with PCs are heat, the generation of heat in the processing.
2577200	2582120	So one of the big things is if you could super cool a computer, you'd get more performance
2582120	2583280	out of that computer.
2583280	2587760	So if we got the computer, don't try it again with my computers, but if we got it and submerged
2587760	2591960	it into a vat of oil, and then we cooled the oil and recirculated it, we could draw more
2591960	2596120	heat away from the circuit, and then we could start bumping up the speed of the computer
2596120	2600120	and in the industry, overdrive the chip.
2600120	2604160	Ask more of the chip than what it's rated for.
2604160	2606040	Yeah.
2606040	2608440	Porcelain.
2608440	2609440	And of course, air.
2609440	2611080	Air is an insulator, isn't it?
2611080	2617040	If you've driven under power lines, what's between the power lines?
2617040	2618040	Air.
2618440	2622240	I don't know if you've ever driven under or walked.
2622240	2629000	Do some walking, hiking under the BPA power lines down south, and on a day that's damp,
2629000	2632560	you could actually hear the zzzz, it's like, wow.
2632560	2636120	Air is the insulator, and I guess it ain't working too good right now.
2636120	2641520	Hope it doesn't arc to me.
2641520	2647000	There's also a category of materials that are called semi-conductors.
2647000	2651640	conductors are materials that could be altered to function as either a conductor
2651640	2658480	or an insulator. Let me go back, I left out one thing here. Insulators are
2658480	2668000	materials that have five or more electrons in the valence shell. Five or
2668000	2677680	more electrons in the valence shell. So conductors were three or fewer, insulators
2677680	2685400	five or more. Anybody want to take a wild guess what a semi-conductor might be?
2685400	2688800	One that could be altered to function as either a conductor or an insulator. If you
2688800	2695480	want to take a wild guess. Four, you all could have been scientists back in the
2695480	2699440	1940s. Because that's basically what they came to the conclusion. We know the
2699440	2703000	properties of conductors. We know the properties of insulators. What happens if
2703000	2705600	we start playing around with something that has four electrons in the valence
2705600	2710320	shell? We could get it maybe to swing both ways depending on how we want it to
2710320	2715960	behave at that moment in time. And as you know, semi-conductors are the
2715960	2722920	fundamental building block of diodes and transistors. Transistors are the
2722920	2728000	fundamental building block of computer microprocessors. It's all a
2728000	2733920	microprocessor is. Now, in essence, billions of transistors on something the
2733920	2740680	size of a postage stamp. Made of materials that have four electrons in the
2740680	2744680	valence shell. Those materials that you're going to study later on in the
2744680	2748600	program, not real important now for you to know, but I think you'll recognize one
2748600	2755040	of the names. Germanium? That's not geraniums, that's what grows in the
2755040	2762320	gardens. Germanium, it's an element. Carbon, that's an element. And the most
2762320	2768680	prevalent? Silicon. Silicon Valley. You've all heard of Silicon Valley? Have any of
2768680	2772360	you know where Silicon Valley is? Have you ever been there? Vast mountains of
2772360	2778160	silicon everywhere. Now, it's fabrication facilities, labs, okay? You're talking
2778200	2786240	about the bay area. Make sense? And what they did is they harnessed the power of
2786240	2790040	semi-conductors and made transformers, or transistors, excuse me, not
2790040	2795440	transformers. It's another, it's another line. Trust me, we'll enjoy that lecture
2795440	2801760	when we get to it. The other big thing I want to address with you is negative ion,
2802640	2811000	positive ion. Because in essence, this is where voltage comes from. This is where
2811000	2819160	voltage comes from. If I get this calculator here on the desktop, it's
2819160	2822320	just been sitting on the desktop all day. It's just your average every day
2822880	2828840	calculator. I assume that since it was sitting on the, on the desktop, minding
2828840	2836160	its own business, it's electrically in a neutral, natural state. Because this
2836160	2845080	calculator is made up of matter, which is made up of elements. Sitting here,
2845960	2855560	neutral, natural state. So if I get this now, and I start rubbing it, I start
2855600	2858800	rubbing it. What effect do you think that's going to have on the calculator?
2858800	2867400	I'm cleaning it. No, it's a different class. That program's down the hall. Go
2867400	2878280	out the double doors. Static electricity causes friction. The friction does what?
2879200	2882200	Creates charge. How? And why?
2883640	2888400	Through the resistance of the fabric going across the plaster.
2889320	2890880	Close. Somehow. Close, kind of.
2891320	2903400	The difference of the electrical potential, and that you're rubbing that
2903400	2911640	cloth on the class calculator, which creates charge on there. And then when you
2911640	2915320	touch it, you're less charged than the cloth.
2915320	2919640	Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. In essence, by me rubbing this and
2919640	2925320	applying friction, which is a form of energy, when I apply energy to matter, and
2925320	2930840	I rub this, there's a pretty good chance that I am going to knock some subatomic
2930920	2934440	particles. Which ones? Electrons, off of what shell?
2935720	2939880	Valence shell. If I rub this so hard that smoke starts coming out of it and it bursts
2939880	2944760	into flames, chances are I've gone in too far. But if I just rub the valence shells
2944760	2952360	and I knock some of those electrons from this onto this, now we've got a disparity.
2952920	2958200	Now no longer. If I've removed electrons from something that was neutral, natural,
2958200	2963560	and I've taken electrons from it, what is the predominant positive? Why?
2969720	2976520	Exactly. Now I'm left with more protons on this than I have electrons. It wasn't a
2976520	2982440	neutral natural state, so I started rubbing it. So that's exactly what I've done.
2982440	2989640	So I just made this a positive ion. I just made this a positive ion by removing electrons from it.
2990520	2994520	If this was also in a neutral natural state until I started monkeying with it,
2994520	3000280	now I rubbed electrons from the calculator onto the cloth. What does this mean for the cloth?
3003640	3011480	It's now negatively charged. Why is that? Because it contains more electrons than it had
3011480	3018760	when it was in its neutral natural state. Now you know what? When I do this, when I do this,
3018760	3022920	both of these items, I don't want to make it sound like they have consciousness or whatever,
3022920	3028360	but their whole freaking goal in life now is to get back into a neutral natural state.
3029000	3034040	They cannot wait until I put them together and the electrons could jump off the cloth
3034040	3042200	back onto the calculator and they could be at rest in a neutral natural state in a perfect world.
3043480	3049560	Does that make sense? What I just shared with you is how we generate electricity.
3050520	3056600	That's how we generate electricity. In order for us to generate electricity, we must apply
3056600	3064520	energy to matter. When we apply enough energy to matter, we could knock electrons off
3064520	3072280	the valence shell, gather them, and then say, hey, what? You want to get back to the positive?
3072280	3079000	Have I got a deal for you? Come, travel through my circuit, make this light bulb,
3079000	3084840	illuminate, and I'll give you a complete path back to your neutral natural state.
3085640	3091560	That's what we end up doing as a career, making sure electrons that were harnessed
3092360	3096840	are ready, able, and willing to do work for us, and then we make sure that they follow the correct
3096840	3102040	path and do something for us. We just don't let them complete the path. If you're just letting
3102040	3106440	them complete the path, that's called a short circuit. Okay? That's not a good thing. We'll
3106440	3110680	talk more about that in future chapters. We just want to make sure that the electrons follow the
3110680	3115800	path and complete that path. Makes sense? Very critical. Talked about two big things already,
3115800	3122840	the properties of materials we use in electronics, and also the property of how we create voltage or
3122840	3126440	electricity. There's one other thing here the book does not go into. There's a
3127960	3131960	we have conductors, we have insulators, we have semiconductors. There's a fourth property that's
3131960	3136040	floating around out there in science right now. Does anybody know what property I'm talking about?
3136280	3143080	Superconductor. Superconductor. Very good. Very good. A superconductor, all of these, whether
3143080	3147000	you're a conductor, whether you're an insulator, whether you're a semiconductor, you have one
3147000	3151480	property associated with you. Everything has that property associated with it. It's a property of
3151480	3157320	resistance. We're going to talk about it in a bit. There is a material that exists. It's called a
3157320	3162280	superconductor. It has no resistance. The problem is, does anybody know where it exists?
3167000	3173320	It is at low temperatures, so therefore where it's going to exist is in a laboratory. They don't
3173320	3177480	have it operating at room temperature. I can't bring you next door and give you a tour of my
3177480	3182840	superconductor that I have set up over on a bench over here. I could if I had a cryogenics plant,
3183800	3190680	and I was a research facility and playing around with it. But when they harness superconductivity,
3190680	3195640	it's really going to rewrite the textbooks on how we manage electricity and electronics.
3195640	3201160	You think Bill Gates got a lot of money? The dude that captures and harnesses superconductivity
3201160	3205720	at room temperature, it's going to be very, very wealthy. Very, very wealthy.
3207480	3213160	Make sense? By the way, does anybody know what material they're having the best luck with
3213160	3220840	as it pertains to superconductivity? What's that? Graphene, they're doing some stuff with that.
3221800	3229400	That's not the best results yet. Believe it or not, it is ceramic. Ceramic at room temperature
3229400	3233240	is an insulator. It's a great insulator. We use it as an electrical insulator,
3233240	3237160	but when they bring these ceramics to really, really cold extreme temperatures,
3237160	3242840	they take on conductive properties, and they conduct with no resistance. Pretty cool.
3243560	3252280	Ionization, that's the process I described. It's the process of gaining and losing electron,
3252280	3254360	and it's significant in current flow.
3256840	3260200	Okay, without ionization, you wouldn't have voltage. Without voltage, you would not have
3260200	3266840	current flow. Current, again, we should ring bells.
3267800	3276280	Current is the movement of electrons from negatively charged atoms to positively charged
3276280	3283880	atoms. The letter that we use to abbreviate current with is the capital letter i, capital letter i.
3285800	3289640	One of the terms we need to familiarize ourselves with when dealing with these
3289640	3295480	electrical properties is the term coulomb. We'll talk more about the coulomb next chapter,
3295480	3305400	but what a coulomb is is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. This is a big, huge number.
3305960	3316840	This is basically 6.24 and 16 zeros after that four. It's too big to fit in your calculator.
3316840	3323640	That's why we refer to it in this as an engineering notation. We'll talk more about
3323640	3328360	engineering notation again in future chapters, because we get you used to dealing with these
3328360	3334600	extreme numbers. In electronics, we deal with a lot of extreme numbers, and we represent it
3334600	3345400	with the capital letter c. Now, in ampere, named after André-Marie Ampere, French physicist,
3346040	3355080	one coulomb, that big number of electrons, 6.24 with 16 zeros after it, that number of electrons
3355080	3361480	moving past a single point in one second is called the ampere. Have you all familiar with the term
3361480	3367160	ampere before? If you've ever burnt out a fuse, you make sure you get the fuse that's the proper
3367160	3371800	ampere rating. If you pop your circuit breaker, you need to make sure when you're resetting it
3371800	3377800	that you're not overloading the circuit and exceeding the amperage rating of the circuit.
3379560	3384440	And what that is is physically a given number of electrons that you're forcing through a conductor
3384440	3393160	in one second's time. One coulomb per second is one ampere. 15 coulombs per second is 15 amperes.
3393160	3398200	We'll talk again more next chapter on that. Currents measure in ampere is that it's represented
3398200	3402120	by the capital letter a. So if you go out to your fuse box in your car and pull a fuse out,
3402120	3410280	it says 15a next to it, that stands for 15 amps. Universally accepted. Universally accepted.
3412360	3416760	Potential, the ability of a source to perform electrical work. What we're talking about here
3416760	3424440	with potential is voltage. Difference in potential causes electrons to move or flow in a circuit.
3424440	3432200	This is referred to as EMF or Electromotive Force or Voltage. EMF, Electromotive Force,
3432200	3434680	Voltage, Difference in Potential, they're all synonymous.
3440440	3447000	Voltage, ring bells, chimes, hit the gong, is the force that moves electrons in the circuit.
3447240	3453800	It's the pressure or pump that moves electrons, represented by the capital letter e or the
3453800	3461160	capital letter v. Whether you use e or v, here the textbook uses e, you could use v if you want,
3462120	3467240	as long as you know what we're talking about. It's universally accepted. The unit of measure is called
3467560	3479080	the Volt. Resistance, the opposition to the flow of electrons, the degree of resistance depends on
3479080	3487240	size, shape, and temperature, and it's measured in ohms. Named after George Simon Ohm, represented
3487240	3492920	by the Greek letter omega. One of the things I want you to familiarize yourself with is,
3492920	3501480	you know what has resistance? Everything, everything except superconductors. And superconductors
3501480	3505800	only exist in the laboratory right now. Hopefully when you buy an extension cord,
3505800	3513400	that extension cord has a low amount of resistance. Okay? Hopefully when you buy new spark plug wires
3513400	3518920	for your car and they're insulated, hopefully the outside of the spark plug wires has a high
3518920	3530120	amount of resistance. Make sense? Conductors have low resistance to current flow. That's why
3530120	3537320	they're called conductors. They have many free electrons to transfer the energy. Insulators
3537320	3546120	have high resistance to current flow, very few electrons. In summary, tonight we talked about
3546120	3552440	matter. We talked about elements, the fundamental building block in nature. We talked about atomic
3552440	3559720	structure, specifically subatomic particles and a place, right? Nucleus is not a particle, it's a
3559720	3565320	place, which that place contains the protons, the neutrons, and the electrons. Protons are
3565320	3572040	positively charged, neutrons are neutrally charged, and electrons, well those are the other ones,
3572040	3578360	they're negatively charged. We talked about atomic number, number of protons in an atom. Atomic
3578360	3582920	weight, number of protons, and number of neutrons in an atom. We talked about shell. These are the
3582920	3587560	orbital arrangements of the electrons, starting with the K shell, going all the way up to the Q
3587560	3592920	shell. We talked about ionization, the process of taking things out of a neutral natural state.
3594520	3601320	We talked about current. Current is the flow of electrons from negative to positive. Why?
3601320	3605800	Because it wants to get back into a neutral natural state. We talked about the coulomb,
3605800	3611400	6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. It's a number of electrons, like a dozen eggs,
3611400	3613640	a bushel of apples, a gallon of gasoline.
3616280	3624760	We talked about the ampere. The ampere is one coulomb per second. We talked about electronic
3624760	3630040	or electric current that is measured in the ampere. And then finally we talked about potential or
3630040	3634040	electromotive force. What we're talking about there is difference in potential or voltage.
3635160	3640280	Does anybody have any questions on anything that I covered in a lecture for chapter one?
3646040	3648920	Going once. Going twice.
3653960	3655960	What's that?
3656520	3659640	Yes, these slides are on the website. The audio recording is on the website,
3659640	3661880	and eventually we're going to get the video uploaded as well.
3664440	3666040	But the content will remain the same.
3669560	3674520	New Google site. Any other questions? Going once, going twice, going, going.
3678520	3684120	The new Google site. The last one that's listed there, the HTTPS sites, google.com,
3684760	3689080	LWTC electronics. I've got that turned on. Anybody with the address should be able to get in there.
3689640	3692600	We haven't uploaded this material to it yet, but it should be there.
3702040	3709320	So I'm like messed up. Is that what you're saying? All right. I messed up. Cool. Cool.
3710040	3715800	That's why you got the job as TA. You're here to keep me honest. Any other questions? Once, twice?
3720680	3725960	I honestly don't know. I mean, it's pretty far down. It is a conductor, of course.
3728680	3731800	It's real close on a periodic table. It's amazingly close to silver.
3732600	3744440	And that's why actually in solder, we used to contain lead, but because lead is lead,
3744440	3749320	and it's bad, they realized it was really, really bad. So we pulled it out of solder,
3749320	3755960	but it was used to join in complete electrical circuits. So it's pretty high.
3755960	3758600	I don't know its actual conductivity value, but it's pretty high.
3759560	3763560	And once, going twice, going, going. Go on. We're black.
3765880	3773560	The next questions that I have for ELEC 110, Chapter 1, you'll be answering for me on a quiz.
3774360	3778200	But don't worry. Well, you'll have another week or so before we take the quiz. I'll coordinate
3778200	3782120	with the class lead on that. Any other questions about protocol? Anything else we're doing here?
3783320	3785880	All right. I'm going to go ahead and cut you loose. We don't
3789480	3794280	know. Okay. Last week, wrapping up lecture, we're talking about electrical insulators.
3794280	3800600	We're talking about conductors, things of this nature, right? I dug out of my archives here.
3803160	3811160	Remember, I talked to you about mica? mica? I found my stash, my private stash of mica.
3811160	3817880	Please be very careful passing this around. It actually kind of flakes off, so you can
3817880	3821640	just handle it, look at it. This is found in nature. It's found in rock formations.
3821640	3831880	And this is the best insulator found in nature. This is a washer, an insulator washer that's
3831880	3837000	been made out of mica. Okay, so we'll pass these things around so you can see. But these are very
3837000	3843400	fragile. Don't try to bend it. You'll break it. It's almost like a real thin piece of glass,
3843400	3851320	if you will. So this is mica in the raw, and this is a processed piece that could be used as an
3851320	3860440	electrical insulator. So cool stuff. So anybody have any questions on anything else before we get
3860440	3883880	started here? Chapter number two. Okay, just to get us kind of ramped up from where we left off
3883880	3891320	last week. Really started our discussions last week talking about the fundamental properties
3892200	3898920	of electricity. And that discussion really started off with a discussion about matter.
3899720	3908040	Matter is everything. If there is no matter, the absence of matter is called space. We could
3908040	3917320	recreate the absence of matter here on planet Earth by using an industrial vacuum chamber.
3917320	3923160	That's where we pump all the gases out of the chamber, and we're left with nothing inside.
3924440	3931400	Industrial vacuum is used a lot in industry, in the manufacturing process, so that they could
3931400	3937720	remove everything from it and only introduce those materials that they want to be inside the
3937720	3945880	chamber. Remember that discussion? The next thing we talked about, which is very, very critical,
3945880	3953160	are the properties, the fundamental physics properties, if you will, of materials that are
3953160	3958760	used in electrical and electronics applications. The most popular that we talked about is the
3958840	3965960	conductor. The conductor is a material that has three or fewer valence electrons, electrons in
3965960	3971880	the valence shell. That means basically we talked about it like a parking garage. There's room for
3971880	3976840	electrons to park in this valence shell, therefore it's going to make it a good conductor. Materials
3976840	3981480	that have five or more electrons in the valence shell are good insulators, like that piece of
3981480	3987080	mica that we're passing around right now. If you looked at that, you'd see, again, more than five
3987080	3992520	electrons in the valence shell. That means if you're a free electron, you're not going to have any
3992520	4000360	place to park on that piece of mica. We also talked about semiconductor materials. Those are materials
4000360	4006040	that have four electrons in the valence shell, and for those of you that continue on in this program,
4006040	4011160	ELEC 120, that's right where we're going to pick up the discussion, back to fundamental properties
4011160	4017560	of physics as it pertains to materials. If any of you were in the classroom the other night last
4017560	4023480	week, I gave that lecture to ELEC 120, and we were talking about these fundamental properties,
4023480	4030040	subatomic structure, because that discussion was all about solid state materials, silicon,
4030040	4033720	germanium that we use in the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits.
4034120	4044120	The other big thing we talked about is, in essence, the beginning, the creation of electricity.
4045480	4053160	When we have matter and we impart energy on matter, we could knock an electron off
4053960	4059640	that valence shell. When we knock an electron off that valence shell, we end up with what's known as
4059640	4070360	a positive ion, a positive ion, because remember in nature, matter is typically in a neutral state.
4070360	4074920	That means it has an equal number of protons and an equal number of electrons. Remember that?
4074920	4083960	That's how we end up with the atomic weight. Atomic weight or atomic number? Which one is it?
4084200	4092440	A is weight, B is number on the quiz. C is both. D is none of the above. Which one's it going to be?
4093960	4104360	The number of protons is number. So that number, whatever number of protons we have,
4104360	4109080	we also have the same number of electrons. That's what puts it in a neutral natural state.
4109160	4114280	So when I impart energy on matter and I knock an electron off, now I have more protons that have
4114280	4120040	a positive charge than I have electrons in the atom that makes it a positive ion. In essence,
4120040	4127640	what I just did is created electricity. That's what electricity is. Electricity is also playing
4127640	4132840	energy to matter, knocking an electron off, gathering those electrons and then saying,
4132840	4137560	hey electrons, have I got a deal for you? You want to get back to your parent atom
4138040	4143960	and get it into a neutral natural state? Come this way. Go through this circuit. Do a little bit
4143960	4151800	of work for me and then I'll give you a path back to neutrality. And the electrons, they do this.
4151800	4157480	So part of your careers in the electronics industry is going to be simply managing
4157480	4163000	the behavior of electrons, making sure the electrons do what they're supposed to do.
4163960	4171480	I guess that's why they call this electronics, electronics, the study of the behavior of the
4171480	4178040	electron. So this is all about. The other thing we talked about last week briefly was the coulomb,
4178040	4185240	a unit of measure. A coulomb is like a gallon of gas, a dozen eggs, a bushel of apples.
4185960	4193880	A coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. It's a big, huge, herken number of electrons.
4193880	4198600	There was a guy by the name of Charles de Coulomb. He was counting electrons for a living and then he
4198600	4203960	died. And then he said, hey, anybody here want to continue on Chuck's work? Anyone? Anyone? All
4203960	4208280	right, we'll just call it even. We'll call the number that he came up with, 6.24 times 10 to
4208280	4216280	the 18th. We'll call that a coulomb. One coulomb per second is the ampere that was that was put
4216280	4222440	together by a guy by the name of Charles. Charles ampere? No, André ampere. Another Frenchman
4222440	4231720	or beret. André Marie ampere. And you know what? Universally that's accepted. See, the amazing
4231720	4235720	thing, I enjoy travel, travel all around the world. People speak different languages. We use
4235720	4242520	different coins, different monetary values. When it comes to current worldwide, the ampere
4242520	4250280	is the accepted value that we use, no matter where you go. So those of you that are learning
4251240	4257000	or if you have English as a second language and you struggle with this, we're all learning
4257000	4261720	a new language. It's the language of electronics. And the word we're going to study tonight
4261800	4269800	is current. Current. And you already know kind of a little bit about current based on our lecture
4269800	4274600	last week. Well, we're going to pull back to curtains and study a little bit more tonight.
4274600	4280360	After completing this chapter, you're going to be able to state two laws of electrostatic charges.
4281320	4285640	I'm going to give you a heads up. Anytime you see the word law, you should like sit up straight
4285640	4292040	and take note. Because if it's a law, the type of laws we're talking about here are not laws that
4292040	4297480	we could go to Olympia and have repealed. They're not talking about laws that we could go to the
4297480	4302920	Supreme Court and have overturned. That actually would be kind of fun, wouldn't it? Go to Washington,
4302920	4307240	D.C. Students from Lake Washington Technical College in Kirkland, Washington protested today
4307240	4312440	outside the Capitol to have the laws of physics repealed. We can't. These are laws of physics.
4312520	4319800	Okay? So these electrostatic charge laws are kind of critical. We're going to be able to define
4319800	4327480	coulomb. Identify the unit used to measure current flow. Define the relationship of amps,
4328200	4336680	coulombs, and time through formula. Describe how current flows in a circuit. Describe how electrons
4336680	4345800	travel in a conductor. Define and use scientific notation. And identify commonly used prefixes
4345800	4352520	for powers of ten. Some of you may be familiar with this law. You've probably heard it before.
4354680	4359720	The first law of electrostatic charges are like charges repel each other.
4360360	4367080	Have all of you heard that one before? Okay? The other thing that you're probably familiar
4367080	4373880	with is like opposites attract. Right? Opposites attract. That's not only in relationships. That's
4373880	4380280	actually the laws of electrostatic charges. Opposites attract is actually the second law
4380280	4387000	of electrostatic charges. So if I got a negative and a negative, they're going to oppose each other.
4387000	4390840	If I have a positive and a positive, they're going to oppose each other. If I got a negative and a
4390840	4393640	positive, pow, they're going to be attracted to each other.
4397480	4402280	Yep, very similar. That's not electrostatic. That's magnetism. It's a different property,
4402280	4407240	but the same thing. North's going to be attracted to south. You've got two north poles. They're not
4407240	4411080	going to be attracted. They're actually going to push back on each other. Two south poles, the same
4411080	4416760	thing. So we're actually going to study that in future chapters. But this is the law of electrostatic,
4416920	4426440	electromagnetic. So just keep those two separate. Coulomb. Coulomb is the unit adopted for measuring
4426440	4434200	charges. In last week in lecture, I gave you the number 6.24 x 10 to the 18th. I figure I'd
4434200	4437800	wait a week before I actually showed you what that number looks like. I mean, it's one thing for me
4437800	4443400	to say up on the board at 6.24, then 16 zeros after. But this is really what the number looks like.
4443640	4452680	Okay? It's really what the number looks like. One of the reasons that we need to use this form of
4452680	4461160	notation is that this number right here will not fit in your calculator. It won't fit in your
4461160	4467000	calculator unless you enter it in this form. And I'll show you. By the end of lecture, I'll show
4467000	4471800	you how to make sure you know how to enter it in that form. It's kind of funny because if you had
4472360	4476440	your neighbor down the street or whatever and you found out that they were going to college
4477400	4481960	in an accounting program, right? If they're going to go to school to become an accountant,
4481960	4489400	you'd probably say, wow, that person must be really good with numbers. Okay? Tell you what,
4489400	4494920	if you're Bill Gates accountant, you're not dealing with a number like this. Okay? But yeah,
4494920	4499160	regularly on a daily basis in the study of electronics, we're going to be dealing with
4499160	4508200	numbers like this. So if you're struggling with this form of notation, we'll work with you.
4508200	4513720	But don't be like me. When I was in school initially like this, I looked at this number and I looked
4513720	4518760	at this stuff and, ah, man, I don't know, that's too complex. It's like, you know, 6.24 times 10
4518760	4523480	to the 18th. That's a number like Mr. Spock would use or something on a Starship Enterprise. And
4523480	4528600	I'm a more down-to-earth guy, so I'm going to keep it basic, you know? And in very short order,
4528600	4532120	I realized you can't keep it basic in electronics because we're going to be dealing with these
4532120	4540280	extreme numbers. So we have to use this form of notation. So you see how we came up with this 10,
4540840	4549640	6.24 times 10 to the 18th? The decimal point here means there's 18 places past it. So if we
4549640	4556760	went ahead and actually counted here, all right, that's like us moving the decimal place from here
4559400	4566360	all the way up to here. So if we went ahead and count, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
4567000	4582280	10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So 6 decimal point 2, 4 times 10 to the 18th. That means there's
4582360	4587480	18 places past the decimal point. In this particular case, since I have
4588760	4598440	0.24, that means there's going to be 16 zeros after it, right? 16, 17, 18. 16 zeros after that. Does
4598440	4606360	that make sense? Everybody see how I did that? All right. There's our first law of electrostatic
4606360	4611240	charges, negative and a negative, positive and a positive, negative and a positive, uh-huh,
4612600	4618520	uh-huh. Because remember, in the beginning, everything was in a neutral, natural state anyway,
4618520	4625560	right? So originally, everything was like harmonious, balanced. When we apply energy to matter, we
4625560	4632840	knock an electron off that valence shell, and all is that valence shell, that electron that we
4632840	4637720	knocked off has in mind is getting back and putting that atom in a neutral, natural state.
4639560	4645080	So if you put an electron in the same room with a positive ion, they're going to seek
4645080	4649640	each other out. They want to achieve balance and harmony. Makes sense?
4654440	4661480	Current. Current. And every time I use this word here, we should like ring bells, chimes,
4661480	4667000	hit a gong, something like that. Because this is like a holy word in electronics. There's four
4667000	4672520	properties that you really need to be infatuated with. And when I say infatuated with, I'm not
4672520	4677800	talking about just as a student, I'm talking about later on when you continue on with your career.
4679160	4684360	The worst day you have in this industry is a paid electronics professional. The problem will be
4684360	4689800	solved by understanding and knowing the behavior of voltage, current, resistance and power, period.
4689800	4694520	Do I sound like I'm oversimplifying it? I'm not. It gets that basic. If they've got an
4694520	4698520	electrical problem with the space shuttle and they can't, you know, they can't hit the button and
4698520	4703320	have it blast off, it's because voltage, current, resistance or power isn't doing what it's supposed
4703320	4707400	to be doing. So if you know everything about those four parameters on the space shuttle,
4707400	4711640	you could get in and look at those four parameters and quickly find where the problem is.
4713640	4717320	So today we're talking about current. We should ring bells, hit chimes, hit a gong,
4717320	4723080	or something because current is one of the big four properties. Now the textbook talks about
4723080	4729800	current as being the drift of electrons from an area of negative charge to an area of positive
4729800	4735320	charge. I don't like this definition, the drift of electrons. It makes it look like
4737960	4741640	I'm an electron and I'm drifting, I'm floating. Okay?
4741640	4750680	An electron is more like if I'm negative charge and there's like positive ions out in the freaking
4750680	4761240	hall, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be trying to get over there. Why? Because I want to fill
4761240	4767960	those holes. I want to fill the void that was created when energy was imparted on matter. Does
4768040	4772520	that make sense? So that's really the behavior of current. As a matter of fact, there's a kind of
4772520	4779080	mad dash. I bet you didn't think I had it in me, huh? It gets better than that. You know how quickly
4779080	4783240	electrons are going to go over there if you can complete the path at the speed of light,
4784360	4788200	at the speed of light. If we allow electrons to complete the path,
4790200	4793720	it's going to travel at the speed of light. So I don't call that the drift
4793960	4804360	of electrons, negative to positive. Now, Andre Marie Ampere came up with this term that he called
4804360	4810120	the Ampere, named it after himself. These dudes didn't have egos. You kidding? They didn't have egos.
4811080	4817800	Andre Marie Ampere invented a unit of measure called the Smith. Now, the Ampere. The Ampere is
4817800	4823960	the amount of current in a conductor when one coulomb of charge moves past the point in one
4823960	4830920	second. This is kind of emotional. This is your first real formula. It's your first real formula.
4830920	4837880	The relationship between Ampere's and coulombs per second can be as expressed as i, which is current,
4838040	4853480	is equal to q charge measured in coulombs divided by t time measured in seconds. So what we're saying
4853480	4865400	here is one amp or ampere is equal to one coulomb per second. Now, be careful with this, because I
4865400	4871720	could ask you a question about number of electrons. Is number of electrons coulombs? Number of electrons
4871720	4880600	is number of electrons. Coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. So this formula only works
4882840	4890360	if you're using coulombs. What happens if I have half a coulomb per second? It's not a trick question.
4891080	4898040	If I have half a coulomb per second, what's my current going to be? Half an amp. If I have
4898040	4905000	quarter a coulomb per second, what's it going to be? Quarter of an amp. If I have two coulombs per
4905000	4910840	second, this is a trick question. No, just kidding. Two coulombs per second. That means I'm going to have
4911640	4919400	two amps. So typically for household current in your home, we talked about this last week,
4919400	4924040	what was that number? What's your typical utility connection from the power company to your home?
4926440	4935640	That's the voltage. What's the typical box? Typically about 200 amps is a typical residential
4935640	4941560	connection. You know, you buy a home, you're going to see that it's typically 200 amp connection
4941560	4946120	from the power pole or if you have underground service to your box, that big gray box that's in
4946120	4952840	your house, 200 amps. From that box, the circuits in your home get distributed to circuits that are
4952840	4961240	typically either 15 amps or in some cases 20 amps. And for some of your appliances,
4962520	4966120	they'll be a little bit higher in some cases. If you have an electric hot water heater or
4966120	4971640	things like that, I've got a hot tub. It requires more than 15 amps, more than 20 amps. I've got a
4971640	4979000	high current connection going to that. So if you've got 15 amp outlet in your home, that means
4979000	4989080	that outlet is capable of handling how many coulombs per second? 15. 15. I could also ask you,
4989080	4994680	how many electrons per second can I handle? Then you'd have to get 6.24 times 10 to 18
4994680	4999720	times 15, and that's how many electrons it would be, physically, that that's capable
5000680	5007320	of supporting. That's why it's so critical that all of these components, when they're manufactured
5007320	5011560	and they're given their specifications, that you don't exceed those specifications. Because if you
5011560	5015560	try fitting more electrons through than it's physically capable of handling, you're going to
5015560	5022280	start an electrical fire. Okay, so everything has ratings associated with the current ratings,
5022280	5027720	and this is why, physically, it can't handle any more electrons. If you try pumping, you know,
5027720	5034120	if you've got a garden hose and connected it to a fire engine, okay, and turn the pumps on high,
5034120	5037960	what do you think's going to happen to that garden hose? It's probably going to blow up,
5037960	5043480	it's probably going to explode, right? It can't handle that volume. That's why firemen have like
5043480	5048920	big hoses, okay? Because they have a higher volume of water that they try to put, you know,
5048920	5055160	from the truck onto the fire. That's why they're firefighters, fire people.
5057160	5061800	Make sense? The other thing I want to share with you about formulas, okay?
5063880	5067960	If there's shortcuts that I could teach you and you could remember, I'm all about that.
5069160	5073320	This is college, so whenever I give you a formula, I'm just going to give it as formula and assume
5073320	5076840	that all of you are like college students that have paid your dues and are here for the right
5076840	5082840	reasons. So I'm not going to show you every possible variation of the formula. I'm going to
5082840	5087240	expect you to know how to do it on your own. But I don't expect you to know how to do it on your
5087240	5092280	own because all of you don't have a comprehensive algebra background yet. So I'm going to show
5092280	5101880	you a couple shortcuts here, a way to cheat. What I want you to do is start off with drawing a triangle.
5106920	5108680	I'm going to draw a simple triangle.
5111640	5114920	Then inside the triangle, I want you to draw a t.
5119400	5125560	The one formula that you know, I want you to plug into this triangle. So i, in this particular
5125560	5137720	case, i is equal to q over t. Does everybody see how I did that? i is equal to q divided by t.
5139080	5148840	So that's the first formula that I gave you. i is equal to q over t. Now on a quiz or an exam,
5148840	5152280	or simply when you're hanging out together working with each other in the lab,
5152920	5157080	what happens if I gave you coulombs and I gave you current?
5159480	5167960	Then what we could do is simply cover up the letter t and say t is equal to q over
5169560	5179640	i. So I did that. So t is equal to q over i. That's the other algebraic manipulation of this.
5179640	5188520	If I asked you on a quiz if I said if I gave you current and I gave you time and I want you to
5188520	5197160	figure out how many coulombs, what the value of coulombs would be, then we simply cover up the q
5197160	5206440	and then it's going to be i times t. See the i is next to the t, so it's going to be i times t.
5206440	5215800	So that's going to be our other variation. q is equal to i times t. So with that one formula
5215800	5222600	that I gave you, there's three basic algebraic manipulations that we could have, and this is
5222600	5228600	all of them. So do you have to memorize these? No. Remember, do the triangle, put the t in the
5228600	5234520	center, and then lay that one formula out, and then now you have all the algebraic variations
5234520	5239800	of that formula. And you know what? You need to know how to do this, because I could ask you.
5239800	5244680	I'll be honest with you. Everything right now is fair game. I could ask you to solve for current.
5244680	5248360	You should be able to do it. I could ask you to solve for time. You should be able to do it.
5248360	5251000	I should ask you to be able to solve for coulombs, and you should be able to do it.
5251640	5261320	I should be able to give you a number of electrons, right? You have 30 gazillion electrons.
5261320	5266600	How many coulombs is that? That gives you this value. Then you could figure out the rest. Does
5266600	5271800	that make sense? So it's a stepping stone. But don't get hung up on what you don't know.
5271800	5277000	Focus always on what you do know. And the one thing to remember is one amp is one coulomb per
5277000	5283080	second. i is equal to q over t. And then if you lay that out, it gives you all the other variations.
5283080	5292440	Does that make sense? Hold. An all-female progressive rock band from Seattle, Washington.
5292440	5310840	Hold. That's a joke. Is hold even still around? No? No? No. When did they disband? Where did they go?
5313880	5316600	She's doing her own thing. Dad, it's where I understand she's doing her own thing.
5320680	5325960	It's a reference. What Beavis and Butthead do America, right? There's a reference to whole. Not
5325960	5330760	this whole, but the other whole. Remember, they were... No, seriously. They were going...
5331800	5334920	Remember Beavis and Butthead do America? They're looking for their TV, or the TV
5334920	5339000	broke, and they stole one, and whatever they're doing. But they were going to go to Washington,
5339560	5343400	like DC. But when they heard about Washington, they were like, Washington, that's cool. That's
5343400	5349800	like where Seattle is. We could go see whole. Anyway, that's required viewing for all of you.
5350600	5354440	Beavis and Butthead do America. That's going to help you understand. Anyway, no, I'm not talking
5354440	5361400	about a different type of whole. Whole that I'm talking about here is the absence of an electron.
5362120	5370120	If I have an atom, and I apply energy to matter, and I knock that electron loose,
5372200	5378680	what do I leave behind? A whole. So a whole is nothing more than the absence of an electron.
5380920	5387480	The reason I want to point this out to you is that here at Lake Washington Technical College,
5387480	5393720	every other technical and community college in Washington State, in the country, the U.S.
5393720	5399640	military, all branches of the U.S. military, technical schools, a lot of universities all
5399640	5408200	embrace what we embrace, and that is electron flow. We call one amp 6.24 times 10 to the 18th
5408200	5412440	electrons traveling per second. That's what we call one amp, right?
5415960	5424040	Engineers, scientists embrace what's called whole flow. They think that the holes are flowing
5424840	5429880	to get filled by the electrons. I don't want any of you to lose sleep over this.
5429880	5435320	Whether 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons travel in that direction per second, that's an amp,
5435320	5440840	or at 6.24 times 10 to the 18th holes that travel in that direction per second, that's going to be
5440840	5446760	an amp. But whole is the absence of the electron. And the reason I'm pointing this out to you is
5446760	5449400	I know all of you this weekend, as soon as you get a little bit of time off, you're probably
5449400	5453240	going to go to the library and pick up some electronic books, start reading. I don't want
5453240	5458840	you to call me a liar, and I want you to open up that book and say, hold on. This book shows
5458840	5463320	that current flows positive to negative. That Joe Greenock over there at that Lake Wash,
5463320	5468120	he doesn't know what he's talking about. He said that current flows negative to positive.
5468120	5474200	Current does flow negative to positive. Electron flow. Current also flows positive to negative.
5475240	5481240	Whole flow. Are any of you going to go home and lose sleep over this? Be honest with me.
5482600	5486840	Let me know, because I did. Honestly, when I was in school, I got the same lecture I'm giving you
5486840	5490680	right now, and I'm like, oh no, I didn't raise my hand, but then I went home and I'm like scratching
5490680	5494920	head. What the heck was he talking about? You know, and I like months for months, I freaking
5494920	5501560	tried to add, it's not that difficult of a concept. You just got to hit the I believe button. Joe says
5501560	5509320	6.24 times 78T electrons per second equals one amp, so be it. We do want to talk about
5509320	5514360	whole briefly so you can differentiate between electron flow and whole flow, and also to prepare
5514360	5519880	you for what you are about to receive in the future. Because again, if you sat in on my lecture
5519880	5526920	last week on ELEC 120, guess what? We started talking about whole flow again, because whole
5526920	5533720	flow is significant in the study of semiconductor devices, solid state devices. If you want to
5533720	5541160	understand how a transistor really works, you have to embrace whole flow. So we are going to
5541160	5546440	talk about it more here at Lake Washington, but you don't need to beat yourself to death on it.
5546440	5553240	Question? Well, you got to realize that the whole itself, though, is the absence.
5554760	5560680	But if you're talking about matter that exists, and it's the absence of the electron,
5560680	5564440	that we're really talking about a positive ion, and a positive ion does have mass,
5564440	5568200	because you got all your protons, you got all your neutrons, and of course that's how we determine
5568200	5578360	atomic weight. Very good answer. A, the atomic weight number of protons and neutrons. So whole
5578360	5582840	is the movement of an electron from one atom to the next, creating the appearance of a positive
5582840	5590360	charge moving in the opposite direction. So that's what we call whole flow. If you had a piece of
5590360	5598200	copper, which we know copper is a good abundant conductor, this is kind of how the electron path,
5599240	5605800	how it would work. Negative to positive, kind of copper atom, it would jump over here to copper
5605800	5613240	atom, jump over here to copper atom. Make sense? Drifting along at the speed of light.
5613320	5621480	This here we see, again, a conductor. We've got electron flow left to right,
5621480	5628840	current flow left to right, whole flow right to left. Make sense?
5631720	5636040	Okay. I want to show you something, how this really works, because the way they're making this
5636040	5641880	look, and I think you guys are all buying this, right? Because, again, you kind of got to believe
5641880	5650760	me, right? But this is kind of like the free electron is kind of like hopping from copper atom
5650760	5655400	to copper atom, because there's three or fewer electrons in a valence shell, right? It's kind of
5655400	5660440	hopping along, hopping along just another copper atom, you know? You ever jump across a stream,
5660440	5666680	right? It's kind of what they make it look like here, right? Everybody at this table here, can you
5666680	5672440	just back up here? Nobody has a coffee or anything on here, okay? Can you put your hand on the end
5672440	5677320	of the table just like this, okay? Okay, let me know how quickly you feel this.
5682120	5687080	That is how current flows through a conductor. That's how current flows through a conductor.
5687080	5694280	The speed of light, instantaneous, instantaneous. If I've got a negative here and I've got a positive
5694280	5699880	there, pow, instantly that is going to be felt on the other side. That's how current flows through
5699880	5707880	a conductor. So it's not this. Got to have your tongue out when you're doing it too, right?
5707880	5712840	It doesn't work like that. It's instantaneous. The speed of light, which is important,
5714680	5721320	186,000 miles per second. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.
5721560	5726680	Or for those of you on the metric system, 300 million meters per second.
5728040	5735560	300 million meters per second. Or for those of you that keep track of all things nautical,
5735560	5741400	161,000 nautical miles per second. And I got a couple of chuckles out there. It's kind of,
5741400	5746920	well, Joe's ex-Navy, he would probably know that. No, I'll tell you what. If you know those three
5746920	5752760	numbers, 186,000 miles per second, 300 million meters per second, 161,000 nautical miles per
5752760	5757320	second. If you know those three numbers, you could probably get about eight or nine questions
5757320	5767400	right on your FCC license exam. Because it's how RF energy transmits as well. If you're working on a
5767400	5772680	radar, you want to get your radar endorsement to be able to work on a radar, the only radar in the
5772680	5780600	world that I am familiar with that operates in statute miles is the radar that's operated by
5780600	5787880	the police. If you're on a Washington state ferry and they're looking at a radar, that radar is
5787880	5794680	calibrated for nautical miles. So all the math that takes place internal is 161,000 nautical miles
5794680	5800120	per second. If you go to work for the Federal Aviation Administration and you work at Seattle
5800120	5805480	Traycon that keeps track of all the aircraft arriving to Seattle and departing Seattle,
5805480	5812680	the radar that they're looking at is calibrated in nautical miles. And the aircraft also travel
5812680	5823720	speed-wise in knots. In knots, which is nautical miles calibration standard. So that's why those
5823720	5828520	numbers are very important. That's how fast current travels, that's how fast radio frequency
5828520	5833560	energy travels at the speed of light or close to the speed of light. There's actually some
5833560	5839080	atmospheric anomalies that kind of slow it up a little bit, but generally speaking it's a speed
5839080	5844040	of light, which is also important to realize. That's why it's so great you got me as an instructor
5844040	5848600	because you could learn from all of my goofy mistakes. Back when I was in the Navy, the only
5848600	5854440	way that I could get a raise, the only way that I could increase rank was obviously not getting in
5854520	5862120	trouble for a period of time, which is actually another funny story. I'll show that one with you
5862120	5868200	in a second. I forgot all about it. But anyway, the other thing is by taking professional examinations
5868200	5873000	twice a year. And I remember one of the exams, you would have thought I would have been ramped
5873000	5878040	up with this stuff. I got to this whole section of the exam once when I was trying to go up and rank
5878920	5883480	and they started talking about the behavior of antennas in outer space.
5884760	5891000	And I was like, I'm a submarine guy. I have no freaking clue how this antenna is going to behave
5891000	5896280	in outer space. What the heck are they talking about? The Navy's got like people in outer space
5896280	5900120	and I just got myself into a tailspin and I just I couldn't even answer anything
5900120	5904840	instead of looking at the obvious. How do antennas behave in outer space?
5904840	5910600	Perfectly. Theoretically, perfectly. That's what they were looking at. So I got all those
5910600	5914760	questions wrong because I could just, they're talking about going to freaking outer space.
5914760	5922280	I'm not going outer space. I'm going to live beneath the sea. So more on that, on keeping
5922280	5926360	out of trouble. Can't make this stuff up. I was looking at a copy of my medical record.
5926360	5930360	I have a copy of my military medical record at home and I was looking through it and I came upon
5931080	5935560	on a page. I got into a slight altercation and actually the medical record
5937800	5945480	reveals 25 year old Caucasian reported to sick call reports being worked over by two bouncers
5946840	5953160	and then it goes into how I slept well and I woke up somewhat sore and basically I reported
5953160	5958200	the sick call and it was I had a crushed my cheekbone got broken and one eye was pointing one way
5958200	5961800	and the other eye was pointing the other way and finally they said yeah you got to go get that
5961800	5967640	looked at but right in there print reports being worked over by two bouncers called my son over
5967640	5972280	I said check this out it's kind of cool I should have that frame put that in my office my medical
5972280	5984280	record you know but anyway I was a good sailor. Voltage source and again we should almost ring
5984280	5988920	bells chimes hit gongs when we're talking about voltage source and I hope you don't think that
5988920	5994680	I'm over exaggerating this these first few chapters are what we're talking about are the
5994680	6002920	fundamentals you have to understand this stuff a hundred percent now you need at least a 70
6002920	6008840	percent to pass this class if I were truly the pope of electronics I'd say no you don't move on to
6008840	6013640	the next module the next chapter until you prove a hundred percent because this is how critical
6013640	6019800	this information is voltage source what we're talking about here is a power supply
6022280	6030040	it supplies electrons from one end of the conductor and it removes electrons from the
6030040	6035880	other end of the conductor it can be thought of for those of you that like using analogies
6035880	6041960	fluid systems it could be like a pump what does a pump do it sucks from one end it pushes out from
6041960	6050200	the other end right this is what a voltage source does it basically supplies electrons from one end
6050200	6057960	and then sucks them back from the other end that has to be taking place or it's not a valid voltage
6057960	6066120	source so a battery is a voltage source we're going to talk more about batteries of future
6066120	6071640	chapters right provides electrons on the negative end of the battery and it collects those electrons
6071640	6077800	of the positive end of the battery that's what makes it a battery it's what makes it a voltage
6077800	6085400	source and we need a viable voltage source in order for us to have a viable circuit
6088920	6094840	well finally we're going to talk about scientific notation but we're not actually what i want to
6094840	6099880	talk to all of you about tonight is what's known as engineering notation
6102840	6107960	anybody here really comfortable using scientific notation if you're really comfortable using
6107960	6113240	scientific notation i guess you keep using it but i would encourage you instead to use
6113800	6121240	engineering notation the difference is scientific notation can be times 10
6123080	6128760	to the first power second third fourth fifth sixth seventh they can be anything you follow what i'm
6128760	6136920	saying can you dig it engineering notation is always going to be in groups of three
6137880	6144280	it's always going to be in groups of three which lends itself very well to what we're doing here
6145000	6153720	in electronics let me show you
6157320	6159240	let's start off with a decimal point
6160200	6169720	oops that is there's the decimal point okay so if i put something to the left of the decimal
6169720	6177400	point this is going to be my base 10 this is going to be my ones column so this number here
6177400	6185640	could be anywhere from zero to nine if i get nine and i add one to it nine plus one equals
6186600	6194360	10 so i've got to go to my tens column so this is my tens column this is my ones column can you
6194360	6201880	dig it this is the part that i did well in school too the number line okay if i get up to the
6201880	6211800	number 99 and i add one to 99 now i go i increment to the hundreds column okay so we're familiar
6211800	6219000	ones tens hundreds cool okay so those are going to be my basic units of measure this could be
6219000	6231320	pounds ounces volts amps miles whatever now if i go here to my thousands column one thousand column
6231880	6243400	basically what i'm doing now is this is times 10 to the third times 10 to the third everything
6243400	6249800	in here will be times 10 to the third this could be one times 10 to the third 22 times 10 to the
6249800	6257800	third 943 times 10 to the third makes sense the reason that i'm so infatuated with having you
6257800	6269160	put it in engineering notation is by 10 to the third we're going to call this value here in the
6269160	6280920	metric system what what's thousands in in metric kilo very good kilo so what we're going to do is
6280920	6291880	we're going to call this small letter k kilo so instead of saying 1000 i'll say 1k instead of
6291880	6305400	saying 943 thousand i'll say 943 kilo kilo pounds kilo ounces kilo miles kilo volts kilo ohms make
6305400	6326280	sense kilo miles there's a new one for you well metrics it's in metrics but if you put it into
6326280	6332920	engineering groups of three then it's going to fit directly into those prefixes those metric prefixes
6333880	6343160	so three more places past the decimal point one two three this is times 10 to the sixth we're going
6343160	6356040	to call this mega mega in an actuality it's like millions right one million ten millions hundred
6356040	6373960	millions mega 10 to the ninth what's that giga very good capital letter g giga
6376200	6379880	when i first got into this industry i'm dating myself i don't know why i say that make myself
6379880	6387240	feel old this is as far like as we had gone in the electronics industry general electronics
6388040	6395640	giga wow and i'll be honest with you where i used to work in electronic intelligence
6395640	6402040	the only people that could that could afford to play up here in giga values were superpowers
6402760	6407320	it was either us or the soviets and we knew what we had so if i detected something that was in
6407320	6417720	giga hertz it had to be the soviets okay now giga commonplace after school today you could
6417720	6423240	probably stop at fred meyer pick up a laptop computer that's got a you know 80 gigabyte drive in it
6423240	6429960	for 49 that's actually too much money 49 bucks you could get a
6437320	6439240	times 10 to the 12th terra
6442840	6446520	terra also happens to be a barista down in federal way that's kind of got it going on if you know
6446520	6456520	what i mean i don't i don't even know what i mean i don't even know what that is terra
6462440	6466120	when i first started teaching here 20 years ago at like washington technical college
6468920	6473960	i can't even remember i think i might have had like an 80 meg hard drive or something
6473960	6481160	i remember getting super jazzed by getting the sunday seattle times and i saw an ad in the paper
6481160	6488680	that i could get like a 250 megabyte hard drive for less than a dollar per megabyte and i'm like
6488680	6494440	you gotta be kidding me i could get less than you know less than a dollar per megabyte of storage
6494440	6498920	i'm gonna go on and get one of those you know so i went on and paid my 250 bucks or whatever
6499320	6505400	now you're getting a terabyte hard drive for 49 dollars now they have two terabyte hard drives
6505400	6512280	they could get for 99 dollars so this is have i made my point about the numbers we're going to work
6512280	6520280	with in high tech industry i mean the numbers are extreme they're extreme so again if you use
6520280	6525320	engineering notation and put it into groups of three and most of you and your calculators have
6525320	6530440	a mode that you could put it into engineering motet notation so ultimately the the answer is
6530440	6535160	going to be given given to you in either times 10 to the third 10 to the sixth 10 to the ninth 10 to
6535160	6541640	the 12th if you don't know how to do that you might want to look at your owner's manual if you're
6541640	6547480	ready through your owner's manual away do a google search on your on on your model it'll come up with
6547480	6553640	a pdf of it okay you want to make sure you know how to access those modes in your calculator
6553720	6558680	because again we're going to be using some extreme numbers but you know what i'm not done
6560120	6565960	i've yet to begin we're about halfway done we're also going to be dealing with numbers that are
6567240	6573960	smaller than one so when i go back one two three places
6575480	6581880	anybody know what we call these times 10 to the negative third three places to the right of the
6581880	6587400	decimal plates milley and actually if any of you come from a machining background or whatever
6587400	6592280	like thousandths of an inch this would be a tenth of an inch right this would be hundredths of an
6592280	6598200	inch this would be thousandths of an inch and use the term mill right how thick is that plastic
6598280	6609240	three mil three milley okay so we're going to call this small letter m for milley m i l l i milley
6611960	6617880	three more places past the decimal point gives me times 10 to the negative sixth anybody know what
6617880	6624760	we call this micro very good micro micro is kind of kind of weird too it's a greek symbol
6625560	6633160	kind of looks like this it's kind of like a backwards u it's actually the greek symbol called
6633160	6648360	mu mu dirty jobs dirty jobs really he does that micro micro micro for our friends at home yeah
6648360	6654840	micro he actually participated in a fundraiser here in the fall of like washington technical
6654840	6659480	college via satellite actually the producer from that show dirty jobs is here and they
6659480	6665640	as a fundraiser for a college foundation but micro was live via satellite speaking directly
6665640	6670760	with all those that went to breakfast here at lake washington technical college i slept in that morning
6672040	6675800	i was hoping hoping they were going to tivo the event so i could watch it at my leisure but nobody
6675800	6685480	t-voted three more places past the decimal point times 10 to the negative ninth
6687960	6693640	yep nano very good small letter m small letter m nano
6699880	6704520	any of you have heard about nano technology this is kind of like where nano technology is playing
6704520	6714200	around with now three more places past the decimal point times 10 to the negative 12
6716360	6718280	pico small letter p pico
6721160	6725080	suffice to say i could go further there's a couple places past this but it's beyond the
6725080	6726760	scope of what we're talking about right now
6727160	6736360	but as students at lake washington technical college you on a regular basis are going to
6736360	6743800	be dealing with numbers times 10 than a negative 12 to times 10 to the positive 12 sometimes in
6743800	6750680	the same problem so like i said earlier even if you're bill gates accountant
6751240	6756840	even if you're the irs itself anybody here not filed their taxes yet
6758600	6762520	two of us three be honest four
6765160	6769960	it's actually funny i was with uh with friends on uh on saturday we stopped at starbucks for a cup
6769960	6775240	of coffee and my friend saw this woman that she thought she recognized that she knew and you can't
6775320	6779880	make this stuff up um you know it's like she's like you know you look like a good friend of mine
6779880	6783560	blah blah blah and you know do you work do you work for quests no i don't work for quests well
6783560	6789960	you know you know i work for the irs really excuse me ma'am but you look lovely today
6790680	6796040	can i buy you a pastry to go with that cup of coffee and you don't want to take those people off
6797000	6801000	too finely brought down al capone wasn't it right the irs
6801000	6807400	anyway we're going to be dealing with numbers like this so we have to make sure we get it right
6808280	6814600	so in most of your calculators you'll have a key ee a key ee and you could enter that whatever
6814600	6823400	you do do not enter it as as it appears here on the uh don't go three hit the times key 10
6823400	6829400	to the third power you're actually going to end up a decimal place off with that you have to enter
6829400	6840760	it the ee key exponential notation any questions on that all right um
6843800	6850680	there's no harm in using your imagination when you're when you're dealing with an electoral system
6853560	6859320	in equating it to a fluid system because let's be brutally honest you can't see electricity
6859320	6866680	coursing through wires you can't see it our five senses are very very limited so sometimes analogies
6866680	6871240	really really help us out so for those of you that understand fluid systems you know it all
6871240	6875640	rolls downhill and you know pressure and pumps and that kind of stuff you could use the same
6875640	6880200	analogies to figure out what's taking place inside an electoral circuit one of the things
6880200	6886920	that i do because i just love seattle is i'll use the treat that the seattle freeway system
6886920	6895640	to sometimes explain the behavior of current in a circuit i5 405 520 and we'll use those as
6895640	6903160	analogies of how current behaves how traffic behaves on a friday before a three-day holiday weekend
6903800	6912120	and it's sunny out and raining in the convergence zone and we'll use those analogies to kind of
6912120	6916280	figure out what's taking place in a circuit so this here this analogy shows us the pump this
6916280	6922040	would act like our voltage source right it's sucking and then discharging right so this is our
6922040	6926040	source of electrons and this is where it's drawing the electron through for the pump
6928040	6934920	the current flows through the plumbing the electrons flow through the circuit the only
6934920	6938360	thing that i would have done differently if i drew this illustration i can't take credit for this
6938360	6942840	i simply pulled it out of the text is the load this would have been nice if they had like a
6942840	6949320	water wheel right here so as the water runs by it turns the wheel because that's what a load does
6949320	6953880	a load converts one form of energy to another form of energy an electrical load converts
6953880	6960440	electric energy into light energy or electric energy into motion or or some other form does
6960440	6968200	that make sense so you can use this if you care to since this chapter is talking about current
6968280	6974120	typically in the study of electronics electronics not electrical but electronics
6974840	6981800	we're typically only going to be using values associated with milli times ten to the negative
6981800	6988440	third milli amps which don't be fooled milli amps could kill you there's enough even though it's
6988440	6994200	it's thousands of an amp it's still enough to kill you more than enough to kill you
6995160	7002360	and also we're going to be dealing with micro amps typically as a student here in the electronics
7002360	7007240	program like washington technical college for those of you that go into the electrical trades at all
7008200	7013720	you're going to be dealing with amps and lots of them we had a student that just got
7014440	7019240	hired by bondable power administration bpa he's going to be working substations i don't even
7019240	7023720	know how many amps you're dealing with out of substation what makes a substation a substation
7023720	7028840	lots of amps i would imagine okay i never had an interest of working with that many amps
7028840	7034280	since milli amps could kill you why would i want to work with more than more than enough to kill me
7037800	7042760	in summary we talked about the laws of electrostatic charges the first law is that like charges
7042760	7048440	oppose each other the second law is unlike charges attract each other a coulomb is six
7048520	7054600	point two four times ten to the 18th electrons electric current is the flow not the drift the
7054600	7062520	flow of electrons in a specified direction measured in amps conceived by the dude by the name of
7062520	7071480	andre marie amp here and andre marie amp here stated that one amp is equal to one coulomb per
7071480	7076520	second that's the relationship between current electrical charge and time formula we talked
7076520	7082040	about holes moving holes moving the opposite direction of electrons electrons travel negative
7082040	7087880	the positive holes travel positive to negative we talked about scientific notation negative
7087880	7094600	exponents specifically milli micro nano and pico and we talked about positive exponents
7094600	7100200	specifically kilo mega giga and terra and terra also happens to be a
7101080	7112680	in that's kind of got it outstanding if you know what i mean i don't even know what i mean
7114840	7120120	we're going to talk about milli prefix typical these are the values of current that we'll see
7120120	7125160	in electronic circuit and also micro times ten to the negative six these are also values
7125160	7131640	of current we'll typically see inside an electronic circuit make sense anybody have any
7131640	7139160	questions anything that we covered in chapter two chapter two all right let's go ahead take
7139160	7143160	about a 15 minute break and at 645 we'll go ahead and kick things off again
7146280	7153480	okay chapter three voltage chapter three voltage after completing this chapter you're going to be
7153480	7161480	able to identify the six most common voltage sources describe six different methods of producing
7161480	7169240	electricity define cell and a battery describe the difference between primary and secondary cells
7169800	7176280	describe how cells and batteries are rated identify ways to connect cells or batteries to
7176280	7185960	increase current or voltage output or both define voltage rise and voltage drop and identify the
7185960	7194440	two types of grounds associated with electrical circuits this this kind of makes me laugh you
7194440	7202920	know the big buzzword now is alternative energy right alternative energy and um
7203160	7212520	really worldwide we consume electricity that's the form that we've pretty much chosen electronics
7212520	7218520	electricity you know i don't think there's any places that are installing oil lamps
7219240	7225400	you know new hotel in the caribbean we light our place with oil lamps no we use electricity
7225560	7235960	and there are six methods of producing electricity period so when i hear about alternative energy i
7235960	7241960	kind of sit up i'm like well have they come up with a seventh method no as long as i have been
7241960	7249160	in this industry there have been six methods there are only six methods if you come up with a seventh
7249160	7257800	now maybe you're on to something those six methods are friction magnetism chemicals light
7258360	7265320	heat and pressure period the first one we're going to talk about is friction
7267000	7271320	probably the most familiar is the vandagraph generator how many of you are here familiar with
7271320	7280600	the vandagraph generator um let me try that again uh how many of you here are familiar with with
7280600	7288040	lightning storms that's probably the best example of friction producing electricity
7290280	7297320	guy by the name of ben franklin figured that out by flying a kite in an electrical storm
7297720	7305320	one of our brilliant forefathers it's amazing it didn't get uh electrocuted in the in the process
7307320	7313320	so lightning is a form of friction caused by atmospheric friction if you will um
7313320	7320120	and that produces lightning another example is electrostatic discharge when you walk across
7320120	7325800	a carpet or you move if you're wearing clothes just that movement you could generate static
7326280	7333640	electricity tens of thousands of volts could be generated by seeing you simply wearing clothes
7335320	7341240	okay the alternative is not wearing clothes you wouldn't generate static electricity by doing so but
7341960	7343800	of course the world would be a different place
7346440	7351800	the vandagraph generator some of you have maybe seen in a museum before i've got one in the back
7351800	7356200	room it's out of commission right now but there's a big sphere on the top of it and then what it is
7356200	7362120	is a belt pulls electrons off the bottom brings it up to the top so the sphere becomes charged
7363000	7366920	and what we could do with that is if you were insulated and you put yourself at that electrical
7366920	7371400	potential you've maybe seen the pictures where people's hair standing straight out on end that
7371400	7381400	effect could be created with a vandagraph generator friction not really the best best method of
7381800	7388440	producing electricity you know i'm not going to hire tens of thousands of people to walk around
7388440	7396360	on carpets and then you know touch a touch of you know of a conductor and power cities that way it
7396360	7402360	just doesn't make sense on the other hand if there was a method of somehow harnessing lightning
7402360	7409240	now that would be something that would be something i don't know how many of you are from the seattle
7409240	7414600	area northwest uh originally your whole life uh i don't know if you've ever had the opportunity
7414600	7424520	to travel like to the east coast the midwest monster storms tropics monster storms storms that even
7424520	7433160	jet airliners can't get above you know 60 000 foot thunderstorms um just amazing i remember a few
7433160	7441480	years ago i was flying commercially down to the caribbean and um on the way back this monster
7441480	7446200	storm outside and even the pilot was talking about it he's like you know in my 30 years of flying i
7446200	7451320	have never seen a storm this big and he just looked out and the whole thing was just glowing
7451960	7457960	constantly glowing it wasn't like lightning flash lightning flash was just constantly sitting there
7457960	7465400	just like throbbing glowing was pretty frightening so if you could somehow harness that lightning
7468760	7471080	that would almost constitute a form of alternative energy
7473400	7480600	magnetism is the most common method of producing electrical energy this is how we produce electricity
7480600	7488920	using something called a generator that generator could be powered by steam
7490200	7497960	that steam could be generated from nuclear power coal water wind gas diesel it doesn't
7497960	7504040	matter how you rotate the shaft the goal is you got to rotate the shaft
7504680	7512040	it's actually very devastating the news from uh japan was watching the news this morning and i guess
7512040	7517880	they upgraded it to a level seven accident now which is on par with chernobyl actually the amount
7517880	7521800	of radioactivity that that puts out could exceed chernobyl if they don't get it figured out
7524360	7528760	um it's really too bad i'm not necessarily i don't know if you want to call me a proponent of
7528840	7534920	nuclear i mean i i worked on nuclear submarines for you know eight and a half years of my life
7535720	7541240	and uh it's pretty cool i mean it's hot because it generates steam you know what i'm saying it's
7541240	7548120	pretty pretty uh innovative technology because you know how often we i you know i commute and i got
7548120	7553560	a i got to go to the back gas pumps about twice a week with my car and my car birds premium
7553640	7558920	um height um high compression engine i got to burn premium in it you're talking about 50 bucks
7558920	7564600	pop just fill up my car for me to commute you know how many times i saw my nuclear submarine refueled
7567000	7573720	just kept going and going and going and going and going so you get a lot of use out of nuclear
7573720	7580680	power commercial nuclear power plant um basically what they do is they refuel the reactor started up
7581240	7589960	run it at full throttle for 18 months 100 flat out for 18 months then they shut it down refuel
7589960	7594520	it most nuclear power plants have multiple reactors so when they're refueling one they got another one
7594520	7598520	that's up and running and then just back and forth or so in some cases three reactors
7600680	7606280	so it was actually getting quite a bit of momentum in the green movement a lot of the the the folks in
7606280	7610760	the green movement were like no nukes no nukes and they realized that it's pretty clean energy
7611400	7616440	yeah you got to worry about the nuclear waste afterwards but it's really a devastating uh you
7616440	7624040	know not only for the folks in japan um but also really for uh you know energy energy efficiency
7624040	7631320	and um non-dependency uh fossil fuel burning uh so hopefully they could get a handle on it
7632120	7635720	i mean nuclear power all forms of energy are inherently dangerous you know i mean
7637080	7641000	my my fuel tank splits open on my car and i drive home and i burst into flames that'll
7641000	7646120	kill me just as dead as radiation you know what i'm saying so it's a matter of mitigating those
7646120	7651400	risks but i want you to keep that in mind this is why again alternative energy
7653960	7658680	you know i've been to holland before they got freaking windmills over windmills
7658680	7664360	they were harnessing wind energy you know now we wind turbines you know all you're doing is
7664360	7671080	rotating the shaft and you're turning a generator as opposed to grinding your grain with power from
7671080	7677240	the wind so is it really alternative energy no it's just a different spin on it which is interesting
7677240	7682760	because i've known this stuff since like puberty and i always in the back of my mind was thinking
7682760	7687240	about like energy in different forms because i was always getting yelled up on my parents you know
7687240	7691400	shut the door shut off the lights what do you think you live in a barn you know this type of
7691400	7696920	stuff so i was yeah at a very young gauge i was thinking wow you know i what one of my duties as
7696920	7704760	a child was cutting the grass and uh he used to amaze me the small amount of gas i could i was
7704760	7709560	always hoping i'd run out of gas so like i don't have to i couldn't finish the lawn why i ran out
7709560	7714520	of gas you know the thing would never run out of gas there was this little tiny tank and that motor
7714520	7717320	would just keep you know the engine would keep going and going and going and going and going
7718280	7723640	there's a way of harnessing that motor to a generator and that could like i could leave the
7723640	7727640	lights on i could leave the doors open i'd get my parents off my back you know at a young age i
7727640	7731720	was thinking about alternative energy and obviously i didn't understand all the formulas
7731720	7737560	associated with it so no you can't necessarily power a home with a small three and a half horsepower
7737560	7746760	brakes and strutting engine but with a ten horsepower you could do it and if you've got a
7746760	7754120	backup generator that's a good enough size generator power home anyway that's how we harness
7754120	7761880	magnetism the generator could be configured to produce either direct current direct current is
7762840	7769080	the flow of electrons in only one direction negative the positive period negative the positive
7769800	7774840	or alternating current alternating in current is actually current that goes back and forth back
7774840	7781320	and forth what we what comes out of the outlets here in the school and at your home is alternating
7781320	7786680	current the electrons never really go anywhere but they're getting shaken back and forth back
7786760	7792520	and forth back and forth that's the harness that's the energy that we harness so we could have a
7792520	7799160	generator connected to a shaft that produces either dc or ac dc generators are not that prevalent
7800360	7806920	they're not that prevalent really ac is used predominantly throughout the industry because
7806920	7811000	of it's a higher level of efficiency in transmitting the power
7811800	7819960	this is the schematic symbol for an ac generator so if you saw this on a schematic
7821320	7825400	you would say ah this means an ac power source ac generator
7829320	7840280	chemical chemical the most common is a cell chemical means is the second most popular method
7840280	7845880	of producing electrical energy a chemical cell what we're talking about here is batteries
7848600	7855480	the original chemical cell consisted of two metals copper and zinc these were the old
7855480	7859320	school batteries remember the kind that if you left them in your device too long they'd start to
7859320	7867480	like ooze and ruin your portable electronic device those were just standard carbon or um
7868360	7872040	yeah zinc cells copper zinc cells
7876280	7883320	typically many cells can be connected to form a battery when we use the term battery
7884280	7890040	we're actually talking about something that's made of multiple cells and part of why i'm telling
7890040	7894520	you this is that you're all here to learn a second language and that second language is electronics
7895240	7900200	so if you were going to go to fred my where you're going i'm going to fred meyer to get me some
7900200	7907080	batteries if you said that to me i'm going to assume that you're going to get batteries and
7907080	7914040	batteries are multiple cells that are put together where you're going i'm going to fred
7914040	7919480	meyer to get me some batteries what do you need batteries for for this here flashlight
7920200	7925080	that battery doesn't take that flashlight doesn't take batteries that flashlight takes
7926200	7932600	cells and cells are the typical size batteries that we've come to know and love triple a
7933560	7943800	double a c am i personal favor the d size cell d size means it's bigger since it's bigger it means
7943800	7953160	it's got more chemical in it more chemical means it's gonna last longer if you had a d
7953160	7957480	size battery and you connected it to your remote control it looks stupid but it would last forever
7958520	7965160	okay i put triple a batteries in my remote and like they last for like longer than my tv lasts
7966120	7971800	you know i just had a i just had some cells go out in a remote and i looked they were the original
7971800	7976600	cells of the remote i'm like man i've had this thing for freaking 14 years it's got the original
7976600	7984840	goofy brand batteries that came with it you know so typically many cells can be connected to create
7984840	7990840	what's known as a battery now it's schematic diagrams when you see this symbol right here you
7990840	7999480	can assume that this is a cell the short line is the negative lead the long line is the positive
7999480	8009080	lead on a schematic diagram if you put a short one a long one a short one and a long one together
8009080	8015320	we could make the assumption that this is a battery the other assumption that you could
8015320	8027640	make on a schematic diagram is when you see this assume 1.5 volts because most cells triple a
8027640	8031880	double a c and d all produce 1.5 volts dc
8036200	8038360	so if we saw this what can we assume
8041880	8050760	1.5 plus 1.5 is 3 so normally on a schematic diagram sometimes they'll draw two of these
8050760	8054520	side by side sometimes they'll draw three but they won't draw any more than three
8054680	8064760	so anytime you see two or more assume assume that it's either the value here or right next to this
8064760	8073160	i could write 12v and if i write 12v well it's a 12 volt battery pack and if you split that battery pack
8073160	8079800	open you would find that it's actually made up of multiple cells that are wired together internal
8079800	8085560	to that battery pack make sense
8088840	8089160	light
8094200	8097400	light photovoltaic cell harnesses light
8099480	8106680	a single cell can produce a very small voltage so therefore many cells must be linked together
8106680	8113240	to produce a usable voltage and current these are primarily used in satellites
8114840	8118760	because satellites would look stupid if they had like an extension cord connected to them
8119880	8123160	you know you'd be like what the heck is that going up into the sky you know well it's an
8123160	8129160	extension cord for you know communication satellite so we can't do that
8129880	8135240	cost is high but it's declining
8137400	8142040	what i suspect is going to happen with this photovoltaic basically to make a solar panel
8142040	8148440	it uses the same technology that is used to make microchips so it's pretty costly process
8149480	8153000	what i suspect to see and you're not going to find us on any textbook
8153720	8157720	what i suspect you're going to see is a marriage between photovoltaic
8158760	8165560	and nanotechnology and when those two merge together you're going to be able to go to
8165560	8171880	Sherwin Williams and get paint for your house and they're going to say sir would you like the
8171880	8181160	photovoltaic additive today for 1995 sure go ahead and a lot of photovoltaic additive and the
8181160	8188520	fact that your paint on your house is outside and it's in daylight part of the time it's going to
8188520	8193720	be producing voltage now we're not quite there yet but i suspect that that's where we're going to be
8193720	8198520	they do have the technology now that there are companies that basically could spit out photovoltaic
8199560	8206760	film almost like Reynolds wrap so you could you know go out buy a roll of photovoltaic and roll
8206760	8211720	it out and connect your your connections and you're producing electricity so the cost is coming
8211720	8217720	down on this stuff and think about it free voltage from the sun i mean how cool is that i mean it
8217720	8223720	really is here in western washington well you know you probably have to pressure wash it twice
8223720	8228200	so you're to keep the moss from growing on your panels i got moss growing on my car i'm getting
8228200	8234760	in the other day and i'm like what the heck is it moss growing on it but other areas of the country
8234760	8242520	they're doing us they're doing us was in arizona uh flagstaff several years ago and i checked into
8242520	8251320	the hotel late at night and um got up in the morning and opened my wind and opened my curtain
8251320	8257000	the hotel room i was on an upper floor and i was shocked number one it snowed out the night before
8257000	8260760	and it was like six inches snow out there i'm like holy crap this arizona what's your snow doing out
8260760	8265080	there it's flagstaff it's you know you're in the mountains the other thing that shocked me is wow look
8265080	8271880	at this across the street was a solar farm and it was all photovoltaic panels connected directly
8271880	8277560	to the power grid and these panels would all track the sun and and you know basically supplying
8277560	8282040	energy to the power grid so in some areas of the country uh they're already doing this
8283160	8289320	when i run out tonight by solar panels for your home probably not but again it's free energy free
8289320	8298440	voltage so keep your eye on this technology because uh i'd love to be an investor in the company that
8298440	8304120	gets that photovoltaic nanotechnology harnessed you know just add a little pinch of it to your paint
8304120	8311480	or whatever and paint whatever he just turned it into a solar panel science fiction now guarantee
8311480	8314840	you within the next few years we're going to be seeing that technology it's one of those solar
8314840	8320360	panels work uh look like and the problem is uh this is on a metal backing but basically it's
8320360	8326680	glass it's glass it's pretty fragile you know you want to have it permanently mounted um
8327960	8337640	still for out of space satellite it's the best option pointed towards the sun the sun comes out
8337640	8341960	every day actually if you're an outer space it never goes out because you know you're not rotating
8341960	8347720	if you're a stationary satellite just looking at it unlimited electrical resources it was actually
8347720	8354040	interesting i was at a conference i spoke at a conference a month ago that was like a month
8354040	8360600	ago today in milwaukee wisconsin it was at the green energy summit i wasn't invited guest speaker
8361480	8367480	and one of the other speakers was very uh it was very interesting he had one of our first
8367480	8373160	satellites a mock-up of it and when they were developing the satellite it was this was in response
8373160	8378920	to the russians uh launching spotnik and it was the whole thing with the space race and basically
8378920	8383960	you know he who gets the satellite in space first and goes to space first is going to rule
8383960	8389000	dominate the earth you know so this is all stuff that was going down the 1950s they um
8390200	8395800	in a push to get our satellite up there in response to the russian satellite um
8395800	8403480	um basically what they had was a battery operated satellite launch it goes up beep beep beep beep
8403480	8409880	and that's literally all this thing did it was a beacon just beeping in space and then as an after
8409880	8415480	thought though the engineers were like let's put this on it this here is a photovoltaic cell
8416120	8420920	let's put this on it so that when the battery dies it'll continue to beep and they're like
8420920	8425720	what are you doing it's a stupid this is stupid this is no this is no you know this is not viable
8425720	8431720	technology solar panel photovoltaic cell this doesn't make any sense well they finally convinced
8431720	8437000	them to put it on well guess what happened after the battery died photovoltaic kicked on and then
8437000	8440840	it kept going and going and going and going and I think finally it was like interfering with some
8440840	8447560	other communication technology that developed they finally had to shut the thing off so that
8447560	8452840	was proof of concept that photovoltaics really work and of course it's become mainstream ever since
8455960	8460280	this is a cool way now it's a hot way actually producing voltage
8461080	8467560	we could use heat to produce voltage with what's called a thermo couple thermo couple
8469400	8473800	these are two dissimilar wires twisted together when I say dissimilar I don't mean one blue wire
8473800	8480040	and one red wire I'm talking about two dissimilar metals and they're not actually twisted together
8480040	8485320	they're actually welded together so you get the two dissimilar metals
8486920	8491800	and then you'll weld them together where they're welded together when you heat that joint
8492440	8499560	because they're dissimilar metals it's going to produce a voltage voltage produced is directly
8499560	8506600	proportional to the amount of heat applied these are going to be used in thermometers
8507480	8513320	if you've had it seen a digital thermometer typically that's going to be a thermo couple
8513320	8519080	because what it does is you apply heat it produces a voltage the voltage gets converted
8519800	8524360	to an equivalency of either Fahrenheit or centigrade and then you read it out real
8524360	8531320	simple way of doing it also called a pyrometer pyrometer had a student in this class several
8531320	8537880	years ago whose father owned a company locally I forgot the name of the company but they basically
8537880	8544600	produced thermal couple sensors and one of the big products that they were developing was
8545240	8554040	specifically for the racing industry and what it was is about the size of my laser pointer
8554040	8557880	it was nice stainless steel and I had a little probe on the end and that was the thermal couple
8557880	8564040	and what was so popular in the race industry if you I don't know how many of you aren't a racing
8564040	8570920	or whatever you know you take like NASCAR for example and ideally what you want to do with
8570920	8578520	one of those race cars is set it up so that you distribute the weight evenly on every tire
8580680	8586680	equally across the tire and if you could do that obviously you've got the most contact with the
8586680	8590200	road it's going to give you the most handling on the track it's going to give you the best
8590200	8594680	performance generally speaking there are some exceptions to that on road course versus whatever
8594680	8598520	but basically you want full contact with all your tires on the track make sense
8600200	8605960	also understanding with NASCAR rear wheel drive right you're going to have a lot more friction
8605960	8612600	on your rear wheels so what happens is when that race car pulls in and they pull the tires off
8613080	8616360	then they could sit there after the after they get the car out of the pits
8617800	8625400	with their thermal couple probe and then measure across the tire outside inside or outside middle
8625400	8631720	inside for my left rear my right rear take the same readings my front tire take the same readings
8632360	8637560	my other front tire same readings so you should see consistency between the two fronts across
8637560	8641960	temperature wise too that means you've got the car set up so that the tires are in full contact
8642280	8649160	with the road so it's really a poor man's alignment tool so he gave me one of these
8649160	8652440	it's kind of cool because it's the OEM it's just stainless it doesn't have any
8652440	8656680	decal or sticker on it I mean they're the factory that built it and then sold in some racing
8656680	8661960	companies so they can put their name on it and or you know snap on and charge you know an arm and
8661960	8667160	leg for the thing so he gave me one of these things so I actually did some experimentation
8667160	8672040	since I am a commuter I I did that a couple times in my drive home I want that I was wondering
8672040	8678200	what the alignment on my car was so sure enough you know I drive home I pull off the exit hot
8678200	8682760	federal way pull over the side of the road get out my fluke meter with this thing plugged in
8682760	8687160	take temperature readings look for consistency I've basically been tweaking alignment my vehicles
8687160	8694360	using nothing more than that temperature gauge pretty cool pretty cool thermal couple
8694360	8702120	simply applying heat to the device produces voltage that's simple apply heat it'll produce
8702120	8707480	voltage this is what the schematic symbol for one looks like
8709800	8714760	again understanding that these are going to be dissimilar metals two dissimilar metals
8714760	8717320	and then you weld this together the bead
8717640	8724040	so are they not actually
8734200	8737480	actually that because they're in contact with each other it will produce
8738680	8745320	where would you take the other tips yeah so simply by putting the the wires together they
8745320	8749000	are going to be in contact with each other so you are going to get some reaction but
8749000	8752920	these thermal couple probes are actually welded the tips are welded
8755240	8761160	believe it or not another method of producing voltage is simply by the use of pressure this
8761160	8767480	is called the piezoelectric effect piezoelectric effect voltage is going to be very small
8769560	8772440	so it must be amplified in order for it to be useful
8772840	8781720	but just a pressure change on a crystal will produce a voltage this is used for crystal
8781720	8789880	microphones phonograph pickups right and precision oscillators as well as some sensors
8789880	8795160	pressure sensors you could get some really inexpensive pressure sensors now that are
8795160	8799560	calibrated for barometric pressure standard barometric pressure so as the earth's pressure
8799560	8804040	the atmospheric pressure changes on it the voltage will change you couple couple that
8804040	8810040	with a weather station or couple that with actually you could use a fur altimeter if you're
8810040	8814520	sending a rocket up and you want to know how high your rocket goes you know what your base pressure
8814520	8821480	is as you go up an altitude the pressure decreases so you can have an inexpensive little sensor that
8821480	8829480	keeps track of your pressure also these are used in a lot of engine sensors now right you
8829480	8834680	could monitor all types of different pressures your oil pressure your pressure your cooling system
8834680	8840360	on board an aircraft your hydraulic pressure is all a little sensor that voltage gets amplified
8840360	8843880	sent into a computer and then you could look at all this virtual instrumentation
8845080	8847560	simply doing it by applying pressure to a crystal
8849960	8852840	this is what the schematic symbol looks like for piezoelectric crystal
8859480	8863000	now we're going to talk about some different types of batteries
8866040	8868920	battery of course is a combination of two or more cells
8870440	8877560	now we have two different choices of cells one is called a primary cell the other is called a
8877560	8885320	secondary cell let's first talk about primary cells primary cells are cells that cannot be
8885320	8894040	recharged one time use these are like most of the cells that you and I buy right when you're
8894040	8900760	done using them you recycle them don't throw them in the landfill right you recycle them
8901960	8907240	bring them to the hazmat place and then they'll turn it in and get money and make your community
8907240	8912600	more profitable based on you turning in your dead batteries some of the stuff you don't want
8912680	8917560	going to the landfill although they've gotten better with the choice of chemicals that they're
8917560	8923960	using but primary cells once you once you use them you throw them away this is designed after
8923960	8931400	what's known as the La Clanche cell or dry cell also referred to as the carbon zinc battery
8932040	8936040	carbon zinc battery this is the old school battery that we were talking about earlier
8943000	8949320	I got a couple old timers in here remember that's all we had these are the only types of batteries
8949320	8954760	that used to exist and then I believe was in the 1970s they came out with alkaline cells
8955720	8962280	that's when alkaline became somewhat mainstream started to become mainstream these alkaline cells
8962280	8969240	were still pretty expensive as compared to the carbon zinc batteries I remember Radio Shack
8969240	8972600	because again I was a big electronics guy so I was like hanging out at Radio Shack like looking
8972600	8977800	at all the parts and stuff and Radio Shack used to have a battery of the month club and you got a
8977800	8982760	little card and you'd go in with the card and you'd pick out the battery that you wanted and then
8982760	8986840	they'd punch your card you got a free battery it was a carbon zinc battery but it got you in the
8986840	8995880	store kind of a cool thing alkaline cells really really good alkaline cells would work a lot better
8995880	8999640	with a lot of electronic equipment when it came into being
9002120	9013640	the latest cell and my personal favorite is the lithium cell these are the high end lithium batteries
9014520	9019240	that Energizer produces they cost like
9023080	9031160	16 bucks for eight batteries they're very very pricey but these lithium batteries
9031160	9039160	will produce a voltage longer than any of these other types of primary cells they also have a
9039160	9045640	longer shelf life I'll bring in a package we could look at it I just I bought some last week
9045640	9051320	and I think it's the the expiration date on them is like 2022 some crazy time in the future
9052600	9056280	we won't even need batteries like that we'll be flying to work in jet packs and stuff
9056280	9063800	we won't even need a lithium batteries and the other thing that these are real great at is working
9063800	9069800	at a variety of different temperatures from extreme cold which really kills batteries big time
9069800	9072840	slows down that chemical reaction to extreme heat
9076360	9080440	they've kind of known about lithium batteries for a while lithium cells for a while
9082600	9088840	on my airplane there's something that's called an ELT emergency locate transmitter
9089800	9095880	in the event of crashing there's a g-switch that triggers triggers a transmitter to start
9095880	9101080	transmitting out a beacon that gives your position away so search aircraft actually they used to
9101080	9104840	have satellites that looked for that signal but now they've long story they've switched those
9104840	9109320	satellites off they've gone to some different frequencies now and but it would transmit so
9109320	9114760	when this thing worked it had to work it's a safety device even like on a ship that goes down they
9114760	9119800	have these e-perm systems that transmit to the satellite you want that when you got when it has
9119800	9125640	to work you need the thing to work so this has always been the choice for those types of applications
9125640	9133240	the lithium cell i was really really jazzed and excited when i saw these come on the market for
9133240	9140680	a consumer based product because the lithium the lithium batteries before were unique you know to
9140680	9144680	the manufacturer would put it together and you'd have to buy the replacement from them
9144680	9149720	because like the f a a requires every 24 months you've got to replace that that cell whether you've
9149720	9156440	used it or not so for them to come out the sizes that i'm aware of they have triple a and they
9156440	9163640	have double a size have any of you here used any of those if you use them highly recommend it if
9163640	9167960	you're going on your dream vacation if you're doing photography and you want something for your
9167960	9173000	flash and you want that flash to keep going off and you don't have to worry about it if you have a
9173000	9180760	if you're going hiking i use it in my gps i use a bat i have a backup gps um you know that i use
9180760	9186520	whenever i'm i'm going off the grid or anything i've got a pack i've got a pack that i bought
9186520	9191640	energizer will sell you a pack that you could use to recharge your cell phone have you seen those
9191640	9197640	things it's like a little pack and it comes with those lithium batteries and it's got a little cord
9197640	9201960	so like if you're off the grid and you got to recharge your battery it comes with that style
9201960	9208280	you know your micro usb or mini usb plug or you know kiesta everything now is micro usb that's
9208280	9214760	kind of the standard for new newer cell phones but you put those lithium batteries in it you plug
9214760	9220760	it in it'll give you another charge so if any of you do any backcountry stuff or anything like that i
9220760	9226280	highly recommend you look into them it's a wise investment a very wise investment it's the best
9226920	9229400	primary cell that money will buy
9232440	9239080	this is kind of you got the diagrams in your book kind of a cutaway view of a standard carbon
9239080	9250360	zinc cell another cutaway view there cutaway view of a nine volt battery is this really a nine volt
9250360	9258920	battery is it really a battery yes it is it's made up of multiple cells that have been put together
9258920	9265960	each cell is capable of 1.5 volt so they put multiple cells together to give them nine volts
9266920	9274920	why nine volts actually this nine volt battery is also synonymous what was what was called a
9274920	9281560	transistor battery back in the day there's no transistors in it why was it called a transistor
9281560	9287560	battery because this is the type of battery that your transistor radio would take growing up in
9287560	9293560	connecticut i used to have a little small eight transistor radio used to go to the beach and i
9293560	9297720	used to tune in my little radio you know playing you know playing music listen to new york radio
9297720	9304600	stations playing all the top 40 hits and everything eight transistor radio took a nine volt battery or
9304600	9310760	transistor battery this was typically the battery that i would get as a free battery at the battery
9310760	9318280	of the month club for radio shack why my assumption was it's got nine volts the other ones have 1.5
9318280	9327160	volts i'm getting more for my punch my free battery than than a 1.5 volt battery so this
9327160	9333080	was typically the bad boy that i always used to get for the purpose of experimenting secondary
9333080	9338280	cells or cells that cannot be recharged you're all familiar with this type of cell the lead acid
9338920	9341400	battery or wet cell which is in your car right now
9345240	9352600	these batteries are not just used for automotive applications these wet cells these lead acid
9352600	9360600	cells are also used for backup power supplies by the phone company for your landline they're also
9360600	9365880	used at cellular sites for backup power in the event that power is interrupted to the
9365880	9372600	cell sites automatically they'll switch over to battery backup they're typically lead acid cells
9377640	9382680	absolutely and they use those for solar systems now because they're the cheapest secondary cell
9382680	9388280	that's really on the market there's other technology that's more efficient that's more better
9388920	9395000	okay but it costs more so if you just want to let's say you live out in the desert and you want
9395000	9399320	want to run lights by day and harness the energy by day and you need a lot of solar panels and
9399320	9404120	you're going to need a lot of secondary cells the cheapest secondary cells that you could buy
9404120	9413160	our lead acid cells my submarine had a whole bank of lead acid cells located in the center of the
9413160	9419640	submarine down in the keel the very lowest portion of the boat and it was the called ironically the
9419640	9426520	battery well and in the battery well were batteries that were basically six feet tall
9427640	9432520	and they were about this big around and they were individual cells and it took a crane to be able
9432520	9438520	to lower these things in and move them all in and then they had wooden shims wax and
9438520	9443080	pregnated maple shims were all put in between these and it was all one giant bank and they were all
9443080	9453160	wired up lead acid on a daily basis an electrician would strip all the metal off of their uniform if
9453160	9458280	they had a belt on or anything metal and typically what they had is a special jumpsuit that they put
9458280	9463640	on it had all acid burns in it and what they would do is they'd have to climb down in the battery well
9463640	9469640	and they'd have to check the gravity the specific gravity this is the electrolyte fluid inside
9470360	9474200	and basically when we charge your battery what are we putting into a battery
9478840	9484600	who said electrons electrons that's really what we're doing when we charge your battery
9485160	9490520	we're putting free electrons we're storing it in an electrolyte solution our electrons matter
9490520	9498600	absolutely they're not very dense but they still are matter when you charge your battery what you
9498600	9504760	do is you increase the specific gravity of that fluid that electrolyte fluid
9507400	9511800	so what the electricians would do on a daily basis is they had a clipboard and they had a
9511800	9516040	grid that showed all the locations of the battery they would go down in and they would
9516040	9521720	check the specific gravity do you know what i'm talking about with specific gravity specific gravity
9521720	9529480	is a comparison of the density of pure water h2o at room temperature standard temperature
9530600	9537480	the specific gravity of h2o pure water at room temperature standard temperature is one
9538440	9544520	1.000000 it's one it's what we compare everything else to
9546200	9551080	now if i have pure water and i start to get some salt and i dissolve salt into the water
9551080	9556200	what am i going to do the specific gravity i'm going to raise it i'm going to increase the density
9556200	9560840	of the fluid and by taking a specific gravity reading i'm going to show that it's more dense
9560840	9564120	that shows me that i've done what i've put matter into the solution
9564760	9570520	if i dissolve sugar into it same thing if i pump electrons into it what am i going to do
9570520	9577800	same thing i'm going to increase the density of it i use specific gravity i i brew my own beer
9579800	9583240	and i use specific gravity to tell me what the alcohol content is
9584280	9591720	in the brewing process i basically impart a lot of sugars into the beer and i take that reading
9591720	9598920	the more sugars i put into the beer the specific gravity increases the density increases make
9598920	9607000	sense then what i do is i get yeast i put the yeast into that solution and the yeast consumes the
9607000	9616280	sugar converting it into co2 and alcohol so after the yeast has done its job i expect to see that
9616280	9623160	specific gravity decrease because alcohol is less dense than water and then i take a read
9623160	9628120	my first reading compare it to my last reading that gives me my alcohol content of what's inside the
9628120	9639240	beer for a battery your battery in your car has six cells if you buy a hydrometer and you test
9639240	9644200	those cells you should get consistency across all of those cells if you don't
9646680	9651480	if this cell is good this cell is good this cell is a little bit lower this good good good
9651480	9657160	the cell being a little bit lower you're probably developing an internal short in that cell
9659000	9665160	need to replace your battery you can't just replace the individual cells you have to replace
9665160	9671000	the whole entire battery so back on the submarine they were really concerned about that on a daily
9671000	9676280	basis they sent somebody down in the battery well to take those readings because if they saw a cell
9676280	9680520	that started to develop an internal short or problem conceivably it could take all of that
9680520	9687160	energy and dissipate that energy through that one bad cell that's bad news because oh by the way
9687160	9693160	you know why we had a battery battery bank if our nuclear reactor shut down or we had a problem
9693160	9700120	we could get to the surface when we get to the surface we could start up a diesel generator
9701560	9705960	so from that transit from the deep up to the surface we needed to be on battery power
9707800	9713320	if you can't get the diesel started while you're on the surface or actually at periscope depth
9713320	9718280	because we had a snorkel they could just stick up where it's an induction system for the diesel
9719240	9723640	run the diesel we had a generator connected where we could keep not as much power as we'd have to
9723640	9726840	nuclear power but to keep all vital systems up and operational
9729960	9733720	actually i had a real scare once we were someplace we weren't supposed to be
9733720	9737640	like someplace we were not supposed to be typically where we always went with my submarine
9738280	9745000	and it was a half it was a national holiday for this country so all of their you know they'd
9745560	9748840	take their submarines and drive them through red square and their tanks and their missile
9748840	9752920	launchers and everything and you know we had nothing better to do so instead of like hey you
9752920	9757320	know we're watching the soviets they're having a holiday let's us have a holiday because on the
9757320	9760520	fourth of july we're going to be watching the soviets and they're not going to take into account
9760520	9765960	our holiday you know the captain didn't think it was a very good idea that i had now as a matter
9765960	9769560	of fact mr grinnock i think what we're going to do is we're going to do some drilling today
9770120	9775880	you know and it's firefighting whatever well we did it we did a drill an exercise
9776840	9782440	that involves scrambling the reactor sounds ominous doesn't it scram the reactor oh no don't
9782440	9787240	scram the reactor scrambling the reactor is actually a good thing scrambling the reactor is
9787240	9791720	when you shut the reactor down you have control rods you move the control rods in you neutralize
9792440	9798600	the the reaction the nuclear reaction this is actually what they did too in japan after the
9798600	9803720	earthquake as soon as there was seismic activity pow they shut those reactors down scram the reactors
9803720	9809800	the problem that they had afterwards was with the tsunami damaging i suspect it was their intake
9810840	9815320	their seawater intake that for used for cooling and they couldn't dissipate all that heat that had
9815320	9821400	already been generated and then it became a you know an avalanche so to speak of circumstances
9822200	9825720	anyway we're somewhere we're supposed we're not supposed to be and it was quiet
9826440	9829800	so the captain figures we're going to do some nuclear drill scram the reactor pow scram the
9829800	9833560	reactor normal procedure as we start to come up to periscope depth make sure that no we're not
9833560	9838200	going to hit anybody up on the surface come up raise the snorkel mast start the diesel generator
9838200	9841640	well they try starting the diesel generator which is common commonplace wouldn't start
9842520	9848440	wouldn't start and what had happened is there was this multi pin connector that for whatever
9848440	9854280	reason disintegrated in the back of the of the diesel control panel so it's kind of like well
9854280	9860680	that's going to take two days to put back together you know so we're on battery power to be honest
9860680	9866360	with you we knew it was a drill and we were all real sloppy rigging for reduced electrical that's
9866360	9873640	where we shut down on non-vital systems and we knew it was a drill so we were very slow in doing it
9873640	9879880	we expended over half of our battery energy in that period of time so now all of a sudden the
9879880	9886200	reactor shut down we can't start the diesel generator we've just consumed 50 of our battery
9886200	9892600	power because we were screwing around kind of dragging our feet with this exercise so we realized
9892600	9899800	what was happening and basically the decision was made restart the reactor well they try restarting
9899800	9906120	the reactor and the reactor won't start and we've consumed all of our battery power so now
9906120	9911160	we went to this like super super rig for reduced electrical where there's like you know emergency
9911160	9915720	lighting and all the environmental systems are down so the air all of a sudden is almost
9915720	9921720	unbreathable and it's it's it's in excess of 120 degrees and it's it's humid and it's just miserable
9922360	9928120	can't get the reactor started and in my job surveillance i was down to one receiver i shut
9928120	9933560	all my sophisticated stuff down i'm down to one receiver you can't make the story up it's like
9934280	9939880	holy crap here comes the fleet it's like what are you talking about here comes the freaking
9939880	9947320	soviet fleet headed right towards us like you gotta be kidding so it got really really hairy
9947320	9952200	because this is the type of thing that like world war three could start over what's a submarine doing
9952200	9957320	in our harbor you know violating our sovereign territory and all of this stuff you know we just
9957320	9963320	we couldn't get get caught so truth be told they were able to get the reactor started they
9963320	9972040	had to kind of amend amend their procedures and come to find out it was actually a reactor control
9972040	9977080	switch had failed it was a series of circumstances we called that day anybody that served on the boat
9977080	9983560	in that era affectionately known as black tuesday because things were really really bad and i had
9983560	9990360	it good i mean my space normally where i worked i had a wear like foul weather jacket to stay warm
9990360	9993960	because of all the air conditioning of course all the air conditioning was down
9993960	9998280	but i tell you what the guys in the engineering spaces i mean they were stripped down to their
9998280	10003960	underwear and no shirts and they're just sweat and port sweat point i mean it's temperature skyrocketed
10003960	10008200	you know 150 160 degrees back there in the engineering spaces you're trying to troubleshoot
10008200	10015240	something but anyway it all worked out good in the end but that's the necessity of backup battery
10015240	10018520	now a lot of you may be saying well i'm never going to work on a nuclear submarine or a ship
10018600	10022520	or whatever no you might go to work as a biomedical electronics tech at a hospital
10022520	10027240	guess what hospitals have backup battery banks you might go to work for the federal aviation
10027240	10033640	administration federal aviation administration down in auburn washington at the mountain region
10033640	10037320	air route traffic control center i don't know if any of you are aware of that facility if you've
10037320	10041720	go to the like the muckleshoot casino down there it's like right across the street it's a big building
10041720	10046680	fences around it garb guards all kinds of stuff like that that's where they control all the air
10046680	10052200	traffic in the northwestern united states from western montana to the pacific ocean from the
10052200	10057400	canadian border all the way to uh northern california if you're an airplane in flight you're talking
10057400	10063160	to somebody in auburn washington they lose the power at that facility guess what the whole
10063160	10067800	northwestern united states aircraft are flying blind so they were kind of smart about this they
10067800	10075320	put in a battery backup system so as soon as the power ac crashes this these batteries have power
10075320	10080680	inverters and that brings it back up online so they don't miss a beat once the batteries are up
10080680	10085480	online then they have diesel generators and another building on the property that will go
10085480	10089560	ahead and kick in and they have huge huge fuel tanks so they could power that for a very very
10089560	10094120	long period of time if any of you have ever heard of the news of the past a lot of times if they
10094120	10098520	have a glitch like an air traffic control system and switching over to backup power that's actually
10098520	10104040	what what the problem is is going from ac to that battery backup if that if it if it doesn't happen
10104120	10108920	seamlessly all of those systems go down you all know with computers you got to reboot computers
10108920	10113240	so you have aircraft flying blind without air traffic control for a period of time
10113240	10121080	so it could be somewhat of a inconvenience safety concern so a lot of you are going to see this
10121080	10127000	actually one of the most reliable systems and this is uh i don't know how many of you still
10127000	10134600	just have an old-fashioned power um old-fashioned telephone lying to your home pots it is called
10136200	10140840	and basically what that is is an old school just two wires coming to your home most of us now are
10140840	10147000	on broadband and voice over ip and all this kind of crap the old school telephones were the most
10147000	10153640	reliable you could have a power outage you could have earthquake whatever and you pick that phone
10153640	10158680	up and you're still going to get a dial tone because that dial tone is being generated by backup
10158680	10164360	battery banks at the central office and that's powering the phone system so you know i've
10164360	10170280	experienced a lot of blackouts in my life where the power would go out and i never lost that dial
10170280	10177880	tone on the phone now you know how many of you are like with comcast you know i mean what was i
10177880	10181560	thinking when i went to actually believe it or not i'm not i'm not just talking to talk i'm walking
10181560	10186440	to walk before i came to work today i actually called quest i want to get an old school line back
10186440	10191480	into my house because i'm looking at my phone bill my freaking phone bill i don't like paying like
10191480	10196680	70 bucks a month for you know call or id and call waiting and the only people that call me
10197480	10204040	are people that i don't want calling me okay so why am i paying 70 bucks a month to have
10204040	10208040	something that i don't want and i don't want to shut the line off because i have some other uses
10208920	10214840	for that line so i called quest and i'm like it's kind of unusual request you have any of the
10214840	10221560	old school lines that you know i could still have you know yeah yeah yeah and how much 13 dollars and
10221560	10228360	50 cents a month plus tax i'm like that's what i want can you port my existing number out back
10228360	10233320	to it yeah no problem so i'm gonna get that scheduled 1350 a month no you can't no long
10233320	10239480	distance or anything but i don't want it for that i want it for that 911 i want it i don't know why
10239480	10242680	i'm gonna disconnect the ringer because again the only people people that want to call me to call
10242680	10247080	my cell number you know but i still need that if you have an alarm system at your home you need it
10247080	10253960	if you've got a satellite tv box for updates and pay per view you need it so it could call into the
10253960	10260680	mother ship on a daily basis so battery backups are still out there so i don't think you're not
10260680	10265800	going to go to work in the industry and never see a battery backup now you're all familiar with
10265800	10271640	lead acid nickel cadmium nicad how many of you are familiar with nicad batteries nicad have been out
10271640	10277720	for for a long period of time nicad's had a nasty habit of generating what was called a memory
10278600	10284280	and what that memory was in essence is uh if any of you have ever had your arm or leg in a cast
10285160	10290520	and you don't use it basically the muscles forget how to fully exercise your range of motion you
10290520	10296360	got to go through through some therapy to get your arm working again right kind of the same thing
10296360	10304760	with a nicad a nicad if you didn't fully discharge it and then fully charge it it would only think
10304760	10312040	that its range was in this narrow margin of performance so the problem with nicads with
10312040	10317480	like cam corridors and cell phones where as soon as that voltage started to drop a little bit you
10317480	10322840	start to get the low battery indicator and to preserve the electronic integrity of what you
10322840	10328840	were doing it would shut off then you'd get it sticking in your charger charge it back up and
10328840	10333640	what would happen it would only get used to operating in this little room right here some of
10333640	10338440	the manufacturers got smart and they put a little button on there and they could connect it to a load
10338440	10343320	and drag it down all the way and then recharge it all the way i've gotten because i understand this
10343320	10349480	stuff i've gotten exceptional exceptional use out of out of nicad batteries when my kids were
10349480	10355400	growing up my first video camera back in the 1980s i had one of those big vhs units don't laugh it was
10355400	10360120	vhs at least it wasn't beta should have been beta beta was better but that's another story for another
10360120	10366040	day but it was one of these big herken vhs you know and it took this big 12 volt battery pack
10366040	10370840	and i went to replace it and i was looking at some different vendors and they're looking at me
10370840	10375160	and they couldn't believe that it was the original battery pack it's like we don't even carry
10375160	10379160	replacements for those anymore you know how long have you had this uh since the beginning
10380520	10385480	well you know how could this be it's because i understood how to take care of nicads what i did
10385480	10390600	is i made myself a dummy load and when the battery got low you know i mean obviously if it was a
10390600	10395560	birthday party or something that i wanted a video i could recharge the battery but at least on a regular
10395560	10402200	basis i would discharge it all the way and then charge it all the way and by the way with nickel
10402200	10406680	cadmium cells when i say charge it all the way that doesn't mean slapping on your quick charger
10409400	10414760	like if you've got a cordless drill at home a makita i got a quick charger for it worst thing
10414760	10420680	you could do mine still works being all those quick chargers work they actually have a temperature
10420680	10427960	sensor in the battery pack when the battery starts to get hot it must be full so it cuts the battery
10427960	10435880	off that's not a full charge the only true method of charging an icad properly is a timed charge
10435880	10441080	a trickle charge where you're trickling in a note amount of current and then you bring it gradually
10441080	10447800	up to that 100% now slam it and then the thing gets hot and then shuts off some of the early ones
10448040	10454600	once it would stop charging it would cut it off right and then what would happen when the battery
10454600	10459560	cooled down it started charging again and then would get hot and shut down so you ended up with
10459560	10464200	this cycle and these were the real cheap chargers and those would just eat these nicads so if you
10464200	10471000	know about nicads nicads weren't that bad they really weren't the next thing was uh nickel metal
10471000	10476440	hydride nickel metal hydride that was the next evolutionary process rechargeable battery secondary
10477000	10482760	cells a lot of us had them years ago and our cell phones worked very very well less prone to that
10482760	10489160	memory condition with all these secondary batteries though is it a limited unlimited number of charges
10489160	10495880	and discharges and recharges no every rechargeable battery when it's brand new you only get so many
10495880	10501160	cycles out of it they're not going to last forever even if you take good care of them and then now
10501240	10506840	lithium ion lithium ion if you've got a newer cell phone probably came with lithium ion that's
10506840	10521320	really the best that's out there now i don't know i was just i don't know i was thinking about that
10521320	10525720	the other day because i've and i've actually gotten new battery put aside that i've never charged it
10525720	10533640	still in the package so um i don't know i've been keeping my eyes open in the store for that style
10533640	10538280	pack and i'm sure it's available on the internet but what am i going to have to pay for it you know
10538280	10542280	the other thing though too check this out because you know i'm not the smartest guy but i kind of
10542280	10548440	understand some of this stuff some of those cases you could actually cut them open and you could
10548440	10553800	replace the cells yourself you know and then re bond the plastic back together and i've done that
10553800	10561640	on several things myself as i've reconditioned put in new packs i had a i had some i forgot what the
10561640	10570520	heck it was it took nycad batteries and then what i did is i cut it open and it was just standard
10570520	10576120	nycad battery usually doesn't have the label on it but the sizes were the same and then what i did
10576120	10583080	is i went to a harbor freight tools and i bought nickel metal hydride rechargeable cells and i put
10583080	10591320	the pack back together soldered it up good to go good to go so in some some cases you could do that
10593080	10597320	a lot of high performance things too even like jet aircraft if you're down drive past bowing field
10597320	10602360	you see a lear jet sitting out there believe it or not what they're typically going to use is not
10602360	10608120	the lead acid they're actually going to have nycad packs so when they start the engines on the jet
10608120	10612760	they're starting it off a nycad and those are very very expensive so it's kind of amazing
10613000	10617320	you're a multi-millionaire flying around in a lear jet a lot of times you know what those guys will
10617320	10622760	ask for they want a starter pack to be brought over with a little tug and there's a cart with a
10622760	10627800	bunch of batteries on it a lot of acid batteries and then you plug that into the aircraft and then
10627800	10633240	what they'll do is they'll they'll use that so they don't have to put a charge discharge cycle in
10633240	10637960	their night nycads in their precious lear jet it's like man if you could afford a freaking lear jet
10637960	10644280	you can afford a new freaking nycad you know but i used to work part you're the funnest job i ever
10644280	10649160	had i worked part-time at an airport canada kept those guys always used to amaze me and a lot of
10649160	10653240	them wouldn't a lot of them would tip you you know you bring that pack over whatever here you go go
10653240	10658840	go buy yourself a good lunch here son oh thank you sir you know i didn't mind somebody's dude so
10658840	10664680	man i'm saving you money you're not even tossing me a bone come on man the heck next time i'm gonna
10664680	10673400	park you out there this is the cutaway view of a lead acid cell now connecting cells and batteries
10674920	10681960	connecting cells and batteries we have series aiding this this chart here is is erroneous
10684440	10691960	um let me draw this on the board here what we're talking about here series aiding means
10694680	10700760	negative positive i can assume that this is what voltage
10702760	10709480	1.5 volts so if i connect it to another cell
10711640	10720680	i can assume that this is 1.5 volts and if i go ahead and even connect the third cell down here
10720680	10729160	i can assume that this is 1.5 volts what am i up to right here what's my total voltage
10729160	10736920	from this point to this point okay very good 4.5 volts everybody see that
10738520	10747960	everybody see that so what i'm doing here is by series in series aiding i am increasing the
10748040	10755000	electrical pressure that's available to me the amount of current that's available here
10755880	10762360	is going to stay the same because this is what we call a series configuration and current will
10762360	10769080	always stay the same in a series configuration so by connecting up batteries or cells like this
10769080	10776680	i could get a higher voltage but current will remain the same does that make sense
10778760	10784920	now down below it talks about series opposing series opposing would be like
10786520	10788600	okay i got a negative and a positive here
10791160	10792040	y'all agree with that
10794920	10797960	then i'm going to connect the positive and a negative here
10800680	10805080	so i've got 1.5 volts here and how many volts do i have here
10808760	10817720	minus 1.5 volts so what's my voltage across zero so
10820600	10826280	my slide which is politically correct says it has little practical value it's actually stupid
10826920	10831480	this is like you know you're you're putting a battery in backwards why come my flashlight no
10831480	10836360	work and you take them out you realize you're putting one of the cells backwards has little
10836440	10843560	practical value this one's adding 1.5 volts this one's taking 1.5 volts away you're putting
10843560	10849080	a negative and a negative here current's not going to want to flow again it has little practical
10849080	10855800	value yeah challenging electronic students when they're going through a theory course like this
10856440	10860840	it really is because i could draw like five or six of these and then you got it let's see plus
10860840	10868200	1.5 plus 1.5 minus 1.5 minus so we are going to give you some problems like that that have
10868200	10872200	voltages because quite frankly when you do get into sophisticated electronic equipment
10872200	10877000	you're going to see that there are some voltages that are being added to a circuit and some that
10877000	10882200	are being taken away from a circuit so from a math standpoint a theory standpoint it does have value
10882680	10891480	in studying it in parallel and again this is a this is a typo here these should not be equal
10891480	10897480	signs this should be total current is equal to i1 plus i2 plus i3 let me show you this one
10898200	10902920	actually let me just go to the next slide and i'll show you on the slide this is what we were
10902920	10906600	talking about or this is what i was talking about i don't know if we're talking about it it's what i'm
10906600	10913800	talking about one point uh this is three volts three volts and three volts is equal to how much
10913800	10920040	across this six volts can you dig it all right so here we got three volts and three volts which is
10920040	10931960	equal to six volts connected in parallel with six volts why why come why come i do this why would
10931960	10942040	i possibly what is the advantage of this over this what's that is the voltage increased
10945640	10948600	you said to increase the voltage in the current is the voltage increased
10954920	10959240	no i still get how much electrical pressure am i getting out of the circuit six volts
10961960	10967960	what's that increase the capacity tell me more about that i like that
10971240	10976680	very good batteries are measured in in amp hours how much current
10978760	10984520	over a period of time can they provide us with so let's look at this scenario for a
10984520	10988520	minute let's say that we all have a sailboat wouldn't it be nice if we all had a sailboat
10988520	10994680	we could sail off to the sunset let's sail up to the sand one islands and hang out up there
10996600	11003960	okay i've got a six volt it's an unusual sailboat i've got a six volt anchor light
11005160	11012040	so when i find a nice cove up in the sand wands and i drop my anchor by coast guard regulations
11012040	11020520	i'm required at night to turn on a light that says i'm anchored and it's a six volt light
11022360	11029720	the problem is this configuration here will only last for six hours
11032200	11038760	and then the light gets dimmer and dimmer and dimmer until it goes out
11039400	11045880	and shortly after it goes out the fog rolls in and here comes along a washington state ferry
11047160	11052520	and it runs us down and it ruins ruins all of our fun that we're having on our sailboat in sand
11052520	11061640	one islands so i'm a pretty smart guy what i did is i went out and i got another battery pack
11061640	11069480	and i i put it in parallel with the original battery pack the original battery pack lasted
11069480	11077080	for how many hours how many is this going to last for for the same size load it's going to last
11077080	11081080	twice as long how's about them apples
11085000	11091160	that's how it works so basically he or she who has the most batteries in parallel is going to
11091160	11098680	last the longest playing it simple it was actually kind of a funny story
11101160	11107800	um going to sea for extended periods of time under the water there are very few things i mean even
11107800	11115160	reading material books how many books can you bring with you what can you do so back in the day
11115160	11119960	the only the only form of media for me basically for music was cassette tapes
11121400	11127000	so i had my little i didn't even have a sony walkman i eventually upgraded to a sony walkman
11127000	11134280	but originally i had some you know off brand cassette player and actually that was a big
11134280	11138920	advancement because prior to that you needed the big cassette player put the cassette in headphones
11139000	11145480	you know no eight track i'm talking strictly the cassettes we this was high tech cassettes
11147960	11152920	so i bought something that looked like a walkman but of course walkman is a trademark of sony
11152920	11158360	corporation and this was some off brand so it was so funny too because uh you know everything
11158360	11162760	that we did was super secret you couldn't tell anybody we couldn't even tell our spouses that
11162760	11169400	we were going so all of a sudden you see a guy in uniform you know at the at the exchange
11170040	11175400	you know buying like you know five tubes of toothpaste and seven bars of soap and you
11175400	11181080	know a hundred packs of batteries and he's in uniform with his unit you know on his ball cap
11181080	11186040	and you know it's kind of like ah you're stocking up you guys are going to see you know so you didn't
11186040	11190840	have to be like an intelligence expert to figure out who's coming and going so anyway we're going
11190840	11195720	to go to see and it was going to be like a seven month operation that doesn't mean that we'd be
11195720	11202040	totally in communicato or away from civilized uh you know shopping or whatever but for at least
11202040	11210120	a minimum of 90 days we're going to be underwater so i go out and my my cassette player took
11210120	11216520	double a batteries so i bought a bunch of these double a batteries well come to find out that this
11216520	11226920	thing was such a piece of crap that i could want i could listen to 1.5 sides of a cassette tape
11226920	11234040	before the batteries would die and i'm like i'm not a math expert but i'm like i'm going to run out
11234040	11240120	of batteries like really quick so after i used up all my double a batteries and i still want
11240120	11245160	that to listen to music because again you're living with 120 other people in a steel tube 285
11245160	11250600	feet long 28 foot diameter when you could put those headset on and you could kind of zone out
11250600	11256200	that was you know a little piece of piece of tranquility you could have so i'm like well i'm
11256200	11260200	a smart guy i got electronics background how tough can this be so i cracked the thing off i figured
11260200	11268360	out what voltage i could wire in externally so then what i did is um uh every every division on
11268360	11273000	the submarine had different consumable products they were responsible for stocking because you
11273000	11280360	didn't have a store so actually for my division it was pens pads paper so if you were a nuclear
11280360	11285320	reactor guy you'd come to me and say hey joe you know can i need some pens look screw you
11285320	11291240	you know but i'd give you the pens or the paper whatever you need well ironically the division
11291240	11298200	that was responsible for first um uh providing batteries ironically were the electricians so
11298200	11301240	when i went back and i said you know i need some batteries what do you guys got well you know we
11301240	11305720	got these sizes here and they were the you know the big d size and they were military you know olive
11305720	11312600	drab green big batteries and i'm like yeah give me like eight of them you know so i got these eight
11312600	11319160	batteries and i wind them all up wired them all up combination series parallel and then i got
11319160	11325080	electrical tape and i like this big freaking brick you know and so i got this this nice little
11325080	11329880	portable cassette player that i paid you know an exorbitant amount of money for and then i got this
11329880	11337480	big brick i'm like so it was truly a portable device you know so anyway it worked and it worked
11337480	11343800	fine and then i got so used to carrying this thing around that it was like months later we're in port
11343800	11349000	and i'm still carrying this brick and i even with a handle on it it was and it kept working and i'm
11349000	11353000	like why am i doing this this thing is stupid i finally i actually cut it off and i threw it
11353000	11356520	over the side of the boat it's probably sitting in the bottom of the Thames river in connecticut
11356520	11365880	still but the moral of the story is that portable cassette recorder operated off of 1.5 volt cells
11365880	11373000	did it not what was the difference when i added the brick to it those are 1.5 volt cells right
11374440	11382280	capacity physically more chemical physically more capacity higher amp hour rating and it
11382280	11387560	kept going and going and going and going and going so this is one of the principles for a lot of
11387560	11396760	you that may pursue alternative energy whatever that means basically it's the efficiency of your
11396760	11405080	cells how many cells do you have how much energy can you store actually had a student that is a
11405080	11413960	project he owns the property in central washington and um living off the grid had a backup generator
11413960	11419480	also put in some photovoltaic cells and as a project he basically did the math and figured out
11419480	11425800	like on the shortest day of the year how many appliances am i going to want to run in my little
11425800	11432040	cabin and will i have enough electrical energy to make it through the night and that's basically
11432040	11438120	what his target was and he says i need this much storage capacity and that's what he used as a target
11438120	11445160	actually increased that i think by about 20 percent and then in the summer how many how many hours
11445160	11450200	could he use photovoltaic to charge that and then what's the minimum amount of time that he needs to
11450200	11456440	run his generator to get those batteries up to that full capacity charge so if you understand
11456440	11460200	the math behind this let me tell you your commodity out there because a lot of people
11460200	11467560	don't have a freaking clue they don't they don't when i was on a cruise a couple weeks ago on
11467560	11472200	vacation i met a uh i'm trying to i'm trying to get on better terms with this guy and actually
11472200	11480200	we've been corresponding via email he owns a 52 foot yacht in miami and an airplane high-performance
11480200	11489880	aircraft and um he likes taking his his yacht down to the bahamas in dropping anchor and he
11489880	11494600	doesn't like running the generator so we had a whole discussion about energy management photovoltaic
11494600	11500120	what's the minimum amount of time that you could run your generator can you add batteries to augment
11500120	11506440	the system and i mean this guy he's a couple masters degree highly intelligent and he didn't
11506440	11511640	have a clue of what i was talking about so if you understand this let me tell you
11513240	11515960	you got it going on when it comes to this type of stuff makes sense
11518840	11523800	voltage rise is the energy we put into a circuit voltage drop is the energy that we take out of
11523800	11528520	the circuit if you will is given up as the electrons encounter resistance to the circuit
11531160	11535240	so voltage rise would be like your batteries voltage drop is what you're powering
11535960	11542120	and you know what they should always be equal to each other if you've got a five-volt battery pack
11542120	11547480	and you're powering a radio that radio should be consuming five volts five volt voltage rise five
11547480	11554520	volt voltage drop makes sense should never end up with energy left over if you are that's what we
11554520	11559960	call a malfunction you've got a malfunction you've got voltage not going from the source to the load
11560920	11566200	the voltage rise that the power company provides my house with is 240 volts a c
11567240	11574120	my voltage drop for my home is 240 volts a c if it was 239 that means a volt is being dropped
11574120	11580440	somewhere underground or in the overhead it's not supposed to be getting dropped there question
11590920	11591640	voltage rise
11599960	11607560	yeah that's your question is more related to power i'm talking simply voltage i'm talking simply
11607560	11613160	voltage so that if i've got and i'm keeping it real simplistic and you need to understand it in a
11613160	11620520	simplistic manner if this calculator takes three volts dc the three volts dc is going to be my
11620520	11627880	voltage drop right if i want this thing to operate properly i need to give it a voltage rise of
11629320	11635880	three volts so that's all i'm saying voltage rise is the power is the elect the voltage pressure
11635880	11642200	you apply to it the voltage drop is the pressure that gets consumed by the load and they should
11642280	11647400	always be equal if they're not wherever the missing voltages that's a problem
11653000	11657080	if you're consuming less than what the power company's providing you with you've got a problem
11657800	11662680	because that missing voltage has got to be somewhere and where you find it that's the problem
11664520	11669560	make sense okay we'll talk more about that concept but right now i just want you to understand
11670520	11672280	voltage rise equals voltage drop
11675080	11683400	ground ground this is an interesting concept and if you hear ever driven over snow qualmi pass
11684520	11688760	how do you know you're going over snow qualmi pass it's not a trick question
11690440	11696360	how do you know you're going over the pass there's a sign on the side of the road that says
11697320	11698760	snow qualmi pass
11702920	11709240	i try to keep it basic here now that sign also says snow qualmi pass and there's another bit
11709240	11719720	of information there elevation elevation above what north bend seattle above where
11721000	11725400	sea level you guys are all smart you guys are one of my smartest classes here in a while
11727080	11737080	high tide or low tide average you know what we call that
11739800	11746840	msl mean sea level mean sea level so one of the things that al gore is talking about like sea
11746840	11753720	level rising that's what he's talking about so his big concern is all the expense of changing all
11753720	11760280	the signs elevation now obviously it's going to cause a lot of problems if mean sea level if
11760280	11765320	the polar ice caps melt and sea level rises it's going to be a lot of flooding and devastation
11765960	11772120	okay especially during hurricanes and high tide events and tsunamis and everything else
11774600	11781240	so we use the height of the ocean mean sea level as a reference for all of our height measurements
11781960	11786120	it's actually really important when i fly my airplane it's one of the first things instruments
11786120	11792600	i calibrate when i get in is the altimeter and that shows me how high i am above sea level
11793320	11799560	it's kind of important i flew my airplane friday night i went across the top of c-tac airport
11800360	11804440	i had airplanes taken off and arriving and i'm flying through there in my small plane
11805000	11807480	you kind of think it's important that i know what else to do what i'm at
11808440	11813720	yeah and as a matter of fact they check back with you when you establish radio communications
11813720	11819880	they say you know hold maintain 1500 forces kilo what's your current altitude 1500 roger we got
11819880	11824520	you at 1500 you're cleared through our airspace because they want to make sure you're not off
11824520	11829880	it's important to me so that's how we calibrate if you're in hiking driving even boating mean sea
11829880	11835000	level is kind of critical isn't it high tide low tide if you're at low tide you hit a freaking rock
11835000	11837560	it's kind of important you have the right charge and you understand low tide
11840600	11849800	mean mean no mean me and mean which is average so when we started playing around with electricity
11849800	11857720	we had to come up with a methodology if you will to what's what's what can we compare what's a
11857720	11861160	benchmark of something that's in a neutral natural state
11865480	11873720	earth why because this is where we be okay this is where we're standing so literally what we got
11873720	11880760	is a ground rod an eight foot ground rod drive it into the earth and say you know what you connected
11881000	11889320	you're connected to ground and you're connected to zero potential it's not positive it's not
11889320	11896120	negative it's neutral why because it's driven into the freaking ground so what happens is
11896120	11904280	the idea kind of caught on so the power company out at the power pole or your transformer if you
11904280	11909640	have underground they got a rod and they drove it into the ground they said you know what we're
11909640	11921240	going to sell you 240 volts ac in reference to ground at your home at your load you should get
11921240	11929640	240 volts in reference to ground the electrical generating plant where they generate the electricity
11929640	11936200	they drove a ground rod in and they reference that voltage to ground so we use it as a reference to
11936200	11941000	all of our voltages which are really quite critical i'm kind of making fun of this in a in a in a
11941000	11948360	goofy way but in all honesty it's actually really really critical like right now at my home i've got
11948360	11957240	the electrical connection coming from the power company in reference to hopefully ground i get my
11957240	11964040	telephone line soon to be replaced kicking at old school and that needs to be referenced to
11964920	11971960	ground i've got a satellite receiver that has the antenna up on the roof that antenna needs to
11971960	11978040	be referenced to ground the satellite receiver also plugs into the electrical outlet that should
11978040	11983480	be referenced at ground and it also needs to be plugged into the telephone connection that should
11983480	11991720	be referenced at ground actually when i had con cast installed in my home it was over the summer
11991720	11996600	i had time off i was watching these dudes install it and because i teach electronics i'd always like
11996600	12000520	to say hey dude what's going on man how long you've been with comcast these people treat you okay
12000520	12005160	what's the deal what's your educational background what's going down you know how are you doing that
12005160	12008520	if i could learn something from you somebody that doesn't installs all day long i'm gonna pick your
12008520	12013560	brain and see what i can learn anyway see this dude hooking his freaking contraption up to my
12013560	12018120	my my faucet i'm like what are you doing he said i'm connecting this to ground we got a reference
12018120	12024120	at the ground i'm like hold on cease and desist what are you doing well i got to connect this to
12024120	12027880	ground i says my freaking water connection well yeah but this is you know water pipe is a good
12027880	12034760	ground no you see that right there driven into the ground that's a ground rod okay that's the
12034760	12039560	same ground rod that the power company's providing me with the ground it's the same ground that everything
12039560	12043400	else in the house is connected to so why are you going to connect it to this faucet coming out all
12043400	12048360	you don't know if it's pvc inside he really got an attitude and i'm like no boom cease and desist
12048360	12053640	i got a supervisor out there and i had assigned paperwork modified install modified install
12056120	12062040	customer request i want ground and i wrote that right in there me want ground to be connected to
12062040	12066760	ground rod you know so they all really got an attitude and stuff you know but it's kind of like
12066760	12070200	no i mean it really needs to happen because especially too this is back in the day when
12070200	12074920	you had a computer modem you could have that modem you could have your computer power supply you
12074920	12080360	could have all these things and if they're not all connected to ground they could develop a difference
12080360	12087160	in potential and if they develop a difference in potential you know how that's going to manifest
12087160	12094120	itself with highly sophisticated electronic systems not necessarily sparks of fire could be gremlins
12094680	12101160	it could just be real wacky behavior all of a sudden your satellite receiver starts rebooting
12101160	12105720	itself all of a sudden your computer reboots itself all of a sudden your modem kicks you out
12106680	12111640	so when they started doing all of this interbuilding networking and everything it became a real big
12111640	12118280	issue to make sure that ground was really ground years ago when they built this building uh well
12118280	12123400	actually they renovated this building behind here they pulled up the concrete they drilled down into
12123400	12129000	the earth and they put in this huge ground for the school to make sure it wasn't just a standard
12129000	12133320	ground rod this was like drilled way down into into the earth you know you can see like the
12133320	12139320	core and stuff and i'm just kidding but it was it was it was pretty far down in this is actually
12139320	12144360	one of the problems they have like in arizona because of the sand and in the desert and it's
12144360	12149880	we have good ground here because it's like all wet but in arizona they have some problems so
12149880	12154280	i think there's some uh code variants down there where they're like actually connecting
12154280	12159480	like rebar in the concrete you know foundation and such and they do some different stuff down there
12159480	12163480	i'm not totally familiar with it but some of those dry climates they have to do it john
12165960	12172600	it was and they were actually adding chemicals to almost create like a p and an n type material
12172600	12177400	there so current would only have one way to travel through that like a giant diode buried in the
12177400	12182760	ground behind here so i wish i'd take a picture it's like i know you know you're not believing me
12182760	12187560	but it was like a drilling rig out there it's like black gold texas tea we're going to hollywood
12189480	12197320	anyway the other type of electrical ground is electrical ground and this provides a common
12197320	12209160	reference point we use this electrical ground because the 747 taking off would look stupid
12209800	12217240	with a big reel spool wired trailing behind it okay it just wouldn't look right so for pure
12217240	12223720	aesthetic purposes we can't do this so we use what's called electrical ground your car uses
12223720	12230440	electrical ground airplanes use electrical ground ships use electrical ground and what that in
12230440	12237800	essence means is a chassis ground now most of our home appliances use both we ground the chassis
12239240	12246680	the electrical ground to earth ground so that if you have a three prong plug one of those plugs
12246680	12250520	that round plug is ground and that's connected to the chassis
12253480	12258520	so be aware of this in the lab you're going to have some problems with ground
12261640	12266760	because you don't understand what i'm talking about some of the equipment that we have in the
12266760	12272440	lab is isolated from ground so when you connect the negative lead like on a power supply you think
12272440	12277240	you're connecting ground as a chat you're not that negative if you have a dc power supply in the
12277240	12283160	lab you have a positive you have a negative they're isolated from ground they have nothing to do with
12283160	12288360	earth ground so in some cases you could create a ground loop in there and they get wacky results
12288360	12295400	with your equipment most commercial consumer industrial products are for the purposes of
12295400	12300120	electrical safety that chassis will be a ground and that's connected also to earth ground question
12302600	12305240	electrical ground can vary from whatever you want
12307320	12311400	absolutely absolutely and that's one of the things that could be a real problem
12311400	12316120	is you might think you get into a piece of equipment and say oh wow look at this big metal
12316760	12321080	look at this big um if this was inside this is actually a dc power supply like we use in the lab
12321720	12327720	okay this in the back here is a heat sink if this was installed inside some big piece of
12327720	12332520	equipment like a radar system you see this metal you assume that oh this metal here that's that's
12332520	12339000	that's ground that must be ground because it's metal right and all of a sudden you know you put
12339000	12346200	your hand on there you lean into it and you get electrocuted this in some cases could be electrically
12346200	12353640	isolated from ground this could be connected to some big high power transmitter tube for the purpose
12353640	12358040	of dissipating energy and it could actually have like that mica that i passed round earlier
12358600	12364760	it could have a big sheet of that mica there electrically insulating it from the rest of
12364760	12369880	the chassis or frame of the piece of equipment and that's taken out many a good technician
12369880	12376440	so never assume never assume generally yes some of the worst shocking experiences i've ever had
12376440	12381160	were working on a lot of tube circuits because sometimes those tube circuits were notorious
12381160	12386360	for too prong old school tube amplifier you plug it in too prong and you didn't have that
12386360	12390040	electrical ground in there all of a sudden you you go up against the chassis and you're getting
12390040	12401560	getting zapped by 300 volts make sense all right we talked about current flow of electrons
12401560	12406440	in a specified direction happens at the speed of light voltage and there's only six different
12406440	12412120	methods of producing voltage friction magnetism chemicals light heat and pressure we talked about
12412120	12417960	voltage rise that's the energy that we put into a circuit voltage drop is the voltage we get out
12417960	12423080	of the circuit voltage rise and voltage drop should equal each other if they don't you got a problem
12423080	12430360	am i being silly am i keeping it basic yeah but you know what i have fixed in my career dozens
12430360	12436840	of problems that that was the symptom and the symptom is the equipment doesn't work right what's
12436840	12441880	the first thing that i do check the voltage coming in if the voltage coming in isn't good
12441880	12447080	it's not going to work right then you got to find out where the missing voltages maybe it's a brown
12447080	12452680	out maybe it's a brown out maybe the power company they're having a problem with with with generating
12452680	12458840	power and giving you know the feed but those two always need to equal each other we also talked
12458840	12466600	about ground earth ground is a freaking rod driven into the earth why the earth well it's where we
12466600	12471000	stand it's where we live it is what it is neutral natural state and we talked about electrical
12471000	12478040	ground which is typically the chassis could be the airframe of an airplane which is actually kind of
12478040	12483080	odd it's kind of odd when they talk about an airplane because what's Boeing building now
12483880	12492200	787 what's that thing made out of aluminum composite think about this one by using the
12492200	12497160	chassis of your automobile as ground you know how much wiring it saves on your car
12500360	12503560	go ahead make a stab at it you know how much how much wiring it saves on your car
12504920	12512360	saves half the wiring if your car was made out of composites and it was not a conductive material
12512360	12518520	you would have double the amount of wires on your car because we use the chassis as an electrical
12518520	12528680	connection make sense okay i've got a question for you and i'm going to ask you about this uh in
12528680	12539800	our next lecture and i want you to discuss this in teams and as a class since there are six different
12539800	12553240	methods of producing voltage i am going to design a deep space probe to boldly go where no man has
12553240	12564680	gone before so this deep space probe is going to probe deep space that's why it's called deep space
12564680	12577800	probe what method should i use to power this thing in outer space so that it keeps going
12577800	12585000	and going and going and sending data back to earth through a high power transmitter so we could we
12585000	12591320	could monitor its journey from afar i want you to think about this i want you to discuss it as teams
12591560	12597800	in next week when we lecture on e-lc 110 i'm going to expect an answer from unit better b
12597800	12605720	and the right answer they're all hell's going to break loose any questions question
12606440	12618120	um
12624200	12628120	radiating something absolutely
12635880	12639720	sounds like you got some good ideas that are worth pursuing
12642920	12650680	enough said we've got somebody in here that's thinking that's cool question how do you measure
12650680	12659720	ground it is measured in ohms um what you do is you have to it's a comparative process of what
12659720	12669320	you assume is a good ground and um you're basically comparing your ground unknown ground to that good
12669320	12677400	ground but there's an assumption may made that by getting an eight foot long rod in in driving it in
12677400	12682200	that that is providing you with an adequate adequate ground you need something else to compare it to
12682760	12692440	in order for your assessment to be accurate what are you measuring it in reference to
12701720	12707080	okay well you're doing from an electrical outlet if i wanted to verify that this is a good ground
12707800	12712200	um in actuality what i need to do here is i could measure ground against my neutral
12712200	12720040	those two should be connected back at that box okay so between the hot lead and ground
12720040	12724520	in between the hot lead and neutral i should end up with the same difference in potential
12724520	12729880	then going with a multimeter to that box i should get that same difference in potential across the
12729880	12734760	two and that basically is letting me know that the ground and the neutral for that particular
12734760	12744920	circuit are valid but for you to compare a good earth ground to a not so good earth ground
12747160	12750840	i don't know how you'd go about that other than you you've got to you've got to basically know
12750840	12757320	that one of them is is good and that's actually one of the things about ground too that um i don't
12757880	12767480	any of you are aware a lot of am radio stations are located in swamp lands it's the best place
12767480	12774120	that you could put an am radio station because in a swampy area you get a really good ground
12774760	12779400	so you get a really good ground plane and because the frequencies that you radiate at
12780200	12787080	it's going to ensure much better transmission of that rf signal a second choice is also a field
12787400	12795160	a pasture where cows graze and urinate and keep everything nice and moist okay and healthy
12795960	12800280	that's why even in new york city grown up in connectica all the new york city radio stations
12800280	12806520	wabc wnbc wcbs all of their transmitters were located in new jersey the meadowlands
12807160	12811880	okay if there's any giant fans here through all their transmitters were located why because it was
12811880	12818440	a marshy location fm transmitters different if you're in new york city where do you want to
12818440	12824600	put an fm transmitter top of the empire state building why because it's the highest it doesn't
12824600	12829320	have as much to do you still need a good ground but it's not as essential as that low frequency
12829320	12834360	transmitters so ground is important folks we're going to talk more about it we can have a course
12834360	12840360	in ground we honestly could five credit class and just talk about ground testing processes um
12840360	12843400	you know some of the some of the different things that that we've encountered with ground
12844200	12849000	50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago ground wasn't that big of a deal ground right now is very
12849000	12855400	very big because a difference equates to a difference in potential and even a small difference in
12855400	12861080	voltage could create could create a circuit it caused that circuit to go here's your final technical
12861080	12867000	term for the night cattywampus all right all right it's all i got folks have a good
12867320	12875480	okay let's get started chapter four chapter four
12878280	12881160	just kind of as a review to get us up to speed with
12885240	12892440	what we've talked about thus far we talked about the fundamental physics of electricity
12892920	12903640	where does electricity come from and uh what subatomic properties mean to both materials
12904440	12913800	the type of materials that we use in harnessing electricity and electronics and also how materials
12913800	12921480	are affected when we apply energy to them when we apply energy to matter we could
12921560	12927240	knock some electrons free from the valence shell when we knock those electrons free from
12927240	12934680	the valence shell that represents potential energy right because we could uh we could direct
12935480	12942680	those free electrons through a circuit and make them do some work for us right
12943400	12952520	so we call that flow of electrons current current the flow of electrons in a specified
12952520	12959400	direction and that specified direction is negative to positive and every 6.24 times 10 to the 18th
12961320	12969000	electrons equals one coulomb one coulomb per second equals one ampere
12969400	12975800	so we talked about current already the next thing we're going to talk about tonight
12976360	12986920	chapter four is resistance or as the french would say resistance right i mean resistance
12989320	12995560	and this is kind of easy to remember one of the questions that i'm going to ask you in the future
12996120	13004600	in lecture is going to be what has resistance and the answer is easy everything has resistance
13006280	13013320	everything some things have more resistance than others but basically everything has resistance
13013320	13020920	there's only one thing that i'm aware of that doesn't have resistance and it only exists in a
13020920	13034200	laboratory what am i talking about superconductor superconductor superconductivity is the utilization
13034200	13045400	of materials that have no resistance zero resistance so once we get that stuff up and running once
13045400	13051080	science masters that they're going to be dealing with materials that have no resistance
13052520	13056920	that's going to revolutionize the industry because right now it's something we just got
13056920	13063320	to deal with and there's a lot of losses associated with it the power companies would love to get a
13063320	13069960	whole superconductivity at room temperature they'd love to harness that question
13070040	13077560	do modern computers have superconductors no no it is not feasible right now for any
13077560	13086360	everyday use it only exists in a laboratory at extremely cold temperatures the use of a cryogen
13086360	13092920	cryogenics and believe it or not i shared with you right what what material are they having the
13092920	13103640	best luck with ceramics who would have thunk ceramics ceramic a great insulator at room temperature
13103640	13109960	but at these extremely cold temperatures some of these ceramics take on superconductive properties
13109960	13114520	anyway we're not going to talk anymore about that i'd love to but we just don't have time
13115080	13119480	what we've got to do is embark on our journey here chapter four resistance
13119480	13126200	after completing this chapter you're going to be able to define resistance and explain its
13126200	13135160	effect in a circuit determine the tolerance range of a resistor identify carbon composition
13135160	13144280	wire wound and film resistors identify potentiometers and rheostats describe how a variable
13145080	13153800	resistor operates decode a resistor's value using a color code or alphanumeric code
13154760	13160520	identify the three types of resistor circuits and calculate out total resistance in series
13160520	13171720	parallel and series parallel circuits resistance is the opposition to electron flow in a circuit
13174440	13181800	what has resistance everything except superconductors everything everything has resistance
13182440	13189640	if you went out and bought a new extension cord over the weekend even though you paid a lot of
13189640	13196040	money and it's a really good high quality extension cord still has resistance if you went out and bought
13197880	13202120	cable for your speakers you're rewiring your house and you're putting in some new speakers
13202120	13209720	and you went out and got some of that monster cable cost your fortune still has resistance
13211720	13215400	everything has resistance it's expressed by the symbol r
13217320	13226840	it's measured in ohms ohms discovered by a guy by the name of john ohms
13227560	13237640	abbreviated with the greek symbol omega the greek greek symbol omega
13240440	13246360	and although everything has resistance the amount of resistance varies from material
13246360	13257240	to material silver is the best meaning it has the least found in nature so if we if you went out
13257240	13263480	the periodic table and played around with it and tried to find what materials on the periodic table
13263480	13273800	you could find and which one had the least resistance it would be silver copper is the most common
13273800	13282760	meaning it's really the cheapest even though it's expensive in the grand scheme of things that's why
13282760	13288360	you got these people like cannibalizing stuff taking stuff apart to steal the freaking wire
13289960	13294760	what took the cake was did you hear down in Tacoma a couple months ago they've got the uh
13294760	13298600	that drawbridge that go down down by downtown Tacoma the big ships go underneath
13299320	13304440	the cannibal they just got in there one night and they tore it all up the control panel it's
13304440	13310280	gonna i don't know it's like millions of dollars to rebuild this thing and they just stole all the
13310280	13315800	wire out of it gutted it and i just started turning into a recycling place yeah i got all this wire
13317080	13326520	sure you know how much you're kidding
13329480	13335160	huh that's nuts
13337400	13339560	for legitimate people that's nuts
13341640	13346120	now washington or oregon washington washington huh
13346360	13359720	gold doesn't tarnish so although gold is not as good a conductor as silver by plating it
13361720	13366200	by plating copper with gold then you get the best of both worlds you have something that
13366200	13372360	doesn't tarnish because the problem with silver if any of you have any silver jewelry or silver
13372360	13378760	wear about the same time you're done polishing it you need to polish it again because being exposed
13378760	13389080	to oxygen oxidizes it gold that doesn't happen no oxidation means you get a superior connection
13389080	13397400	when you use it as a termination on an electrical connector resistance is affected by temperature
13397480	13408040	it is affected by temperature typically resistance has a positive temperature coefficient we call it
13408760	13414280	positive temperature coefficient meaning as temperature increases the amount of resistance
13414280	13422120	in a conductor increases which is a problem if you have an extension cord and it starts to get hot
13423080	13429320	the extension cord is going to possess more resistance if it possesses more resistance that
13429320	13434600	means less current makes it to your load and the extension cord is going to get even hotter if it
13434600	13439480	gets even hotter its resistance is going to increase more limiting the amount of current even more
13439480	13443400	that's going so that's where you end up with a vicious cycle you let that go on long enough you
13443400	13451480	end up with an electrical fire so keep that in mind if you've got an extension cord or a cable
13451480	13462760	that's getting warm getting hot it's a problem it's also affected by size size does matter
13462760	13469560	when it comes to conductors basically the individual that has the thickest conductor
13471640	13477400	will have the least amount of resistance so earlier in lecture when i said about connecting
13477400	13484200	up your speakers using that monster cable if you really are using monster cable and that
13484200	13491240	cable is really thick the thicker it is the least resistance it has the more energy you transfer
13491240	13498920	from the source to the load from your amplifier to the speaker and that's a good thing so generally
13498920	13505480	speaking you want to use the thickest conductor that you can afford or of course adhere to standard
13506440	13511800	manufacturing processes and there's tables that you could find that show specifically
13511800	13514920	what is required electrical code dictates that
13517160	13522520	in your home the majority of circuits in your home are 15 amp circuits they can handle up the
13522520	13530200	15 amps standard electric code code dictates that you need to use at least 14 gauge wire for those
13530200	13536520	circuits for 20 amp circuits you have some 20 amp circuits in your in your house maybe in your
13536520	13542600	kitchen or out in your garage your workroom your utility room electrical code dictates that you
13542600	13550920	have 12 gauge wire minimum that means that the wire is thick enough to support the flow of 20 amps
13550920	13561560	of current resistivity is the resistance of a material to current flow resistivity is going to
13561560	13571240	be different for different materials even good conductors have different levels of resistivity
13571240	13585080	here is a table that shows us the resistivity and what we use as a benchmark is the resistivity of
13585080	13593080	silver there's a lot of things in science that we we do like this one we were talking about last
13593080	13599720	week remember i talked about specific gravity remember specific gravity specific gravity
13599720	13608280	is a benchmark that we use with fluids and we compare everything to the specific gravity
13609160	13616200	of pure water h2o at room temperature typically 65 degrees standard temperature
13617080	13621080	and we say that it has a specific gravity of 1.000
13621880	13634760	in dealing with conductors we use resistivity which compares resistivity to that to the best known
13634760	13642520	conductor that we have found in nature which is silver so we say that resistivity has a or excuse
13642520	13659240	resistivity of 1.000 copper 1.0625 lead 1.370 gold 1.5
13663000	13669720	and you can see the rest of the table there this compares all resistivity of all materials so silver
13670040	13677080	has the least resistance it's the best so therefore it has a resistivity we use as a benchmark of 1.000
13677080	13682600	so do you understand the difference between resistivity and resistance
13685240	13692280	resistance is measured in ohms resistivity compares everything to silver
13692760	13703880	conductance the ability of a material to pass electrons conductance
13705960	13712280	it's expressed as the capital letter g and believe it or not i'm not making this up
13712760	13723720	the unit that we measure this in is called the mo mho its ohms felt backwards and that's not by a
13723720	13730360	mistake basically the dude that came up with this said i'm going to spell ohm backwards take the
13730360	13737560	reciprocal of resistance and call it the mo and see if that makes the textbooks well it made the
13737560	13747720	textbooks but it's not the unit of measure that we've adopted for measuring resistance
13748920	13754760	it is the unit we measure conductance with it's abbreviated with the greek symbol
13755720	13761240	it should be an upside down omega i don't know why it gives me like an orthodox cross
13761560	13769240	but since that orthodox cross appeared on my slide i'm not inclined to remove it if you
13769240	13776040	know what i mean it's it may be a sign but all this should be as an upside down omega
13778840	13783640	a guide by the name of seamans came up with this have any of you heard of seamans before seamans
13783640	13791160	corporation well this was like great great great granddad seamans and he made the textbooks by
13791320	13796920	playing around with electrical properties and the rest of that company of course is history
13799000	13803560	and what seamans said i guess he was in a big argument with ohm back in the day
13805800	13811720	ohm said we should measure the materials all for their resistance seamans said no we
13811720	13814520	shouldn't we should measure it all for their conductance
13814520	13823160	resistance is measured in ohms seamans is like uh conductance is measured in
13824040	13831400	mose it's ohms spelt backwards well how do you calculate it well it's real simple what you do
13831400	13839960	here is you take the reciprocal of resistance one over resistance equals conductance i mean i
13839960	13846120	guess the guy said this to his face with a straight face so what do you say the answer
13846120	13851400	is you know i say the answer is a thousand ohms well one divided by a thousand well that's how
13851400	13858040	many mose i think it is and actually since it's thousands of ohms taking the reciprocal of it
13858040	13868040	means that most of our answers will actually be in millie mose millie mose or micro mose
13869720	13878200	you can't make this stuff up it used to be that i put out in lecture you will never see a
13878200	13887960	conductivity meter anytime i put out any absolutes in lecture somebody feels compelled to prove the
13887960	13894360	prof wrong so i stated you will never see a conductivity meter and then almost immediately
13894360	13900920	i had a student of my class raise their hand it said i use one every day at work really i've
13900920	13906600	never seen one in my life where do you work and the individual worked actually at a water treatment
13906600	13913880	facility a water treatment facility and what they use the conductivity meter for
13914040	13924680	or literally is to see how much stuff is left over in the water after they treat the water
13925800	13934920	because i don't know if any of you realize this is water a conductor or is it an insulator
13944120	13956520	very good very good pure water h2o pure water
13958200	13963240	basically is an insulator current will not pass through pure water
13965000	13970680	so if i'm in my hot tub filled with pure water my neighbor's wife comes over and joins me
13971000	13977640	and my wife comes home this is why you look comfortable in there would you like a piece of
13977640	13984760	toast and throws a toaster oven that's plugged in provided the tub was filled with pure water
13984760	13993400	h2o it wouldn't be a shocking experience but due to the fact that my water chemistry actually if
13993400	13998280	i get in the tub there's going to be salts and oils from my body that are going to contaminate that
13998280	14001720	and immediately take that pure water into the conductive realm
14003720	14009400	so again the conductivity meter that my former student was using was to measure the conductivity
14009400	14013080	of the water the more stuff you have in the water the more conductive it's going to be
14016040	14022760	i had a terrible bout of um bronchitis several years ago the flu with bronchitis
14022760	14029080	was terrible the verge of pneumonia was coughing fever felt miserable got up went to the doctor
14030360	14034440	it's in the middle of winter you know how dry our air gets in our homes in the middle of winter
14034440	14040760	he recommended i go and get one of those humidifiers fill it up with water plug it in makes humidity
14041400	14042520	puts humidity in the air
14045960	14051800	so i stopped that wall green picked one up brought it home it didn't even have an on off switch
14053000	14057800	you know it's just a tank of water you put the thing on you plug it in and it puts humidity
14057800	14064840	into the air how tough can this be so i mustered every ounce of courage that i had because i really
14064840	14072600	felt like i was dying filled the thing up with water climbed under my covers and i'm looking at
14072600	14080840	the thing sitting over on my uh on my uh nightstand and it's just sitting there so i look at the clock
14080840	14087400	and i continue to watch it nothing's happening i'm like you've got to be kidding me okay this
14087400	14094120	thing's busted or worse yet i got to read the owner's manual on something that doesn't even
14094120	14099320	have an on off switch so i go ahead and i open the owner's manual i'm reading it and stuff
14099320	14103960	and they say right in there if you plug this in and it doesn't produce steam
14104200	14110840	in a certain number of minutes i think it was five minutes your your water may be too soft
14113400	14122040	and add no more than an eighth of a teaspoon of salt to the two and a half gallons in the tank
14123160	14128040	any more than this could corrode the electrodes blah blah blah blah blah blah so i'm like you know
14129160	14133000	i'll read the instructions i'll follow the instructions but i don't think an eighth of
14133000	14136760	a teaspoon of salt in two and a half gallons is going to make much of a difference
14138360	14142040	so i got an eighth of a teaspoon which is a pinch i mean that's just a pinch of salt
14142760	14148440	put it in there plug the thing in got back under the covers by the time i was tucked in under the
14148440	14154680	covers i look over to think steams steams pouring out of it that small amount of impurity was enough
14154680	14159720	to make that water conductive because those don't boil the water what they physically do their
14159720	14167720	electrodes and they flash it to steam so its operation is contingent on having water that
14167720	14171640	has some impurities in it that being said what does this say about our water tap water here in
14171640	14181880	western washington really good water what's that really where where where do you where are you that
14181880	14188520	you don't think the water is that good all right they're getting a little slew out there don't they
14189720	14197720	also depends on which side of red in here generally speaking though here yeah generally speaking here
14197720	14202440	in western washington in the northwest in general we have pretty good water um if any of you've ever
14202440	14207480	lived in southern california i mean i'm by i was buying bottled water back there before bottled
14207480	14212520	water was in vogue you know i was buying bottled water because it tasted like it it didn't have
14212520	14220360	a taste to it that was super hard yeah um in the midwest i mean you know i stayed with a cousin of
14220360	14225800	mine that lives in missouri once and you know get the water softener you got like stalactites and
14225800	14230440	stalagmites in the shower you know because all the minerals that are you know i mean it's just
14230440	14235880	crazy stuff it's very hard on plumbing i grew up in the east coast actually an artesian well well
14235880	14242440	water until the city came in and finally you know put but water was perfect so to some areas of
14242440	14249320	country that are really bad but keep that in mind pure water h2o is an insulator so we have to add
14249320	14260520	some impurities to it to be able to convert it now everything has resistance but we in electricity
14260520	14267480	and electronics have a component that is designed to have this property of resistance and amazingly
14267480	14277640	enough you know what they call it the resistor so a resistor is a specific device designed to
14277640	14285480	possess the property of resistance it's designed to have resistance it's designed to possess a specific
14285480	14294840	value of resistance that's predictable comes in two different classifications one is a fixed value
14294840	14306600	meaning what you see is what you get and the other is a variable value variable meaning we can adjust it
14306840	14315000	variety of shapes and sizes to meet specific circuit space and operating requirements
14317400	14320680	so there are all kinds of resistors on the market
14325480	14329640	these components all have a tolerance associated with them
14330280	14336520	them tolerance is the amount that the resistor may vary and still be acceptable
14342440	14346360	the larger the tolerance typically the cheaper it is to manufacture
14349160	14356520	now believe it or not in electronic components we could have values of tolerances that go
14356520	14363160	anywhere from plus or minus 20 percent 10 percent five two one percent but 20 percent
14363160	14369560	can you imagine that everybody get their taxes in on time how do you think that would go over here
14369560	14375800	irs uh you know i did my taxes and i think they're accurate within 20 percent i think that'd go over
14375800	14383400	pretty big what about if your employer said you know here's your paycheck on friday but
14384200	14390840	uh plus or minus 20 percent we're not really sure if it's accurate plus or minus 20 and if you're on
14390840	14400760	the plus side cool but if you're on the negative 20 it's no either plus plus 20 or minus 20 but
14400760	14407160	it's a difference yeah it well i don't even know if it's a difference of 40 percent is it i guess it
14407160	14416280	would be yeah but the way we say it so we're allowed plus 20 or minus 20 but it's a difference
14416280	14421880	yeah you know if you had a if you've got a hundred ohm resistor keep the math simple right
14421880	14427560	that means that that resistor out of the package could be anywhere from 80 to 120 ohms
14428920	14435080	and it's still okay you got what you paid for so it's kind of wacky thing here because
14435480	14441480	i make you follow all these procedures and policies here dot your eyes cross your t's make sure your
14441480	14446840	paperwork is accurate you're answering to your team lead the class lead we have all this protocol
14446840	14452680	here and everything i expect your answers to be very very accurate but when you get over here to
14452680	14455960	the lab when you get out into industry you're going to find that you're working with components that
14455960	14464040	have tolerances up to plus or minus 20 percent very very frustrating it's actually one of the
14464040	14469800	challenges that i had in this industry because in here everything we talk about is theoretical
14469800	14478520	perfect in industry it's a plus or minus 20 percent and it's okay it's okay
14482680	14486920	so keep that in mind when you're when you're working with any of these components
14487160	14496520	some of the different types of resistors we have molded carbon resistors that are made out of
14497320	14506600	carbon that is molded it's the most commonly used it's inexpensive and it's manufactured in
14506600	14512680	standard resistor values by standard resistor values what i'm talking about you know like how
14512680	14520520	tires come in different sizes you know you i mean i'm sure you could if you wanted to go take a
14520520	14526200	machine class and then make your own wheels on a lathe or whatever on a milling machine down here
14526200	14531640	you could make your own wheel whatever size you want knock yourself out you could make your own
14531640	14536360	wheel can you find a tire that's going to fit your wheel probably the first thing that you would do
14536360	14541880	is look and see what standard tire values are and then make a wheel if you're going to make a custom
14541880	14545560	wheel that fits standard tire sizes because you're going to end up making a wheel that you can't even
14545560	14550360	find a tire for it makes sense so resistors are the same thing when we say they come in standard
14550360	14559560	sizes they come in standard sizes don't expect to go out and find a 103.5 ohm resistor
14561880	14568120	don't expect to find that on the market you could go buy a package of resistors that are
14568120	14574280	100 ohm resistors that are plus or minus 10% and start going through and see if you could find one
14574280	14581720	that's 103.5 but an engineer is never going to specify and say i want 103.5 ohm resistor in the
14581720	14591960	circuit they'll say i want 100 ohm resistor standard sizes another type of resistor manufacturing
14591960	14599400	process comes up with what's called a wire wound resistor these are used in high current circuits
14600120	14614520	and they are made out of wire that is wound because we know that wire has resistance so
14614760	14620760	if i get a certain amount of wire in one turn then i can make another turn and get
14622200	14625240	twice the amount and it's literally how it works
14628440	14634680	the resistance of these varies from a fraction of an ohm to several thousand ohms question
14645240	14653560	it could change over time it could typically it's going to stay pretty close to what it was
14653560	14658680	but again since these heat up things could change in the composition of it and alter its
14658680	14664840	characteristics but that's not a big factor to worry about there's a lot more components
14664840	14669480	in electronics that are a lot more sensitive than resistors good question
14675000	14683800	yeah um the question is do tolerances add up is there a cumulative effect yes
14684360	14689640	i worked um as a contract employee for a biomedical company before i came to tea chair
14689640	14695640	at lake washington you know 20 plus years ago and this um unmentioned biomedical company i was
14695640	14700360	working on this product and it was pretty expensive motherboard and um
14703640	14708840	every component this board kicked my butt i could fix these boards pretty much you know
14708840	14712920	a lot of them were common problems i'd look at the symptoms you know kind of hold it to
14712920	14719240	my forehead let me guess resistors you know our r 22 needs to be replaced i'd replace it
14719240	14726840	fired up the thing works okay i had this one board that i couldn't fix i just could not fix it
14726840	14732120	and when i looked and evaluated the integrity of every component every component was within
14732120	14737480	tolerances but when you put it all together one tolerance was pulling it this way another
14737480	14741960	tolerance was pulling it that way when you put it all together the board would not work it was
14741960	14748200	an anomaly because everything individually functioned and i kind of got in trouble over it
14748200	14753320	it was kind of like my ego like i'm not going to let no stink and board kick my butt and um
14753320	14759320	believe it or not this company had it figured out where every circuit board a technician was allowed
14759320	14765720	allotted basically 0.65 hours to troubleshoot it so what i would do is if i was given a big
14765720	14771000	production run to do on racks what i would go through is fix all the easy problems first
14771000	14775000	and then go to the next easiest problems and work my way so that when i was done i had all
14775000	14779640	the real difficult problems left and then i'd look and see how much time i had left statistically
14780360	14783720	see a lot of a lot of you i don't even think realize that this is how you're
14783720	14788360	met you're measured when you get to industry they know exactly how long it takes to fix this board
14789160	14793480	okay so if it takes you if it's 0.65 hours and it takes you three hours you're gonna have a
14793480	14797560	discussion with the boss you're in the wrong profession you're in the wrong so anyway i knocked
14797560	14802280	out all my boards and i ended up with like four days left so i could go take breaks for four days
14802280	14807720	goof off and still end up statistically ahead of the game but i want that to fix this board i ended
14807720	14811960	up screwing around with this board for two and a half two and a half days and then finally you
14811960	14817160	know my boss saw that you know i'm all i don't have a lot of boards i'm on what are you doing
14817160	14820280	i'm working on this board since kicking my butt you know i've been working on it two and a half
14820280	14824840	day two and a half days you know got the thing through to cross the freaking floor we're not
14824840	14829640	paying you to screw with that and i never was able to fix it but what it was again were tolerances
14830200	14833960	pulling in different directions so sometimes you could have something that individually
14833960	14837640	everything is functional you put it together as integrated as a system just doesn't work why
14838200	14840600	because of what you said tyler's just pulling in different directions
14846520	14849080	you know it's probably more common than we think
14850840	14855480	but yeah generally speaking it's it's uncommon one of the and that's why i'm not mentioning the
14855480	14862840	name of this company one of the things that they did is the majority of boards that were rejected
14862840	14869560	were because of this capacitor that they use 20 percent tolerance capacitors and the circuit would
14869560	14876680	not tolerate that it had to be right in the zone so what i would do is i would go to stores and i'd
14876680	14883400	get a bin of capacitors i'd sit there and then i would test every one and basically sort from
14883400	14888760	20 percent tolerance to like a five percent tolerance and keep those capacitors so when i
14888760	14892040	ran into that problem i would just unsotter that cap with the new cap in
14892920	14896920	wrote it you know employees wrote a beneficial suggestion that a company saying you know why
14896920	14902200	don't we just buy five percent tolerance capacitors and all these things wouldn't have to be reworked
14902200	14905720	you know you don't know what you're talking about you know just do your own job or whatever
14905720	14909400	instead of looking at the big peter i think it was like in a production manager i think his brother
14909400	14913560	in law sold cheap capacitors for a living or something and he was buying them by the semi load
14913560	14919960	or it just made no sense it just made apps it is a biome is a well-known biomedical company
14919960	14925400	it's kind of like why are you doing this why not just use a tight tolerance component to begin with
14925400	14930200	and avoid somebody having to solder and unsotter and you know repair these boards it's costing them
14930200	14939240	a ton of money but what do i know film resistors are becoming increasingly popular there's three
14939240	14947000	different types carbon film metal film and tin oxide film and by film what we mean is a manufacturing
14947000	14954360	process that lays down a thin film of this material on a substrate and then that becomes the resistive
14954360	14964040	material so it's um some of the manufacturing processes actually are on par with manufacturing
14964040	14970360	solid state semiconductor devices surface mount resistors ideal for small circuit applications
14970360	14976360	available in both thick and thin film if you're working with surface mount resistors and you
14976360	14983640	have a package open and you sneeze they're gone so don't sneeze near a package of open because
14983640	14989160	these are tiny these are some of these are almost the size of a head of a pin tiny tiny components
14989400	14995960	that's what goes into making your cell phones and digital watches and tv's on your wrist that you
14995960	15006680	could watch and all of that kind of stuff we also have variable resistors variable resistors allow
15006680	15020200	resistance to vary both linear and logarithmically linear and logarithmically when i say linear do
15020200	15032920	you know what i'm talking about linear linear means a straight line so if i if i have something on a
15032920	15039480	linear scale if i adjust if i adjust it a little bit i get a little bit of response if i go to 100
15039480	15045880	percent i get 100 percent if i go to 50 percent i get half if i go to 25 percent i get a quarter
15047560	15055560	make sense that's linear it's a straight line logarithmically is on a curve it's on a logarithmic
15055560	15062840	curve so if i turn a little bit i'm not necessarily it's it's it the whole response is on a curve
15064200	15070040	so anybody know why we would want to have a control that is not linear that intentionally puts
15070040	15085400	things on a curve for us very good logarithmic is used for audio
15085480	15096360	applications because audio is not linear audio is not linear audio some of you may be aware is
15096360	15105320	measured in decibels and that's on a logarithmic scale so if you want to control something that is
15105320	15112840	non-linear you need to use a control that's non-linear and audio is that example so that's
15112840	15121800	why we have this logarithmic control one of the things if you're shopping for these variable
15121800	15129400	resistors you may also see it say audio on the box because it's for use with audio so volume control
15129400	15136120	on a radio on a stereo would be a logarithmic control because it's controlling something that is
15136120	15141720	non-linear and what we're trying to do is get somewhat of a linear response out of it right
15141800	15145640	when you turn the volume all the way up to a hundred percent you expect to get a hundred percent
15145640	15151160	when you turn to fifty percent you expect to get fifty percent but since audio is not a linear
15151160	15157640	we need to use a logarithmic control to get a linear type response make sense
15161560	15170840	these variable resistors when they're configured as a potentiometer potentiometer
15170840	15183720	or pot also known as pot a pot when we configure it to control voltage we call it a potentiometer
15185400	15190600	and i'll show you how we do that in a second but i want you first to hit the i believe button
15191560	15196520	what type of a device do we use to control voltage variable resistor do we use to control voltage
15196520	15207640	the answer is potentiometer when we use a variable resistor to control current we call it a rheostat
15210680	15212360	we call it a rheostat
15217080	15219080	and basically the way that this thing works
15226600	15237400	what i just illustrated here on the board is a resistor right and what i've got here
15239320	15249960	is i've got terminal a and i've got terminal b when i put my meter across terminal a and b
15249960	15258440	what am i going to what am i going to measure the resistance the resistance between a and
15259160	15268680	b the total resistance you all agree with me with that okay so if i go ahead now and connect this
15268680	15273400	up to a circuit
15280040	15287800	this is the negative terminal this is the positive terminal okay current is going to want to flow
15290520	15296040	in a counterclockwise direction here and it's going to flow through this resistor
15296040	15303400	and when it encounters this resistance it's going to limit how much current flows through this circuit
15304440	15308360	do you agree with me with that okay
15312280	15321800	so if i go ahead now this is a this is a fixed resistor if i go ahead and turn this into a
15321800	15326120	variable resistor a variable resistor has a third lead on it
15330440	15331800	and i'll label this this
15335880	15343480	terminal c so i have between a and b is my total resistance and then i have
15343800	15353400	c and what this is is a wiper arm this is a wiper arm and physically what it's going to do is move
15353960	15360040	up and down and come in contact with either more resistive material or less resistive material
15360040	15367560	it all depends on your perspective if i have this adjusted right now smack dab in the middle
15368200	15370840	how much resistance do i have between a and c
15375000	15385000	half how much resistance do i have between c and b half if i adjusted just just barely touch it just
15385000	15395480	a little bit now i'm 49 percent on one side 51 on the other tweak it more i'm 40 60 right
15395480	15401960	80 20 90 10 99 1
15404200	15408120	so i'm i'm moving this wiper arm coming in contact with a different amount of
15408120	15413640	resistive material i'll agree with that does that make sense okay now in this particular
15413640	15418840	configuration i could move this wiper arm up and down all day long am i going to have any effect
15418920	15421800	on current flowing through the circuit why
15424760	15431240	it's just flowing between point a and point c excuse me point a and point b point c is
15431240	15435640	effectively not even part of the path so i can move that wiper arm hey look mom
15437160	15439480	right nothing's going to change nothing's going to happen
15439640	15443800	now what if
15446440	15448440	what if i break this connection here
15450840	15456600	and come and move this and connect to point c directly
15461480	15464040	now what's going to happen when i move that wiper arm
15464440	15475640	what's that total resistance is going to change in the circuit absolutely if i adjust this thing
15475640	15482120	all the way to the end right here i may have what 100 percent
15484120	15487960	well if i move it all the way here and it's not in contact with any any resistance 100
15488040	15494120	percent current flow zero resistance or as close to zero as i could get
15495000	15500280	when i move the wiper arm all the way to the bottom here now i get 100 percent resistance
15501320	15506520	minimum current flow so literally when i'm adjusting this wiper arm here i'm adjusting
15506520	15514280	the amount of you said current in the circuit so i've got this configured right now is what
15514520	15525080	a real stat a real stat so when i'm using only two terminals of a three terminal device i've
15525080	15531880	got it configured as a real stat when i adjust my wiper arm i'm literally adjusting the total
15531880	15536600	amount of resistance and that total amount of resistance is going to affect the total amount
15536600	15546360	of current flowing in that circuit makes sense i'm going to disconnect this
15551080	15558440	reconnect this and let's assume that i'm going to have make another connection over here
15559240	15561480	and this is going to be a voltmeter
15565000	15571160	i'm going to connect a voltmeter between a and c and i'm going to connect a voltmeter
15571160	15576760	another voltmeter why because they're cheap right between b and c
15581000	15587640	when i have this adjusted smack dab in the middle what voltage am i going to get across this
15587720	15595480	voltmeter half i like you you keep it a basic half that's why i want you to keep it you know
15595480	15599080	i asked that question i see somebody going for their calculator you know it's i haven't given
15599080	15603240	you any numbers you can't calculate this one if i've got it set smack dab in the middle i'm
15603240	15609400	going to get half my voltage here which means i'm going to get my other half voltage down the bottom
15610120	15614840	okay so if this is 10 volts i get five volts here and five volts here
15616840	15628360	as soon as i begin to move that wiper arm slightly now i'm that 51 49 60 40 but i'm not
15628360	15637000	talking about resistance now i'm talking about what voltage so when i connect all three i could
15637000	15643720	use this as a voltage divider a hundred percent of the voltage it gets applied between a and b gets
15643720	15650040	divided proportionally between the wiper arm and the outer terminals
15652200	15658520	when i have it configured like this and i'm dividing voltage or controlling voltage we call that a
15660600	15664920	potentiometer this is how the volume control on your stereo is connected
15664920	15673720	this is basically what you're doing and that voltage that voltage that you're controlling
15673720	15680440	is going typically to a transistor and it's telling that transistor here's more voltage i want you
15680440	15688040	to amplify more and make the music louder or turn it down and make the music softer i'm going to give
15688040	15696040	you less voltage to the amplifier the transistor this is how it works so keep that in mind that's
15696040	15703400	how that's how we say we're either controlling current or or voltage could i use a potentiometer
15703400	15709960	as a real stat how would i do that
15712840	15721080	only connect two of the terminals so if you go to radio shack and say do you have any real stats
15721080	15725320	here that would be a fun question i should give you that as an out of class assignment everybody
15725320	15731000	go to radio shack and ask if you got any real stats and they'd probably scratch their head and bring
15731000	15737320	you know but we have some potentiometers you could use a potentiometer as a real stat you only
15737320	15747160	need to connect to the terminals if you went out and bought special ordered a real stat and it came
15747160	15755320	in the box and it said real stat could you use a real stat as a potentiometer if it only came
15755320	15762840	with two terminals now you need that third terminal to be able to divide the voltage make sense
15766120	15772760	okay resistor identification there's a couple different methods that we use to identify resistors
15775240	15778200	does anybody know the easiest method of identifying resistors
15779160	15791640	i love it now the easiest method is when they put the value right on the outside of it with numbers
15791640	15797400	and letters i always sucker people in with that one because everybody knows resistor color code
15797400	15801400	now the easiest method is is really when they use numbers and letters and they just say if it's like
15801400	15807480	a 1000 ohm resistor you know one k ohm it's right in there in black and white you read it you're
15807480	15818120	good to go another method that they use is alpha numeric code and for a lot of these resistors you're
15818120	15825640	going to have to like a secret agent use a decoder ring or decoder chart to figure out exactly what
15825640	15834920	the code means the third easiest method is the color code and of course you can't have a successful
15834920	15839560	career in electronics unless you understand the color code first thing we're going to take a look
15839560	15849400	at here is the alpha numeric code if you looked at a small resistor and it had an rn 60d 5 1 1 2 f
15849400	15859960	on it and you came up to me and you said hey joe what kind of a component is this i would probably
15860040	15867400	hold my head and say i have no freaking idea what you're going to have to do is you're going to have
15867400	15875320	to call up this code and decipher it if you work at a company this is one of the things
15875320	15880120	this is a very difficult judge tough job i got i got to train all of you generically but what
15880120	15884360	happens is when you go to your specific industries you're going to see some of the same components
15884360	15887720	day in and day out day in because you're going to get used to your company's product line
15887960	15893720	but here it's very difficult i'm teaching you generic electronics and there's a lot of different
15893720	15899800	schemes that are you know that they use this is one of them so the rn 60 identifies the
15899800	15910840	resistor style what what is it carbon comp wire wound film the d are its temperature characteristics
15911560	15916120	how does this behave and they'll normally include some tables or charts in there to say
15916120	15922680	you know for every five degrees rise in Fahrenheit this is how many ohms it's going to change so
15922680	15933000	it's going to be its temperature characteristics question yes yeah no don't memorize this the
15933000	15940600	point of this is that you're dead in water unless you get the code the five one one two that shows
15940680	15950040	the resistance value the five one one the two represents the number of zeros at the end so this
15950040	15958120	would be five one one zero zero putting that most common terms be fifty one point one k ohms
15959640	15963560	fifty one thousand one hundred ohms and the tolerance would be f
15964440	15971480	i don't know if that's good bad you're gonna have to look it up and see what it equates to five percent
15971480	15978040	two percent ten percent twenty percent i don't know but that's how you would decode that if you saw
15978040	15986920	that on the side of the resistor if you saw colors on the side of the resistor well there they are
15988760	15993000	you've got this in your book the way the color code works you have your first band second band
15993000	16000760	third band fourth band if you have a resistor that's well first thing you want to do is hold it
16000760	16007720	so that one of the bands is closest to the edge you normally want to put that closest on the left
16007720	16018440	and then read it like a book if i had a resistor and i held it in my hand and it was orange white
16018520	16025960	red gold orange on the color code equals the number three white is the number nine
16026680	16034360	red is the number two so that means i'm going to add two zeros after the three nine three nine zero
16034360	16040600	zero and gold means it's a five percent tolerance putting that most common terms means this would be
16040600	16047240	a three thousand nine hundred ohm resistor or three point nine k ohm resistor five percent
16054120	16065560	question i hate the word memorization question is we have to memorize it you gotta know it
16066120	16074040	but you've got to know it and to be honest with you a lot of job interviews they're gonna ask you
16074040	16078360	to do that the best thing though i'm not going to go out of my way i'm going to be honest with you
16078360	16083320	i'm not going to go out of my way on a quiz to hammer you on it you're not going to fail this
16083320	16087800	quiz because you don't know the resistor color code one of the big things with the resistor
16087800	16093160	color code is simply your experience doing your labs you're going to you're going to come to learn
16093160	16097800	this and the more you work with it you're going to understand it and you're going to remember it
16097800	16103560	but i don't want to make flash cards other programs do that you know we could give you
16103560	16108120	flash cards and identify this resistor i could keep you occupied and entertained for but then when
16108120	16112680	you're all said and done you know you're ready to go get a job and identify resistors for a living
16112680	16117240	not a lot of money in that so this is just something that you need to learn you need to know you need
16117240	16127480	to be able to decode it make sense i'll let you study the acronyms at your own leisure in a group
16127480	16134600	form see i'm ex-navy and we had some acronyms that basically if i repeated here i would be
16135160	16142280	handcuffed and dragged off and start with bad boys that was one of them that's a lot of you
16142280	16147560	you know so i'll let you discuss some of these amongst yourselves and they they do work it's
16147560	16153240	actually funny because having interviewed potential faculty member i'll of course always throw in
16153240	16160040	there identify this resistor and you see some man making charts and you know i've never once given
16160040	16165720	anybody a resistor you know what size of this resistor oh that's a 1.2 k 5 percent resistor
16165720	16169720	you know actually if somebody identified i'd probably you know you're a freak you're a freak of
16169720	16175000	nature yeah but it is something that again through experience you're going to get used to
16175000	16180520	and when you're prototyping a circuit you're going to say i'm looking for a 1.5 k ohm resistor you
16180520	16187720	know and you find it you plug it in your circuit and you move on so resistors and circuits
16189640	16194040	resistors are typically configured in a circuit in one of three different ways
16194040	16205320	either series parallel or compound and to be honest with you i hate to let the cat out of the bag
16205320	16214600	put the cart before the horse but you know what in the entire world of electronics and the entire
16214600	16221720	entire universe of electronics there's only three types of circuits and here you are week number three
16221800	16228840	learning about them it's that simple the most complex circuit you ever work on in your life
16228840	16237160	will be one of these three it's either going to be a series circuit a parallel circuit or it's called
16237160	16247640	a compound circuit or a combination yeah the first circuit we're going to talk about is a series
16247640	16257080	circuit and the simple thing to remember with a series circuit is resistance is additive
16259240	16265480	resistance is additive so the formula that we need to remember
16267320	16271880	and this is not accurate this should have an equal sign right here there's an error in this formula
16271880	16280120	should be rt total resistance is equal to resistor one plus resistor two plus resistor three plus
16280120	16287480	etc etc etc if you got 5000 resistors in a circuit you're gonna have 5000 resistances to add up
16288280	16289240	it's cumulative
16293640	16298360	so in this particular circumstance all is we have to do is pick a point in the circuit and start to
16298360	16304120	count we'll start right here at the negative terminal the first resistor I encounter has
16304120	16315560	30 ohms of resistance 30 plus 20 is equal to 50 plus 10 is equal to 60 that completes the circuit
16315560	16322280	in this circuit there are a total of 60 ohms of resistance does that make sense
16322840	16331960	sounds real basic doesn't it it's all fun and games until you have a bad battery connection
16331960	16336680	right here there's some corrosion that adds some resistance you got a bad solder joint right here
16336680	16344200	it adds a little bit more resistance so in in in a theory class like this how many ohms of
16344200	16348680	resistance are they supposed to be in a circuit 60 you get in there and measure it with your meter
16348680	16355080	and you get 67 ohms then you realize you have tolerance of these resistors did you take that
16355080	16360280	into account yeah but that only accounts for a small percentage based on that then all of a
16360280	16365240	sudden you realize why i've got corrosion in the circuit or i've got a bad solder joint in the circuit
16366520	16370360	so that's where there's a disconnect sometimes between the world of theory that we live in
16370360	16375320	here in a classroom a lecture environment and the world of reality in the lab that's why i want to
16375320	16379800	see all of you getting in the lab doing your lab assignments because you're basically going to
16379800	16384600	start scratching your head saying hey i thought joe i kind of believed what joe was saying in a
16384600	16390440	lecture but it isn't quite working like that it's going to work like i say but there's going to be
16390440	16396680	also a lot of variables that take place in the lab and in the real world as i said before that's
16396680	16401640	the toughest thing that i had when i got out into industry i went through a bunch of theory
16401640	16409080	schools when i started seeing things for real i was like wow this doesn't make sense is this good
16410040	16414200	can this possibly be good this doesn't look like a good reading and it's not what the book says
16414840	16417800	how could this be you know so that's the only way you're getting that is experience
16420360	16422440	any questions on series resistance
16425000	16428440	parallel this is my favorite slide of the entire
16428680	16434280	entire quarter because like watch i'm going to hit the key and the formula is going to fly in from
16434280	16445880	the side oh it's not cool you ever see how people like abuse powerpoint use too much animation this
16445880	16450840	is just right all right and i'm going to do it one more time it's the last time i'm going to do the
16450840	16456440	entire quarter the last slide that i have that's animated is this slide okay you ready oh
16460680	16461720	just kidding one more time
16465960	16471960	now in order for us to calculate out the total resistance in parallel this is kind of different
16471960	16479720	this is this is kind of odd right what we're going to do is this reciprocal formula
16481160	16490200	the reciprocal of resistor one plus the reciprocal of resistor two plus the reciprocal of resistor
16490200	16496840	three on and on and on what that sounds awful familiar to me what is the reciprocal of resistance
16499880	16505720	conductivity remember that one over r equals conductivity
16506120	16521880	so what we're saying here is by adding up all of the conductivities of all of these branches to
16521880	16528840	a parallel network then taking the reciprocal of that we end up with total resistance
16528840	16538760	so this is kind of like a bar trick how can you add resistors to a circuit
16539800	16548280	and yet make the resistance of the circuit less the answer is add them in parallel because that's
16548280	16556360	exactly what we're doing here it's exactly what we're doing think of this as the seattle
16557320	16569240	traffic system seattle traffic system okay this is a uh it's a friday afternoon before a three-day
16569240	16574440	weekend and these are all the people that are in seattle and they want to get the bell view
16577000	16582520	and they've got multiple paths to take how do you get from seattle to bell view
16582760	16593480	five twenty how else i-90 how else up and around the north end of the lake
16593480	16598280	or down around the south end of the lake so basically we have four let's say let's just
16598280	16605160	talk about three for the case of our example here if you're in seattle i'm a big commuter so i
16605160	16610120	like these analogies they really work well for me they work all too well for me if i'm in seattle
16610120	16615560	and i want to get the bell view and it's a friday three-day weekend what path is probably going
16615560	16625160	to be the best for me to take and why what's that no if i'm in seattle and i want to go to bell
16625160	16636520	view three-day weekend which is the best path for me to take and why why most lines it's going to
16636520	16647160	move the most traffic it's got the least amount of resistance after i-90 what would be my second
16647160	16658840	choice before the toll the toll will quickly make this number three choice at least for me i'm a
16658840	16669160	tightwad i'll take the ferry to vancouver and drive down around before i get a boat five twenty
16669880	16674600	five twenty has fewer lanes it's got more resistance it doesn't move the same amount of traffic
16675480	16679240	and then finally the other option is driving around the north end of the south end of the lake
16680760	16688680	not an easy way of doing it a lot more traffic less flow so comparing that now to this we could
16688680	16694120	say that i-90 is like the equivalent of 10 ohms of resistance because even though i-90 it's a super
16694120	16700840	interstate highway and it's got multiple lanes does it still have resistance oh yeah oh yeah if it
16700840	16708600	didn't have resistance there would never be any brake lights on it this would be like five twenty
16708600	16714200	would be like twice the amount of resistance meaning it moves half the amount of traffic
16714520	16722200	and then the north end of the lake three times the amount of resistance meaning even less traffic
16723480	16731640	does that make sense so every one of these is a viable current path every one of those routes
16731640	16744760	is a viable traffic path let's say for example that bill gates he really wanted a give back
16744760	16751000	and he loves the people of the puja sound region and he wants to build another bridge across lake
16751000	16756600	washington and he he he is so into it he's even going to let the bridge like come off of his property
16756840	16763560	okay and because he's building the bridge it's going to be called the bill gates memorial bridge
16765800	16771960	when he builds that bridge across lake washington what's it going to do to this flow here what's
16771960	16779240	it going to do it's going to it's going to make the overall circuit have less
16779960	16788520	resistance because he built another viable path is the path he builds going to be perfect
16788520	16794920	is it still going to have resistance yes but is it going to have an overall effect on increasing
16794920	16801560	the flow in the seattle metropolitan area of traffic absolutely so that's how we can add
16801560	16808920	resistances on this circuit yet lower the overall resistance of the total circuit
16809880	16815320	and that's why we have to use this formula we're actually adding up the conductivity
16815320	16819480	we end up with the total conductivity for the circuit take the reciprocal of that that gives us
16819480	16827560	the total total resistance for the circuit makes sense okay now i'm going to give you some thumb
16827560	16830840	rules thumb rules
16834040	16839320	the first thumb rule that i want to give you it's very very important when you're analyzing a
16839320	16849480	circuit like this the total resistance of the circuit will always be less than the value of least
16849560	16855240	resistance if not you made a mistake plain and simple
16858360	16864360	absolutely and if you come up with something other than that you're done screwed up plain and simple
16867240	16871560	so the total resistance of a parallel network will always be less than the value of least
16872360	16878920	resistance and your assumption is correct in this circuit it's got to be less than 10 ohms
16880280	16888120	the other thumb rule that i'm going to give you is if the values of resistance are all equal
16891400	16897320	you simply count up the number of resistors take the resistance and divide it by that number
16897960	16909400	as an example if this is if our three is 30 ohms our two is 30 ohms and our one is 30 ohms
16910280	16914520	30 divided by how many resistors equals
16918120	16923720	30 divided by 3 equals 10 the answer to this is going to be
16923720	16932520	10 ohms that's a thumb rule so if i've got four 100 ohm resistors in parallel 100 ohms divided
16932520	16941080	by four equals 25 if i have two 50 ohm resistors in parallel with each other
16941080	16954520	250 ohm resistors 25 50 divided by 2 25 so that's a thumb rule only if the values are equal
16955400	16960120	so a lot of times in the lab you may be looking for a certain value of resistance
16960120	16964840	i need 20 ohms of resistance or you could put two tens in series with each other
16964840	16967800	or you could put two forties in parallel with each other
16969800	16973080	there's a couple different ways of doing it it's one of the reasons we're teaching about this stuff
16973080	16977080	make sense
16983320	16991080	okay
16991880	16997640	the number of resistors only if they're equal it's only works if they're equal
16999640	17000440	it's a thumb rule
17003880	17007160	if you don't need to use the thumb rule it's just another tool in your toolbox
17008200	17013720	to make it easier for you if you doubt me well you could always use that formula
17015880	17020280	there is another formula i want to show you it's not in the book but i want you to know it
17020280	17030520	learn it
17035960	17039320	this is called the product over some formula
17040360	17047560	product over some this only works if we have two resistors in parallel with each other
17047560	17052200	period two resistors in parallel with each other period
17055480	17064360	so this literally is the product over some the product is r1 multiplied by r2 r1 times r2
17065400	17071560	divided by r1 plus r2 the product over the sum
17071560	17087560	this works if you only have two resistors in parallel with each other
17101560	17108840	if you've got two or more resistors you have to use this formula here
17109400	17112520	i just drew it a little bit differently but that's basically the same formula
17116200	17123400	the reciprocal of r1 which is the conductance of r1 plus the conductance of r2 plus the sum of
17123400	17129880	the conductances total conductance the reciprocal one over the total conductance equals the total
17129880	17137160	resistance so this formula works for two or more resistors in parallel this one here works for
17137720	17141560	two resistors in parallel period
17145240	17150440	the reason i want you to start using this is because in the future we're going to take
17150440	17155080	this formula and we're going to adapt this formula for some other use
17155480	17159960	so it's better that you just learn it now and it's another tool in your toolbox
17161000	17166200	product over sum easy enough to remember product over sum
17171320	17177400	when we execute the math on this formula here the reciprocal of r1 plus r2 plus r3
17178040	17183160	we had those conductances up take the reciprocal of it we end up with 5.405 ohms is that answer
17183160	17189880	sound right why does it sound right it's less than 10 works for me
17191320	17201320	and that's like at r3 you consider rn as well no our rn would be like r4 5 r22 r447
17201960	17208520	r to the nth degree means to the nth degree that this formula works to infinity if we keep adding
17208600	17214840	resistors in parallel we just keep adding the reciprocal of that resistance on it that's what
17214840	17221800	we mean by that so they drew it like this plus one r to the nth i did it etc etc etc
17225320	17232120	this is a complex circuit now again i know you want to do the math you want to get it right
17232120	17236680	that's cool okay i want to keep things real i want to keep things basic
17237480	17245720	the first thing that i notice in this circuit is that these two resistors are in parallel with each
17245720	17252440	other so this is an actual ideal situation for us to use this product over some formula
17253880	17257800	50 times 25 divided by 50 plus 25
17257800	17264040	why don't we just do it right now you got your calculators let's do it
17266440	17267160	just do it
17269800	17272760	but i want to do it in stages here for those folks at home
17278280	17280280	this is how i'm going to start off with the formula
17282200	17287320	now what i'm going to do is substitute in my numbers i what is that 50 and 25
17288200	17302840	so it's going to be 50 times 25 divided by 50 plus 25 okay i know that this is going to 50 plus 25
17302840	17312120	i could do that in my head right that's 75 okay but the 50 plus 25 50 excuse me times 25 equals
17313080	17315560	1250
17318040	17323320	so 1250 divided by 75 equals
17331480	17338440	16.67 ohms so does everybody see how i did that isn't that a cool formula
17338680	17344600	oh it's cool i like that formula i don't know why because the answer is always like
17345240	17351080	come out i don't know i like that formula you could do the same thing down here and you're
17351080	17357480	going to get the same results so i know that i've got and the way i want you to look at these
17357480	17364280	parallel circuits the way that i want you to think of these parallel circuits is how much
17364280	17375160	resistance is there between between this point here and that's actually called a node a node
17375160	17382360	are where two or more wires are joined together how much resistance is there between node a and node b
17385480	17387720	so to lay this out mathematically
17394440	17406120	the way that i would actually calculate out this whole problem
17407640	17416760	is rt for this circuit total resistance is going to be equal to the resistance of resistor one
17417240	17433000	plus the resistance between node a and b plus the resistance of resistor
17436920	17437240	three
17440040	17441960	four four thank you
17442040	17450600	why this is a dry erase board so r1 plus rab plus r4
17452920	17457560	now before i could solve for this i'm going to have to calculate out what
17459160	17465880	rab is equal to rab is going to be equal to
17466200	17476680	r2 times r3 divided by r2 plus r3 you agree with that
17480280	17486360	so then it's just a matter of me we already did this this is 16.67 ohms
17486680	17497880	plus 30 ohms plus 20 ohms gives me my total amount of resistance in the circuit
17501880	17506200	so i highly recommend until you really got a handle on this you lay it all out like this
17507000	17511080	although so many formulas whatever i don't look at them as formulas these are tools
17512040	17519560	these are tools yeah they're formulas but they're tools to solve the problem to unlock the key to the problem
17521560	17522520	use the right tool
17525000	17531640	you get the right results use the wrong tool on your car you strip the knot
17533960	17539320	use the right tool you get about the results that you desire make sense
17542040	17549880	when you first see a problem like this though one of the things that i'm going to stress
17549880	17555320	in this program is that you keep it real what's the what was this total resistance
17555320	17563400	going to be between these between this a and b it's going to be less than 25 so i've got 30 ohms
17563400	17569720	here and 20 ohms there 30 plus 20 is 15 and less than 25 what do i know my answer is going to be
17569720	17578440	less than what less than 75 if you could do that in your mind looking at this stuff i want
17578440	17584760	you on my team i'll be honest with you i want you on my team those are the people that i want
17585640	17589640	if i give you this problem and immediately you're with the calculator and you know you're
17590520	17594280	i don't mind if you use the calculator but if you're turning it upside down your you know
17594280	17601240	sideways and you know no what i want out of all of you is to look at this i got 30 ohms here i got
17601240	17610760	20 that's 50 50 and 25 less than 25 my answer is going to be less than 75 ohms do not try to take
17610760	17619480	my quizzes doing that if you do you'll probably be very successful with a lot of my quizzes i could
17619480	17623560	take most of my quizzes not even use a calculator and get them all right well it has something to
17623560	17631320	do with the fact that i wrote my quizzes but what i want you to do is that thumb rule as a litmus
17631320	17637080	test at the end or even before you calculate it i should get less than 75 ohms as an answer
17638600	17644280	my answer should be less than 75 ohms i came up with 66.7 ohms does that sound about right
17645800	17651560	if you come up with an answer of what's the total resistance in a circuit 1250
17652360	17657000	well that's not less than 75 houston we got a problem there's probably a math error
17658840	17663480	if i were pope of electronics i would require you to all get a hundred percent on all of these
17663480	17667240	quizzes because if you use the right tool you get the right results make sense
17669320	17675480	in summary we talked about resistance what has resistance everything everything
17676920	17681240	we talked about specific devices that are designed to possess the property of resistance
17681240	17687480	it's known as a resistor can you imagine some dude wakes up every day and like you know instead
17687480	17692840	of it's off to make the donuts it's off to design the resistors there are engineers in the world that
17692840	17703160	design resistors for a living huh talk about a career path resistivity that property that we
17703160	17712600	compare the resistivity of everything to that of silver silver the best conductor found in nature
17712600	17721160	conductivity conductivity the reciprocal of resistance measured in mose or typically millimose
17722920	17730120	resistor identification for fixed value variable values we talked about fixed resistors variable
17730120	17733800	resistors that could be configured as potentiometers if they're used to control
17736040	17743160	voltage real stats if they're used to control current if i'm using three leads i'm using it to
17743160	17750280	control voltage if i'm using two leads i'm using it to control current and then finally we talked
17750280	17756920	about certain configurations first was a series configuration in a series configuration how do
17756920	17765000	i determine total resistance simply add it up it's additive in a parallel circuit
17766760	17772520	how do i determine total resistance add up the reciprocal sounds like i'm adding up the conductivity
17772520	17784040	of the paths in a compound circuit what do i got to do both thumb rules for parallel circuits total
17784120	17792840	resistance will always equal less than the value of least and if i have like resistor same size
17792840	17797720	then i could simply take that number take the value divide it by the number of resistors that
17797720	17803160	i have and that will give me the total resistance any questions out of this chapter
17806680	17812440	in parallel you got to divide it out so if i've got four one hundred ohm resistors it's a hundred
17812440	17817480	ohms a hundred ohms a hundred ohms hundred ohms 100 divided by how many resistors for 100 divided
17817480	17826280	by 4 equals 25 i should have approximately 25 ohms across that circuit all right let's go ahead
17826280	17834520	and take a about a 10 little 12 minute break and we'll start up at about 10 after
17842920	17849560	chapter five ohms law
17853240	17857880	again we should like hit a gong ring a bell ring some chimes
17860360	17861320	ohms law
17864120	17869880	ohms law has more of an effect on being able to predict the behavior of electricity than
17870120	17877480	really anything else so anybody know how predictable the behavior of electricity is
17878120	17882920	percentage wise we're talking about tolerance is last chapter anybody know how accurate we
17882920	17891640	could predict the behavior 100 it's bold statement it's absolutely correct 100 you use ohms law you
17891640	17899160	could predict with 100 accuracy what's going to take place inside a circuit it's pretty powerful
17900440	17905160	it's pretty powerful tool especially when you're going to be paid to go out into industry and fix
17905160	17909000	broken electronic equipment get this tool working for you you got something
17911720	17916200	after completing this chapter you're going to be able to identify the three basic parts of a circuit
17917400	17922040	identify three types of circuit configurations describe how current flow can be varied in a
17922040	17928920	circuit state ohms law with reference to current voltage and resistance solve problems using ohms
17928920	17934280	law for current resistance voltage in series parallel in series parallel circuits describe how
17934280	17940920	the total flow differs between series and parallel circuits describe how the total voltage drops
17940920	17945640	differs between series and parallel circuits describe how the total resistance differs between
17945640	17953160	series and parallel circuits state and apply kerfs current and voltage laws and verify answers using
17953160	17961080	Ohm's law with Kerchoff's law.
17961080	17965380	First of all, electric circuits.
17965380	17973140	The path that current follows is called an electric circuit.
17973140	17978280	All circuits consist of, and this is important, and it sounds really basic and it sounds very
17978280	17981640	simplistic, but I'll tell you what.
17981640	17988160	Doing this helped me on my worst day of my career as an electronics professional because
17988160	17995560	it's so easy to get turned around and lose track of what the problem is, and if you could
17995560	18000120	get back to basics, you're always going to do well.
18000120	18011400	The basics are all electric circuits must consist of a voltage source, a load, and a
18011400	18015640	conductor.
18015640	18018520	The voltage source is the source of your electric energy.
18018520	18024360	It could be any of those six different types that we talked about last week.
18024360	18030800	The load is what converts one form of energy into another form of energy.
18030800	18038440	An example of an electric load would be a light bulb, a motor, a heater.
18038440	18046360	It converts electric energy into light, heat, motion.
18046360	18055400	A conductor, a conductor, electrical conductor transfers the energy, the electric energy,
18055400	18061400	the current from the source to the load.
18061400	18068120	You have to have those three parts of a circuit, or it's not a circuit.
18068120	18075320	I'm going to add two other optional parts that are not in the book.
18075320	18086200	The other optional device, most circuits have them, not all do, is a controlling device.
18086200	18091920	A simple example of a controlling device is a switch.
18091920	18098520	A simple example of a complex controlling device is a microprocessor with 1.9 billion
18098520	18102640	transistors on it.
18102640	18107800	You see, that's where we're going in this course, by the way, from one switch to 1.9
18107800	18116240	billion switches in a microprocessor.
18116240	18120320	Controlling device is used to control the flow of current in the circuit.
18120320	18128200	The fifth optional device that you could have inside a circuit is a protective device.
18128200	18140080	An easy example of this is a fuse, a circuit breaker, a fusible link, a thermal circuit
18140080	18142960	breaker.
18142960	18147440	These are all examples of protective devices.
18147440	18154800	On my worst day of my career as an electronics professional, it involved a nuclear submarine,
18154800	18160600	someplace we weren't supposed to be, and it involved, unfortunately, my equipment that
18160600	18161600	I was responsible for.
18161600	18167920	There were three of us that were responsible for that system, big system, $16 million system,
18167920	18173760	and that was like a $1982 expensive.
18174200	18180840	The system was sold to the Navy, and it was designed with what was called graceful degradation.
18180840	18188920	That means bits and pieces could fail, and the whole system would keep up and running.
18188920	18192960	That's what the vendor told the Navy when the Navy bought the system.
18192960	18196280	Here we are someplace we're not supposed to be, doing stuff we weren't supposed to
18196280	18201840	be doing, and it was showtime for my equipment to do its thing.
18202840	18204160	It didn't work right.
18204160	18205160	It didn't work at all.
18205160	18209520	As a matter of fact, it was totally down, 100%.
18209520	18213040	And the captain, like, Mr. Greenock, how can this be?
18213040	18217080	The system was designed with graceful degradation, it should never be 100% down.
18217080	18223000	Well, Skipper, it's like this, it's totally busted.
18223000	18226520	I don't care what you gotta do, I want you to fix it.
18226520	18235800	Now we literally worked on that system non-stop, three days in a row, stayed up, popping no-dos,
18235800	18238760	drinking coffee, just working on it, working on it, working on it.
18238760	18241960	Two other guys might, they finally gave up, they're like, we just cannot fix this, it's
18241960	18242960	not fixable.
18242960	18246440	It just cannot, we can't bring it back from the dead.
18246440	18250200	Me, I went back to these basics.
18250200	18254400	It's an electronic system, it's made up of nothing but circuits.
18254400	18259640	Circuits have a voltage source, they have a load, you have inter-connected with conductors,
18259640	18264080	have controlling devices, and have protective devices.
18264080	18266680	It's something not doing what it's supposed to be doing.
18266680	18268920	It's gotta be, that's what's causing the problem.
18268920	18271120	It's narrowing it down.
18271120	18276800	And I stuck with the problem, I ended up fixing the problem, save the day, whoop-de-doo, I
18276800	18279800	basically did my job and fixed the equipment.
18279800	18287200	But I had to take a couple steps back and say, here's a $16 million system, fills half
18287200	18292000	a room with equipment racks, none of it works.
18292000	18295240	Can I verify the voltage sources for everything?
18295240	18300000	Can I narrow it down and say, this stuff's not working, but this stuff is working?
18300000	18305760	Can I look at the loads, what's not working, what's not converting electric energy into
18305760	18309000	the form of energy that we need to be getting out of it?
18309000	18312760	So if you know all of these systems, then you're gonna be an effective troubleshooter,
18312760	18315160	but always go back to basics.
18315160	18320000	Okay, God forbid you get out of class tonight, go out to your car, out in the North Parking
18320000	18322360	lot, turn the key, and you've got an electrical problem.
18322360	18325240	If you do have an electrical problem, approach it like this.
18325240	18327720	Do I have a good source?
18327720	18329720	Is my load functional?
18329720	18330880	Is it the interconnects?
18330880	18334680	Can I prove that the interconnects are viable?
18334680	18337280	Is it a controlling device?
18337280	18340720	And to be honest with you, in this day and age, most of the problems we encounter are
18340720	18343120	controlling devices.
18343120	18349920	Okay, it's not a simple switch, toggle switch, that was easy to troubleshoot.
18349920	18356080	I do a lot of traveling, I forgot what brand car it was.
18356080	18359520	I got the rental car, I flew in, it was on the East Coast, and I'm there late at night
18359520	18364040	and I got in and I'm like, I couldn't figure out where to put the key.
18365040	18368440	Where do I put the key to start the car?
18368440	18372600	There was no place to put the key, and I'm looking at it, you know, I got a little flashlight
18372600	18375080	and I'm looking, there's no place to put the key.
18375080	18376640	I didn't need a place to put the key.
18376640	18379960	The fact that the key was on my person was good enough for the car.
18379960	18383600	Just hit the start button, ooh, it started.
18383600	18391160	Alright, so the controlling device there was the FOB, RFID talking to the computer saying
18391160	18395080	this is a valid operator to be inside the car to operate it.
18395080	18401280	Kind of a complex controlling device, but a controlling device nonetheless.
18401280	18408320	And of course protective devices, and sometimes wacky stuff is done with protective devices.
18408320	18413520	I was working on my Tivo about a month ago, I had problems with my Tivo, and I've got
18413520	18418600	an older Tivo, it's a direct Tivo, so it's got two dual receivers, I could record two
18418600	18420920	shows and watch another show.
18420920	18428240	It's non-HD, because I don't have HD, I don't want to pay for HD, I'm a cheapskate, okay?
18428240	18433560	Feed my nice plasma screen, high resolution plasma screen with my basic signal, it's great.
18433560	18436200	It's great, it's all good.
18436200	18438440	My Tivo crapped out, okay?
18438440	18442520	So all the Tivo's got a hard drive in there.
18442520	18447880	So I got a new hard drive, I configured that and everything, and I was just through putting
18447880	18452080	it together, and something happened, and I heard a pop, and all of a sudden Tivo wouldn't
18452080	18453080	fire up anymore.
18453080	18459320	And I'm like, oh man, if this thing is dead, I don't want to go out and buy a new direct
18459320	18466880	TV DVR, and I got, it's a higher, I'm grandfathered into paying the older Tivo value, and plus
18466880	18472600	quite frankly, I don't know if any Tivo users here, Tivo's the bomb.
18472600	18476240	It truly is, because it could do word searches and all kinds of additional stuff that a normal
18476240	18479000	DVR will not necessarily do for you.
18479000	18482000	So I want that to bring this thing back from the dead, and I'm like, what the heck, I was
18482000	18486560	pretty ticked off, because I already wasted a whole weekend screwing with this thing.
18486560	18492160	So I'm looking through the circuit for something obvious, and I find this device, and basically
18492160	18497120	it's got shrink wrap, black shrink wrap over it, two leads coming out of it, and I measure
18497120	18498920	across it, and I'm getting it open.
18498920	18501920	I mean, I just got in there with the thing unplugged, and I'm poking around, and what
18501920	18504440	the heck is this?
18504440	18508400	So anyway, I unsodder it, and I inspect it, and with an exacto knife, I cut the heat
18508400	18509400	shrink out.
18509400	18510400	You know what it is?
18510400	18511400	It's a fuse.
18511400	18515080	It's a fuse, and the manufacturer tried to disguise and get by putting a piece of heat
18515080	18519840	shrink around it, and sticking it on the circuit board, and that's what was burned out.
18519840	18524960	I found a suitable replacement that I had at home, and my tin can, soldered it back in
18524960	18526880	place, fired it up, I was good to go.
18526880	18530160	Tivo's been working nonstop ever since.
18530160	18531320	Okay?
18531320	18532320	And that's a hidden.
18532320	18536160	A lot of companies do that type of stuff, so that if you don't know, if you're not the
18536160	18540640	authorized service center, you don't know to get in there and even check that.
18540640	18546760	I've seen some companies that will encapsulate a fuse, inside silicon or epoxy, you don't
18546760	18548720	even know what's in there.
18548720	18551480	So keep your eye open for all these basic parts of the circuit.
18551480	18555920	I know this sounds basic, and I'm beating it to death, but I tell you, you will deceive
18555920	18561240	me in the future when you get in the lab, and it's going to be like, I can't fix this.
18561920	18563680	The problem's too complex.
18563680	18566120	It's never a complex problem.
18566120	18569000	It's usually a real simple problem.
18569000	18570000	Very rarely.
18570000	18571000	All of you are here.
18571000	18574080	You want to get into advanced electronics and work on sophisticated equipment.
18574080	18577960	The problems with sophisticated equipment are always very, very simple.
18577960	18578960	Okay?
18578960	18581920	You've got to follow this protocol, though.
18581920	18585000	So use this as a checklist.
18585000	18586080	This is a series circuit.
18586080	18591040	We talked about series circuits already.
18591040	18600200	The most important thing for you to remember about a series circuit is that current is
18600200	18604160	constant in a series circuit.
18604160	18611840	The most important thing to remember is that current is constant in a series circuit, meaning
18611840	18615080	I've got a resistor here, a resistor here, a resistor here.
18615080	18621000	These three resistors cumulatively add up to the total amount of resistance in the circuit.
18621120	18626240	This electrical pressure here encounters this total resistance and allows this amount of
18626240	18629620	current to flow.
18629620	18634240	This current has to travel the entire path of the circuit.
18634240	18639560	That is the most important thing about a series circuit, period.
18639560	18643960	The second thing I want you to remember about a series circuit is a series circuit is also
18643960	18657960	known as, like FBI lingo, a.k.a., a series circuit is also known as a voltage divider.
18657960	18659680	A voltage divider.
18659680	18662040	What voltage gets divided up?
18662040	18663880	The total voltage.
18663880	18664880	Remember this?
18664880	18666680	We call this voltage rise.
18666680	18669040	How many voltage drops do I have in this circuit?
18669040	18670840	This circuit.
18670840	18672200	Three.
18672200	18678240	So voltage rise is going to get divided into three proportional values.
18678240	18682560	The biggest resistance gets the biggest voltage drop, the smallest resistance gets the smallest
18682560	18689000	voltage drop, and the resistance that's just right gets a voltage drop that's just right.
18689000	18690000	Make sense?
18690000	18693680	That's the series circuit.
18693680	18699160	The parallel circuit, the most important thing I want you to remember about the parallel
18699160	18707720	circuit is that voltage is constant across a parallel network.
18707720	18709720	This is a parallel network.
18709720	18714240	Here there are three resistors in parallel with each other.
18714240	18724760	The voltage rise will be distributed equally, equally, across all three branches.
18724760	18729080	So whatever this is, if this is 120 volts, this is going to have 120 volts across it.
18729080	18732200	This is going to have 120 volts across, and this is going to have 120 volts across.
18732200	18736080	Kind of like how your house is wired.
18736080	18737960	Your house is wired in parallel.
18737960	18742680	Each of the outlets has the same voltage across them, or they should.
18742680	18746360	If not, you've got a problem.
18746360	18752040	That's the most important thing about a parallel network.
18752040	18756920	A series circuit was also known as a voltage divider.
18756920	18763040	A parallel circuit is going to be known as a current divider.
18763040	18765520	Because what happens to current in the circuit?
18765520	18770640	This total current here gets divided here at this node and here.
18770640	18773600	Then current gets divided here and here.
18773600	18778520	The current flowing through R3 and the current flowing through R2 join up at this node and
18778520	18780880	flow onto this node.
18780880	18787680	Currents current plus this current equals total current.
18787680	18790360	Series circuit, current's constant.
18790360	18793040	Series circuit also known as a voltage divider.
18793040	18800040	Parallel circuit, voltage is constant, also known as a current divider.
18800040	18805240	Complex circuit, well, that's got both going on.
18805240	18811160	I've got current division going on here in my parallel network and I've got voltage
18811160	18821880	division going on here between this resistor and this resistance.
18821880	18823160	This resistance.
18823160	18830480	The best thing you could do in this circuit is label this A, node A, or in B, or X and
18830480	18832840	Z, or whatever you want to label it.
18832920	18838080	I like using letters because numbers typically equate to components.
18838080	18843840	Letters I could use to, and there's no rule on this, but it works for me.
18843840	18847760	So I'm going to label this node A and this node B.
18847760	18855920	The resistance between node A and B is equal to the product over some of R2 and 3.
18855920	18856920	Remember that?
18856920	18858880	I studied that last chapter.
18858880	18867480	The total resistance of the circuit is going to be equal to R1 plus RAB.
18867480	18875560	This voltage drop, RAB plus the voltage drop across R1 equals RT.
18875560	18879200	Voltage rise, and really, how many voltage drops do I have in the circuit?
18879200	18881760	Really, how many voltage drops do I have in the circuit?
18881760	18882760	Two.
18882760	18886320	And what are they?
18886320	18891640	R1 and RAB, or R2 and R3.
18891640	18894880	If I say R2, it's really the same thing.
18894880	18897000	R2 is the same as R3.
18897000	18899440	You could argue and say, well, you really got three voltage drops here.
18899440	18900440	You got a voltage drop here.
18900440	18903080	You got a voltage drop here, and you got a voltage drop here.
18903080	18907200	Well, this voltage drop and this voltage drop are the same voltage drop.
18907200	18911360	It's the same difference in potential, so I really, I don't want to call it different.
18911360	18912360	It's the same.
18912800	18916600	Make sense?
18916600	18921520	Some different circuit conditions that I want to talk about, and this is very important.
18921520	18924400	I want you to use the proper terminology with me.
18924400	18928880	It's part of why you're here at Lake Washington Technical College studying this stuff is to
18928880	18934880	learn to speak another language, the language of electronics.
18934880	18941640	The circuit condition that I want to talk about is called a closed circuit.
18941640	18947920	Is a closed circuit a good thing, or is it a bad thing?
18947920	18948920	Depends on what you want.
18948920	18949920	Thank you.
18949920	18952520	It depends on what you want.
18952520	18959760	Right now, the circuit in this room for the interior lights is closed, meaning the circuit's
18959760	18965600	energized, and we have an appropriate amount of illumination in here.
18965600	18968680	That's a good thing.
18968680	18975280	If I go and operate the switch and try to open the switch and the lights won't go out,
18975280	18977920	that could be a problem.
18977920	18980160	That could be a problem.
18980160	18985000	If you're operating an electric tool and you try to shut it off and you can't shut
18985000	18990560	it off, that's a problem.
18990560	18994320	Be a closed circuit is causing you a problem.
18994320	18997320	I had this problem with a pressure washer.
18997320	19003160	One of these $100 pressure washers, Costco special, great pressure washer for what I
19003160	19004160	do.
19004160	19012120	Got a patio, I got a deck, I don't need 40 horsepower, fire breathing, peel the paint
19012120	19016000	off the Queen Mary pressure washer.
19016000	19018800	But it's my pressure washer, and I like it.
19018800	19024720	I got a lot of tools, got a lot of neighbors, I know I got a lot of tools.
19024720	19029400	My neighbor Tom, he's since moved, it's another story, I'll tell you about that some other
19029400	19030400	time.
19030400	19034400	I finally drove him out of the neighborhood.
19034400	19037800	Tom's an engineer, an electrical engineer with Boeing.
19037800	19041040	Hey Joe, I'm going to stain my deck.
19041040	19042640	Can I borrow your pressure washer?
19042640	19046720	I'm a nice guy, but I hate loaning out tools because nobody takes care of stuff like I want
19046720	19047720	to take and care of.
19047720	19052480	I mean, if I borrow somebody's tool, I take care of it 10 times better than my own, and
19052480	19054840	if I break it, I buy it, I replace it.
19054840	19065040	So Tom, that's fine, I'll loan you my pressure washer, but only plug it in a dedicated outlet
19065040	19068480	and do not use any extension cords.
19068480	19072720	Because it's right on the label, it's not that I'm that smart a guy, I just read the
19072720	19075040	label, the tag that's on it.
19075040	19081000	Because this motor requires a lot of current to be able to turn and be effective.
19081000	19084320	If you plug it in an extension cord, it doesn't get the right amount of current.
19084320	19088600	Remember that whole thing, the cord gets hot, the hotter it gets, the more resistance, the
19088600	19091680	more resistance, the less current, the less current, the hotter it gets, it's a vicious
19091680	19092680	cycle.
19092680	19095840	So I loaned him my pressure washer.
19095840	19096840	How did it work out?
19096840	19097840	Oh, pretty good.
19097840	19099840	Thanks Joe.
19099840	19103760	Fast forward a couple of weeks later, I go out to wash my sidewalk.
19103760	19109600	I plug the thing in, turn it on, and it's on, continuously on.
19109600	19111000	It won't shut off.
19111000	19115840	Normally what happens, it's a real simple circuit.
19115840	19120760	This switch right here on a pressure washer, one of those cheap Costco specials, what it
19120760	19123640	does is there's a water pressure sensor.
19123640	19128560	When the water pressure builds up, what it physically does is open the switch.
19128560	19132840	So what you do in the handle, when you release the switch or release the pressure, as soon
19132840	19137400	as you release the pressure, you close the switch, you turn your motor on, the motor
19137400	19140480	turns the pump on, and you're pressure washing.
19140480	19146760	You release the trigger, you build the pressure up, you open the switch.
19146760	19151880	Mine will never shut off unless I unplug it.
19151880	19158600	If I unplugged it and it still kept operating, well, that'd be something.
19158600	19159600	Keeps operating.
19159600	19164280	I'd ripped the thing apart, and what had happened was, I guarantee you, I didn't see
19164280	19168920	him do it, but what, because I had no problem with that, and I had it for years.
19168920	19173160	He plugged it in a non-dedicated circuit, it built up a lot of heat, and physically,
19173160	19176600	the switch, the contacts got welded.
19176600	19180240	I took the switch apart, the contacts were welded to each other.
19180240	19184600	That's how hot it got.
19184600	19189040	So I went to my file cabinet, opened the drawer, pulled out the manual, got the parts list,
19189040	19190200	contacted the company.
19190200	19195480	The new switch would be $65 plus shipping.
19195480	19203800	A new pressure washer at Costco, $109, I can have it right now.
19203800	19206640	The old one's in a landfill somewhere.
19206640	19208880	After I cannibalized some parts off of it.
19208880	19212000	You thought your neighbor called?
19212000	19214800	No, I ran him out of the neighborhood.
19214800	19218480	I finally ran him out of the neighborhood.
19218480	19223400	There was a chainsaw involved.
19223400	19224400	Trees falling.
19224400	19225400	Long story.
19225400	19226400	Long story.
19226400	19236200	Now actually, what pushed Tom over the edge was, he had problems in his basement, flooding,
19236200	19239360	split level house, and water would get in.
19239360	19244440	So what he dug, did is he dug a trench around the entire foundation of his house, and then
19244440	19248000	what he's going to do is he's going to put a treatment on the outside concrete, and then
19248000	19250640	he was also going to backfill it, put in drainage and everything.
19250640	19252520	So he had this ditch dug.
19252520	19254080	It was a lot of backbreaking work.
19254080	19255080	He did it all by hand.
19255080	19259040	Got to respect that.
19259040	19260720	But it took him forever to do it.
19260720	19262080	It took him years to do it.
19262080	19263880	So I used to accuse him of having a moat.
19263880	19269160	It's like, Tom, what's the deal with the moat?
19269160	19274200	So anyway, again, I had a buddy of mine over, and it was the wee hours of the morning, and
19274200	19279320	we were enjoying some libations and some cigars.
19279320	19284080	And actually, my buddy who's got my sense of humor, he's like, hey, Joe, is that Tom's
19284080	19285080	moat?
19285080	19286080	What's up with that?
19286080	19287080	Doesn't he want that thing full?
19287080	19289440	I'm like, that's a good point.
19289440	19292440	Why have a moat if it's not?
19292440	19296920	So anyway, we turned on his garden hose and started filling the moat, and then we're just
19296920	19300600	laughing and like busting a gut, and then Tom came out and he's pretty freaking ticked
19300600	19301600	off.
19301600	19303920	Then we're filling his moat with water.
19303920	19307800	I mean, he woke up to the sound of running water, like, why is water running in my house?
19307800	19312680	And hey, man, we thought we were doing you a favor by filling your moat, you know?
19312680	19316640	He was out of there within six months.
19316640	19320040	Open circuit, is this good or bad?
19320040	19321040	Depends.
19321040	19322040	Depends.
19322040	19325560	Now, my pressure washer, this would have been highly desirable.
19325560	19332920	When pressure builds up, it opens the switch, interrupts the flow of current to the motor.
19332920	19340820	Another circuit condition is called a short circuit.
19340820	19343520	Have you all heard of a short circuit before?
19343520	19350440	God blessed my wife, but she's been my wife now for a long time, and I've been in this
19350440	19351920	industry since puberty.
19351920	19356280	So hanging out with a guy that teaches electronics and does electrical stuff, you'd think something
19356280	19357280	would rub off.
19357280	19363320	Constantly, I get a call, and it's kind of like, the blunder's not working, I think
19363320	19368640	it's got a short circuit, and I'm like, holy crap, you tell short circuit to me, I'm like
19368640	19371480	ready to call the fire, but I mean, short circuit is like what you see in a Star Trek
19371480	19375920	when they get hit by a phaser, you know, and the, you know, I mean, that's a short circuit.
19375920	19378160	That literally is what a short circuit is.
19378160	19382960	A short circuit will cause an electrical fire.
19382960	19386680	And then on further probing, what exactly is the blunder doing?
19386720	19389280	Well, I plug it in, I hit the button, but nothing happens.
19389280	19394360	Oh, you mean it's an open circuit, not a short circuit, big difference.
19394360	19398720	The majority of household appliances that I've encountered that have failed have failed
19398720	19403360	because of an open circuit condition.
19403360	19405360	That's where nothing works.
19405360	19411960	Now you've got to be careful, because sometimes a short circuit will cause a protective device
19411960	19419040	to open and render the piece of equipment dead.
19419040	19424680	So you've got to get in, and like that direct TV, direct TVO, that was dead.
19424680	19426640	That was open intentionally.
19426640	19431080	I found the open, it was that fuse with heat shrink around it, trying to disguise it to
19431080	19435480	make it look like a fuse with heat shrink around it.
19435480	19437120	Make sense?
19437120	19441320	So keep that in mind, open circuit, short circuit is always bad.
19441760	19447040	There's never an intentional reason to short anything.
19447040	19451800	Current flow in a circuit can be varied by changing the voltage applied to the circuit.
19451800	19454640	As voltage increases, current increases.
19454640	19458840	As voltage decreases, current decreases.
19458840	19462960	And also changing the resistance in the circuit.
19462960	19468960	As resistance increases, currents going to decrease.
19468960	19473240	So these first values we call these directly proportional, right?
19473240	19477920	If voltage increases, current increases, directly proportional.
19477920	19481400	Voltage decreases, current decreases, directly proportional.
19481400	19488400	Resistance increases, current decreases, inversely proportional.
19488400	19495400	Now, in the beginning when Ohm gave his like sermon, I don't know if it was a sermon, Ohm's
19499720	19506720	sermon on the mount, somehow I think I'm getting my history messed up.
19510760	19514920	This is what Ohm said.
19514920	19518680	I think the speech was given down at the king dome.
19518680	19522760	And he was at the king dome, and he got up, hello, hello, hello.
19522760	19526160	This is, this is, I'm the happiest man, man, man, alive.
19526160	19533160	Alive, alive, because, because, because, I know, no, no, Ohm's law, law, law, law.
19533240	19535360	Y'all ready, ready for this, this, this, this?
19535360	19540360	E, E, E is equal to I, I, I times times times R, R, R.
19540360	19542080	And the crowd went nuts.
19542080	19545120	Forty-five thousand people on their feet.
19545120	19548000	Ohm's law, Ohm has spoke.
19548000	19550120	Actually, I think I'm getting my history mixed up a little.
19550120	19556640	I don't think it went down like that, quite like that.
19556640	19558040	So this is Ohm's law.
19558040	19559320	This is what Ohm really said.
19559320	19563560	Voltage is equal to current times resistance in the circuit.
19563560	19570160	And of course, instead of the letter E, we could use the letter V, V is equal to I times R.
19570240	19577840	Now remember that trick that I showed you with the triangle T in the center?
19577840	19583640	Let's put this in that, V, I, R.
19583640	19587160	So now you've got all the other variables.
19587160	19591400	If I ask you how much resistance is in there in a circuit, you cover R up, it's voltage
19591400	19593720	divided by current.
19593720	19597520	If I ask you how much current is there in a circuit, you cover up the I and you say
19597520	19599800	it's V over R.
19599800	19604520	If I ask you how much voltage is there in a circuit, it's I times R.
19604520	19610440	So by knowing that one formula, you can figure out all the other algebraic manipulations
19610440	19611440	of it.
19611440	19613640	Does that make sense?
19613640	19621920	So in essence, that is Ohm's law in all of its variables or variations, I should say.
19621920	19622920	Algebraic variations.
19622920	19629640	So you don't even need to be a math whiz to be able to do it.
19629640	19634960	Ohm's law states relationship between current, voltage, and resistance or I is equal to E
19634960	19640760	over R or E is equal to I times R or R is equal to E over I, however you want to look
19640760	19642760	at it.
19642760	19649360	But in the beginning, beginning, beginning, it was V, V, V, or actually E, E, E is equal
19649360	19657760	to I times R, R, R, R, 45,000 people on their feet applauding the man with the beret.
19657760	19663120	I don't know if you wore a beret or not.
19663120	19671320	If I was Ohm, I'd wear a beret.
19671320	19678480	Some of the algebraic formulas, if you will, and when I say that, I know there's some people
19678480	19681560	in here that cringe like, I got to know all this math or whatever.
19681560	19682880	All this is a recipe.
19682880	19683880	That's all this is.
19683880	19687360	By laying it out like this, it shows you how it needs to be laid out to explain the
19687360	19688360	behavior.
19688360	19692240	In a series circuit, the same current flows throughout the circuit.
19692240	19695240	Total current is equal to the current through resistor one plus the current through resistor
19695240	19698440	two plus the current through resistor three, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
19698440	19706400	It's a fancy way of saying current is constant in a series circuit.
19706400	19710400	Total voltage is equal to voltage drop across one across two across three, et cetera, et
19710400	19711400	cetera.
19711400	19712400	That's what I'm saying.
19712400	19720120	A series circuit is also known as a voltage divider.
19720120	19724440	Total resistance in a circuit is the sum of the individual resistances in a circuit.
19724440	19727640	That's a fancy way of saying you got to add it all up.
19727640	19731480	Resistance is additive in a series circuit.
19731480	19737080	In a parallel circuit, total voltage is constant across the parallel network.
19737080	19740200	Resistance is formula.
19740200	19745920	Down below, total current is equal to i or one plus i or two.
19745920	19752840	This says that a parallel circuit is also known as a current divider.
19752840	19756200	Oops, there it is.
19756200	19758000	That's another formula.
19758000	19765800	The reciprocal of the resist, the sum of the reciprocal of the resistances equals the
19766360	19771480	reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals equals the total resistance in the circuit because
19771480	19773960	when we add resistors in parallel, what are we doing?
19773960	19780320	We're actually adding up the conductivity of the individual branches.
19780320	19784200	To determine unknown quantities in a circuit, you can kind of use this as a checklist.
19784200	19785200	Draw schematic of the circuit.
19785200	19790040	You've got to start off with the schematic of the circuit.
19790040	19795080	If one has not been provided to you, you need to draw one.
19795520	19798680	Troubleshooting circuits off the top of your head doesn't really work well.
19798680	19803080	You've got to be looking at the big picture, pun intended.
19803080	19806960	Label all known quantities.
19806960	19813960	Sometimes you may need to get these known quantities from manufactured data sheets.
19815680	19819320	Solve for equivalent circuits.
19819320	19824920	Solve for equivalent circuits.
19825920	19831440	When I say redraw the circuit, remember when we were dealing with a parallel network,
19831440	19835760	two resistors in parallel with each other, you could redraw that circuit and just show
19835760	19837920	one resistance.
19837920	19840720	Two resistors equals one resistance.
19840720	19844200	I could do a simplified, do you want me to do a simplified drawing of my car, electrical
19844200	19845440	system right now?
19845440	19852440	Want to see this?
19854920	19861920	Battery.
19861920	19865920	Car.
19865920	19872920	And to be honest with you, I'm not being silly.
19874760	19880120	I could redraw every circuit of my car and come up with an equivalency and this is what
19880120	19881640	it is.
19881640	19885920	And I'll tell you what, if you go out to your car and you turn the key and there's nothing
19885920	19890680	and you open the door and the dome light doesn't come on, nothing works in the car and all
19890680	19895880	of a sudden this is exactly what you've got and there's an open in this circuit and it's
19895880	19898760	a pretty big open or your battery's dead.
19898760	19900440	I don't think your whole load is dead.
19900440	19902760	It's like oh my goodness all my load is dead.
19902760	19909760	I've got to replace the load, save the battery, you know what I'm saying?
19910760	19912440	It doesn't work like that.
19912440	19914920	But do you see the power of troubleshooting like that?
19914920	19915920	What's working?
19915920	19916920	My car's dead.
19916920	19917920	What do you mean it's dead?
19917920	19918920	It's a conversation with my wife.
19918920	19919920	The car's dead.
19919920	19920920	What do you mean it's dead?
19920920	19922120	It's dead.
19922120	19923680	When you turn the key does it click?
19923680	19924680	No.
19924680	19926040	When you open the door does dome light come on?
19926040	19927040	No.
19927040	19928040	Oh it's dead.
19928040	19930880	But you've got to ask those questions because it's different.
19930880	19934560	When you open the door the dome light comes on but you turn the key, does anything, do
19934560	19936480	you hear a click or anything?
19936480	19939600	Immediately your troubleshooting, you're narrowing it down to what circuits perhaps
19939600	19942000	could be faulty.
19942000	19946840	So redraw to simplify.
19946840	19953920	There's another big law out there, it's Kirchhoff's law, GR Kirchhoff extended Ohm's law with
19953920	19960240	two important statements, Kirchhoff's current law, the algebraic sum of all currents entering
19960240	19964880	and leaving a junction is zero, equal to zero.
19964880	19969000	Kirchhoff's law is kind of like this, everybody know the intersection down here at the bottom
19969000	19971360	of the hill.
19971360	19975800	Let's say that you're a traffic cop and you're directing traffic down there in the center
19975800	19978520	of the intersection.
19978520	19983440	And you've got three cars coming at you this way and you've got five cars coming at you
19983440	19985560	this way.
19985560	19990520	In a few moments how many cars are going to be going away from you?
19990520	19993440	Eight.
19993440	19997640	Because three are coming from one way, five are coming the other way, chances are our cars
19997640	20000840	don't come and we're just kidding, we're going to back up.
20000840	20009400	I've seen them do that down here, but generally speaking, three plus five equals eight.
20009400	20011240	Pretty profound, isn't it?
20011240	20016440	That's what Kirchhoff came up with, and he made the textbook, you laugh, his name's
20016440	20019720	in the textbook, my name's not.
20019720	20025080	That's Kirchhoff's current law, and what Kirchhoff is saying is again the total current entering
20025080	20026080	has to exit.
20026840	20032520	And it's really a profound troubleshooting tool because what you could do, what you could
20032520	20040960	do is I say, I've got three amps of current flowing at me and I've got eight amps flowing
20040960	20042960	away from me.
20042960	20045320	What does that tell me?
20045320	20049760	I must have five more amps coming in from another direction that I'm not aware of and
20049760	20052760	there's only one other circuit, so I must have five amps.
20052760	20059440	And I tell you what, you could take that information to the bank, it's a law of physics, and it's
20059440	20066560	so powerful in troubleshooting, it's extremely powerful in troubleshooting.
20066560	20072320	There was a guy that was in my division, one of our techs in the Navy, goofy guy, I'll
20072320	20077200	tell you some stories about him and his wife in the future.
20077200	20085040	But this dude, it just, you know, every day was a mystery what you'd see this guy into.
20085040	20091400	So military equipment is put together really, really, really well and we didn't have cordless
20091400	20095160	screwdrivers, so you used to have to take stuff apart by hand.
20095160	20097560	So I come in and I'm like, you know, what are you working on?
20097560	20101320	He's like, yeah, we've got a problem with this unit here and I want to take this current
20101320	20105200	reading, you know, and you know, in order to take a current reading I've got to open
20105200	20109080	the circuit.
20109080	20114360	So you're going to remove this access plate here with 64 screws and you're going to remove
20114360	20118520	that, you're going to get in there and take that reading, you know, why don't you use
20118520	20121880	this here which is called Kirchhoff's law, okay?
20121880	20125320	You got this amount of current going this way, this amount of current coming in and
20125320	20130560	the unknown is what you want to measure here, you're going to use Kirchhoff's law and determine
20130560	20135160	with 100% accuracy how much current is flowing through that point, you don't have to take
20135240	20140760	the panel off, you don't have to remove the screws, you don't even have to use a meter,
20140760	20146760	you could use math, put the meter down, math, solve the problem and to be honest with you,
20146760	20151480	these are the technicians that I look for, these are the technicians that I want to hire.
20151480	20157120	If you start the troubleshooting process with the manual and then you're going through tracing,
20157120	20164620	redrawing, applying these principles, these laws, before you go ripping into stuff, you're
20164660	20169260	going to save yourself a lot of grief, a lot of grief.
20169260	20174980	It's like going to work for Boeing, Boeing builds big airplanes, on the tail of their
20174980	20180020	airplanes they put a light that blinks so other airplanes don't hit their airplane when
20180020	20185740	it's flying, you know, I'm not making this stuff up, it's kind of like the light doesn't
20185740	20186740	work.
20186740	20189620	Well let's get a man lifting, get up there and take it apart and whatever, you get a
20189620	20194300	man lift, you get all harnessed up, you know, your five stories in the air, you're manipulating
20194300	20199580	the controls and all of a sudden, oops, you put a dent in the rudder.
20199580	20204460	When you could have done some troubleshooting, probably through an access panel down below,
20204460	20208740	using Kirchoff's law, how much current do I have flowing up there, what's going on,
20208740	20213300	then make some determinations, is it really essential for you to get up there and take
20213300	20218420	that assembly apart, get a man lift, harness yourself up, run the risk of plowing into
20218420	20222920	the rudder by accident, I mean accidents happen, so always look at that kind of stuff.
20222920	20227440	Is there an easier way of going about getting the reading that I want?
20227440	20234320	That's the power of Ohm's law, that's the power of Kirchoff's law.
20234320	20242600	Kirchoff's law also has a voltage application and Kirchoff says the algebraic sum of all
20242600	20246860	voltages around a closed circuit equals zero.
20246860	20256180	This is a fancy way of saying voltage rise equals voltage drop, and you know how much
20256180	20258900	you're left over with, zero.
20258900	20261560	We talked about this last week, didn't we?
20261560	20264680	We talked about this last week.
20264680	20268960	If you put 12 volts in, how many volts are going to get used, 12.
20268960	20273700	If you're troubleshooting and you can only account for 11.5 volts, that half a volt
20273700	20277660	is somewhere that it doesn't belong.
20277660	20280540	You got 120 volts that are supposed to be coming out of these outlets.
20280540	20285780	If you plug it in, you only get 98 volts, something's wrong.
20285780	20290180	If you could go to that box and prove that you got 120 across each leg, but you go to
20290180	20294580	an outlet in your home and you get 98, something's wrong.
20294580	20297780	You find where the missing voltage is, you find the problem.
20297780	20301220	So again, does this sound really basic?
20301220	20304260	What goes in must come out.
20304260	20305260	It is.
20305260	20310180	But I'll tell you what, when you get to industry, you'll deceive me.
20310180	20313180	You're going to get your head to all, ooh, wow, ooh, it's complex.
20313180	20316660	I never worked on one of these before, oh, geez, it's got to be something really, it's
20316660	20320060	got to be the flux capacitor must have failed.
20320060	20323420	I missed that day when Joe talked about the flux capacitor.
20323420	20326060	Keep it basic.
20326060	20327660	Keep it basic.
20327660	20332300	The fundamental parts of the circuit, the source, the load, the internal wiring, the
20332300	20340300	controlling device, the protective device, you got to be able to prove every one of those
20340300	20345660	parts, functional parts is functional.
20345660	20349420	And how are you going to learn how to do that in the lab by doing your labs?
20349420	20353060	Theoretically, how are you going to come to appreciate that by attending a lecture and
20353060	20355020	doing your rent assignments?
20355020	20357620	Because that's what this industry is about.
20357620	20360100	It's about the written theory, which is kind of cool.
20360100	20366260	Some of you had back-breaking jobs in the past, okay?
20366260	20369300	I never worked a hard day in my life.
20369300	20371580	Actually I did, but it was all mental.
20371580	20376340	And I'll tell you what, there were days working on my system.
20376340	20378700	That's the other thing too, you know, it's one of the reasons that we all try to treat
20378700	20380660	you as professionals here in this program.
20380660	20382940	When you go to industry, you're going to be professionals.
20382940	20386700	If your equipment ain't broke, they don't care what you're doing.
20386700	20392420	But when it's broke, they expect you to be there bringing it back from the dead.
20392420	20393420	No questions asked.
20393420	20398660	Well, I'm a union guy and do I get time and a half and fix the freaking gear?
20398660	20399660	Get it up and running.
20399660	20401300	That's all they care about.
20401300	20406060	And actually there are some union maintenance jobs that, you know, do pay you well if you've
20406060	20408620	got to put in that over time.
20408620	20412940	But generally speaking, this is where you make your money.
20412940	20415980	This is the most, I tell you what, I'm taking a lot of time with this chapter.
20415980	20418940	This is one of the most important chapters of the book.
20418940	20424140	It's one of the most important chapters of this entire program.
20424140	20427340	I could talk for a week about just this chapter.
20427340	20430340	And you know what the beauty of it is?
20430340	20431340	You've all been here.
20431340	20432740	This is your third week in this program.
20432740	20434460	You understand what I'm saying?
20434460	20437620	Do you understand what I'm saying?
20437620	20441540	The message isn't going to get any worse.
20441540	20443540	It's not.
20443540	20451180	The most complex electronic systems could be rapidly troubleshot, keeping these fundamental
20451180	20452900	skill sets in mind.
20452900	20457580	Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's Law, five basic parts of a circuit.
20457580	20458580	Is my source good?
20458580	20459580	Is my load good?
20459580	20460580	Is it the interconnects?
20460580	20461780	Can I prove that?
20461780	20466980	The other thing you've got to do as a technician is just pay attention to what can you check
20466980	20469100	quickly?
20469100	20470980	What can you check quickly?
20471740	20477500	Again, like my former esteemed colleague on the submarine, Mike Wirep, was his name.
20477500	20481340	Wirep, weird name.
20481340	20486020	He'd be the kind of guy like, well, you know, I think it's the wiring, Joe.
20486020	20488620	I want to look at the, I want to do continuity checks.
20488620	20491940	I mean, you're talking these big multi-pin connectors and you're going to disconnect
20491940	20492940	and check the continuity.
20492940	20496260	It could take months.
20496260	20498700	You really think that's the problem?
20498700	20504420	You really think a wire like broke in the middle of the night behind that equipment
20504420	20505420	rack?
20505420	20508980	You know, I don't think so.
20508980	20512900	I think it's, you know, maybe something like controlling device.
20512900	20517060	Have you tried reloading the software, you know, the virgin version of software that
20517060	20518060	we have in that safe?
20518060	20521620	Why don't you try reloading the version of software?
20521620	20524020	Controlling device is what I'm thinking, right?
20524020	20526180	Reload the firmware, software.
20526180	20527180	Reboot the system.
20527180	20528740	That's what the problem manifests itself.
20528740	20531460	Oh, Joe, most amazing thing happened.
20531460	20533260	We loaded the software, started working.
20533260	20534260	Wow.
20534260	20538020	Good thing it didn't like take, you know, six months and check the continuity of all
20538020	20540860	them wires in the back of the equipment rack.
20540860	20545060	What would the odds have been?
20545060	20550940	In summary, the electric circuit contains a voltage source, a load, a conductor, the
20550940	20555220	two optional ones, controlling device, protective device.
20555220	20556220	Don't second-guess those.
20556260	20561580	Hey, you want another troubleshooting hint?
20561580	20567020	Another type of protective device, it's called a resettable fuse.
20567020	20569020	Resettable fuse.
20569020	20577100	A lot of consumer electronic products, DVD players, VHS players, stuff like that, tuners,
20577100	20579660	TV tuners, have these resettable fuses.
20579660	20584540	And a lot of times what happens is the device will not work.
20584540	20585540	So it's kind of funny.
20586180	20589500	You know, my family, they all know, you know, Joe, and the family, he's the electronics
20589500	20590500	guy.
20590500	20592900	You've got a problem, you know, and they always call me with the problem.
20592900	20597300	So it's amazing how many things I've fixed from afar.
20597300	20599820	They tell me what the problem is, you know.
20599820	20604620	And a lot of these have been with DVD, VHS players, things like that in the past.
20604620	20609340	So what I'm going to have you do is I've got a ritual that I'm going to go through here
20609340	20610340	on the West Coast.
20610340	20615180	I want you to unplug that device, okay, and what's the most comfortable chair you have
20615180	20616180	in the house?
20616180	20619860	I want you to remove it and put it in the most comfortable chair of the house overnight.
20619860	20625780	And I've got some rituals and some telepathic, you know, things that I'm going to do.
20625780	20628860	And then I'm going to call you back in the morning and let you know when I'm done.
20628860	20630420	Okay, and I'll go plug it in.
20630420	20631420	Holy cow, it works!
20631420	20633580	How did you do that, you know?
20633580	20639660	It's all about chi, okay?
20639660	20641780	Freakin' resettable fuse.
20641780	20644620	For whatever reason, there was a glitch that tripped that.
20644620	20648660	You got to unplug it, totally discharge the whole unit, plug it back in, it reboots thinking
20648660	20649660	it's back at the factory.
20649660	20653620	The first day it was ever made, problem goes away.
20653620	20656420	You got to make sure you give it overnight to be able to do that.
20656420	20657860	So I've brought back countless.
20657860	20663340	I've had a lot of people come in here, colleagues, hey Joe, my amplifier, this amp doesn't work
20663340	20664340	anymore.
20664340	20668220	I can have, you could have it if you could fix it, okay, because I went out and bought
20668220	20669220	a new one.
20669220	20671060	I figured this thing is toast.
20671060	20674980	I go plug it in, it works.
20674980	20679820	By you unplugging it, you fix it, I don't even go on to it with people.
20679820	20682860	We would be surprised the amount of stuff that you could fix by simply unplugging it
20682860	20686380	for 24 hours, plug it overnight, not even 24 hours, plug it back in, you're good to
20686380	20687380	go.
20687380	20689900	Why does it take time?
20689900	20694340	Because these resettable fuses, there's a time delay before they're actually solid
20694340	20698620	state devices, before they physically reset and allow the circuit to function properly
20698620	20699620	again.
20699620	20703500	So you want to get it back to that neutral state of when it left the factory.
20703500	20709860	I don't know, in mobile audio, did you encounter any of that stuff?
20709860	20714180	Or by disconnecting it for a period of time, would fix the problem?
20714180	20720620	Yeah, I mean, when you did a harder reset, touch positive, negative together, make sure
20720620	20728620	the circuit's completely different on the EnerGuy, airbag lights, some control systems
20728620	20736620	if you get a hard reset, would do that to make sure that everything just paints inside.
20736620	20739620	So the fastest way would be to...
20739620	20740620	Yeah.
20740620	20743620	And that's the other thing that you can do even with a DVD player, if you just short
20743620	20747660	it, not unplug it, make sure it's unplugged and then short it, keep the leads shorted
20747660	20750780	together, then that's a kind of a fast track.
20750780	20754620	But still, there are some capacitors we'll talk about in the future, store energy in
20754620	20758500	the form of an electrostatic field that may keep stuff alive for a considerable amount
20758500	20759500	of time.
20759500	20760500	So...
20760500	20763500	Flux capacitors.
20763500	20766940	Flux capacitors.
20766940	20770540	Current path, we talked about series circuits, parallel circuits and complex circuits, series
20770540	20771540	parallel circuits.
20771540	20776580	We talked about current flow, negative to positive, varied by changing the voltage or the resistance.
20776580	20782060	We talked about Ohm's Law and also determining unknown quantities in a circuit as well as
20782060	20783660	Kirchhoff's Law.
20783660	20789460	For current, current is constant in a series circuit, Ohm's Law.
20789460	20793460	All the current entering a node must exit the node, Kirchhoff's Law.
20793460	20801860	Powerful, powerful stuff prevents you from removing 64 screws by hand to take one reading.
20801860	20804300	He used to think I was an A-hole.
20804300	20806900	This here is Kirchhoff's Law.
20806900	20808660	I stayed awake during that class.
20808660	20812620	You could use this here tool to prevent yourself from removing 64 screws.
20812620	20813620	Chronic.
20813620	20815620	Chronic, you're a freaking jerk.
20815620	20816620	No.
20816620	20817620	No, I'm not.
20817620	20823020	I think the guy that's removing 64 screws and then is going to strip the screws, break
20823020	20824660	the heads off.
20824660	20825660	That's another story.
20825660	20828780	There was a dude, a local company, can't make this stuff up.
20828780	20829780	Broke heads of screws off.
20829780	20834940	The product's ready for shipping, got freaking instant glue, glued the heads back on.
20834940	20838580	First time it was out in the field and they took a panel off for maintenance, snap, snap.
20838580	20839580	What the heck is this?
20839580	20840580	What is that on there?
20840580	20841580	They look at it.
20841580	20842580	It's like this instant glue.
20842580	20843580	Who worked on it last at a company?
20843580	20844580	Why'd you do that?
20844580	20847020	But, well, I didn't want to get in trouble.
20847020	20849860	You're out of here, you know, that instant.
20849860	20852540	You can't make stuff like this up.
20852540	20855540	Try to avoid it.
20855540	20856540	Questions?
20856540	20865180	Yes, and that's basically what we're studying is the theory.
20865180	20866740	Laws of physics.
20866740	20874180	We have proven that although this is theory, these are laws of physics, voltage, the relationship
20874180	20880300	between voltage current and resistance, the relationship between voltage current and power,
20880300	20882300	Kirchoff's laws, they're laws of physics.
20882300	20889300	We know that we could prove with 100% accuracy that this is how they behave.
20889300	20898300	Also, in science, generally, a theory is something that is provable all to an infinitesimal
20898300	20903860	degree and a postulate is something that's unproven.
20903860	20904860	Very good.
20904860	20905860	Thank you.
20905860	20906860	Okay.
20906860	20910380	Hey, before we wrap things up, because we've got another chapter to do, okay?
20910380	20914660	Well, fortunately, one of the reasons that I took this amount of time here is this other
20914660	20918340	chapter is not a chapter that I am going to lecture on.
20918340	20924460	It's another chapter that you've got to watch some videos on.
20924460	20926460	There are four videos.
20926460	20932740	When you go to the Google site, it's going to say, follow this link to watch test equipment
20932740	20937180	videos, okay?
20937180	20945100	And there are four videos that I want you to watch and you're responsible for the information.
20945100	20951860	I think all of you kind of figured out that I'm the kind of guy that likes lectures, okay?
20951860	20953780	I like to have fun with lecture.
20953780	20958460	Hopefully you're not falling asleep during my lectures, but I like lectures and it gives
20958460	20961900	me quality face-to-face time with all of you.
20962300	20967260	However, that being said, I also, I'm not the smartest guy, but I know that a picture
20967260	20969380	is worth a thousand words.
20969380	20972940	So if I could have you watch a 15-minute video, that's a lot of frames.
20972940	20974060	That's a lot of pictures.
20974060	20975740	That's a lot of data.
20975740	20979380	More time than I have to preach to you about this stuff.
20979380	20980660	The four videos.
20980660	20987900	The first video is going to be a basic introduction to digital multimeters versus analog meters,
20987900	20988900	okay?
20988900	20991580	The analog, when I speak of analog, this is what I'm talking about here.
20991580	20996500	We can, old school.
20996500	21001340	The digital meter is going to be based on a Fluke 70 series meter that quite frankly
21001340	21007660	all meters are really measured against.
21007660	21015500	The second video is going to talk specifically about how to perform resistance and continuity
21015500	21022740	measurements using an analog meter and a digital multimeter.
21022740	21026420	Resistance and continuity.
21026420	21033160	The third video is going to talk about measuring current and voltage.
21033160	21038860	So by the end of those three videos, you're going to know how to measure resistance, current,
21038860	21044860	and voltage.
21044860	21049140	If you know how to do that, let me tell you, you've got it going on.
21049140	21050780	You've got it going on.
21050780	21055940	Because those are three of the big four properties that all of this is based on.
21055940	21057660	So these are very, very important videos.
21057660	21061860	One of the reasons that we have them on videos and upload it is so that you can watch over
21061860	21066540	and over again to make sure you understand exactly what the process is.
21066540	21070340	So by the time you get into the lab, you can apply that.
21070340	21072220	Very, very critical.
21072220	21074260	Like how to diffuse a nuclear bomb.
21074260	21078380	You want to get it right the first time.
21078380	21083180	The fourth video is produced by Fluke Corporation.
21083180	21085940	How many of you know about Fluke?
21085940	21087900	Fluke is the real deal.
21087900	21089980	The real deal.
21089980	21092340	Expensive local company.
21092340	21093860	John Fluke.
21093860	21097300	John Fluke, former submarine guy.
21097300	21098900	Got to support his product.
21098900	21101380	He was before my time.
21102380	21107860	But yeah, John Fluke is a former submarineer.
21107860	21111420	They produce this video and it kind of, it's a drama.
21111420	21112420	Not a drama.
21112420	21115700	Like, oh, I can't believe he's going to test the voltage.
21115700	21117940	You know, it's got a story behind it.
21117940	21121620	There's a kid who's working on the job and he blows up something and his boss is like,
21121620	21125540	you know, you need to go out to the community college and talk with the electronics professor.
21125540	21131540	And basically it reviews how to perform basic measurements, resistance, current, and voltage
21131540	21135380	with a Fluke 70 Series DMM.
21135380	21136740	That's the fourth video.
21136740	21139220	So all of the information of those videos is testable.
21139220	21141940	The link is on the Google sites.
21141940	21143500	You can watch it at the privacy of your own home.
21143500	21149620	You can watch it on these machines, but that is what we are doing in lieu of this chapter
21149620	21150620	on test equipment.
21150620	21154540	Does anybody have any questions on anything that I covered tonight?
21155540	21156540	Yes.
21158540	21160540	No, the Google site.
21160540	21162540	It's the sites that were in the syllabus.
21162540	21163540	Okay.
21163540	21164540	This right here.
21164540	21169900	If you go to that Google sites, the electronics, LWTC electronics, you're going to see a link
21169900	21170900	in there.
21170900	21173260	Follow this link for test equipment videos.
21173260	21178980	You click on that and then it brings you to some server in Peru that we've uploaded those
21178980	21181580	videos to.
21181580	21183980	We got stuff all over the place.
21183980	21186700	You know what the alternative is?
21186700	21189060	You got to sit here and watch it all.
21189060	21190060	We've really tried.
21190060	21194980	I got my TAs working very, very hard to get as much stuff as we can uploaded to the web
21194980	21199780	so that you could look at this stuff morning, noon, and night.
21199780	21203940	Any other questions on anything in general?
21203940	21207740	Make sure you get that video watched over the next 24, oh, those videos watched over
21207740	21209740	the next 24 hours.
21210500	21212000	All right.
21212000	21220740	A chapter that I really like talking about is chapter seven because the title is Power
21220740	21223500	and I like power.
21223500	21224500	I like power.
21224500	21225500	Remember what was it?
21225500	21226500	Tim the tool man?
21226500	21227500	Remember power?
21227500	21229340	You could never have enough power.
21229340	21231660	The gas-powered blender.
21231660	21233500	I think it's a great idea.
21233500	21237700	If you've ever mixed any frozen concoctions, having a little bit extra power to chop that
21237700	21243220	ice up and get just the perfect consistency is not a bad thing.
21243220	21245140	I've never driven a car.
21245140	21249020	I've never driven a car that's had too much power.
21249020	21252260	Actually, no, and I did have the opportunity.
21252260	21255980	I went through Richard Petty's driving school two years on a row.
21255980	21258900	This was probably about 10 years ago.
21258900	21261380	I thought these cars would have governors on them.
21261380	21266060	You go through and they're going to turn some goofball like me loose in a Winston Cup car
21266100	21267100	at the time.
21267100	21268100	No governors.
21268100	21269980	That car had a lot of power.
21269980	21270980	Putting the right hand.
21270980	21271980	It's scary.
21271980	21277180	I got the Drive Las Vegas Motor Speedway and I'll tell you the whole story sometime, but
21277180	21279780	actually I got the fastest times of the day.
21279780	21284460	I was at the top of the reader board, Joe Greenock, it was pretty freaking cool.
21284460	21289780	So I was thinking about quitting my day job and becoming a NASCAR driver.
21289780	21295140	Luckily I have good friends that woke me up to reality, but the power was fabulous.
21295140	21300300	So I think as much as I love aviation and aerospace, I see the Blue Angels in town.
21300300	21305500	I look at those F-18s and knowing my own piloting skills, and I think I'm a pretty good pilot,
21305500	21310340	but knowing my own pilot skills, I probably last probably five or six seconds in one of
21310340	21313780	those things before there'd be a fireball going down the runway, a little bit too much
21313780	21317460	power for me.
21317460	21324020	Power in electronics is in electrical is very, very important because it's the metric that
21324020	21327220	we use to determine output.
21327220	21331300	It's the metric that we use to determine efficiency.
21331300	21337020	It's the metric that we use to show us how much energy we're converting into work.
21337020	21340580	So this is a really big chapter.
21340580	21347780	If you fully understand the implications of power, you're going to be a better technician.
21347780	21352260	You truly are, because looking at inconsistencies in power output is going to start to paint
21352260	21358340	a story, tell you a story, and paint you a picture of what's taking place with a system.
21358340	21363660	So with that being said, let's jump and immerse ourselves into chapter seven power.
21363660	21367940	After completing this chapter, we're going to be able to define power as it relates
21367940	21375020	to electric circuits, state the relationship of current and voltage, solve for power consumption
21375020	21381380	in electrical circuit, determine the total power consumption in a series parallel and
21381380	21384980	a series parallel circuit.
21384980	21392620	Now power relates to the rate at which work is being done.
21392620	21396560	Relates to the rate at which work is being done.
21396560	21402220	Work is done when a force causes motion.
21402220	21406940	I'm sure my kids, I got three kids, three boys, they're all grown, the youngest is going to
21406940	21412100	graduate, new dub here in June.
21412100	21415140	Business finance, he's going to make me, he's going to make a bunch of money and then hire
21415140	21419020	me to hang out with them.
21419020	21420340	He's going to do really well.
21420340	21424860	My kids probably all think I'm a jerk because I know stuff like this.
21424860	21430220	We'd have family cleanup day around the yard, and I'm out in the front yard digging ditches
21430220	21435300	and doing whatever, and the kids are in the back yard, it's supposed to be raking leaves.
21435300	21441860	When I come around the corner and they're standing there leaning on the rake, what are
21441860	21442860	you guys doing?
21442860	21443860	We're working.
21443860	21449780	No, you're not because work is done when a force causes motion, right?
21449780	21454740	So by simply standing there bracing yourself against the rake, you're definitely not working
21454740	21461420	to get back to raking, so obviously me knowing this stuff, they think I'm a jerk.
21461420	21465540	So work is done when a force causes motion.
21465540	21471420	Now check this out, force, voltage, current, motion.
21471420	21475740	Voltage creates current causing electrons to move in a circuit.
21475740	21479420	So if you've got a voltage and you've got current, you're doing work.
21479420	21483940	May not be the work you want to get done, but you're doing work because a force causes
21483940	21489260	motion, voltage causes current, and we know voltage is pressure, current is movement,
21489780	21494420	it's got to be power, make sense?
21494420	21503660	Now electric power rate is the instantaneous rate at which work is done, instantaneous.
21503660	21507660	That means take a snapshot right now, how much work is being done right now?
21507660	21508660	What's the pressure?
21508660	21509660	What's the current?
21509660	21512340	Right now, instantaneous value, make sense?
21512340	21516460	Now that's not how the power company, it's actually odd the power company is called the
21516460	21519820	power company, let's go back to that.
21519820	21524580	Power relates to the rate at which work is being done, work is done when a force causes
21524580	21525580	motion.
21525580	21529620	How many of you here pay money on a monthly basis to the power company?
21529620	21531180	Why are they called the power company?
21531180	21534740	All they're really providing us with is voltage, you know who the power company is?
21534740	21535740	It's you.
21535740	21539740	It's to take money out of our wall, it's exactly.
21539740	21540740	Who's the power company?
21540740	21544820	You're actually the power company, you're providing the current path if you will for
21544820	21545940	the current to flow.
21545940	21547900	They're just providing you with the voltage.
21547900	21550980	They should be called the voltage company, okay?
21550980	21553300	I mean realistically, that's all they're doing.
21553300	21558100	When you pay for electrical service to your home, all they're providing you with is a
21558100	21562020	voltage, a electrical pressure at your box.
21562020	21566020	It's up to you to hit the breakers, turn the circuits on, turn your lamps on, turn your
21566020	21568580	appliances on, turn your loads on.
21568580	21573500	That gives current a path to flow, now you're consuming power, power company.
21573740	21577580	I always, you know, I see, I take this stuff to literal, which is one of the reasons that
21577580	21579980	I'm here and you're there, okay?
21579980	21582180	But it just doesn't make sense, does it?
21582180	21583180	It really doesn't.
21583180	21588620	Now the power company, the voltage company, charges you in watts.
21588620	21596340	Actually, the power company charges you in what are called kilowatt hours, kilowatt hours.
21596340	21598100	I'll talk about more of that in a second.
21598100	21599100	Measure in watts.
21599100	21605420	Wattage is greater when work is done in a short period of time than when the same amount
21605420	21611620	of work is done in a longer period of time.
21611620	21616740	Wattage is greater when work is done in a short period of time than when the same amount
21616740	21620900	of work is done in a longer period of time, right?
21620900	21626900	A mild example of this, it's an area of I enjoy motorsports in general, I enjoy mechanical
21626940	21628580	things, you know?
21628580	21633900	No offense to any of you here that are into any of the fine arts, but if I had a chance
21633900	21641140	on a Sunday afternoon of going to the opera, which I've attended, the opera, the symphony
21641140	21647900	orchestra, musicals, plays, not a big musical guy, no offense, but it's not how I roll,
21647900	21652460	or going down a bowing field and standing at the edge of the fence and watching the
21652460	21654020	heavy metal takeoff, okay?
21654020	21656820	I'd probably be down a bowing field, it's just how I roll.
21656820	21659700	So I've always been a big advocate of motorsports.
21659700	21665180	One area of motorsports that I never was really that intrigued with, I respect it, but I'm
21665180	21671540	not that intrigued with pursuing it, is drag racing, but I respect it immensely.
21671540	21677860	Drag racing is about getting as much end power out of the engine and coupling it to the wheels
21677860	21684180	and getting the car down the track, a quarter mile track as quickly as you possibly can.
21684180	21688180	If any of you have ever watched drag racing, I mean some of the rockets, rockets, strap
21688180	21692820	yourself in, go pow wow, quarter mile, you know, a matter of seconds and they're down
21692820	21694420	that quarter mile track.
21694420	21699820	I've always been, I've enjoyed NASCAR racing and Formula One is just, Formula One for me
21699820	21704700	is, because they not only go down the track that fast, but they turn around and come back
21704700	21708420	and they make some turns in between, so that's really amazing technology.
21708420	21713500	But, follow what I'm saying, drag racing takes all of that power, couples it to the
21713500	21717540	wheels, the tires, traction, and accelerates, okay?
21717540	21721300	So they're consuming a huge amount of power and converting it into energy to get down
21721300	21722300	the track.
21722300	21727300	Would that be the same concept if you had a car that did 45 miles in one hour, versus
21727300	21732300	a car that did 80 miles in one hour, and you would be consuming more power in the amount
21732300	21734820	of an hour, would you get there faster?
21734820	21735820	Absolutely.
21735820	21736820	Yep.
21736820	21740940	And to get that work done in a shorter period of time, it's going to take you more power.
21740940	21743900	So that's one of the reasons that, you know, with gas prices going up, getting off that
21743900	21748380	pedal, it does make a difference, it does make a difference.
21748380	21754300	The epitome for me, and it's a toss-up, it's a toss-up, NASCAR was involved in both of
21754300	21755300	them, right?
21755300	21756300	Space Shuttle.
21756300	21761420	Space Shuttle, or old, kicking at old school, NASCAR, the Saturn V rockets.
21761420	21767780	Saturn V rockets, a little tiny capsule up on the top, big, huge freaking rocket, okay?
21767780	21768780	Light it.
21768780	21771380	The dude that lights it, lights it, and then goes like three miles away and goes into a
21771380	21773820	concrete bunker, okay?
21773820	21777060	And then literally with the Space Shuttle, it's the same thing, they light it, and then
21777060	21781020	they like run three miles away, and you know, that thing goes off, right?
21781020	21784060	Seven minutes later, they're in outer space.
21784060	21785900	Seven minutes later, they're in outer space.
21785900	21790620	NASA throws power at the problem to get the Space Shuttle into orbit, okay?
21790620	21795380	So obviously we're talking about, if NASA could meter out that power, you know, you
21795380	21799020	could probably light several cities for a good deal of time.
21799020	21804340	Instead, they say, how can we get that power and concentrate it in liquid fuels, solid
21804340	21809260	rocket boosters, and then be able to concentrate that energy so we could get that Space Shuttle,
21809260	21814180	which is freaking huge, it's a big thing, into outer space in seven minutes.
21814180	21818980	Not eight minutes, not nine minutes, but it's seven minutes, they're in orbit.
21818980	21819980	Tremendous amount of power.
21819980	21822340	Have any of you here ever seen a Space Shuttle launch?
21823340	21829060	Yeah, I had the opportunity back in the 80s, I actually saw the Challenger, fortunately
21829060	21834580	not the time that it had its malfunction, I saw it before that, and actually ironically
21834580	21840940	Dick Scobey, who's from Auburn, Washington, I saw a mission that he flew prior to the
21840940	21847140	catastrophic accident that they had, but I was in Titusville, Florida, and you're listening
21847140	21851660	to the radio and you hear the countdown and everything, three, two, one, and you know,
21851660	21856180	I don't know how many miles away you are, like 10 miles, 12 miles, you know, you see
21856180	21862300	it going up, going up, and then all of a sudden the wall of sound hits you, and it's just
21862300	21867660	a sound like I've never heard before, it's like, wow, that is freaking cool, you know,
21867660	21871540	the next thing, you know, it's gone, man, it's in orbit, they're in orbit, over and
21871540	21876340	around the Earth, tremendous amount of power, okay, so the same thing with electronics, same
21876340	21880900	thing with electronics, the more power we throw at something, the more work we can do,
21880900	21885420	so you know, basically, you know, if you're attending a concert, you know, the Pink Floyd
21885420	21892100	Orchestra is performing in an auditorium, they are going to have to throw a lot of voltage
21892100	21897700	and current at the problem to create a lot of acoustic energy to satisfy the masses, because
21897700	21906340	that's what we've all grown accustomed to, is loud music, right, okay, what is the basic
21906340	21915060	unit of power? That is not a question, it's a statement, what, what is the basic unit
21915060	21925460	of power? It is literally equal to the voltage across a circuit multiplied by the current
21925460	21938900	through the circuit, it represents the rate at which work is being done, and what is the
21938900	21946300	guy that came up with it, and what he said, I think he gave this presentation down at
21946300	21955580	the King Dome back in the day, 45,000 people, Ohm gave his spiel, right, remember that,
21955580	21962660	V, V, V is equal to I, I, I times R, R, R, R, right, that was Ohm's deal, Watt got up
21962660	21970260	there not to be outdone, and he said P, P, P is equal to I, I, I times V, V, V, and that's
21970260	21993660	what he said, that's what he said, so again, P, I, V, triangle with a T in the center,
21993660	21997940	power is equal to voltage times current, if I ask you how much voltage is there, and you
21997940	22002660	know how much power there is, right, in current, then you can calculate out the voltage, if
22002660	22006580	I ask you how much current is there, if you know the power and the voltage, you can calculate
22006580	22012340	out the current, and of course power, current times voltage, that's all your variables,
22012340	22019220	simple math, and this is called Watt's law, Watt's law, so so far, for those of you at
22019220	22024180	home keeping track of what's going down, we've gone over Ohm's law, we've talked about Kirchoff's
22024180	22028780	law and this is Watt's law, these are laws of physics, they allow us to calculate what's
22028780	22034180	going to take place with 100% accuracy, very, very useful tools, we're not teaching you
22034180	22037580	this stuff because I got nothing better to do with my time, we're teaching you this stuff
22037580	22043420	because this becomes very valuable for an electronics technician, paints a picture, tells
22043420	22051140	you what's going on, literally tells you what's going on, okay, a little known fact about
22051140	22058220	yours truly, I used to work in radio, okay, I worked on the air, I was on the air personality
22058220	22062820	for an AM radio station in Connecticut, and it was one of the things that got me interested
22062820	22068220	in electronics, because I worked kind of hard and I didn't have a whole lot of job security,
22068220	22075460	there was a guy at the station, the chief engineer, this guy, every year he'd buy a formula
22075460	22080180	firebird, trade in the old one, get a new formula firebird, and he always kind of had
22080180	22084900	a girlfriend with him that was kind of had it going on, if you know what I mean, okay,
22084900	22090420	and he did very little, he came every week to the station and he'd get all of the readings
22090420	22094420	that all the on the air people took from the transmitter, we were able to take the readings
22094420	22100420	from the transmitter remotely, but we had to log in these voltages and these currents,
22100420	22105940	and then he would come, he'd come with a calculator much like this, okay, and he'd sit there and
22105940	22111260	he'd perform these calculations all the way down, and then he'd sign the logs, take them,
22111260	22115580	stick them in a folder, and then they'd be held by the station.
22115580	22122780	What he was doing is that the station, commercial station, was licensed by the Federal Communications
22122780	22128340	Commission to only broadcast so much power, and the proof of how much power was being
22128340	22135540	transmitted was the voltage of the final transmitter tube, the current flowing to that transmitter
22135540	22139700	tube, if you knew those two you could calculate out the power, and then there was approved
22139700	22145620	engineering design criteria for the antenna system, that the antenna system had certain
22145620	22151540	number of losses, so you could prove to the FCC, you see, we were not broadcasting more
22151540	22157380	power than we were allotted, we were not interfering with that station in Pennsylvania, okay, we
22157380	22161460	couldn't have been, because we're only broadcasting out what you've allowed us to broadcast out,
22161460	22167260	so it was a technician calculating this out through the current and voltage readings that
22167260	22172460	I think it was every four hours we had to take, every four hours on the air personnel,
22172460	22175940	and it was right there in the studio, it was an equipment rack and you could go and just
22175940	22181180	sequence through, you know, and take the voltage readings, the current readings, and log those
22181180	22191060	in and that became part of the permanent record, so it was kind of funny, it really was inspirational
22191060	22195700	for me seeing this guy as the chief engineer, he was a chief engineer and he was assigned
22195700	22201300	several radio stations in Connecticut on contract, the guy made really good money, you know,
22201300	22206860	and I'm like how do I get his job, well you need an FCC license, you know, basically the
22206860	22211460	general radio operators license to be able to maintain a commercial radio station like
22211460	22217580	that, so anyway, I'm an examiner now for the FCC and I give that exam and I've never in
22217580	22222940	my life owned a Formula Firebird, so I have had some girlfriends that kind of had it going
22222940	22230740	on if you know what I mean, until it hits the fan, until the station gets hit by lightning,
22230740	22235740	okay, and then it's like oh, and then you got the general manager, right, the program
22235740	22241100	director, and all of that advertising dollars that were spent, right, you're losing that
22241100	22245860	money because the station is off the air and that's how stations pay the bills is all the
22245900	22249980	advertising, so when you're off the air, you're in a pickle, people will tune to another station
22249980	22255660	or whatever, so it's kind of a big deal, ironically though, kind of behind the scene story like
22255660	22263340	here, we had a woman in our program that completed this program and I got her an internship, she
22263340	22272020	interned for a period of time at KISW and the engineer at the time over there, Brian, he hadn't
22272060	22276820	had a vacation for three years because again, as a chief engineer, you just don't go on vacation,
22276820	22282580	yeah, I'm taking my vacation next week, you know, you can't do that because if the station goes
22282580	22287300	off the air, who's gonna, you know, so for the, there was nobody, nobody that he could hand the
22287300	22293820	station over to, once she got in there and she built up some credibility, he actually went
22293820	22299180	on vacation and gave her the keys and it's kind of like hey, you've got it, so you've got the
22299180	22303580	station, she was a student here at Lake Washington Technical College, she was the acting chief
22303580	22311420	engineer for KISW, also, also because all these engineers and all the radio stations, they're
22311420	22315940	all in cahoots with each other, okay, so if the station goes off the air, you know, call Tony
22315940	22320340	over at Cairo, he'll come over and help you out, you know, you've got all these engineers that will
22320340	22324740	lend a hand, even though you're the competition on paper, if I need something, you'll help me out,
22324740	22328780	if you need something, I'll help you out and it kind of goes, it's a, you know, unwritten law,
22328780	22335540	if you will, and radio to help everybody else out, so kind of exciting. So anyway, this power
22335540	22340900	reading is very, very critical, so that you could tell the performance of your equipment and it's
22340900	22344940	something that, if any of you go into commercial broadcasting, you're gonna be doing the exact
22344940	22348700	same thing, taking those power readings, how much energy are we, are we getting off the antenna,
22348700	22352300	the only way to tell them is how much voltage you got, how much current you got, you got going,
22352300	22356860	same thing, you come from an audio car, car audio background, same thing, you got a thousand watt
22356860	22364260	amplifier, it's a math problem, okay, 1000 watts, you know what this is, okay, 12.6 volts DC, you
22364260	22368540	know what this is, well, this is gonna tell you how much current it is, it's a math problem, you
22368540	22373420	know, now it's a thousand watt amplifier, that's peak performance, and how often you're gonna be
22373420	22378340	cranking out that peak performance, but you've got to design everything backwards to make sure that
22378340	22383860	if you crank it up all the way, you're not gonna cause an electrical fire, it's a good meltdown,
22383860	22389380	so you've got to design, and it all integrates, really it's a beautiful thing. Now the electric
22389380	22398420	company, the electric company, the voltage company, they charge you, they charge you for kilowatt
22398420	22408820	hours, kilowatt hours, that's a thousand watts, a kilowatt, right, per hour, so that you consuming
22408820	22414660	a thousand watts over an hour, okay, I don't know if any of you go to the gymnasium periodically,
22414660	22421060	the gym workout, some of the life cycles, stair steppers, these things, some of them have integrated
22421060	22427300	in calories that you're consuming, some of them have a screen that you can go to for watts, okay,
22427700	22432660	so I often thought I hate working out, I really do, it just, I'm not afraid of hard work, okay,
22432660	22436980	if I got to dig a ditch in the backyard, I love doing it, you know, I'm all about hard work, but
22436980	22444340	going to the gym and like, you know, for an hour just doesn't make sense, at least put the thing
22444340	22449540	up to a generator, let me charge my cell phone or something, and you know, let me save a nickel or
22449540	22454020	something, if you know, that makes more sense to me, but anyway, somebody's screens have watts,
22454020	22460820	and if any of you have ever done that, how hard you have to work to generate a watt, I mean,
22460820	22467700	it's amazing, so the electric company, the voltage company is selling us a thousand watts
22467700	22473380	per hour, that's the unit of measure that they charge us, okay, so anybody know off the top of
22473380	22477780	their head about what we're being charged here in the greater Seattle area, a kilowatt hour,
22477780	22484340	zzz, wait, you're being ripped off, man, that's, that's chronic power and light,
22486420	22491460	about eight cents, about eight cents, some of you, depending on your, on your, your scale,
22491460	22497300	six and a half cents, seven cents per kilowatt hour, which is the thing that I kind of struggle with,
22498340	22507140	I go, this year alone, since January, I got invited to attend a green energy conference,
22507140	22512820	good jobs, green jobs in Washington DC, and then I was invited to be a guest speaker in Milwaukee
22512820	22518980	at the green summit, so I, I'm some world-class speakers I get to be in the presence of, so I
22518980	22522980	go to this like green summit in Milwaukee, and I get seriously jazzed, you know, like, yeah, I'm
22522980	22527940	going to go home and I'm going to do an energy audit, I'm going to see, I'm going to get home,
22529220	22534820	lost them six and a half cents per kilowatt hour, you know, how much effort do I have to put into
22534820	22539220	really saving, and how much am I going to save, it really doesn't make sense, I mean, it really
22539220	22544980	doesn't, there needs to be consumer incentive for you to, to really hunker down and save,
22544980	22549700	because electricity here in the Northwest is very, very inexpensive, and that's a good thing,
22549700	22555540	I'm not complaining about it, you know, and there are some things that you could do to save,
22555540	22559380	save energy, but there's only so much that you could do, and we're really not paying that much
22559380	22566260	for it, even like with electric cars, I know my colleague did some of the math with purely
22567220	22573220	electric cars that we're coming out with, and really it equates for the price of gas at four
22573220	22580340	bucks a gallon, it comes out to being that it's about 99 miles per gallon that you would get,
22580340	22587220	equivalent to travel, travel 99 miles, then it would cost you to do that for that fill up,
22587300	22591060	and that's what about what it equates to when you're paying six and a half seven cents per
22591060	22595300	kilowatt hour, which is bad, you know, I wouldn't mind having a car that got 99 miles per gallon,
22595300	22602420	100 miles per gallon, but is it worth the investment of me scrapping my, you know, my V8,
22603140	22608100	I mean, because I don't, unless I'm having, unless I'm driving a Tesla, which is out of my range,
22608100	22613540	you know, I don't think, I like that V8, you know, V8 Taurus, pour some fuel into the situation,
22613540	22619220	a little bit of air, get out of the freeway, set the pace, I keep up with the flow of traffic,
22619220	22624340	set the pace, and I have documentation, watching the state control of a little Tesla at math, okay.
22631060	22636100	So, good analysis to determine the power dissipated by a component of voltage,
22636100	22642500	drop, and time, so I'm talking about for a component now, okay, this works for loads,
22642580	22646820	this works for like an amplifier, if you've got an electric load, an amplifier, a transmitter,
22646820	22652980	you could do this, but this also works for individual components, so if you know how much
22652980	22655940	current's going through the component, and you know the voltage across the component,
22655940	22663300	then you could figure out exactly how much energy that component is dissipating. Now, remember resistors,
22665620	22670500	remember resistors, resistors are devices designed to possess the property of resistance,
22670500	22676820	resistance is that force which opposes the flow of electrons, the byproduct of resistance,
22676820	22683220	when current encounters resistance, it generates heat, that's how we determine the power of that
22683220	22688020	resistor, because all resistors are not created equal, there's ath watt resistors,
22688020	22692260	quarter watt resistors, half watt resistors, one watt resistors, five watt resistors,
22692260	22697540	how much energy could they dissipate, and literally, literally it's the voltage across the component,
22697540	22701940	times the current going through the component, that's going to give you that power that's being
22701940	22709140	consumed by it. If a resistor, if you ask too much of a resistor, it will fry, it will fail,
22710020	22716340	if you exceed its rated capability, so all electronic components are really like that,
22716340	22720660	you know the voltage, you know the current, we're going to talk about some exceptions in the future,
22721380	22725620	they're not resistive components, they're called reactive components, that'll come later this
22725700	22730580	quarter, we'll talk about that, and that they don't, these are components that don't consume
22730580	22736980	energy in the form of heat, that's why they're called reactive, but something we'll talk about
22736980	22743540	in the future. Hey, the neat thing with power, power dissipated in series or parallel is equal to
22743540	22749140	the sum of the power dissipated by the individual components, power is always additive, it doesn't
22749140	22755780	matter if it's series or parallel or whatever, power is always additive, I've got a 400 horsepower
22755780	22763220	engine on my airplane, and I remove it and get another 400 horsepower engine amount, each engine
22763220	22769540	on each wing, now 400 times two is up to 800 horsepower worth of power, as were before in a
22769540	22776820	single engine aircraft, that was only up to 400 horsepower, okay, it's kind of funny, I know a
22776820	22781300	little bit about airplanes, but the odd thing about airplanes is when you do that, instead of the
22781300	22787140	airplane costing twice as much, it ends up usually costing you about three times as much,
22787140	22790980	so for a twin-engine airplane you're going to pay through the nose, you know, much higher performance,
22790980	22798340	a lot more going on with it, a lot more structural that they have to do, but power is always additive,
22799060	22802020	that's why the space shuttle, right, solid rocket boosters on the space shuttle,
22802740	22808260	all right, they have two, you know how much power that is, twice as much as one, okay,
22808260	22812740	that's why they put two of them up, and actually from what I understand, I think the space shuttle
22812740	22817380	can, I don't know if it could get a shallow orbit, if it's just on one solid rocket booster
22818020	22821300	or not, but those things are literally like Roman candles, once they light up they're going for a
22821300	22827140	ride, there's no shutting them down, uh-oh, we changed our mind, let's back it back to the pad now,
22827140	22833380	you're going for a ride, power, so power is always additive, always additive,
22833380	22839380	this is the thing like with your home, forget about what is energy conservation, a bunch of
22840340	22846660	your home, every device that is on in your home right now that has a voltage across it
22846660	22852900	and current flowing through it is consuming power, okay, there's a lot of phantom loads in your home,
22852900	22859380	stuff that's plugged in but it ain't turned on, but it's still consuming power, why? You got voltage
22859380	22865060	across it, it's got a current flowing through it, you're plugged in, how many have a nice flat
22865060	22870340	screen TV at home, right, how many have it, is it turned on right now, do you leave it on 24-7
22870340	22876340	or is it turned off, still consuming power, still consuming power, so that way when you go home and
22876340	22880980	hit that remote, pow, that screen comes right up, if not there'd have to be a period of time with
22880980	22886820	some electronics for it to warm up, come up, everybody wants instant gratification with systems,
22886820	22890980	especially somebody old tube systems, right, those really consume a lot, you had to wait for the tubes
22890980	22896740	to heat up and everything, but most electronics are really in a standby mode, your battery charger
22896740	22900100	right now, your cell phone charger at home, if it's plugged in the wall and it's not plugged
22900100	22904020	into your cell phone, it's still consuming some energy because it's got current flowing through
22904020	22912260	a coil there, when you plug in your phone, it consumes more current, right, so a lot of these
22912260	22917700	again are phantom loads that exist at your home, you're consuming energy, real small amount, real
22917700	22925940	small amount, it all adds up, it all adds up, you know, as you want to things that give you a sales pitch
22925940	22931220	for tomorrow's meeting, right, you can watch a documentary called Power Search, that was just on
22931220	22937540	on public television, there's a talk a lot about that, you know, it all adds up, it's all about
22937540	22951060	power, you know, I didn't hear about her, did she save money early, huh, I'm not gonna do that,
22952180	22956420	all my plugs are like behind the couch and crown, I'm gonna climb back there, it's all the power
22956420	22962340	stripper that on off, you know, that's it, in all honesty, that actually I thought about that,
22962340	22967700	you know, my wife and I travel a lot and we, you know, we go away and really would make sense,
22967700	22973380	just shut off that main breaker of the house, you know, leave for a month, come back and then,
22973380	22977140	you know, you go get your electric bill, they still charge you the same, you know, they're just
22977140	22982980	messing with you, gotta have your thucks in a row, man, you gotta pay attention to that meter, so
22983700	22989860	now electronics, the power dissipated in a circuit is often less than one watt,
22991140	22995700	electronics, microelectronics like you're studying here, typically the value is going
22995700	23002020	to be less than a watt, typical values will be the milli watt, this is times 10 to the negative third
23002020	23004740	or one-thousandth of a watt
23007380	23012340	and the micro watt, one million micro watts equals one watt,
23014020	23018580	so we're talking a millionth of a watt, that's typically what's consumed in
23023860	23027700	some of you are working around with amateur radio, you want to get your amateur radio license and
23027700	23030980	play around with some of that stuff, some of them are here for power transmitters,
23031060	23033780	you need to make sure you have the available current and voltage
23033780	23038020	signal on, you're not going to be able to do that, because again, you want to hear behind
23038660	23044180	why power is equal to current and voltage, so if you're on a low voltage system,
23046100	23053140	like a car, like a car or a boat or an airplane, and you want to start jacking this value up,
23053140	23057620	that means you're going to have to start using a bigger cable, a physically bigger cable,
23057860	23063860	you have more electrons that you're going to have to transport from the source to the load,
23063860	23067060	and that's what you're measuring, okay, so the math doesn't lie,
23068980	23073060	total power dissipated in a series or parallel circuit is equal to some of the power dissipated
23073060	23080500	by the individual components, meaning power is additive, power is additive, there's no such thing
23080500	23089300	as negative power, but this is putting power back in, you know, perpetual motion machine,
23089300	23093700	you get something like that going, give me a call, okay, give me a call, I have my attorney
23093700	23100180	contact, your attorney, and I'll personally fly you to Bimini, and you could watch the sunset
23100180	23104580	drinking out of a coconut with one of those screwy straws, an umbrella on the top of your drink,
23105540	23111940	okay, now all we do is consume voltage, we consume power, nothing puts things back in,
23111940	23115460	so it's not, I guess it'd be like me getting an airplane engine, you know, mounting one,
23115460	23117700	like going this way, and then the other end, you go this way,
23123460	23130020	one, yeah, one, that one, you lift off, you know, so UFO, no, it's a doofus,
23130180	23136820	it's a doofus, what's that guy doing? Does that make sense? All right, summary,
23137700	23144980	power is the rate at which energy is delivered to a circuit, power is also the rate at which
23144980	23152420	energy or heat is dissipated by the resistance in a circuit, this isn't, that second bullet
23152420	23155620	statement there isn't something we dig, it's something we got to deal with, we don't want
23155620	23161220	our electronic equipment to get hot, it's one of my, one of my, I got a lot of electronics in
23161220	23167380	my family room, got my audio, I got surround sound, I got my plasma screen, TV, I've got,
23167380	23171860	got all this equipment, I've got, I got several computers, I got a computer that monitors the
23171860	23176820	weather at my house, why, because I'm just into that kind of stuff, I got my other main computer,
23176820	23184100	I've got all my network gear from, for router, I got a switch that powers the other internet
23184100	23188660	connections in the house, got all that stuff, in the summer, that room really gets freaking warm,
23189220	23193860	okay, in the winter it's kind of cool, warm I mean, you know what I mean, you come in there and I got
23193860	23197940	all this electronic stuff that's keeping that warm, really heavy and temperate, but you know,
23197940	23201940	was it last year, two years ago, we had the heat wave, it was like, holy cow man, I had to start
23201940	23205940	shutting stuff down, I'm like, you know how important it is to start shutting stuff down,
23205940	23210100	so I don't have a Wi-Fi system in the house, not that that generates that much heat, but
23210100	23215780	everything else in there does generate the heat, we don't want that, we don't want that,
23215780	23221220	it's something we have to live with, so a lot of times when equipment is densely packed,
23221220	23227540	that thermal profile tells us what's going on, former member of our advisory committee here
23227540	23232820	at Lake Washington Technical College was the chief engineer for Channel 9 out of Seattle,
23233540	23237780	and we went down there for a tour one day, their transmitter is located up on Capitol Hill,
23238740	23245860	and he was showing me the air inlet temperature and then the exhaust temperature, right, the air
23245860	23250180	that they're sucking in to run through the transmitter to Kula, and by looking at that,
23250180	23255380	you know, this is the inlet air temperature, this is the exhaust, by looking at that difference,
23255380	23259860	obviously if it's a warmer day, they go up like this, right, I mean it is what it is,
23260580	23265620	by him looking at that, okay, if this stay stationary and then this one goes up,
23265620	23272580	it immediately tells him what, the transmitter is consuming more power, that means there's a problem,
23272580	23276500	because when it was brand spanking new, this is what it was, this is the inlet,
23276500	23279860	that the difference between the two is a critical number, temperature,
23280660	23283780	you raise the temperature, shows you something's not operating efficiently,
23284980	23289140	plain and simple, one of the tricks, because I paid attention, I'm not that smart of a guy,
23289140	23293300	but I did pay attention when I was in school, formal schooling like this, one of the things
23293300	23303460	that I used to do is when I was in the Navy, we had very, very complex circuits, and there was
23303460	23310900	this one board that had memory chips on it, and it used to fail, and running the diagnostics to
23310900	23317460	determine which chip it was was just very, very laborious, and I've always kind of been a lazy
23317460	23323460	guy, and I'm like, you know, there's got to be an easier way of doing this, you know, so what I did
23323460	23328660	one day is just for giggles, and then we had to figure out what it was, I put it back in,
23328660	23332820	it fired the whole system up, right, and then immediately shut the thing down, pulled the
23332820	23340420	circuit card out, right, and I started going across the chips, got to the hot chip, and guess
23340420	23346740	which chip was the hot chip, the fail component, so anyway, it was kind of funny, my colleagues
23346740	23351140	thought like I was like into, you know, black magic, and like voodoo, and you know, because
23351140	23355620	there'd be a problem with the chip, and then I'm like, okay, you know, I'll figure out which one
23355620	23359620	it is, but you're all gonna have to leave, okay, and I actually started doing, I hit a little mojo
23359620	23364180	bag with some bones in it, and a crow's foot, and I played the whole thing up, you know, and we'd
23364180	23369540	shut the thing down, I'd come out, U44, I was like, how the heck did you do that? I was looking at
23369540	23374020	which chip was getting hot, the one that gets hot is the one that failed, and it's generating more
23374020	23378260	heat, and that's what the problem is, so you could really determine, use this trouble shooting tool
23378260	23382900	later on, if something's getting hot, and if you know what the norm is, beyond that, now they've
23382900	23391700	got stuff on the market, they've got thermal imaging, power company, actually uses thermal imaging,
23391700	23395620	they'll go ahead with the thermal imaging gun and look at their power runs, and where two wires
23395620	23399620	are joined together, if it starts to generate a lot of heat, they know there's a problem up there,
23399620	23404420	okay, because if it's generating heat, that shows that that connection has too much
23405700	23411780	resistance, because resistance generates heat, so you could analyze, you know, with thermal
23411780	23416660	imaging, really see a picture of physically what's working, what's not working, so that's an advance
23416660	23422580	that's taking place really, within the past decade, thermal imaging now is pretty much mainstream,
23422580	23428340	you know, it's not that, heck, you could get a non-contact infrared, you could get one
23429940	23436420	Harbor Freight tools, you know, from 1995 to later, and that would have shown you what, you know what
23436420	23441460	I mean, I had used to burn my fingertips finding the hot chip, okay, now you could just use one of
23441460	23446100	those and say, oh yeah, this chip is hotter than all the others that are doing the exact same job,
23446900	23452660	where the failure is, power is measured in watts, watts is what power is measured in, it's not a
23452660	23459540	question, it's a statement, power is literally the product of current and voltage, current times
23459540	23468660	voltage, any questions on power, you were saying that to determine the total voltage drop, any
23468660	23474420	component is a different formula than what it would be to calculate power, but in the book it says
23475380	23477460	no, no, I'm just saying
23478900	23485220	how much power is being consumed across a component, you need to use that voltage drop
23485220	23488660	across the component, not total voltage value
23492100	23499700	go ahead and take a 13 minute break and we're going to start off again at 635, 635
23499700	23511140	chapter 8 dc the circuits, dc circuits, one of the things that you need to understand about
23511140	23519700	this chapter is it's the concepts that we're going after, we want you to understand the basic
23519700	23524820	concepts, you're not going to make a lot of money necessarily going out and working on circuits like
23524820	23530740	this in industry, circuits that are made up of a power source and a bunch of resistors, but what
23530740	23540020	this is designed to do is to show you an approach on circuit analysis, we are going to use circuits
23540020	23547380	that contain a bunch of resistors in industry and those resistors are going to be used to establish
23547380	23556260	voltage operating points around transistors or other semiconductor devices, so although you're
23556260	23561940	never going to go out necessarily work on circuits exactly like this you have to absolutely,
23561940	23570580	positively understand the steps and the competencies of circuit analysis as it pertains to dc circuits,
23570580	23575460	okay that goes without saying and quite frankly we've already talked about these concepts,
23575460	23581220	this is just the chapter where we pull it all together, after completing this chapter you're
23581220	23588100	going to be able to solve for all, now let me emphasize the words all, unknown values, that
23588100	23596020	means voltage, current, resistance, and power, all we solve for everything because if you know
23596020	23600740	everything I could never ask you anything that you don't know because you know everything,
23601140	23610660	in series circuits parallel and series parallel circuits, understand the importance of voltage
23610660	23617460	dividers and design and solve for all unknown values in a voltage divider circuit,
23619860	23624100	we are going to spend time on voltage dividers, some of the stuff I'm going to blast through,
23624100	23628340	but voltage dividers are something that I'm going to spend some time on the board here to make sure
23628420	23633860	you got a handle, it's quite frankly the book is okay but the author really drops the ball
23633860	23637700	with voltage dividers, he pulls a couple numbers out of the air that I still don't have a clue
23637700	23643620	where it comes from so I'm going to show you how to approach that, as you know a series circuit
23643620	23649700	is a circuit that provides only one path for current flow, the simplest example of a series
23649700	23653380	circuit, you ever have those holiday lights, the Christmas lights that a bulb burns out and the
23653380	23659700	whole string goes out, it's a series circuit, because the filament of one bulb interrupts
23659700	23667940	the flow of current to all the other bulbs, series circuit, if you've got a string that one bulb
23667940	23672740	burns out and maybe 10 other bulbs go out, what does it tell you about those 10 other bulbs,
23672740	23679780	they're all in series, the whole string may be a combination circuit but that individual section
23679780	23688100	that went out is in series, so there's a lot of lessons behind looking at festival lighting
23688100	23694260	and when it goes out what exactly is taking place there, factors governing the operation are the
23694260	23699940	same current flows through each component, literally the same current, the same electrons,
23699940	23704500	they only have one path to go, that's from negative to positive so they have to travel the entire route,
23705300	23710340	total resistance in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistances,
23711460	23719940	right, this is what chapter 3, 4 review, right, you got resistance, you add it up in series,
23720820	23728100	always additive and that includes the resistance of a bad solder joint, the resistance of a bad
23728100	23732820	splice, remember how I said the power company, the voltage company will actually use thermography
23732820	23736900	and look and say wow we've got a splice up there and it's generating a lot of heat, we've got to
23736900	23741700	shut that section down and replace that because it shouldn't be generating any heat if it's a good splice.
23746180	23750340	The total voltage across a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage
23750340	23755860	drops, meaning total voltage is equal to voltage across component 1 plus the voltage across component
23755860	23760180	2 plus the voltage across component 3, this is a review, this is the same thing I quote,
23760180	23768260	you could quote me, right, I love it when you quote me, right, voltage rise equals voltage drop,
23769060	23780420	okay, so here voltage rise ET or VT if you prefer equals voltage drops, ER1, ER2, ER3,
23780420	23785780	those three voltages better equal what I put into the circuit, if not you got a problem,
23786500	23789540	if you find where the missing voltage is you probably found the problem,
23790740	23796180	where was the missing voltage, where was it, oh it was on a bad splice, oh okay, you fix that
23796180	23804020	problem, boom you're up and running. The voltage drop across a resistor in a series circuit is
23804020	23810020	proportional to the size of the resistor, meaning the bigger the resistor, I'm talking about in ohms,
23810020	23816660	I'm not talking about physical size, the more ohms the less current, the more ohms the higher
23816660	23822980	the resistance the bigger the voltage drop across that resistor, I always think of a resistor, remember
23822980	23829780	how I used Seattle traffic flow as an analogy, right, a big resistor is like a big accident,
23829780	23832740	if you just got a fender bender is that going to slow the traffic down, yeah,
23833540	23837460	fender bender they pull over the side, people start, you know, slow down or whatever,
23837460	23844260	now you got a three five three five car pile up, it's a big accident, that's a big resistance,
23844260	23849860	a big resistance is going to create, I gave it away already, a big backup, a big backup is a
23849860	23854660	big difference in potential, a bunch of people here that want to get to work at a bunch of people
23854660	23860980	here on the other side of the freeway that, an empty freeway basically, that's a big difference
23860980	23870500	in potential, okay, I love flying in my airplane over traffic jams, as a matter of fact being a
23870500	23877140	pilot owning an airplane, being stuck in a traffic jam drives me freaking nuts, like why am I stuck
23877140	23882020	in this traffic jam, but from the air it's so obvious, where there's an accident or a problem,
23882020	23887220	because all the traffic's backed up and then just a few cars are making it through, difference in
23887220	23899220	potential, big resistance, make sense, it's a mistake, that's for parallel, you sure that's
23899220	23914020	not parallel you're looking at, typo, typo, yeah, total power in a series circuit or parallel circuit
23914020	23919940	or complex circuit, power's additive, pt is equal to pr1, pr2, pr3, pr4, just add up all the power
23919940	23926100	and that's going to give you your total power, the bottom line, you want the bottom line or you
23926100	23933060	want the bs, bottom line, in a series circuit the most important thing to remember about a
23933060	23940900	series circuit is current is constant in a series circuit, period, the second most important thing
23940900	23950420	to remember about a series circuit, series circuit is also synonymous with voltage divider, when I
23950420	23954660	say series circuit I want you to think current's constant, I want you to think voltage divider,
23954660	23958340	that's just how I want you to look at them, and if you're not looking at them that way, you ain't
23958340	23964260	looking at them right, Houston we're going to have a problem, okay, those are the most important
23964260	23969940	things, I'm going to have you repeat that back to me in the future, do not deceive me, okay, remember
23969940	23979460	that stuff, the most important thing in a series circuit is current is constant, why is it constant,
23979460	23985460	it's only got one path to flow so it better be constant, the second most important thing about
23985460	23992980	a series circuit is a series circuit is also known as, right, aka, like in police lingo, aka also
23992980	24003140	known as a voltage divider, voltage divider, in this particular circuit, I mean I look at it,
24003140	24008660	and yeah I've been doing this since puberty, but I look at this and what do I see, I see a voltage
24008660	24014340	source and three voltage drops, voltage rise and three voltage drops, three loads, I don't know what
24014340	24021060	they are, but I know these loads are connected in series, and I know that all the current that
24021060	24025620	flows out of the negative terminal of my voltage source has to travel this complete path,
24027140	24032580	no place else for it to go, so the current's going to leave the negative terminal of the battery,
24033780	24036660	it's going to make this corner, 90 degree corner at the speed of light,
24038340	24044660	this is cool stuff ain't it, the speed of light, come on down through here the back stretch, hit
24044660	24052980	resistor 3 and create a voltage drop, a difference in potential, current's going to finally make it
24052980	24059700	through that obstruction, another 90 degree corner at speed of light, come up here to R2,
24060900	24064900	it's going to create another voltage drop, because there's another obstruction, there's
24064900	24069940	more resistance here, current's going to continue on, another 90 degree corner through R1, another
24069940	24074420	voltage drop, this voltage drop, this voltage drop, this voltage drop have to equal this voltage
24074420	24079700	rise, if anything's missing you got a problem, find where it's missing and you found your problem,
24084500	24094980	power additive, resistance additive, what else is there, so anytime you've got, the other way I
24094980	24098980	want you to look at it is anytime you've got one way into a circuit and one way out, what does that
24098980	24107780	tell you, it's a series circuit, it's a series circuit, because I cannot, I cannot show you
24107780	24113220	every possible series circuit ever invented, if you've got one way in and one way out it's a series
24113220	24119700	circuit, even if it's one component, one component, could that be series, yeah, one way in, one way
24119780	24128740	out, it's series, right, right, to solve for values in a circuit in order, the first thing I recommend
24128740	24135620	you do is try to solve for that total resistance, once you determine RT total resistance in the
24135620	24147620	circuit, then try to solve for total current in the circuit, IT, once you know IT, then you could
24147620	24153620	determine what your individual voltage drops are, right, so solve for your total resistance,
24155940	24160020	total resistance with your total voltage will show you how much current you're allowing into this
24160020	24165860	circuit, current flowing through the circuit, encountering the resistance, v is equal to i
24166740	24172340	times r, the total current, the same current that travels the entire path, times the amount of
24172340	24178580	resistance there is in a circuit, so this is going to drop a portion of that voltage,
24178580	24184020	this is going to drop a portion of that voltage, this is going to drop a portion of that voltage,
24184020	24189140	these three portions better equal the voltage that's put into the circuit.
24189860	24198980	In regards to the slide previous to this, uh-huh, this one, yeah, it doesn't say
24200100	24207780	on the slide series or parallel, so these will, will they primarily cross out between the two
24207780	24214100	applications? Yeah, but I gotta warn you, this here is just like generic, this is like generic,
24214820	24223700	and the thing of it is, is when you get out into industry or in lab, I may give you this,
24223700	24232500	I may give you this, I may give you this, but this is encased in epoxy, you can't even get to it,
24232500	24235700	you can't even get a part number off of it, you can't even take a reading of it,
24236660	24242100	so you're gonna have to use these laws and say, well, see, I remember Joe said that this is equal
24242100	24246820	to this plus this plus this, I know what this is, I know what this is, I know what this is,
24246820	24251860	but I don't know what this is, so then you could say this minus this minus this, the remainder
24251860	24257380	is equal to this, and it's a safe assumption because you're using a law, Kirchoff's voltage law,
24257380	24261300	basically to determine what the unknown is, and if you're using a law in industry
24262980	24267940	to figure out what part you need to buy, whose money you need to spend, it's a pretty safe
24267940	24273700	assumption, I mean it really is, so that's why we're teaching you this, so don't necessarily use
24273700	24277860	this as a checklist and like, oh yeah, I took copious notes, I listened to what Joe Grinnekat
24277860	24284500	said in lecture, I went home this weekend to try to do my homework and it didn't work because I
24284500	24289060	couldn't determine total circuit current because I didn't know what this value was because Joe
24289060	24293460	didn't say sometimes we might not know what this value is or we need to find it on the internet
24294420	24300740	off of a data sheet from a manufacturer, so the bottom line I want all of you to realize with
24300740	24305140	these circuits and analyzing the circuits, you always need to find at least two bits of information,
24305140	24308580	if I only give you one piece of information you're not going to be able to get very far,
24308580	24313940	but if you could extract two bits of information then you could reminipulate these three to suit
24313940	24322260	your needs as long as you get the right answers, make sense? Okay, parallel circuits, I might as
24322260	24325940	well get the cat out of the bag right from the get go, parallel circuit's the most important thing
24325940	24331940	you need to remember about a parallel circuit, is voltage is constant across a parallel network,
24332580	24336580	voltage is electrical pressure by being constant across a parallel network, what am I talking
24336580	24340820	about? I'm saying that that voltage can be constant across all components that are connected in
24340820	24346100	parallel, your house is wired in parallel, the freaking voltage coming out of the outlets better
24346100	24354180	all be the same, if not you got a problem, you got a problem, voltage is constant across a
24354180	24359220	parallel network, most important thing you need to remember, so when I say that what's most important
24359220	24363380	thing about a parallel circuit like church you all repeat after me, voltage is constant across a
24363380	24370820	parallel network, okay? The second most important thing about a parallel circuit is that a parallel
24370820	24380420	circuit is also known as police lingo aka also known as what? If a series circuits a voltage
24380420	24386020	divider what's a parallel circuit? It's a current divider, divides up current, some of the current
24386020	24389860	goes one path, some of the current goes the other path, remember the Seattle traffic pattern last
24389860	24395780	week? Was I here with talking to you folks about that or was it somebody else? Was it a dream I had?
24395780	24402660	I had a dream, it was about current and that's what it is, so some of the current's going to take
24402660	24406660	the 90, some of it's going to take the 520, some of it's going to take the north end of the lake,
24406660	24414420	some of it's going to take the south end of the lake, make sense? I've been a commuter for 20 years,
24414420	24420660	I know Seattle traffic, I've gotten out of here and gotten out of 990 and driven eastbound
24420660	24428500	to get the Tacoma, the highway 18, just so I could avoid traffic, so I know a little bit about
24428500	24435300	traffic, look at these circuits like that. Factors governing the operation of a parallel circuit,
24435300	24443140	the same voltage, the same voltage, not an equivalent voltage, the same voltage exists across each
24443140	24450900	branch of the parallel circuit and is equal to that of the voltage source, so literally this is
24450900	24454180	what we're literally, this is what we're up against, total voltage is equal to voltage
24454180	24458340	across component one, it's equal to voltage cross component two, it's equal to voltage cross
24458340	24466420	component three, it's not only mathematically equal to, it's the same pressure, I'll show you
24466420	24474900	in the schematic, same pressure. In that, in and of itself, will help you solve problems.
24475940	24480820	If you know something's in parallel, you could assume, if it's connected in parallel, I should
24480820	24485700	have the same voltage across that. Well, gee, the thing's still not working or it's working kind of
24485700	24491540	goofy, it's hard to get to, well sometimes you have to remove that access plate, access panel,
24491540	24496100	go in there and take the reading, holy cow, everything else in parallel is at 12 volts,
24496100	24501620	this is only at 9 volts, I'm missing 3 volts, you find I'm missing 3 volts, you found the
24502420	24509620	problem, it's that simple. One of the most powerful tools, how many of you here like tools?
24509620	24514340	I got tools, I got like every tool known to man in my garage, just ask my wife, she'll tell you,
24515060	24519620	okay, I like tools. One of the most powerful tools in your box is this stuff right here,
24520580	24524980	the second most powerful tool you're going to have is the digital multimeter, because the digital
24524980	24529780	multimeter is going to allow you to get out there and find the missing 3 volts, find the
24529780	24534340	missing 3 volts, found the problem, found the problem, you save the day, you save the day,
24534340	24539940	hit your boss up for a raise, he gives you a pink slip, cut you loose, just kidding,
24540820	24547860	you get a promotion, life is good, make so much money, get married, start a family,
24547860	24552980	get a girlfriend on the side, it's all good, and I don't mean that.
24557060	24563060	The current through each branch of a parallel circuit is inversely proportional to the amount
24563060	24572340	of resistance of the branch, I is equal to E over R, I is equal to E over R, so that means
24572900	24579860	because R here, that means E over R, right, E over R, we use the slash here, but that means
24579860	24585540	that this is on the bottom of the slash, so whatever we do to R is going to have an opposite
24585540	24593220	effect on I, we call that an inverse proportional relationship, an inverse proportional relationship,
24594660	24599300	so for resistance increases, current decreases, bigger accident, less flow of traffic,
24600100	24606500	smaller accident, traffic flow increases, plain and simple, so keep that in mind,
24607540	24612820	the value of least resistance in a parallel circuit will have the highest current flow through it.
24614820	24619860	The total current in a parallel circuit is the sum, literally the sum of the individual branch
24619860	24628260	currents, that's why we call parallel circuits current dividers, thank you current dividers.
24630180	24634180	The reciprocal of the total resistance in a parallel circuit is equal to sum of the
24634180	24639700	reciprocals of the individual resistances, this is a fancy way of saying when we put
24639700	24646500	resistors in parallel with each other, we actually add up the, the reciprocals, we add up the
24646500	24652660	conductance of those, of those pads, not the resistance of those pads, and the conductance
24652660	24660180	of those pads literally is the reciprocal of the resistance, and as Simon came up with, right,
24660820	24669780	that was his whole trip. The other formula that I want you to be aware of, and I know some of
24669780	24674740	you are resistant, reluctant to use it, it's a product over some formula, if you've got two
24674740	24682100	resistors or two resistances of parallel, use the product over some formula, product means
24682180	24689700	R1 times R2 divided by the sum, R1 plus R2, and it's a real easy way, I mean it's what's the,
24689700	24694980	you know, you got a half inch nut that you need to get loose, you know, you could either use,
24694980	24701460	you know, the box end wrench, or you could use your teeth, use the easiest tool, the easiest tool
24701460	24705540	is the product over some formula, well that's another formula we got to memorize, don't memorize
24705540	24711460	these formulas, use them and learn them, you understand the difference, memorizing stuff
24711460	24716500	never worked for me, I mean that's always my fear that I'm gonna get pulled, that's why I don't drink
24716500	24720500	and drive, because like I get pulled over, even if I haven't been, or you know, if I'm not totally
24720500	24723940	under the influence, they're gonna ask me to do the ABCs, and I'm probably gonna screw that up,
24724660	24728820	they're gonna throw me in the husk out because I don't know my ABCs, because I never really
24728820	24734420	memorized them, I kind of like learned them, saying backwards, I mean have you do that crap,
24734420	24739780	can't freaking do that, what the heck are you doing, while hopping on one foot, you know,
24739780	24745220	recite the alphabet backwards, no man officer, with all due respect, let's see you do that,
24745940	24753060	huh, geez, you're killing me, total power consumed in a parallel circuit is equal to
24753060	24757060	some of the power consumed by the individual resistors, no mystery here, we just talked about it
24757060	24769220	last chapter, power is always, that's beautiful, correct, if you only have two components in
24769220	24774900	parallel, two or more, you got to use your favorite formula, the reciprocal of the total
24774900	24778180	resistance of parallel is equal to some of the reciprocals of the individual resistances,
24779620	24782980	a lot of people like that one more than mine, mine is only good for two,
24784500	24790580	also with that don't forget your thumb rules, remember your thumb rules, right, if it's equal
24790580	24795860	resistance, you simply count up the number of resistors, that value of resistance and divide
24795860	24800100	it by that number, if I have four 100 ohm resistors in parallel with each other, what's the total
24800100	24811780	resistance, four 100 ohm resistors in parallel with each other, 100 divided by equals 25 ohms
24811780	24820260	of resistance, the other thing for resistors in parallel, the total resistance will always be
24820260	24827860	less than the value of least resistance, it'll always be less than the value of
24827860	24832500	least resistance, thumb rules, okay, you pay attention to those thumb rules, your GPA is
24832500	24837060	going to increase drastically, because you're going to have something to check yourself against,
24837060	24840180	I don't know if I use the right formula, but I remembered you always said the value of least
24840180	24843300	resistance will be less than the value of least resistance, my answer meets that,
24843620	24850340	I'm comfortable with that answer and stick with that answer, power is additive, it's a parallel
24850340	24854260	circuit, remember I always said voltages constant across parallel network, that's because this
24854260	24859300	electrical pressure being exerted by this source is distributed equally across these three loads,
24859300	24864500	period, it's the same, it better be the same, if it's not we got a problem,
24866420	24872900	if it's not we got a problem, where's the missing voltage, this is how your house is wired,
24872900	24878740	in parallel, the outlet in your bathroom better have the same voltage across as the outlet in
24878740	24883300	your family room as the outlet in your garage, if not it's not wired properly, something's up,
24888340	24893220	I got a big circuit like this at home, because I do everything big, that's how I roll,
24894260	24899300	I made some significant improvements to my backyard about 10 years ago, my backyard used to come out
24899300	24906020	and used to drop off a hill and it was just an unusable backyard, I wanted to like do stuff back
24906020	24914020	there, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, so I was looking at, I had to build a
24914020	24920660	retaining wall, pocket big bucks to put in a nice retaining wall, so I was looking at different options
24921380	24927460	and I like to utilize the resources that are available to me, so I have a good friend of mine
24927460	24934100	that worked for the railroad, Burlington Northern, and I said hey, you know you guys use those railroad
24934100	24939220	ties, what are the chances of getting some of those railroad ties, what are you talking about,
24939220	24943380	all like a truckload, those are hard to come by Joe, I ain't what it used to be,
24945060	24948500	so for like three years I kept hitting them up for railroad ties and wasn't getting anywhere,
24949060	24954020	and we had a great relationship, finally he said something, he was kind of hitting around about
24954100	24959540	going for an airplane ride, you know, it's hitting me up for an airplane ride, and finally, and I'm not
24959540	24964980	the quickest study, the smartest guy out there, sharpest tool in the shed, I finally like oh,
24964980	24969300	I get it, so I gave him a call like hey Larry, what are you doing Monday night, you know,
24969300	24973940	want to go for an airplane ride, pick them up in Arlington and we went out over the cascades,
24973940	24979700	beautiful sunset, whatever landed, right, that Wednesday my cell phone's ringing, hey Joe,
24980020	24983860	still want those railroad ties, yeah, I got clearance not only to give you the railroad
24983860	24988740	ties, but I got clearance to use a Burlington Northern crane to load them on a truck for you,
24988740	24993380	okay, you just got to get the flatbed, so I went out and rented a flatbed, I drove literally,
24993380	24997460	it was funny it's a Burlington Northern, but it was a yard up in Burlington, so I had to drive
24997460	25003700	all the way up there, he loaded them on 148 ties, long story short, I built a beautiful retaining
25003700	25009300	wall, I actually had a former student of mine that was an engineer, he designed a wall for me,
25010340	25016340	you know, did the prints and everything, built this wall and landscaped it, beautiful, so now I
25016340	25020900	have a backyard, my neighbors, they weren't digging it, because now they're looking at like, you know,
25020900	25026020	he's got a perfect yard, we still, you know, there's like a wall, you know, railroad ties,
25027540	25031540	funny part of that story too, that entire, I built that by hand, 148 ties, I don't know if you've
25031540	25037460	ever picked up a railroad tie, they are heavy, I built that by hand, back filled it by hand with
25037460	25043460	a wheelbarrow, gravel, drainage by hand, you know how much weight I lost that summer, zero,
25044180	25048980	probably had something to do with the pizzas and beer I was consuming while I did it, but anyway,
25049540	25054020	what I wanted to do is I wanted, when it was all landscaped and everything, in the process,
25054020	25059700	before landscaping, I wanted to put in low voltage lighting, low voltage lighting around the perimeter,
25059700	25064740	so you know like these, the goofy lights you stick in and you know, but I wanted to put in conduit,
25064740	25071860	I wanted to do this right, and as a pilot, I kind of want that almost to look like a runway,
25071860	25076180	and you know, in airport, you know, the lights around the periphery, so I use these low voltage
25076180	25081220	lights, I had a big power supply in my garage and equipment rack, dug conduit all the way back,
25081940	25086580	did my calculations, and the other thing about calculations, determining what size wire you
25086580	25091460	should use, the kind of wire that I use is the kind that falls off the back of a truck, you know,
25091460	25095940	and the kind that contacts provide me with, so I went with this gauge of wire, it was a little bit
25095940	25099940	substandard, but you know, I was like, ah, the math kind of works out and it's kind of good,
25099940	25105860	so I've got all these low voltage lights, and ironically, ironically, I came out nice, came
25105860	25112820	out really, really nice, nice backyard, but I could tell, if I brought you back there, you
25112820	25118500	probably wouldn't, you probably wouldn't even notice it, but I could tell which light is the
25118500	25126340	furthest from the power supply, just looking at it, and it kind of bothers me, it doesn't bother me
25126340	25132740	enough to rip up the conduit and pull new cable, okay, but I know, I know by looking at it, and
25132740	25141220	what does that tell me? That tells me that the load furthest down the line is not getting the
25141220	25148660	same voltage as the load closest to the source, and gradually as you get further away from it,
25148660	25150740	you just notice a little difference in illumination.
25155300	25158020	Yes, that's my whole point. Why, it doesn't it?
25158900	25173300	I needed, I needed to use basically a heavier gauge of wire in doing that, if I had done that,
25173300	25177380	then I could, yeah, there's ways of faking, soldering, what are you doing out there? I'm
25177380	25182740	soldering in resistors to these other laps, why'd I get it? My wife would probably finally really
25182740	25187700	give me the boot, but it bothers me, it bothers me because I'm, I'm, I like doing things right,
25187700	25192660	and I guess I did do it right, because you know how much that wire that I used cost me,
25192660	25198740	you know, literally fell off the back of a truck, so you know, don't, don't judge me. I have a friend
25198740	25201940	that's a police officer, I asked him, I said, you know, what's the whole deal like if I got
25201940	25205860	something that fell off the back of the truck? He like sat up, and he's like, you know, I'd like,
25205860	25210340	I'd love to drive the, cite the driver for driving an unsecured load, you know, so.
25210340	25216420	Anyway, so this is a parallel circuit. Now, yes.
25221780	25225540	You know, that's one of the other things I was kicking around, can I stick an inert gas in there,
25225540	25230980	and, and you know, increase the, the dielectric properties, and you know, she'd throw me out,
25230980	25237060	man, she'd throw me out. And you know what, I know you find it's hard to believe, maybe you won't,
25237060	25243060	but I actually have a nitrogen bottle at home, doesn't everybody? And I don't necessarily use
25243060	25251140	it for welding. Series parallel circuits, this is the easiest part of this entire chapter.
25252100	25256340	Circuit thick, it's just about series and parallel circuits. To solve most series parallel circuits,
25256340	25261300	simply apply the laws of rules of each type. There's no mystery, there's no silver bullet,
25261300	25266500	there's no easy way for me to describe it to you. Use series formulas for the series parts of the
25266500	25272740	circuit, use the parallel for the parallel parts, period. That's all it is, that's all the series
25272740	25277780	parallel circuit is, that's what it looks like. R2 and R3 are in parallel with each other.
25278820	25285540	You got to solve for that before you could solve the total resistance, because R2 and R3, one of
25285540	25291860	things that I like to do is identify these points right here, these are called nodes. I'm going to
25291860	25298020	call this node A and node B. The resistance between node A and node B is equal to the parallel
25298020	25306980	resistance of R2 in parallel with R3. I'd use the product over some formula to determine what RAB
25306980	25314340	is. Follow what I'm saying, RAB, the resistance between node A and node B. The total resistance
25314340	25322660	in the circuit is equal to R1 plus RAB, that's what equals total current, excuse me, total
25322660	25328980	resistance. Total current can be determined by that. Once I know what total current in the circuit is,
25328980	25332100	total current is going to create a voltage drop across this resistor.
25334420	25339540	Total current is going to create a voltage drop across this resistance.
25339540	25349300	The resistance I'm talking about is the resistance of AB, which is the combination of two in parallel
25349300	25355140	with three, make sense? So once you do that, it's just easy to slice and dice. The worst thing is,
25355140	25358580	is when you see, I mean, you know, obviously we gave you some problems with the assignments of the
25358580	25365460	book that are, you know, take time for you to solve. But the first thing you got to do is, is break
25365540	25371380	it down. The other thing too, is if I had a resistor in series with another resistor here,
25371380	25377940	I'd need to solve for these two first, because they're in series with each other, but in parallel
25377940	25384500	with this. So then I need to solve for this section of the circuit, which is in series with this
25384500	25391860	section of the circuit. So, you know, a lot of students get frustrated
25394340	25399780	and think there's a checklist they could follow or a protocol. No, you just got to pay attention to
25399780	25405860	the individual laws and rules that we established, but there are no two circuits alike. One of the
25405860	25410980	things that I've heard over the years of teaching here, I got a lot of new students that come and,
25410980	25415300	or quite frankly, a lot of people, they're working in industry already, and they want to come in,
25415300	25422180	and they want to learn how to read schematics. Joe, if I come to your program, can I learn how
25422180	25428980	to read schematics? Well, yeah, but we don't have a schematic reading class. There's no schematic
25428980	25435460	reading class. And quite frankly, I wouldn't want to have a schematic reading class, even if I could
25435460	25439460	fill the schematic reading class, because you wouldn't learn anything. What are you doing here by
25439460	25446660	studying this? You're learning how to read a schematic. You're learning to differentiate between
25446660	25451220	those sections of the circuit that are in parallel with each other and those sections that are series
25451220	25457700	components. Later on, when we talk about transistors right now, those of you in the full-time program
25457700	25463060	did a component ID test today to be able to recognize different types of components. You're
25463060	25469140	going to see what happens when we put a transistor, a diode, a capacitor, different components in
25469140	25478340	different configurations. If I put a capacitor in series, all as it is, is a capacitor in series.
25478340	25483140	It's still a series circuit, and everything that we've talked about this week still applies.
25484340	25487220	There's going to be some things that are going to be a little bit different with a capacitor in a
25487220	25492740	circuit. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but it's still a capacitor connected in series.
25493860	25498180	And there's really only three types of circuits that you're ever going to deal with in your entire
25498180	25506580	career, and that is series, parallel, and complex. So if any of you this week have been grunting,
25507700	25518420	groaning, outside, weeping, gnashing your teeth, you know what? It's all right, because once you
25518420	25524980	master series, parallel, complex, there's nothing else I'm going to throw at you. There's nothing
25524980	25532020	else that Peter's going to throw at you. Now that being said, we're going to have you look
25532020	25537300	at some complex circuits in the future, and you know what? You will deceive me. As much as you
25537300	25542500	could pass this test on series, parallel, complex circuits, you're going to forget about it in the
25542500	25546900	future, because we're going to give you some schematic to read that's got some different
25546900	25551620	components on it, or it's got some components drawn at weird angles or something, and you're
25551620	25558340	going to get your freak on, and you're going to say, boy, they never taught me that. I don't know
25558340	25563620	what to do. You know what you do? You fall back to the basics. The only circuit you're going to
25563620	25568820	encounter in industry are series, parallel, and complex. And if it's complex, what laws do you
25568820	25572740	use? Those are series and parallel. You just got to figure out which components are in series,
25572740	25577140	which one are in parallel. I can't say it any stronger. If it's in series, there's one way in,
25577140	25583060	there's one way out. If it's in parallel, that means there's interconnection of all the components.
25584500	25584980	Make sense?
25588500	25594340	Voltage dividers used to set a bias or operating point of various active electronic components.
25594900	25601060	We use voltage dividers to create the voltages that turn on transistors and integrated circuits.
25601380	25607860	They're used to divide a higher voltage to a lower voltage, and this process is often called
25607860	25616340	scaling, because what are we doing? Voltage rise equals voltage drop, or voltage drops.
25617540	25623940	So voltage drops will always be a fraction or scaling of the total voltage that we apply to the
25624500	25626500	circuit. Does that make sense?
25629860	25633220	We're going to use Ohm's Law to solve that. That's the current through his circuit. I'm not done
25633220	25638020	with voltage dividers. Trust me, I'm not done. I'm done when the screen goes black. Now, no,
25638020	25641860	I'm not done when the screen goes black. Then I'm going to show you some stuff on the board,
25641860	25646820	so sit tight. That's not my spiel on voltage dividers. Ohm's Law to current through a circuit is
25646820	25651700	directly proportional to voltage across the circuit, inversely proportional to resistance.
25651780	25659060	Ohm's Law, i is equal to e over r. Current division, current is directly proportional to voltage
25659060	25663220	across the circuit. If a voltage increases, current increases. If a voltage decreases,
25663220	25671140	current decreases. The voltage drop is equal to the percentage of the dropping resistor to the
25671140	25675700	sum of the dropping network. You know what? I'm giving you this formula. If you dig math,
25676100	25683620	great. If this confuses you, just tune me out. Because everything could be solved with Ohm's
25683620	25689380	Law and Watts Law. If you dig math, this is another tool in your box. Let me show you how this
25689380	25696340	thing works. If I want to calculate out my voltage drop across a load, across a resistor,
25697300	25707380	this voltage is going to be equal to my voltage source multiplied by the voltage drop
25707380	25715300	divided by the voltage total. Let's keep this really, really simple so we can understand how
25715300	25724180	this formula works. If I've got two 100 Ohm resistors, if I have two 100 Ohm resistors
25724180	25729380	in series with each other. I want to know what voltage I'm dropping across one of those.
25730580	25734260	I'm going to draw that. You know what I'm talking about? I should be able to use words because the
25734260	25738740	test I give you, the quiz, is going to be words. That's why I try not to draw too much on the board.
25738740	25742660	I'll draw some stuff on the board, but I want to draw too much because I, Joe, all week you've been
25742660	25746740	drawing stuff on the board and then you ask me a bunch of words. You've got to pass the quizzes
25746740	25765220	and their words, word problems. But if I've got this, if I've got this and I've got 100 volts,
25765220	25772980	let's keep this real simple. What this formula is showing me is what is our drop here?
25776980	25793620	V drop is equal to voltage total times our drop over our total.
25795860	25799060	Okay, so let's take a look at that. Voltage total is going to be
25799700	25807940	100 volts times our drop, which is one of these voltage drops, whichever one you're trying to
25807940	25815140	calculate for. Let's say it's this one. It's going to be 100 divided by, what's my total
25815140	25827860	resistance in a circuit? 200. Okay, what's 100 divided by 200? What is it? 0.5. 0.5. What does 0.5
25827860	25842820	mean? What percentage? Half. It means 50%. So 100 times 50% equals what? 100 divided by 0.5. What
25842820	25847220	does it equal? 50 volts. We could do this one in our head. That's why I want you to do this in your
25847220	25852420	head so you understand the formula. You understand how the formula works? So if you know what this
25852420	25857620	value of total is and you want to calculate out, let's say that I went ahead and I changed this
25857620	25869380	now, that this is 500 ohms and this is 100 ohms and I'm asking you what voltage is going to be
25869380	25877140	across this voltage drop here. 100 divided by 5, basically 1.5. 1.5. What percentage is 1.5?
25880260	25885860	2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20%. So that means 20% of my voltage is going to be dropped across this.
25886740	25895220	If 20% is being dropped here, actually no, right? Because this is 100 over 600. So what percentage
25895220	25900740	is that? I was off on my math. I'm sorry. You guys were buying it, man. I want to be your banker.
25904980	25913620	What's 100 divided by 600? Because total resistance is 600. 17. So basically 17%
25914340	25919700	is going to be dropped right here. 117 volts is going to be here. The remainder is going to be...
25922340	25926340	Where's the remainder voltage going to be dropped? This is an easy question. Right here. It's got to
25926340	25933700	be because this plus this has to equal this. Does that make sense? So this is just another formula
25933700	25939540	for those of you with mathematics. One other tool. I like tools. Just ask my wife. I've got every
25940260	25944500	tool. There's another tool for you. So if I'm giving you... I could sit here all day long and tell
25944500	25948260	you how much voltage is dropped here, how much is here. It's a lot easier to use this formula.
25948260	25951620	Although you could calculate the same thing using Stray Ohm's law. It's just going to take you a
25951620	25960420	little bit longer to get to the answer. Make sense? All right. In summary, a series circuit provides
25960420	25965860	only one path for current flow. Series circuit formulas include IT is equal to IR1, equal to IR2,
25965860	25973460	equal to IR3, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RT is equal to R1 plus R2 plus R3, et cetera,
25973460	25979940	et cetera, et cetera. Voltage. A series circuit is also known as a voltage divider. So therefore,
25979940	25984820	the sum of the individual voltages must equal source voltage. I is equal to E over R. Well,
25984820	25989540	that's Ohm's law. Power is additive in a series circuit. Power is additive in a parallel circuit.
25989780	25997700	A parallel circuit provides more than one path for current flow. Parallel circuit formulas
25997700	26005300	include IT is equal to IR1 plus IR2 plus IR3, the reciprocal formula for resistance. Voltage
26005300	26010100	is constant across a parallel network. Again, I is equal to E over R. If you want to calculate
26010100	26015380	how much current is flowing through an individual path, and power total is equal to PR1 plus PR2
26015380	26020100	plus PR3, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Series parallel circuits are solved by using
26020100	26023300	series formulas for the series parts of the circuit. Parallel formulas for the parallel
26023300	26028980	parts of the circuit. We talked about voltage dividers, more to come. And we talked about
26028980	26034260	current division, process of, excuse me, process of current division in a parallel circuit.
26034260	26039380	Any questions on this? Okay, let's talk about voltage dividers.
26039940	26048020	Kind of get emotional when I talk about voltage dividers. It's kind of like your first real
26048020	26052260	circuit that really does something. Trust me, it'll be good.
26056980	26060420	But I need some help, though, because we've got some electronic experts in here.
26060420	26066980	I'm going to need some help. What kind of a circuit would I use to divide voltage?
26068980	26072580	Series. You've got three to choose from. Multiple choice answer.
26072580	26076340	Series circuits, parallel circuits are complex circuits. The correct answer is ding, ding,
26076340	26082340	ding, ding, ding, series. Okay? So a series circuit is also known as a voltage divider,
26082340	26085860	right? Y'all believe me? Okay, so let's go ahead and draw that.
26091300	26103380	This is a voltage divider. Any questions?
26108580	26113300	Unfortunately, this is a voltage divider, but unfortunately, this isn't going to do much for
26113300	26118740	us. This will do a lot for us, but if we effectively want to use it, it really can't be
26118740	26124500	represented like this. It can't be represented like this. First of all, we got to ask ourselves,
26124500	26130580	why would we want to divide up voltage? We want to divide up voltage, like I said in here, to power
26130580	26136980	transistors, to power integrated circuits, to power different types of loads, to power different
26136980	26150820	types of devices. Make sense? Okay, so let's say as an example that I have a 48 volt power supply.
26151540	26159620	This is a big rack mounted power supply that sits there and drones. It puts out 48 volts DC,
26160100	26168500	but I've got some different appliances that I want to power from it. Okay? One of the devices that I
26168500	26183940	want to power from it is a 12 volt radio, a simple 12 volt radio. Okay? And that 12 volt radio is a
26184020	26192820	citizen band radio, CB radio. So what I need to do is I want to connect that radio
26195540	26204740	to this resistor right here and have this resistor produce 12 volts across it. So when I go out
26204740	26211620	here and connect my radio, which I'm going to represent, anybody know a symbol that I could
26211620	26224660	use to represent a radio? What's that? R. Yeah, yeah. There's no special schematic. What I'm
26224660	26230660	going to do here is I'm going to draw a resistor and that represents the load
26232580	26237380	that a CB radio has. And I'm going to connect it in parallel.
26237700	26245060	Do you agree that that's in parallel? So whatever voltage is here is going to be right here. Okay?
26245060	26251060	When I did this, I just changed the dynamics of the circuit. I just changed the dynamics of the
26251060	26256740	circuit. What I just did is I just loaded the voltage divider. So we're going to call this a
26256740	26261780	loaded voltage divider now. And quite frankly, a voltage divider in and of itself without any
26261780	26267300	the loads connected to it's kind of stupid. So you guys, guys, if you had read ahead and you
26267300	26270580	really had mastery of it when I'm showing you the voltage divider, you could have said,
26270580	26274260	Joe, that's stupid. What are you going to do is put three resistors, divide the voltage. What
26274260	26280020	good is that? Okay? What you got to do to make it viable is connect the load to a loaded voltage
26280020	26283060	divider. This is a real circuit. We're really going to do something here. We're really going to
26283060	26291700	power a CB radio. Okay? So to figure out, we know that this is 12 volts because the manufacturer
26291700	26295620	just said this is a 12 volt CB radio. You plug it in your cigarette lighter, you could wire it
26295620	26302900	into your car, and you too could be breaker breaker 1-9. Makes sense? So we know the voltage
26302900	26312580	is going to be 12 volts. The other piece of information that is critical for us is we have to
26312580	26323860	know how much current is required by the CB radio to operate properly. So what we're going to do
26323860	26343540	over here, okay? P-I-V. Okay? I know that the CB radio, a typical CB radio, is about five watts.
26345780	26351060	And I know that that CB radio, because I got the box, and the salesperson at Radio Shack,
26351060	26355540	we know how smart they are, said I could wire it up into my car. It's a 12 volt system. Okay?
26355540	26362500	So this is going to be 12 volts. So how much current is going to be required to power that radio
26362500	26368660	when I key the microphone and I broadcast out five watts? By the way, that's the maximum you'll
26368660	26373220	ever consume in a CB radio. If it's a five watt radio, the maximum you're ever going to consume
26373220	26377300	is when you're transmitting. If you're just receiving, that doesn't consume much energy at all.
26377300	26384260	It's when you key that mic and transmit that you're going to start consuming the most power.
26384260	26390020	So I'm thinking worst case scenario here. Okay? So all we need to do here, right, with your calculator,
26391380	26405460	go five divided by 12. What do I come up with? 0.42, rounding off, right? 0.411, 0.416666.
26407380	26410740	All right? That's what I got. Everybody get that? Everybody saw I came with that? Okay?
26414660	26421700	That's assuming the radio is 100% efficient. You know what I mean? Like every ounce of current
26421700	26425540	is going into generating that, which there's going to be losses. How do I know there's going to be
26425540	26432340	losses? When I use the radio, it's going to get hot. All that energy is not going to get out the
26432340	26436900	antenna. If you get that working, you get all the energy, getting out the antenna,
26436900	26441940	give me a call. All right? I have my attorney contact. I personally fly at a bimini. I'll
26441940	26447140	set you up. Pour you your first cocktail. Okay? I'll set the tab up for you.
26450580	26455140	So what I'm going to do with this, just for the case of example, is I'm going to round this.
26455140	26462500	Generally speaking, a CB radio is going to take a minimum of half an amp at 12 volts,
26462740	26468420	a minimum half an amp. Probably it's going to be even more than that. But in order for it to
26468420	26473380	transmit out 5 watts, you see the math. Does everybody see the math? Okay. So I am going to
26473380	26486020	assume that this here is 0.5 amps. So we know everything about the CB radio now. It's a 12 volt,
26486020	26492260	5 amps, 5 watt radio. I feel pretty good about it. We can calculate out the internal resistance
26492260	26496660	of it if we want it to. I don't see the benefit of doing that now. We don't need to do that right
26496660	26508260	now. Make sense? Okay. Voltage divider. Voltage divider. I've got another device. I've got another
26508260	26514260	device. And this other device that I have is, by the way, we're not going to put this in your car
26514260	26520180	anymore. We're going to put this CB radio on my boat. Why I want a CB radio on a boat? I do not know.
26520180	26525300	It's a power thing, man. I want to talk with truckers because I'm going underneath the bridge. Ha-ha.
26525300	26531540	You start the traffic. I'm going underneath it. Ha-ha. I'm on my boat. Okay. I'm going to install a,
26532980	26538340	I'm going to install a radar system. And the radar system
26542580	26544900	that I could represent with a resistor
26545620	26554500	is going to be connected across these two resistors.
26557620	26564420	The voltage of my commercial radar system is 24 volts DC.
26568100	26570820	And it puts out 200 watts.
26575860	26583620	How much current is going to be needed to go through this device in order to transmit out 200 watts?
26583620	26593220	Again, if you get confused, draw the triangle, P, I, V, 200 watts divided by 24. What do you come up with?
26593540	26601220	How much?
26602580	26604100	0.12? 0.12?
26608260	26616340	How much? We got a big disparity here. That makes sense, right? If a half an amp can power a CB radio,
26617940	26622180	it's going to have to be more than a half an amp to power 200 watt transmitter, right?
26623380	26629300	Even at, even at double the voltage. So all's I got to do here is power is 200
26630980	26635540	divided by how much? What's our voltage? 24.
26645140	26647380	8.33? And that assumes what?
26647380	26653780	That assumes 100% efficiency. Do we get 100% efficiency out of this stuff?
26653780	26657620	To be honest with you, if we're lucky if some of this stuff operates at 80% efficiency,
26658260	26664900	20% of the energy gets consumed as heat. So just for the case of example,
26666020	26672660	I'm going to say that this thing really in order for it to work properly is going to need 10 amps.
26673460	26680660	And this might be what the placard data on the back of the radar says or the manual says,
26681300	26688340	okay? But you understand that which one of these are real? If you do the math, this number could
26688340	26692100	be good, this number could be good. And if that's the case, then we know that the answer is going to
26692100	26700100	be 8.33 amps. But in reality, because of the losses, because of the property of resistance,
26700180	26708180	we're probably going to be consuming really about 10 amps. Make sense? Okay. So now what I have
26708180	26713620	is a circuit, a viable circuit. And by the way, if I want 24 volts here,
26716180	26721700	and I am getting this voltage across these two resistors,
26723860	26727540	what voltage must I be dropping across this resistor right here?
26730740	26733300	How much? Why 12?
26736980	26744180	Yeah. And I am connecting this radar unit in parallel. I love it when you talk that way.
26744980	26751700	Parallel with these two resistors that are in a voltage divider network. Okay. So what we did
26751700	26757380	is we just built a voltage divider, a loaded voltage divider. But we've got to analyze it now.
26758340	26763380	We've got to analyze it. And this is where the author like pulled numbers out of his backside,
26763380	26766420	and he really didn't justify it. And I don't even know where that's coming from. That's why
26766420	26783460	we're having this lesson. Question? This, remember, this here, I bought this military surplus. This
26783460	26789540	is a 48 volt power supply. Okay. So it converts my ship's power to 48 volts DC.
26792740	26799860	Yeah. So if this is 48, and this is 12, and this is 12, what's this got to be? 24. Why?
26804820	26807540	Come on, guys. Quote me what I've been quoting you.
26807940	26813860	Rise has to, your drop has to equal the rise. Absolutely. Because the drops have to equal
26813860	26819620	the rise. I'm putting 48 volt rise in. I'm getting 48 volts a drop. 12 here, 12 here, 24 here.
26820420	26825620	All voltage drops present in the count of 4. Makes sense? Okay. So this is cool. It's really
26825620	26830340	going to work like this. But we don't know the math. We don't know what values of resistance
26830340	26834820	to use here. This is where it gets tricky. This is where there's another thumb rule.
26834820	26839380	It's why you come to lecture. Okay. If the book was that good, the book was that good,
26839380	26843060	you could be home in your underwear studying right now. And I could be home in my underwear
26843060	26847140	correcting your work. Instead here, I'm dressed up wearing lab coats, you're wearing lab coats,
26847140	26856420	and we're having this interactive lesson. The thumb rule is, you ready for this? The bleeder,
26857380	26866020	the bleeder current needs to be one-tenth of the total load current.
26868740	26875140	The bleeder current needs to be one-tenth of the total load current.
26879860	26885700	How many of you buy that? You better buy it. I just sold it to you. Now the question is,
26885700	26890980	what the heck is he talking about, bleeder current? The bleeder current is the current
26890980	26899460	flowing through the first resistor that starts the voltage division process. So by me saying that,
26899460	26904900	first of all, we've got to determine what is our total load current? What's our total load
26904900	26913220	current in this circuit? 28? 48? Total load current. Current is measured in
26914180	26920820	amps. What is my total load current in this circuit? 10.5. What? Pounds ounces, kilograms,
26920820	26926260	amps. I love it when you talk that way. Total load current is 10.5 amps. Everybody see how we did
26926260	26931620	that? The only loads in this circuit, this is a voltage divider. These are my loads. The only
26931620	26936180	loads in the circuit here are, what the heck was this, a CB radio? Breaker, breaker, 1.9, CB.
26937380	26944980	And then this was a radar system. Radar system consumes 10 amps. This consumes half an amp.
26944980	26953380	So my total load current is 10.5 amps. Do you all agree with that? Okay. So I said
26954580	26959460	the foam rule is that the bleeder current is one-tenth of the total load current. What's one-tenth
26959460	26979140	of 10.5? Okay. So 10.5 divided by 10, 10.5 amps. Do you all agree with that?
26981140	26988100	Get some puzzle to look. One-tenth of my total load. One-tenth of 10.5 is 1.05. Agree with that?
26988900	26994580	So that's how much current, I'm going to do something here to change the color to make it stand
26994580	27001780	out. Okay. It's going to be passing through this first resistor. Very good. Okay. And this is going
27001780	27013460	to be 1.05 amps. And again, that's where, where's that coming from?
27019220	27025220	So at least remember my, my deal. So right there, we just unlock the entire circuit.
27026180	27032660	We just unlock the entire circuit because what we've got here is 1.05 amps coming up out of this
27032660	27039140	node. How much current do we have coming up through here? Where'd that number come from?
27041780	27047460	Thank you. The paperwork. Okay. Or your calculation based on, if the paperwork left out the current
27047460	27051060	demand, you know it's a five watt radio. And again, as long as you can prove it,
27051700	27057220	got to be able to prove it to somebody. Okay. So we called that 0.5. So we've got 0.5 amps
27059300	27060260	coming up through here.
27062900	27068260	All the current that comes up through the radio is going to come here into this node right here.
27068260	27075300	So I got 0.5 amps coming in from this angle. I got 1.05 coming in from this angle. Can any
27075300	27084900	tell me about how much current's going to be going through this? How'd you come up with that?
27091220	27094740	And how'd you come up with that? Is that just, is that, is that a notion?
27095940	27102420	It's a current divider. It is a current divider. Okay. But again, what's going to bring tears to
27102420	27109140	my eyes is if you quote me laws. Are there any laws that govern what's happening here in this node?
27109140	27115620	What is it? Absolutely. Kirchoff's law. I got 1.05 coming up here. I got 0.5 here. We got
27115620	27119220	a traffic cop standing in the middle of that intersection. How much current's driving away
27119220	27129380	from them? 1.55 amps. It's got to. It's got to. If this thing's functioning, it's got to work like
27129380	27137140	this. So I've got 1.55 amps coming up through here. Okay. How much current is coming up through
27137140	27150260	this load? How do we know that? Plackered data, technical documentation, calculation utilizing
27150260	27157780	Watt's law. I don't know. Because Joe said so. Actually, I didn't. All I gave you is that 24 volts
27157780	27165300	in the 200 watts. You folks really calculated that out. The only curveball that I shot you in any of
27165300	27171380	this was the efficiency bit. I'm talking about efficiency. The book doesn't even talk about that.
27171380	27176980	But you just, you don't get 100% of anything. You don't. There's nothing that's 100% efficient.
27178500	27184020	So I got 10 amps coming up through my radar system. That means that 10 amps makes a 90 degree corner at
27184020	27202340	the speed of light. Okay. 10 amps. 11.55 amps. How'd you get an extra amp with Watt?
27208020	27212260	What was the rule here? What was the whole thing on unlocking this entire circuit?
27212340	27214260	What did I call this resistor? The
27216260	27221060	bleeder resistor. And that's what's starting the whole process. We have to have some current going
27221060	27226580	through that to create. And the reason that we use 1.10, so is that these loads come on and offline?
27226580	27230660	The circuit's going to have stability because that CB is not always going to be on. And when we
27230660	27235940	turn the CB off, we don't want the whole circuit to go cattywampus. We want it to be somewhat
27235940	27241060	balanced. Same thing with the radar system. So it's a thumb rule. It's not an absolute. It's a
27241060	27247380	thumb rule that should give us consistency of operation for this circuit. Makes sense?
27248100	27251380	So we know that we have 11.55 amps coming up through here.
27252340	27257380	Boom. If I've got 11.55 amps flowing into my power supply, how many amps must I have flowing
27257380	27267780	out of my power supply? The same. Okay. So that means I've got 11.55 amps flowing into this node.
27267780	27274100	If I've got 11.55 amps flowing into this node and 1.05 amps flowing out of this node,
27274100	27279940	how much current do I have flowing in this direction? How much?
27283140	27290580	10.5 amps. Do you agree with that? If I've got 10.5 amps flowing
27290580	27295700	into this node and I got 0.5 flowing in this node, how much current am I going to have flowing
27295700	27304020	in this direction? Isn't that the same number we started off with?
27304020	27309700	So I just prove that this works. I just traced all the current through this circuit in doing this.
27309700	27314580	Now, the easy part of the analysis,
27320340	27328180	VIR, let's calculate out resistance, voltage over current. Voltage over current, right?
27328820	27337700	Voltage 12 over 1.05. 12 over 1.05 is going to give me this value of resistance. R is going to be equal to
27339700	27367220	11.428 ohms. That's what I came up with. Are we going to find a 11.428 ohm resistor?
27370020	27377460	Can we find something close? Maybe we could find one with tolerance as a 10 ohm resistor that's
27377460	27382420	on the high side, 20 percent tolerance. We could find one that's within that, right?
27382420	27387620	Because a 10 ohm resistor could be anywhere from 12 ohms to 8 ohms. So yeah, we might be able to
27387620	27396100	find something close to that. It's not going to be that critical. You're going to get less
27396100	27402100	of a voltage drop there because that is kind of critical. The bigger the resistor,
27402100	27407540	the bigger the voltage drop. The smaller the resistor, the smaller. So we could do the same
27407540	27422820	thing up here, right? 12 volts divided by 1.55 amps, 7.7 ohms, and then finally here up at the top,
27422820	27437300	24 divided by 11.55, 2.08 ohms.
27446180	27449140	And this is how you analyze a loaded voltage divider.
27453060	27462180	It's really nothing unique. All we did is apply Ohm's law, Watt's law, Kerchoff's law.
27464180	27466820	You know, one of the other things that's kind of fun that I could do with this circuit,
27466820	27471300	I think it's fun. You'll probably think I'm horrible for doing that kind of stuff.
27482820	27511300	What is it?
27513300	27518580	It's the exact same circuit. And to be honest with you, this is how this thing would really be
27518580	27524740	connected. This is how it'd be really connected. Your 48 volt power supply would be connected to
27525860	27531700	what kind of ground? Electrical ground. Not necessarily earth ground, electrical ground,
27531700	27536580	which is typically a chassis ground or a frame of a vehicle or a boat, the hull of a ship,
27537540	27544020	the frame of a train car. This is how it's going to be done because we're going to use the frame
27544020	27548980	as a conductor. Circuits are going to operate exactly the same. We're going to get the
27551940	27556660	bottom of the circuit here, the bleeder resistor, connect that also to ground, chassis ground.
27557860	27563460	We're going to connect the negative lead of our radio directly to chassis ground. We're going to
27563460	27569060	connect the negative lead of our radar. The radar's kind of out of an unusual position, you know?
27569060	27572580	I got that, you know, the pulpit up there, I drive the boat, I want the low radar there.
27572580	27576100	So I'm going to have to run quite a bit of cable, but I'm still going to connect it to
27577140	27583620	chassis ground. And this is the exact same circuit that you just analyzed. I just made it more
27583620	27589140	complex, complicated looking by putting these grounds in. Basically, when you see this in a
27589140	27597140	circuit, you know that electrically all of these are interconnected. Don't let me screw you up with
27597140	27604740	this kind of stuff. And it's assumed that you know how to interpret this type of stuff. Questions?
27619620	27622980	10.5 divided by 10.
27625620	27632580	One tenth is 10, right? One tenth is 10. Make sense? 10.5?
27636660	27640820	1.05. You can multiply it by 0.1, you get the same answer.
27641140	27649380	Another question? No? Questions?
27652580	27656660	So you could sit here, and again, that's a thumb rule, but you could use it for analysis.
27656660	27659940	And then if somebody asks you, how the heck did you come up with that? How did you, what,
27660740	27664660	you want me to buy these parts? Well, how'd you come up with that? Well, I used it as a thumb rule
27664660	27668900	that I want my bleeder current, okay, as opposed to the author, who just, again, I don't know where
27668900	27672580	those numbers came from. I don't know, I don't want to know, it is what it is.
27675220	27679780	So in the future, use that one tenth. I use that one tenth, you're not even going to get the,
27679780	27683300	I mean, you'll get the, you won't get the answer that the author gets in the book.
27683940	27687700	I don't know what, you got to do it wrong to get the number that the author gets in the book.
27688340	27692900	So there's, in the future, when you see loaded voltage dividers, use that one tenth rule,
27693700	27698500	unless you're told otherwise. You know, there might be an engineer that knows a lot more
27698500	27704500	math than we know. They say, no, we want you to assume 15%, or 20%, or whatever.
27705700	27711700	But you need some guidance. We're not engineers. Guys, remember that? You know that? We're not
27711700	27717700	engineers. Anybody here want to be an engineer? Honestly? No offense, honestly? Okay, if you
27717700	27721940	want to be an engineer, that's, you know, that's good. You're going to immerse yourself more in
27721940	27725940	the world of theory. We immerse ourselves more in the world of reality.
27726580	27731940	So we're going to do what we're told to do. Actually, I had a meeting today with an engineer,
27731940	27736180	we're looking at some engineering, starting some engineering classes here at Lake Washington,
27736180	27740260	a parallel program to pursue your engineering degree. And the way he was talking about it,
27740260	27744260	too, like a pyramid. It's like a pyramid. You get to research science, a handful of
27744260	27748500	research people up here at the top of a pyramid. Then you've got engineers designing this stuff.
27748500	27753380	And then you got technicians making the stuff work. So there's a lot more technician jobs out
27753380	27759780	there to support engineering. And the engineering supports R&D. You know, Boeing only has a handful
27759780	27766100	of people that sit around and think about weird crap all day long. Thank God, right? Because then
27766100	27770500	what they do is they farm it out to the engineers and say, hey, make this work. Make this work.
27771220	27774020	And then the engineers figure it out and the calculations and everything. And then they
27774020	27779380	give the technicians and they say, make this work. And then we are the last line of defense.
27779380	27786180	And the only thing that we have to fall back on are the laws of physics and the theory of operation.
27786180	27789620	That's all we have to fall back on. And if you're going to apply that, then you're going to be ahead
27789620	27799940	of the game. So no question about it. No question about it. This actually worked out pretty well
27799940	27808420	for us with last week doing seven and eight and then saving chapter nine for this week.
27809780	27813220	Because that's the only thing that we're going to do tonight is going to be chapter nine,
27813780	27820340	magnetism. And this is a huge chapter. I don't think there's any other property that has
27821140	27827860	had such a profound impact on society as magnetism, as you're soon going to see.
27828500	27835300	I mean, if it weren't for the property of magnetism, electronics and electricity would not be
27835300	27843060	what it is today. It's really that simple. So with that introduction, let's forge ahead with
27843060	27847700	chapter nine, magnetism. After completing this chapter, you're going to be able to identify
27847700	27855460	three types of magnets, describe the basic shapes of magnets, describe the difference between
27855460	27860900	permanent magnets and temporary magnets, describe how the earth functions as a magnet,
27861540	27868980	state the laws of magnetism, explain magnetism based on the theory of atoms and electron spin,
27869700	27876020	explain magnetism based on the domain theory, identify flux lines of their significance,
27876660	27882340	define permeability, describe the magnetic effects of current flowing through a conductor,
27882980	27888180	describe the principle of an electromagnet, describe how to determine the polarity of an
27888180	27896420	electromagnet using the left hand rule, define magnetic induction, define retentivity and residual
27896420	27902100	magnetism, define a magnetic shield, describe how magnetism is used to generate electricity,
27902660	27907460	state the basic laws of magnetism, describe how the left hand rule for generators can be
27907460	27912820	used to determine the polarity of induced voltage, describe how AC and DC generators
27912820	27918260	convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, describe how a relay operates as an
27918260	27923700	electromechanical switch, discuss the similarities between a doorbell in a relay, discuss the
27923700	27929780	similarities between a solenoid in a relay, describe how a magnetic phonograph cartridge
27929780	27936260	works, describe how a loudspeaker works, describe how information can be stored and retrieved using
27936260	27943860	magnetic recording and describe how a DC motor operates. I don't think we've had any chapter
27943860	27950020	up to this point that has had so many objectives and this just shows us the far-reaching hand
27950020	27957060	of the property of magnetism. It's everywhere. All the magic that's done in today's society is
27957060	27968020	brought to us really by magnetism. I'm not bragging about it. It's really what takes place.
27969540	27977860	Magnets. There's really several different types, three types. Natural magnet is derived from
27977860	27985540	magnetite and it just so happens that I've got a couple pieces of magnetite in my pocket.
27985540	27991140	These are natural magnets. It's like found in the earth's crust. Here it is. We'll pass this
27991140	27998660	around and we'll let you play with polished magnetite. That's kind of cool stuff.
27999620	28003140	So that's found in the earth's crust and it's just a natural magnet.
28003140	28009540	Artificial magnet could be created by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a piece of magnetite.
28009540	28016100	So if you've got a piece of soft iron and I see underneath what the heck are you doing under there,
28016660	28023140	I'm creating an artificial magnet by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a piece of magnetite.
28023140	28026980	And what it's going to do is it's going to pull that magnetic property off of the magnetite and
28026980	28033540	transfer it to your piece of soft metal. Actually, that's a trick with a lot of mechanics. If you
28034340	28039540	magnetize the tip of a screwdriver, it comes in handy for picking up things that you drop
28040180	28047220	into odd places. Finally, the third type of a magnet is an electromagnetic magnet.
28047220	28053220	This is created by current flowing through a coil of wire. Basically, when we pass current
28053220	28059380	through a coil of wire, we're going to develop a magnetic field. And in concentrating that,
28059380	28064180	that's how we have an electromagnet. So electromagnets range in size from very,
28064180	28069380	very small to, if you've ever seen like at a junkyard, a scrapyard, on a crane,
28069380	28074180	they've got an electromagnet. You turn it on, it like, you know, picks up a car or whatever.
28074180	28079940	Actually, my favorite application, I'm a big James Bond fan. Remember that Jaws dude? It was like,
28079940	28084260	you know, like biting things, like train cars and stuff. And you know, they turned on the big
28084260	28089940	electromagnet, boom, pal. You get pulled right up to the ceiling on that. So that was a giant
28089940	28097940	electromagnet. I'd hate to have your credit cards anywhere near that as your credit cards have
28097940	28105140	magnetic strips on it and a strong electromagnet will probably desensitize those cards. Here's
28105140	28111700	some examples of some magnets coming variety. It's my personal collection. Just kidding. This is
28111700	28118820	torrid core, meaning it's a donut shaped. It's circular. This is a standard bar magnet. This
28118820	28123140	would be like a horseshoe magnet because it kind of looks like a horseshoe. The thing to remember
28123140	28128260	is that all these magnets are going to have a north pole and a south pole, even that magnetite
28128260	28134660	that we're passing around there. If you try holding it unusual, it won't even attach each other.
28134660	28140660	Basically, the reason that those four pieces of magnetite are attracted to each other is because
28140660	28145540	the north pole is attracted to the south pole of the other magnet, which is attracted to the north
28145540	28151220	pole, the south pole of the other magnet. North and north ain't going to work. Permanent magnets
28151220	28158340	retain their magnetic properties. That's why they're called permanent magnets. Temporary magnets
28158340	28163940	are only going to retain a small portion of their magnetic properties. That's why they're called
28164020	28171380	temporary. Over time, that magnetic field may deteriorate or be altered. Permanent magnet
28171380	28177700	will retain the magnetic properties. Now, this is kind of cool, and I'm sure it's no surprise to
28177700	28186340	any of you. The earth is a giant freaking magnet. It has to do with the core of the earth and then
28186340	28196020	the crust. We basically have a giant north pole and we have a giant south pole. The problem about
28196020	28201060	the north pole and the south pole, I got to give you a geography lesson here. If I wanted to go
28201060	28211220	find Santa Claus, where would I look and how would I get there? How could I navigate my way to this
28211220	28219540	place? With a compass, and where am I trying to get to? Okay, so you want me to use a compass
28219540	28226100	to try to get to the north pole to try to find Santa Claus? To get to the magnetic north pole.
28226980	28232420	If I get to the magnetic north pole, am I going to find Santa Claus? No, nowhere to be found.
28232980	28237060	In order for me to find Santa Claus, what am I going to have to do? I'm going to have to go to the
28237540	28248820	north pole, or the north geographic pole, which is literally the top of the earth.
28250660	28253940	Anybody want to take a wild guess what the best way of getting up there might be?
28256500	28256980	What's that?
28259460	28261540	Well, I'm talking about means of transportation.
28261940	28278420	Submarine. Yeah, you could be in a short sleeve shirt and go up there, surface at the north pole,
28278420	28282340	because it's underneath the Arctic Ocean. So you could surface at the north pole.
28282340	28288020	So I just happened to flaunt that. I actually have never been to the north pole. My submarine has
28288020	28295460	been to the north pole. At home, I've got water from the north pole in a vial from my submarine
28295460	28299060	that went to the north pole. My submarine actually delivered, believe it or not,
28299060	28305220	Al Gore to the north pole. It was after I was off the sub, but they did a mission
28305220	28312020	and went to the north geographic pole. Typically on the ice, they've put a lot of research camps
28312980	28319140	to conduct research, magnetic research. I mean, that's the place to do it.
28319860	28326100	So the north magnetic pole is, this is this illustration. It's an artist depiction. It's
28326100	28333700	not very accurate. The north geographic pole is going to be somewhere up here up north of Labrador,
28334740	28340980	and it moves about two kilometers per year, and it's actually moving in a northwestern lead
28341060	28347940	direction. And the variance, the magnetic variance. Anybody know the magnetic variance?
28347940	28352260	The difference here between the north pole geographic pole and where the north magnetic
28352260	28358260	pole is? I know because I'm a pilot, and it's kind of important, okay? Because if I start flying
28358260	28363620	northbound or whatever, which am I going geographic north or am I going magnetic north?
28363620	28369460	And the difference here in the Seattle area is between 19 and 20 degrees difference.
28370020	28377300	It's pretty significant. So this hallway right out here in this wing is aligned pretty much with
28377300	28381860	the north geographic pole. If you could walk straight, which none of us could do, we've got
28381860	28386580	a dominant leg, and you walked out this hall and just kept walking north. Eventually you're going
28386580	28391620	to get to the north pole flying Santa Claus. It's all going to be good. If you had a compass and you
28391620	28398100	stepped outside the door here and you looked, that north magnetic pole is going to be literally
28398820	28403540	over in this direction here. So it's very important because again in the aircraft,
28403540	28411860	you've got a compass, you set your gyro compass for that magnetic heading. And I bet you folks never
28411860	28417060	realized magnetic properties had such a profound impact on all these different things. If any of
28417060	28428020	you are familiar with airports, airport runways are designated based on their magnetic heading.
28428900	28434580	So C-TAC airport, C-TAC airport's got three runways, but they're all parallel with each other.
28434580	28442500	So they all have the same numbers. If you're headed southbound, typically when we have crappy
28442500	28446500	weather here in Seattle, if you look up and you see an airplane going on the C-TAC, what he's
28446500	28452580	going to do is he's going to fly out over like Magnolia, then turn inbound, and then what he's
28452580	28460500	going to do is land on runway 16. Because if you rounded that, it's on a compass heading of 160.
28461380	28464820	So how do you make sure you're, you know, since there's three runways down there, because we
28464820	28468340	all remember those of us that have lived in the area a while, that third runway when they put
28468340	28476740	it in, it was very controversial. It's 16 left, 16 center, and 16 right. That's how they designate
28476740	28483140	which runway you're cleared to land on. Add 180 degrees to that, and you end up with what?
28484420	28495700	Runway, no, 16 plus 180 degrees, runway 34. So if you're landing northbound at C-TAC airport,
28495700	28503620	you're cleared to land on runway 34 center, 34 left, or 34 right. Okay. Ironically, and the
28503620	28509300	reason that they select runways is they do wind studies to determine where the prevailing winds
28509300	28514260	are. You want to take off into the wind, and you want to land into the wind. So primarily here in
28514260	28521060	central Puget Sound, that's pretty much how all the runways are. Auburn airport, 1634,
28521060	28530900	Renton airport, 1634. C-TAC, 1634. Boeing field is a little bit different. It's runway 31 northbound,
28530900	28537300	so there's going to be a slight variance in runway 13 in the opposite direction. That's just how the
28537300	28544500	winds are kind of funneled there by the location of Boeing field. But Renton airport used to
28546740	28553860	be runway 33, but because of that magnetic procession, what they've had to do is they've
28553860	28557060	had to renumber. Do you think, oh, it's no big deal. You send a guy out there with a can of paint,
28557060	28561060	and you paint the new number on the runway. It's not that easy. All of the procedures,
28561060	28565620	all of the approach procedures, all of the publications, all of the databases all have
28565620	28570740	to be updated. It's really a big thing. So eventually, all runways are going to have to
28570740	28575700	change their number as that north magnetic pole continues to fluctuate. Why am I telling you
28575700	28581220	this in an electronics class? A lot of you are going to go to work in industries that are associated
28581220	28586020	with electronic navigation. And you got to know this. I mean, you don't have to memorize it. I'm
28586020	28591460	not going to quiz you on this magnetic procession in the 1920 degrees variance here in Seattle.
28591460	28595140	But a lot of you are going to go to work in electronic navigation systems, and you need
28595140	28603140	to understand the difference between the two. Makes sense? The laws of magnetism. I think most
28603140	28609060	of you probably remember this from elementary school. Unlike magnetic poles attract each other,
28609060	28613460	right? Unlike a track. So north is going to be attracted to a south. The south is going to be
28613460	28619460	attracted to a north. Like magnetic poles repel each other. North and a north, they're going to
28619460	28624660	push each other away. South and a south, push each other away. This is actually kind of interesting
28624660	28632180	too, because it has some applications now, like magnetic levitation. Some of these rail systems
28632180	28636740	that they're actually, the whole train, levitates magnetically. That's how they're doing it. That's
28636740	28641860	how you get a whole train to levitate. Because north pole and the north pole, they'll basically push
28641940	28648020	each other away. And then once you've got something floating like that, it doesn't take a whole lot
28648020	28653060	of energy to move a train. I mean, think about that. That's, I don't know if you've ever even
28653060	28660420	thought about why do we use trains. I mean trains, that wheel on a rail, very little friction.
28660420	28667220	So it takes very little energy to move a bunch of stuff, right? If you could kick it up even a
28667220	28673220	notch further. I mean, we still have to overcome the friction of the bearings and the axle and
28673220	28678420	the wheels on the track. Now, if you could levitate the entire train magnetically,
28678420	28682820	then just give it a little push and that thing's going to be able to move with hardly any energy.
28682820	28688580	So these are a lot of the advancements that we probably want to stay tuned for, because in the
28688580	28695540	name of efficiency, we're trying to play with a lot of this stuff. Color code for magnets. Color
28695540	28702260	code for magnets. Red is the color code that we use for north pole. Blue is the color code that
28702260	28710980	we use for the south pole. So if we were going in search of Santa Claus and we got to the north
28710980	28716260	geographic pole, what, how would we know we got there? What would we see?
28716580	28724900	There'd probably be reindeer, but what color pole would there be?
28725780	28729700	Red and white, very good. Red and white pole. We know that. Candy cane, right?
28729700	28732100	If you were at the south pole, what color would the pole be?
28734580	28738980	Blue and white. Striped pole, right? I mean, if you got to follow that same tradition.
28740020	28743860	If you're outside a place that has a pole that's red, white, and blue, where are you?
28744820	28748340	Bingo. Excellent. Very good. I got students that just...
28750500	28753220	Same students that don't know what a barbershop is.
28755220	28758580	I like the barbershop. That's how I roll. That's my thing.
28759540	28764820	So yeah, that's the color code for magnets. Magnetism, the property of magnetism,
28764820	28772820	can be traced to the atom. As electrons orbit the nucleus, they also spin on their axis.
28773940	28781940	This electrostatic charge produces a magnetic field. So even these electrons are going to
28781940	28791300	have magnetic properties. The direction of the magnetic field is the same as the electrons'
28791300	28801620	direction of spin. So even at a subatomic level, we're going to have properties of magnetism.
28804100	28810100	Ferromagnetic materials, ferro, meaning materials that contain ferrite,
28810100	28816660	this is the stuff that will rust. If the metal will rust, it contains a high amount of ferrite.
28816660	28824420	So any ferromagnetic materials are materials that respond to magnetic fields. Any of you have
28825140	28832100	magnets at home stuck to your refrigerator? Your refrigerator is made out of a ferromagnetic
28832100	28838740	material. If it were not painted, it would rust, plain and simple. If not, the magnets wouldn't stick
28838740	28843700	to it. It's actually the old trick too, if you're going and buying a used car or whatever and you're
28843700	28849700	looking for Bondo, right? Put a magnet over it and obviously if it sticks, you know that that's
28849700	28854980	all original with no Bondo. You know, you all of a sudden get to an area and that magnet doesn't
28854980	28860580	want to stick. Don't try this with a Corvette. Of course, Corvette is a fiberglass. And actually,
28860580	28866580	with all the cars now, with all the plastic on them, magnets aren't going to stick well to plastic.
28868020	28875460	Atoms combine into domains or groups. When un-magnetized, the domains are random.
28875460	28879940	This is what we're looking at here in this illustration. This is random domains, okay?
28879940	28886180	This is an un-magnetized piece of ferromagnetic material.
28886340	28896340	As soon as we magnetize it, watch, this is kind of cool, boom. When magnetized, the domains align in a
28896340	28904340	common direction and the material becomes a magnet. So if you've got my magnetite that we're passing
28904340	28911620	around and you rub a screwdriver up against that, this is ultimately what's going to happen.
28911620	28915380	You're going to align those domains and it's going to become magnetic.
28918980	28921540	What would it do between a ferro and non-ferro metal again?
28923380	28929860	Ferro contains ferrite and that's the iron content that makes stuff rust, basically.
28935300	28940580	Now a magnetic field. A magnetic field. This is kind of where you got to hit the I believe
28940580	28949860	button, right? It's invisible lines of force that surround a magnet. These invisible lines are called
28949860	28956420	flux lines. We got to be careful because those of you in ELEC 115 are learning about flux, right?
28956420	28962420	It's a different kind of flux. There's two types of flux in electronics. There's magnetic flux that
28962420	28968980	we're talking about tonight and there's also flux that we use as a cleaning agent for soldering,
28969860	28974660	okay? You're not going to use a magnetic field for cleaning and soldering to the best of my
28974660	28980340	knowledge and magnetic field has never been used as a cleaning agent. Flux, however, is used as a
28980340	28986260	cleaning agent, different type of flux. So this word has two meanings in electronics and don't forget
28986260	28990180	one of the reasons that you're here is to learn the language of electronics. I wish I had had
28990180	28994660	me as an instructor because I was kind of like flux and I was like, why are we going to use magnetic
28994660	29001780	lines of force to clean something and make it more soluble? Nobody ever explained that to me
29001780	29007620	and I wasn't the smartest student. These flux lines have polarity and that polarity is north
29007620	29017540	to south, north to south and it always forms a complete loop. They do not cross each other
29017540	29030260	and they tend to form the smallest possible loop. Some of you may have done this like in
29030260	29036820	third grade. You've got a magnet, bar magnet, you've got a piece of paper and on top of that piece
29036820	29043780	of paper you sprinkle iron filings. The iron filings will actually form a pattern and that
29043780	29052020	pattern that you see is the invisible lines of force. It is the flux lines. That's exactly what
29052020	29060340	you're doing by spreading those iron filings on that is seeing the lines of flux as a visual aid,
29060340	29069540	if you will. Permiability, there's a new word for you, permeability is the ability of a material
29069620	29076980	to accept magnetic lines of force. An example of something that has a high level of permeability
29076980	29083300	would be your refrigerator at home if you've got magnets stuck to it.
29085700	29091300	My last refrigerator that I bought and you never, how many of you here like buy a refrigerator because
29091300	29096100	like you got nothing better to do and how many of you like buy a refrigerator because your food
29096100	29101540	is all spoiled and your old one died. I mean that's normally how you go about it. My last
29101540	29111620	refrigerator I was like in a panic and I found one and they never fit right. They've actually
29111620	29116980	made them bigger so if you want one to fit into the small hole you got to get a custom refrigerator.
29117860	29124980	A smaller custom refrigerator costs more than the big one that doesn't fit right. So I just got the
29124980	29129620	big one it doesn't fit right. It's bigger whatever but I get home and I paid a lot of money for this
29129620	29134420	thing and then I get my magnets and I got you know the magnets to put juniors work up on and
29134420	29138660	everything else and my favorite pizza place. Magnets won't even stick to this thing because
29138660	29143620	it's like this designer facade so you could, what the heck is this? I mean you know so you got to
29143620	29148100	put the magnets on the side. You got to put them on the side because the front is so that you could
29148100	29153940	make it you know I don't know. I just want something to keep my stuff cold. That's all I want.
29155540	29160900	So permeability is a material that readily accepts these lines of force.
29160900	29165620	If a magnet will stick to it it has a high level of permeability.
29167620	29172900	Now there's a direct correlation between electricity and magnetism probably why we're
29172900	29179060	talking about it tonight right in electronics program. A magnetic field is generated when
29179060	29189140	current flows through a wire period. Period. Let me say that again a magnetic field is generated
29189140	29196340	when current flows through a wire period. So when you plug something into an extension cord
29196340	29205700	is it generating a magnetic field? You bet you. When you have, when you connect a speaker up to
29205700	29210260	an amplifier and you've got current flowing through that wire to the speaker are you generating
29210260	29218660	a magnetic field? Yeah okay. Anytime current flows through a conductor you generate a magnetic field.
29219700	29224340	So if you could see magnetic fields and you had an energized piece of equipment you would see all
29224340	29228740	of these lines of flux that are being formed by simply turning a piece of electronics on.
29229700	29236340	By simply turning a piece of electronics on or an electrical circuit on you're generating lines of
29236340	29241300	flux. Sometimes it's something that we need to be aware of other times it's something we need to
29241300	29246660	discount. An example would be in your home okay. Typically how your house is wired up the magnetic
29246660	29252820	fields that are generated by your home are not sufficient enough to cause you any worries.
29252820	29258260	They're not going to demagnetize your credit cards. They're not going to you know screw up your
29258260	29265700	brain. You know it's but still they are generating magnetic fields. There's no way around it.
29272500	29277860	Yeah and again with some computer screens there's some higher frequencies that are used and I mean
29277860	29284100	it's the same thing. You know is it harmful or harmless? I don't know. There's also some laws
29284100	29290740	on the books about building schools underneath power lines. You know so if there was nothing there
29290740	29295940	why are there laws on the book about that? You know I've never had an interest of well my only
29295940	29301620	interest of living underneath a power line would be able to perhaps tap into that magnetic field
29301620	29306580	and lower my power bill which of course would be illegal and not above board and I would never do
29306580	29311060	that but I never really had a whole lot of interest of like living underneath power lines.
29311700	29317380	You know because it's just an unknown. You just you just don't know because those high voltage
29317380	29323700	wires they move a lot of current through it. I mean you create huge magnetic fields. I don't know
29323700	29328660	if you you realize this but there if you get a fluorescent tube and you go underneath a lot of
29328660	29332580	these high voltage wire you could you could excite the gases inside the fluorescent tube and light
29332980	29339700	look mom it's lighting up with no strings attached so if it could ionize gas inside a fluorescent
29339700	29344260	tube you know what's it doing to your you know I don't know about you you know but I've had a
29344260	29348500	pretty good life I got a lot of good memories I do not want to scramble those memories so I'm
29348500	29353460	going to keep my brain away from magnetic fields and anything else that will alter some of these
29353460	29371300	fond memories that I have from my youth so this is exactly what it would look like here
29371300	29377300	we have current flowing through a conductor and we're going to generate this magnetic field around
29377300	29393540	the outside um if the magnetic field is strong enough stuff would stick to it normally the
29393540	29400900	magnetic field is is not that strong so stuff won't necessarily stick to it like iron filings are
29400900	29406820	not necessarily going to be attracted you know to a low energy circuit that's energized but
29407620	29411700	that being said there's still a magnetic field there it's just not strong enough to
29411700	29418980	you know attract an iron filing you know to to stick to the circuit thank goodness you know or
29418980	29426420	whenever we turned anything on it would be you know now yeah it would it would have to be a
29426420	29431940	significant enough field to attract you know current to do that the current going through it
29431940	29436740	would have to be sufficient enough to create a big enough magnetic field to attract an iron filing
29438180	29444900	electromagnets composed of many turns of wire close together because as I as I just said one
29444900	29450420	piece of wire may not be strong enough what happens if you get that and then you wrap it around again
29450420	29456020	now you just doubled it you do it a third time you tripled it fourth time quadrupled it the
29456020	29461780	math is simple the math is is that simple so every time with a winding you add a winding you're
29461780	29467460	increasing it that magnetic field that you're generating by it so the principle of an electromagnet
29467460	29476660	when wire is twisted into a loop the flux lines are brought together the flux lines are then
29476660	29485300	concentrated at the center of the loop and we establish a north and south pole anytime you
29485380	29490020	create a magnetic field you're creating both a north pole and a south pole
29493220	29500100	the strength of the magnetic field can be increased three ways the more turns of wire the more
29500100	29504980	flux lines are going to be added together and concentrated the greater the current
29506420	29511620	the greater the number of flux lines that are going to be generated okay this only carries you
29511620	29516340	so far though because what happens you're passing current through what
29518900	29522500	a piece of wire what property does wire have associated with it
29523220	29530100	resistance so you just can't keep increasing the current because if you keep increasing the
29530100	29536260	current eventually what's going to happen it's going to become a fuse I mean even if the wire is
29536260	29540420	this thick you have enough current go through wire that's this thick eventually you're going to
29540820	29548500	part that wire okay and it's going to begin to get hot and so it could cause an electrical fire
29548500	29553940	so you just can't keep saying it let me take another step back you know what kind of wire
29553940	29559300	we're going to use to make these coils we're going to use what's called magnetic wire and
29559300	29566260	magnetic wire is not wire that's inherently magnetic magnetic wire is wire that's used to make
29566260	29573460	windings and what it is is thin copper wire but it has a a lacquer coating on the outside
29573460	29580420	there's an example right there outstanding that's magnetic wire okay and it looks like copper wire
29580420	29586340	and it is copper wire but on the outside is a thin lacquer coating that lacquer coating
29586340	29592820	acts as an insulator an electrical insulator to prevent the wire from shorting because if I wound
29593380	29598740	wire over itself why would current want to go all the way keep going through the wire it would
29598740	29605860	just short right out okay so we have to keep it insulated by by using that lacquer on it so
29605860	29609780	let's get back to this bullet statement here the greater the current the greater the number of
29609780	29614740	flux line generated I'm going to get to a point that I cramped so much current through that coil
29614740	29619540	it's going to begin to get hot if any of you have ever done paint removal you know that that
29619620	29624020	paint removal when you're using a heat gun works really really good for removing paint
29624020	29630500	it works good on removing lacquer too so once you ask have too much current go through that coil
29630500	29635300	you're going to compromise that lacquer coating and that's the end of your coil by the way if
29635300	29642020	any of you have ever smelt a coil that's the end of the coil by the time you smell it it's over
29642020	29648180	with you've already compromised the integrity of it it'll never work right again transformers
29648180	29654020	motors coils any of that stuff any of that stuff if you smell it if it gets that hot forget it
29655860	29664020	another way that we could increase the magnetic field is we could insert a ferromagnetic
29664020	29669860	core into the center of the coil usually iron iron has a high level of permeability
29669860	29674740	by putting it into the center of the coil and unwrapping the coil around it it's going to
29674740	29681060	enhance the magnetic characteristics so by putting in a ferromagnetic core it's going to enhance
29681700	29692820	the characteristics now magnetic induction is the effect a magnet has on an object without physical
29692820	29701700	contact the effect the magnet has on an object without physical contact this is the cool thing
29701700	29706980	and i think some of you were playing around even with these uh with these magnets here right
29706980	29710100	and how they're not even touching
29713780	29714340	but yeah
29717220	29721140	it's having an effect on the other magnet that's magnetic induction
29721300	29732420	on residual magnetism is the magnetic field that remains when an object is separated from a magnet
29738180	29741620	we used to have literally a big problem with residual magnetism
29743300	29747140	this is something that i might i don't know if any of you want to make a wild guess at this here
29747140	29753700	i'm thinking of a very very large object that developed magnetic properties
29756100	29760420	and those magnetic properties needed to be removed or it could compromise the position
29760980	29766900	of this large steel cylindrical object
29769220	29776020	submarine submarine big big big problem in submarineing
29776980	29783300	because the submarine being made out of a ferromagnetic material would pick up the earth's
29783300	29790260	magnetic field and gradually it would become magnetized and the problem was
29792260	29797940	there was equipment that would detect the magnetic anomaly so there's no way of seeing
29797940	29801940	a submarine and some of our submarines are so quiet you would never even hear the submarine
29802660	29808660	but if you're flying in an anti-submarine warfare aircraft and you pick up a magnetic
29808660	29817380	anomaly a large submerged contact that's creating a magnetic variation chances are
29817380	29825060	you found a submarine so this is exactly what if any of you ever go up around would be island and
29825060	29833780	you see those uh the big four engine turboprop aircraft p-3s no not those those are awaks those
29833780	29840020	are like airborne command posts the p-3 orion is a submarine hunter and off the back of it
29840020	29844980	you'll see like this little thing that looks like a stinger and that's what that is is called mad
29844980	29851060	gear magnetic anomaly detection so when you're flying around typically what they they just wouldn't
29851060	29857140	be looking for a magnetic anomaly what they would typically do is have a circular scan radar on
29857140	29863380	radar so when they stick up a periscope all of a sudden they get a blip blip if it's a good radar
29863380	29869620	operator that's all it takes are two two blips and then he'll shut the radar down so what they'll
29869620	29875620	do is they'll continue to fly and then he'll go to a sector scan okay so from a circular scan blip
29876260	29880660	blip then he'll shut it off then he'll get he'll he knows where he's looking for because he saw it
29880660	29886660	on the radar screen he'll go to a sector scan right sector scan is back and forth like this so
29886660	29892660	then off it's gonna be and then he'll shut the radar off and then he'll drive his cursor over to
29892660	29898260	where he had that contact and hit enter autopilot will bring the airplane to that point in the ocean
29898260	29903780	and then the operator is looking at the mad gear and then all of a sudden they start to get a magnetic
29903780	29910420	anomaly at that point they pop a flare out over the target if you're at war at that point the
29910420	29915700	aircraft is going to go into a bank start to open the bomb bay doors fly right over that point put
29915700	29920740	a torpedo in the water it's a smart torpedo it's going to find the target and blow it up that's how
29920740	29928020	you die in a submarine in a combat situation okay the only thing that we would know my job was to
29928020	29934260	detect that so i was good at picking up the blip blip but again the good guys the good operators
29934260	29940260	two sweeps two sweeps and they'd pick you up the british came out with a radar that basically 400
29940260	29945700	miles away could spot a beer can floating in the water so it's kind of like when i saw that technology
29945700	29949700	can't come out i'm like you know i think it's time for me to move on to a different career
29949700	29954660	because if this turns into a shooting war we're dead really quick you know really really quick
29955300	29961620	so to get rid of this residual magnetism um if any of you aren't the boating or fishing and you
29961620	29966500	ever have the opportunity to get on hood canal don't get too close to the submarine base because
29966500	29971060	they have gun boats and stuff and it's all restricted area but over at the sub submarine base
29971060	29976820	in banger they've got a giant pier it's a degausing pier and what they'll do is pull an entire trident
29976820	29983700	submarine into it and pull off that magnetic field and get it back to just an un-magnetized
29984420	29990260	piece of of steel but over time that magnetic field will build up again and it needs to be
29990260	29994980	stripped off periodically or you're going to have a real profound magnetic signature
29999700	30004420	correct yeah i told you i'd have to kill you
30007940	30011860	a lot of it depends where you operate to and what the magnetic you know i mean if you're doing a
30011860	30015620	lot of stuff up north and there's some stronger magnetic variants you're going to pick that up
30015620	30025540	a lot quicker yeah because then if you keep track of what boats go in and it begins to paint an image
30030500	30031540	earth's magnetic field
30031700	30037540	earth's magnetic giant magnetic field
30047860	30052660	and then again we see this manifest itself like with the aurora borealis if any of you
30052660	30058980	ever seen the aurora borealis i had the opportunity in february i went up to fairbanks
30059540	30066900	and they say that if you're up there between october and april for three nights basically you
30066900	30073060	stand a 90 chance of seeing the aurora borealis so we were up there for the flight up there we saw
30073060	30077300	him from the airplane the first two nights i mean it was it was phenomenal i mean we couldn't have
30077300	30081860	planned it any better because there was a huge solar flare and that's exactly that earth's magnetic
30081860	30088420	field is attracting the charged particles so as soon as they get the upper regions of the atmosphere
30088420	30094900	they ionize so literally it's like a neon light except that's in the sky so i should bring in
30094900	30098820	some pictures and show you i mean just it was breathtaking just phenomenal you're just standing
30098820	30106100	there minus 23 degrees um it warmed up the the week prior it was like minus 47 or whatever and
30106740	30111140	i seriously even though i had gloves on and everything i had to take off my gloves to manipulate
30111140	30116500	the camera i ended up burning the tips of my fingers and it took about a week for me to get the
30116500	30123620	feeling back and it's very very dangerous but way cool you know way cool to see this and you
30123620	30128740	know people spend thousands and thousands of dollars to go up there and and and see that
30130020	30136340	but it's the magnetic field it's actually attracting that near the poles retentivity
30136340	30142500	is the ability of a material to retain its magnetic field after the magnetizing force
30142500	30149540	is removed so unfortunately a submarine hull has a high level of retentivity and um that magnetic
30149540	30156020	signature you want to strip that off because it's not desirable to have a submarine magnetized
30157060	30163060	now magnetic shields are made of low reluctance materials they're used to protect electronic
30163060	30172260	equipment from magnetic flux lines okay sometimes we need to protect the equipment from these
30172260	30183140	lines of of flux um because they could cause interference or even worse um let me kind of
30183140	30188420	back up for a second and then see if you could connect the dots on this we all understand that
30188420	30198180	when we apply current to a conductor we create a magnetic field right so bear with me if we have a
30198180	30203380	magnetic field that happens to pass through a conductor what do you think we're going to do
30208020	30215220	i'm going to create current yeah so basically if current creates a magnetic field an electromagnetic
30215220	30220900	field can create current um this is one of the things that they kind of figured out the hard
30220900	30227780	way when we started lighting off nuclear weapons one of the side effects of a nuclear weapon
30228260	30236740	was an emp an electromagnetic pulse and this electromagnetic pulse was a giant magnetic pulse
30236740	30243860	that would go through the atmosphere and when it contacted came in contact with a conductor
30243860	30252740	it induced a current where current didn't belong fry radios back in the day when they first light
30252740	30259540	started lighting off nukes um basically we all use tubes and tubes are high voltage devices and
30259540	30265300	it would cause some interference and some wacky symptoms and that was about it with us going to
30265300	30271380	micro chips now and integrated circuits that amount of current is going to fry that's our
30271380	30276980	technical term for the night fry these circuits okay because we're dealing with minute amounts of
30276980	30282740	current to get the job done so all of a sudden you have an emp you're gonna fry stuff and um
30284260	30290180	quite frankly it really concerns me i know enough about this where you know basically if you had
30290180	30294580	you know everybody's afraid of a dirty bomb and everything and yeah that's that's really bad news
30294580	30302900	but i tell you what one strategically placed high altitude nuke going off over the central us
30302900	30308340	it's going to totally wipe us out and set us back into the stone age okay and it's the high altitude
30308340	30313540	ones that really screw things up because they're far reaching because of the line of sight and um
30313540	30319140	yeah i mean can you imagine a world you know in a world that your atm doesn't work in a world that
30319140	30326340	your grocery store which uses a computer to order new food and supplies from the distribution center
30326340	30332580	doesn't work your cell phones don't work your internet doesn't work your computers don't work
30332580	30337460	your car computers don't work the only people that are going to be driving around the old people
30337460	30342660	kick an old school diesel where you know compression and fuel and you've got the diesel engine running
30342660	30350900	okay science fiction no pure science this is how it works so um these magnetic shields are actually
30350900	30357700	used in some military applications for hardening the the sites because we know that this emp is
30357700	30362500	going to cause problems none of the consumer stuff that we use is hardened air force one
30363300	30368820	what the president flies around in is hardened okay they brought that down to kirtland air force
30368820	30374980	base outside albuquerque new mexico and that's where they do the cmp testing and basically prove
30374980	30380020	what it's able to withstand and again that's all really highly classified information um the same
30380020	30384980	thing with the autopilots the uh you know now it's all fly by wire technology
30385860	30391380	so this electromagnetic interference could cause big problems i don't know if any of you um
30392260	30396900	remember years ago there was a problem with the airbus well there's always been a problem with
30396900	30403380	airbus um just different problems as time progresses but this was the problem with airbus was
30403380	30410820	was with the a320 aircraft and the a320 was the first commercial aircraft to use what was called
30410820	30417300	fly by wire technology and it's actually funny i like messing with people um that are flying on a
30417300	30422980	lot of people don't realize that up in the cockpit there's no control yoke like this on an a320
30422980	30427300	they're flying with a joystick and you know the pilot's seat and he's got the instrument panel
30427300	30432020	in front and right off to his left here is a joystick and that's how the pilot captain
30432020	30439220	it's got his on the left the copilot's got his on the right so there was a um an air show that
30439940	30445460	they were doing a fly by and what happened is the the airplane came died to the you know the
30445460	30450580	symbolic low pass and then kept going and going and going right into the trees at the end of the
30450580	30454420	runway and there was a huge fireball and explosion a bunch of people got killed but there were a
30454420	30459940	bunch of people including the pilot that survived and he was like man he's i don't know what happened
30459940	30465380	you know i was pulling up the whole time the aircraft was not responding so in the in the
30465380	30470500	basically the investigation they determined at this big air show in europe there were military
30470500	30477540	aircraft that were present they had their high energy weapons fire control radars turned on
30477540	30482100	and they think that high energy got into the computers and basically put current where current
30482100	30487780	and it got confused so he's pulling up on the stick you know to pull up and you know dip the wing
30487780	30491300	and you know you know the maneuver at least i know the maneuver it's classic maneuver
30491380	30496180	instead he's pulling up and just right into the freaking trees you look that up on youtube
30496180	30502980	a 320 crash and you know they they they very well documented crash um they added a lot more
30502980	30509140	magnetic shielding to it um bowings first air planted dabble with fly by wire was the triple
30509140	30512980	seven and it was kind of a gamble military aircraft have used it for years but military
30512980	30516180	aircraft are kind of a different animal you know if you got a problem in the military
30516180	30520580	aircraft you know eject eject eject pow you punch out and you know you live to fight another day
30520580	30524980	in a commercial airliner you got hundreds of people behind you there's no eject eject eject
30524980	30529620	it's like you got to ride it out and you fix the problem so bowings first airplane with fly by
30529620	30534900	wire technology was the triple seven was the triple seven and believe it or not was kind of funny
30534900	30540980	because bowing opted for standard controls not the joystick they could have done the joystick
30540980	30544980	because basically the standard controls are controlling the equivalent of a joystick but it
30544980	30549540	makes a pilot feel like they're kicking at old school and uh they're not kicking at old school
30549540	30555140	it's they're still putting in inputs that create small currents to feed a computer and then the
30555140	30562020	computer controls the control surfaces of the aircraft so in a lot of cases like that suffice
30562020	30567380	to say you reckon bowings got some really good magnetic shielding on their flight control systems
30567380	30575940	fly by wire absolutely it's to prevent current from being where current doesn't belong in any time
30575940	30581060	there is a magnetic field you run the risk of putting current where current doesn't block
30583620	30590260	absolutely absolutely and that was actually one of the other problems too that bowing had you
30590260	30595220	know every commercial airliner statistically gets struck by lightning once a year so next
30595220	30598900	time you go on your dream vacation or whatever you got on that airplane suffice to say that
30598900	30604420	airplane was probably struck by lightning in the past year as bowing went to and for most
30604420	30608820	aircraft it's not that big of a deal because what happens is when an aircraft is struck by
30608820	30613060	lightning it follows what's called skin effect and that current passes over the skin of the
30613060	30617380	aircraft i mean it could scare the dickens out of you if you're on board it's going to be a big
30617380	30621620	you know and in some cases fireball coming through the cabin and you know it's going to scare the
30621620	30626100	dickens out of you but it's not going to bring the airplane down one of the manufacturing trends
30626100	30632100	now with aircraft though is not to build airplanes out of aluminum it's to build it out of composites
30632100	30640260	okay if you're using carbon they're not always using carbon they're just using various composites
30640260	30644500	so one of the things that they're doing on aircraft now especially control surfaces
30645380	30651220	flaps ailerons that control the role of the aircraft and such these would typically be made
30651220	30655700	out of composites so you get struck by lightning it's quite simple the lightning gets in there
30655700	30661140	has nowhere to go it blows the the the control surface apart not good if you're in the airplane
30661140	30664340	okay because now you're going to lose control because you don't have the ability to control the
30664340	30670260	aircraft anymore so Boeing actually started doing is that by put basically putting in a conductive
30671140	30678340	layer into the composites so that will allow current from a lightning strike a place to dissipate
30679060	30686340	so kind of get rid of the aluminum only to put a conductor back into the composite so it's still
30686340	30691460	highly efficient and lighter and stronger and everything else i guess lighter and stronger
30692100	30696340	i don't know when they fail they fail big but i guess aluminum when aluminum fails it fails
30696340	30703220	big too so i don't know i like kicking her old school electromagnetic induction is the principle
30703220	30707460	behind the generation of electricity and i think all of you know where i'm going with this because
30707460	30712500	we just talked about emp magnetic field passing through a conductor is going to induce current
30713220	30717860	current is produced when a conductor passes or is passed by a magnetic field
30718740	30724660	as the conductor passes through the magnetic field a deficiency of electrons is going to be
30724660	30730580	created this results in a difference of potential between the ends of the conductor
30731300	30736900	so again if you've got a long piece of wire you pass a magnetic field through it you're going to
30736900	30743860	induce current many years ago i think the space shuttle um conducted an experiment like that
30743860	30748740	and literally what they did is they trailed a long wire loop and what their goal was to try to
30748740	30754260	track it through the earth's magnetic field and see if they could you know generate current from
30754260	30760260	that um basically they vaporize the wire that's how much current they generated from the earth's
30760260	30765620	magnetic field so if there was a way of harnessing the earth's magnetic field as a generator you
30765620	30773220	know our energy woes would be over but i don't think there's a you know adequate way of of harnessing
30773220	30781380	it at this point basically trail the wire and pull it through the earth's magnetic field and vaporize
30781380	30788180	the wire so when the conductors remove from the magnetic field the free electrons return
30788180	30792340	to their parent atom so what we're doing is we're getting electrons to move in a conductor
30792340	30799300	by getting electronic electrons to move in a conductor we call that current call that current
30799300	30808820	so we're creating current faraday's law the induced voltage in a conductor is directly
30808820	30814980	proportional to the rate at which the conductor cuts the magnetic lines of force okay gonna make
30814980	30821460	this real simple if you'd understand faraday's law here okay envision up here that i have a big
30821460	30827620	north pole big magnet sitting here boom big giant and here i have a big south pole you all agree
30827620	30832100	that i've got lines of flux that are going from the north pole to the south pole and all that stuff
30832100	30836900	that i talked about earlier the straightest line the shortest distance right so in between here i'm
30836900	30841060	gonna have a strong magnetic field if i had a giant magnet right here do you agree with that
30841060	30849140	okay faraday's law says that if i my conductor if i got a conductor this is a conductor when i say
30849140	30853860	conductor i'm not talking just a piece of wire i'm talking about a piece of wire that has a loop
30853860	30859620	in it so the current's got to have somewhere to go it has to have a load right if i get this and i
30859620	30867380	move it perpendicular to the lines of flux i'm going to generate my maximum amount of current
30867380	30873140	because i'm doing what i'm cutting the lines of flux if i get the conductor and i move it
30873140	30878820	parallel to the lines of flux nothing's going to happen i mean nothing is going to happen
30878820	30883700	because the lines of flux are going north pole to south pole so me with the conductor moving
30883700	30888420	it like this all day long nothing's going to happen all of a sudden i move it like this i'm
30888420	30894260	moving it right through those lines of flux perpendicular so i'm going to get maximum
30894260	30898980	effect of cutting those lines of flux so that's in essence faraday's law
30903940	30908260	it's it's me cutting those lines of flux so i'm still going to have a strong effect by
30908260	30913700	simply cutting it now if i'm doing it at a 45 degree angle what am i going to be doing
30915140	30922260	i'm really half effective it's not this and it's not this it's going to be half at 45 degrees
30924180	30932580	faraday's law but i'm cutting it at a 45 degree angle so i'm not cutting the maximum
30933540	30937700	lines of flux by by cutting it at 90 i'm getting the maximum out of it
30939860	30944980	so that's faraday's law this here don't try this in your car on the way home somebody will think
30944980	30951620	you're like doing gang signs or something you know yo yo i'm an electronic student yo
30953300	30959300	this is called the left hand rule and the way that this thing works is that your your finger
30959380	30962820	points in the direction of flux which way does flux go
30966900	30971620	which way does flux go from where to where positive to negative east to west
30975380	30981060	north to south i said that earlier right flux goes north to south north pole south pole
30981060	30986180	so this means north to south that's the direction that the flux is is pointing in makes sense
30990260	30995540	my thumb is going to point in the direction of motion so as an example let's go back to me with
30995540	31001460	this wielding the yardstick here is this the yard this is the yardstick 36 inches
31002740	31006740	that's one of the reasons that i'm real happy that we're not on the metric system or we weren't
31006740	31013060	when i grew up because having attended a catholic church for school for a period of time the nuns
31013060	31019380	if the nuns had been equipped with meter sticks as opposed to yard sticks there's a good chance i
31019380	31024420	wouldn't be here with you today okay because that additional three inches would have been just enough
31024420	31033380	probably for them to connect and uh yes i was beaten by the nuns anyway so i've got a north pole here
31033940	31039780	a south pole here remember that north here south here okay so that means the lines of
31039860	31045140	flux are which going which way north to south so i got to do what
31051380	31057620	makes sense i'm going in this direction okay so the left hand rule now my thumb is going to
31057620	31065620	point in the direction of motion so this means the conductor is moving down through this scenario
31066180	31068500	and if that's the case
31073460	31078020	if that's the case my middle finger is pointing towards me which way does current flow
31080100	31088100	this is not a trick question folks negative to positive so that means i am positive with respect
31088100	31094420	to my finger negative the positive current to blow towards me okay to make it easier let's
31094420	31100580	make this the north pole let's make this the south pole and let's move our conductor let's move our
31100580	31110340	conductor down by moving the conductor down current now is going to be flowing away from me negative
31110340	31119700	to positive make sense so again will you ever use this in industry i doubt it but this is a way of
31119700	31128420	determining which direction we're going to induce current in a generator based on relative motion
31131940	31139140	now magnetic and electromagnetic applications probably the biggest and most important is the
31139140	31146740	ac generator ac generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy by utilizing the
31146740	31153140	principle of electromagnetic induction and this is the most popular way of producing electricity
31154740	31162020	now whether we turn this ac generator we're going to turn it by the shaft right whether we turn
31162020	31172420	that shaft from steam and a turbine that's generated from coal oil nuclear hydroelectric
31172420	31178260	it's irrelevant the key is that we're turning the shaft and turning the shaft we turn the generator
31178260	31183620	that's what produces the electricity now if we take that another step are there are there
31183620	31189620	means that are more efficient than others are there means that are more ecologically minded
31189620	31195140	than others are there you know what we watched last week in our program meeting on wednesday
31196020	31201060	i mean even that dude you know who was uh you know pretty much a tree hugging kind of guy saying hey
31201060	31207940	i've rethought nuclear you know and although nuclear is is dangerous and it's something we need to be
31207940	31216100	aware of you know polluting the environment with coal is worse so um things for us to think about
31216100	31221540	but the key here is by turning that shaft we generate ac electricity with an ac generator
31222100	31227140	this is how it works this is how an ac generator works and the thing that i want to point out to
31227140	31234340	you here is that these are the magnets and these magnets could be permanent or they could be
31236100	31241380	electromagnets they could be permanent or they could be electromagnets as a matter of fact this
31241380	31249300	is exactly what is taking place in your alternator in your car okay and your alternator in your car
31249300	31256740	are these those permanent magnets or are they electromagnets does anybody know alternator in
31256740	31266100	your car which produces produces voltage for us the generator are they permanent magnets or are
31266100	31273300	they electromagnets are they electromagnets that's my question to you what's that
31275220	31283060	no no because there's a power going to it and what do you call what do you call that if some
31283060	31286660	of you've ever played around with an alternator you might remember as soon as i say you're going
31286660	31293300	to know if you've played around with it before called your field windings your field windings
31293300	31300980	your field windings produce an electromagnetic field this is why if you're you know how you
31300980	31307300	can push start a car you can push start a car if it's dead you can push start a car if it's
31307300	31313220	if your battery is totally dead you're not going to push start a car somebody older vw's are different
31313220	31318900	different magnetos different system okay different on my aircraft my aircraft doesn't have a system
31318900	31325780	like that it has a a magneto so if i get that prop rotating i'm creating a spark that will
31325780	31332260	support the combustion combustion process okay kickstart motorcycle
31334980	31341460	so your car if your battery is totally dead if you if you remove your battery and try to jump
31341780	31348340	start push start your car pop start it it ain't going to work okay if your battery is kind of dead
31348900	31353940	not enough to crank the starter but enough to go click click click click click that's probably
31353940	31360900	enough to create enough of a magnetic field so when you push the car pop the clutch start the
31360900	31365380	combustion process get the engine turning immediately you're going to start to put
31365380	31370980	you know increase the voltage to these windings so these windings could be very i don't really
31370980	31376580	know of any applications they use permanent magnets here most all use windings the same
31376580	31382260	thing for a power generating plant like at grand coulee dam they got to start off with a little
31382260	31388420	bit of voltage to create the magnetic field and then get the generation process going they're not
31388420	31397700	permanent magnets okay so this here this loop of wire this is an artist depiction this loop of wire
31398660	31404100	has a light side and a dark side this is just so you could see it for the purposes of illustration
31404980	31407300	but this here is actually a loop of wire
31409940	31417620	the loop the armature here is connected to these slip rings these slip rings allow the
31417620	31428740	armature to stay connected 360 degrees of the rotation so if we look at this right now
31429460	31436820	north pole south pole north pole south pole the armature right here with the winding here at
31436820	31442900	the top and the winding at the bottom is the winding right now parallel to the lines of flux
31442900	31451860	or perpendicular lines of flux parallel it's right at the top you see how it's right at the apex
31451860	31458260	here the top so right at this moment in time it's parallel to the lines of flux how much current
31458260	31465780	do we generate when we're parallel to the lines of flux faraday's law how much zero and look what
31465780	31474100	we're generating right here zero when we rotate that armature now we're going to rotate it we're
31474100	31478820	going to connect the shaft to this and we're going to blow on it and make the shaft turn through a
31478820	31484100	wind turbine or we're going to steam and rotate you know the shaft through a steam turbine or
31484100	31489460	whatever but when we rotate the shaft now how many degrees have i rotated it from my peak
31489540	31497940	90 so right now is the armature parallel or perpendicular perpendicular what does faraday's
31497940	31507220	law say when i'm perpendicular to the lines of flux i generate my maximum amount of current well
31507220	31513700	look what we did when we rotated it 90 degrees now i'm at my maximum peak value
31514340	31520900	when i rotate my armature another 90 degrees see how i started out here at the top then i rotated
31520900	31527620	it 90 now i rotate it another 90 so i'm actually 180 degrees from where i started off am i parallel
31527620	31536900	or perpendicular to the lines of flux parallel what does faraday's law say zero what am i generating
31537220	31542900	what am i generating zero i rotate it another 90 degrees now i'm coming up on the backside 270
31544180	31552500	parallel or perpendicular perpendicular what am i going to do generating faraday's law maximum
31552500	31559140	cutting my maximum field i'm right here i complete that cycle i've just created 360 degrees of a
31559140	31567860	sinusoidal waveform this is an ac generator half of this is positive half of this is negative if
31567860	31574340	you're actually an electron if you're actually an electron caught in this whole thing basically
31574340	31579940	what happens is you get moved x amount in this direction then you go back to zero and then you
31579940	31587860	get moved x amount in this direction and then you go back to zero you never really go anywhere
31587860	31593060	but you do get shaken back and forth back and forth back and forth make sense
31594820	31600980	it's an ac generator a dc generator it actually by the way does anybody know who the father of
31600980	31607700	the ac generator was who do we give credit to ac generation tesla very good nicola tesla
31608820	31616980	he said ac was the way to go there was another guy big in history who said dc is the way to go
31616980	31622100	anybody know who that dude was edison actually more of a household name everybody knows thomas
31622100	31628660	edison actually when i first entered this industry i nobody even knew tesla tesla recently has gained
31628660	31636580	some acclaim or a cult following depending on how you want to look at it but thomas edison
31636580	31642260	he wanted to wire up everything in dc if you go back to new york city which is actually the power
31642260	31649060	company back there is consolidated edison con edison um really started off by edison edison
31649060	31655060	got the first contract to wire up the um new york city and he wired up a lot of the buildings for
31655060	31660900	dc and again i we're not going to get into it here in class you could look at youtube edison
31660900	31666900	experiments electrocuting animals you know um tesla experiments and they were they'd get like
31666900	31671540	an elephant and like you know electrocute it and like you know kill it dead and say you see this is
31671540	31676100	why you don't want to use dc this is why you want to use ac ac is much safer you know and
31676100	31680980	sort of like killing animals and stuff on you know so you can look that up on your own youtube we're
31680980	31685780	not going to do it here but i mean it was these dudes were at each other because that meant world
31685780	31694020	domination you know who's going to get the contracts and um again uh tesla was right
31694020	31701060	ac is much more efficient to transmit we'll talk about that later on so dc never really caught on
31701060	31707620	but a dc generator this is how uh what a dc generator looks like again you've got an armature
31708500	31716660	but what note here as we rotate this we're coming in contact here with this is called a commutator
31717620	31722580	and the commutator only makes contact for 180 degrees
31722660	31731060	so what happens is as we rotate the armature through we're going to generate a positive pulse
31731860	31735780	then what's going to happen is we're going to break that electrical connection because the
31735780	31741460	commutator only makes contact for 180 degrees and then what we're going to do is harness another
31741460	31746100	positive pulse so it's positive pulse positive pulse positive pulse
31746260	31749780	it's a definition of dc
31752100	31759780	definition of dc ac is half positive half negative alternation this is positive
31759780	31766340	positive positive this is almost like a battery not quite this is a pulsating dc
31766340	31772580	as where a battery would be constant dc created chemically so the big thing you need to remember
31772580	31780180	is that an ac generator has slip rings and it maintains contact for 360 degrees of the
31780180	31786660	rotation of the armature a dc generator has a commutator and it maintains contact for
31788500	31796020	180 degrees but the same principle is applied we're either cutting the lines of flux or we're not
31796020	31808100	now a relay a relay anybody here have any experience working on any relays okay relays are
31810260	31818100	are popular then they still are popular because for handling high amounts of current
31819060	31826420	still a very viable way of control a relay is an electromagnetic switch
31827460	31836660	that opens and closes with an electromagnetic coil so real simple with a relay i create an
31836660	31845620	electromagnetic field with a coil what i have is an armature above that coil and that armature has
31845620	31854740	a contact on it and it has a spring that basically when the electromagnetic field is energized it pulls
31854740	31862020	the armature down making an electrical contact when i de-energize it it has a spring that opens a backup
31864100	31870900	energize makes electrical contact de-energize opens up the circuit or i could do it the opposite
31870900	31875780	way i could be making electrical contact and when i energize the electrical circuit it's going to
31877460	31885780	open the circuit relays also could have multiple ganged contacts so when i energize it i'm opening
31885780	31894340	and closing a bunch of contacts but a relay is an electromechanical switch it's using
31894340	31901220	electromagnetism to move that armature up and down the good news is it's an electromechanical
31901220	31905620	switch it's going to fail often and you're going to need highly qualified competent technicians
31905620	31912820	to go in and troubleshoot it it's called job security they replace that with something that's
31912820	31919060	solid state it's not going to need to be replaced so as long as there are relays there's stuff for
31919060	31927620	us to fix we use relays when it's desirable to have one circuit control another circuit
31927620	31932660	typically one low power circuit controlling another high power circuit
31935940	31940100	these lights would be an example although i don't know if we've got a relay integrated and i know
31940100	31944820	that there's a relay that's integrated with the motion sensor so when the switch is energized
31944820	31948980	that motion sensor you'll actually hear if you walk in here and the lights are off especially over
31948980	31954100	here you hear the click when that obnoxious somebody's looking for a project rewire this thing to
31954100	31958420	keep that thing from ever shutting off when you're in the lab becomes pretty obnoxious
31963780	31969860	it's also used to control several circuits some distance away so an example of like a relay would
31969940	31975860	be anybody here play with model trains at all model trains are nothing more than a small example
31975860	31982420	of the real thing if you look at a freight yard on how they switch and build trains they basically
31982420	31989860	have switches that move an entire it's a motor that will move an entire railroad track so that
31989860	31995220	trains you know could be built on different sightings and such well how do you control that
31995220	32000660	you know the switch alone would be like a Frankenstein you know switch you can't do that
32000660	32006980	typically in a switching yard you'll have a up in a control tower a small switch that they throw
32006980	32013460	that sends a small signal out to a big relay that could chunk makes connection and allows
32013460	32019780	all that current to flow and turn the motor which boom switches the track it wouldn't be practical
32019780	32026180	to have you know wire this thick going to a control tower knocking you know that it would
32026180	32036340	pull the control tower down wouldn't make sense so it's used to electrically isolate the two circuits
32038100	32043780	make sense okay example of this would be a doorbell
32043780	32052500	small signal voltage bringing about a large change large changes you get and woke up out
32052500	32059860	of sound sleep because the delivery man's outside delivering a package here are some examples of relays
32065140	32071540	some of these relays are actually encapsulated so they could be put in a explosive environment
32072340	32077060	because when you open and close that contact what are you doing there could be a spark
32079060	32083380	there could be a spark so if you're working at an oil refinery you probably don't want that
32083380	32087060	spark you want that spark to be contained so it's going to be in a sealed relay
32088660	32093380	this one right here you could probably see the contacts there's two contacts here
32093380	32096580	and that thing is going to open close big sparks
32102500	32108900	now a solenoid is a coil when energized pulls a plunger that does some mechanical work
32109780	32116020	an example of this might be door chimes i'm talking about the old school ding dong ding
32116020	32123620	dong right those are physically little hammers hitting chimes now most of the stuff even like
32123620	32128260	clocks if you buy a clock that has chimes it's not chimes it's a recording of chimes
32129060	32135140	synthesized okay there's very few examples of real chimes being struck by solenoids
32136340	32140820	another example is your automotive starter when you turn the key typically you turn the key
32141460	32149860	that energizes a starter relay the starter relay energizes the starter solenoid the starter solenoid
32149860	32154820	on your car is probably about the thickness of this laser pointer and on the top is going to be a big
32154820	32160180	piece of metal that when you energize it it's going to pull that metal down and make a big
32160180	32164900	electrical connection that big electrical connection basically takes all of the energy
32164900	32171780	from your battery and dumps it into your starter there has to be physically a lot of metal present
32171780	32182820	to make that electrical connection so a relay has a moving armature a solenoid has a moving
32182900	32188740	plunger a moving core if you will if any of you have ever played a pinball machine the flippers
32188740	32194900	solenoids when you hit the button the flipper it's energizing a solenoid that solenoid
32195540	32200100	is attached physically to the flipper that's going to move back and forth back and forth
32200100	32208180	energize the energize energize the energize energize energize the energize pinball anybody
32208180	32212180	you're like pinball it's the bomb it's pure it's it's the pure game
32217380	32222180	look for a project there you go restore a pinball machine you could restore a pinball machine
32222180	32228500	contemporary pinball machine it's got everything electrical mechanical you've restored one
32229860	32236580	early there you go there's projects there's projects right there what what era
32238820	32244580	really uh i've got one i've got a 14 top cat
32246820	32251780	the real deal man if you remember that one i had the big gumballs on the top red white blue
32252340	32255940	when you get it into the advanced levels those things light up it's actually considered the most
32255940	32260420	obnoxious pinball machine ever created because if you're in a bar you know those freaking lights
32260420	32264420	you know looks like a police car park there whatever when you get into the you know multi-ball
32265220	32269940	it's pretty slick what's that Williams yeah
32272340	32276500	good stuff um 87
32284020	32287780	one of my other favorites i've been keeping my eyes open if i find one if i find one bring
32287780	32291380	home my wife will kill me because that one pinball machine she's freaking
32292260	32295700	why aren't you gonna get rid of that thing never i mean it's so freaking cool man
32296340	32301780	and i keep it operational you know um but the other one i'm always looking for a cyclone
32301780	32308340	and if you remember cyclone and it was a big uh big you know during the cold war ronald reagan
32308340	32313460	and actually there's a cyclone roller coaster and then the front car is ronald and nancy reagan
32313540	32322820	holding on for dear life great pin great pin anyway pinball brought to you by the amazing
32322820	32332740	solenoid and relays i love the applications for these things actually one of the things too with
32332740	32340260	um with relays it's kind of fun is um some airports have what's called pilot control lighting
32340900	32345540	and one of the local airports here is uh bremerton bremerton national and i don't you know
32345540	32349860	probably a lot of you don't even know bremerton national you land a 737 over there okay it's
32349860	32354020	big airport you know they don't have any commercial traffic in and out they've actually
32354020	32357780	tried in the past but it's just bremerton's not that big of a market but it's a big runway
32358340	32363700	pilot control lighting so one of the things that i've been known to do in the past if i'm
32363700	32369220	bringing somebody that's not accustomed to aviation is what i'll do is i'll start the approach and i'm
32369220	32375300	flying the instrument approach so i'm following an invisible glide path down to the runway so when
32375300	32380100	the lights are turned off at the airport it's just a black hole you're just descending into this black
32380100	32386180	void and then usually about a half a mile out what i'll do is i'll dial in the frequency and then
32386180	32390340	i'll hit the code and basically it's a matter of me just turning my transmitter on and off on and
32390340	32394420	off on and off five times turns it to high intensity so all of a sudden you're descending
32394420	32400020	into this black hole and then before you this runway appears with the chaser lights and everything
32400020	32405060	and it's kind of a power trip you know i think it's kind of cool you know by me simply you know
32405060	32410900	clicking my radio i just turned on you know this huge airport you know five thousand feet of runway
32410900	32417220	lights um that's all brought to you by well there's the pilot control lighting aspect of the radio
32417220	32423860	but what really makes it happen is relays it was really you know really relays it was actually
32423860	32430420	fun with relays too also called and could be called an industrial contactor industrial contactor
32431540	32435620	i used to be really in the i guess i've gotten old and i'm out of a swing of things with holiday
32435620	32440020	lighting i used to cover every right angle of my house i mean it looked like you know christmas
32440020	32447380	vacation material um and uh it was kind of funny because my next star neighbor he worked for bowing
32447380	32451620	his electrical engineer for bowing the guy across the street was electrical engineer for the federal
32451620	32456660	aviation administration so these guys you know i'm out there kind of messing with them and stuff
32456660	32460660	and you know you see them i'm plugging in an extension cord and the bush lights up and you
32460660	32465780	know you plug in another extension cord another you know the the roof line lights up and with me
32465780	32471220	i wanted to control everything at simultaneously so i got this big industrial contactor that fell
32471220	32477300	off the back of a truck and what i have are four separate circuits each circuit is up to 20 amps each
32477300	32482260	so what i did is i put in i basically rewired my home and i have separate circuits for the
32482260	32486580	outside lights and then i have a have it on a timer i mean i could connect it to the freaking
32486580	32492980	you know clap clapper if i want the two right so simply when that turns on boom everything is on
32492980	32497700	at once it's like how did you do that this here's an industrial contactor you know it's kind of a
32497700	32512500	cool system yeah yep absolutely yep yep and actually what one of the things that brings that
32512500	32518340	about and it's it was kind of where i was segwaying into is um normally for a first quarter student
32518340	32526180	you'd be taking the plc class el ec 116 plc basically is an industrial computer that controls
32526260	32532580	opening closes basically relays for industrial control so after taking that el ec 116 class
32532580	32539860	if you wanted you could buy a plc and basically set up a christmas display on par with with you
32539860	32544420	know what that what we've seen on video is that with the light synchronized to music and everything
32544420	32553140	really easy to do with plcs really easy to do well not easy but doable with plcs
32556580	32560020	phonograph pickups sure some of the younger students are sitting in here and saying what
32560020	32564900	is a phonograph right you know what what's this with the scratching right that's what
32564900	32570340	they're scratching on a phonograph right uses an electromagnetic principle believe it or not
32570340	32579780	a magnetic field is produced by a permanent magnet attached to a stylus the stylus tracks
32579780	32587620	through the groove of a record in response to the audio signal recorded basically um
32588660	32592420	back in the day some of you are probably familiar with this like a a musical group
32592420	32599700	were cutting an album and literally what they were doing was cutting a groove into a blank
32600340	32605380	and they're cutting an album they're recording an album okay this is how it was done back in the day
32605940	32610340	then what that would be is a negative then with the positive you could start stamping out albums
32610340	32615380	all day long and you know getting them to radio stations play your music and start selling it
32615380	32621380	and that's how you'd make the big time well with the mp3 that's all changed uh we won't we won't
32621380	32626660	comment on that but the stylus literally tracks through that groove in the record in response
32626660	32635220	to the audio signal the movement creates a small voltage that varies at the audio signal response
32636180	32643460	to replicate the wave pattern that originally created it the induced voltage is then amplified
32643460	32649540	and used to drive a loudspeaker producing the audio effect similarly of the audio signal that
32649540	32656340	produced it and um you know if anybody here own any albums do you have the ability okay anybody
32656340	32662260	here have a means of playing any of those albums actually bought a phonograph a couple years ago
32662260	32667940	because i had some older records and um you know all the stuff's available as mp3 now but you know
32668740	32675860	they don't they don't you know and only for that full experience you need a phonograph player to
32675860	32680100	play it so kind of a classic old-school retro way of going but
32684820	32687300	no it's almost too clear
32687300	32694020	i tell you some of the stuff i have a hard time because again growing up growing up in kinetica
32694020	32697860	you know i had my little late transistor radio we'd go down to the beach in kinetica shore
32697860	32702180	road island mesquamica beach we'd go down there and whatever and you're listening to the new
32702180	32708900	york radio station you're listening to the hits the top 40 hits you know and um i you know now i
32708900	32713060	listened to some of the high quality recordings it's kind of like is this a remake or it doesn't
32713060	32716820	sound like the original you know the original because the original was listening to out of a
32716820	32722260	little speaker like this you know he transistors mono you know now the stereo version of it it's
32722260	32726900	a little bit different and of course i was on a limited budget so i wasn't always going out and
32726900	32732340	buying the albums or certain albums that you had and that was high fidelity back in the day so how
32732340	32739140	a record player would work magnetic magnetic that little stylus tracking in there magnetic cartridge
32739140	32747700	loud speaker basically the opposite constructed of a moving coil around a permanent magnet so
32747700	32752660	basically if any of you've ever bought speakers before one of the attributes you're looking basically
32752660	32760020	he or she who has the the the heaviest magnet the biggest magnet wins because that's the permanent
32760020	32767060	magnet and what that means is that you could throw more energy in there to create either an
32767060	32775940	attraction or a repulsion and move the cone of the speaker back and forth rapidly replicating
32775940	32782500	the original sound that created it so that's how a loud speaker works so the key components the size
32782500	32791380	of the magnet the coil how much energy how much energy measured in watts acoustic energy but again
32791380	32805380	it's a magnetic device that's how it works magnetic recording uses the electromagnetic
32805380	32812260	principle to store information a signal is stored on tape or disc with a record head
32812820	32819460	to be read back later with a playback head some can be combined in one package that means record
32819460	32828260	head and playback head on on the same head the way that this works and it's kind of important
32828260	32834580	that you understand this basically it's like getting a piece of tape and sprinkling a bunch
32834580	32843380	of iron filings on that piece of tape by passing that tape over record head when I when I speak
32843380	32851940	into a microphone I'm creating a signal in the wire because the microphone which also is a magnetic
32851940	32859060	device the vibration the air molecules moving back and forth create that vibration the microphone
32859060	32864340	picks it up and transforms that in the small electrical signal that goes in gets amplified and
32864340	32870740	gets connected to the record head the record head is going to fluctuate its magnetic field
32871220	32877780	putting those iron filings on the tape into a unique pattern into a unique pattern
32879620	32885060	that pattern will be stored on that tape not indefinitely because if it's stored here on
32885060	32891620	planet earth what's one of the things that it could be under the influence of the earth's magnetic field
32893220	32898100	if you put it in close proximity to any other electromagnetic device it could alter that
32898100	32905540	so magnetic recordings will not last forever as a matter of fact a magnetic recording every time
32905540	32912260	you play it back and you try to read that that that fluctuation in the particles that was put
32912260	32920100	on there it loses a little bit of what it was originally remember how the video stores and
32920100	32924660	get younger students know what's a video store well back in the day we used to have to go to
32924740	32932020	places and rent vhs tapes okay um why would you have to rent tapes when it's just get it on demand
32932020	32939460	well that didn't exist back then you have to rent it on tapes right be kind of rewind absolutely
32939460	32947860	okay those were the good old days they really were um i think um those tapes they used to sell
32947860	32952020	they'd only get so many uses out of them and then they would sell them as previously viewed
32952580	32956580	you know and i used to capitalize and add to my library if there's a movie i really liked
32956580	32963460	buy it previously viewed but you know what the quality was always on its way out because
32963460	32969220	every time you use that play that tape you'll lose a little bit of it so like for high end
32969220	32975860	production and video what they would do is um uh let's say you're making a documentary for the
32975860	32980420	discovery channel and you're shooting it on video now there's some different ways of doing
32980500	32984580	if you're shooting it on videotape what they would do is they'd go out and they'd shoot
32985380	32989860	you know the helicopter and these beautiful shots or whatever they'd get the original tape
32989860	32996660	they'd make one copy for the purposes of editing editing then they'd put the originals in a vault
32996660	33001060	and they wouldn't touch the originals then they would figure out what we want to edit this scene
33001060	33005380	we want to edit that scene we want to do this once they figured out where all the edits were then
33005380	33010500	they'd go back to the master tapes and they would make a recording of the segments that they want
33010500	33017460	and produce a video production knowing that every time they run that tape through the machine
33017460	33024340	they're lessening the video quality of what was on that tape so videotape any magnetic recording
33024340	33029860	media will over time lose its integrity there's no way around it
33035220	33041860	yep if you're burning them you're it with basically um uh traditionally it it it's not
33041860	33048820	magnetic per se but over time it will deteriorate the best method is what's um known as actual ram
33048820	33054660	like dvd ram and that's for archival purposes you want to you know do dvd ram so that's one
33054660	33059300	of the problems that i actually as soon as they had a dvd burner that was on the market that was
33059300	33064580	reasonable like vhs to dvd because when my kids growing up i shot a lot of home movies and stuff
33064580	33068660	and over time i knew those tapes were going to diminish every time i watched them those tapes
33068660	33073860	are going to diminish so i got them and then transferred them but to be honest with you i
33073860	33080580	should have transferred them to um dvd ram ram and it's kind of a niche niche thing but that's
33080580	33085300	going to last the best and it won't experience degradation all these other forms of media even
33085300	33089380	if you're burning your own dvds um they will degrade over time
33093540	33099060	so the way that magnetic tape works that tiny gap between the ends of the core is a magnetic field
33099140	33103940	a piece of material covered with iron oxide basically iron filings is pulled across the
33103940	33112340	record head magnetizing it information is written in a magnetized pattern to play back or read the
33112340	33118900	information the material is moved past the gap in a playback head the magnetic field induces a small
33118900	33127220	voltage into the coil winding when amplified the information is reproduced and this really
33127220	33133460	revolutionized the recording industry being able to i mean i remember back in the day i'm dating
33133460	33139620	myself but wow could actually own a cassette recorder and i could speak in real microphone
33139620	33144660	and record my voice on magnetic tape and then you could put it in and at a later date and hear
33144660	33152340	yourself wow that was really the big deal now we have cell phones that we talk into and digitally
33152420	33160340	record that examples that used this technology on tape would be cassette recorders video
33160340	33164980	recorders reel-to-reel recorders that were used in a lot of production studios and such
33166260	33172980	floppy disk drives floppy disk drive is nothing more than a a disk with particle on it with the
33172980	33178660	iron iron iron particles on it and believe it or not hard disk drives if you've got a hard drive
33178660	33185460	in your computer using the same technology a little bit better no a lot bit better okay because
33185460	33191940	now you're you could go out and buy a terabyte drive for forty nine dollars and the reliability
33191940	33197940	of that data is extremely high and if it's properly maintained you're really not going to lose
33197940	33203620	integrity of that data and that's really as far as i'm concerned this is really that's the best
33203620	33209620	method of storage my wife and i really enjoy amateur digital photography and when we go out
33209620	33216260	and shoot something when it's on the card we're at risk as soon as we plug that card in and we
33216260	33224580	copy it to one drive i primary drive okay then what i do is i mirror that on a secondary drive
33224580	33231380	and i mirror that on a tertiary drive and i also pay for a service to go back to that primary drive
33231380	33238900	and back it up offsite okay let me tell you in the middle of february in the middle of february
33239460	33245380	all right i fly to to fairbanks alaska minus 23 degrees to see see the aurora borealis to get
33245380	33250340	some pictures i don't want to lose those pictures because my hard drive fails so i want to make sure
33250340	33257220	i have backups to backups to backups so as long as you do that you're good with me just transferring
33257220	33265860	a home movie to a dvd i could lose integrity of that over time if it's backed up digitally on a
33265860	33274580	hard drive and you could again mirror that then then you're good dc motor operation depends on a
33274580	33280980	principle that a current carrying conductor placed in and at right angles to a magnetic field tends
33280980	33284500	to move at right angles in the direction of the field basically what we're saying is if we could
33284500	33294020	rotate a shaft and create dc why can't we apply a voltage to a winding and create motion
33297220	33302580	so the difference between a dc motor and a dc generator
33305940	33313220	is perception most cases they could be used either way it's actually one of the things that
33313220	33318980	they use for power management over at the grand coulee dam i don't know if any of you have any
33318980	33323780	of you go recreating over in central washington you ever go camping or anything out there it's
33323780	33327460	really amazing if you have a chance to go out there this is stuff again they were thinking
33327460	33336180	about in the early 1900s okay you got the columbia river they built a dam on it not just any dam the
33336180	33341380	grand coulee dam okay and what they did behind the dam is they created lake roosevelt
33343620	33352340	for the purposes of irrigation and to store energy to store energy during low demand times
33353220	33358580	what they did is they have the generator's turn you can't stop the columbia river it's a river you're
33358580	33362420	going to kill all the fish so you can't just shut the river off you got to keep the water flowing
33362420	33370180	but if it's low demand time get that harness the electricity then with the electricity drive pumps
33371140	33377540	drive pumps and they pump the water from lake roosevelt up to banks lake
33379220	33385140	banks lake very popular for water skiing and recreating banks lake goes to feed agriculture
33385860	33393220	and then during peak demand times what they could do is turn it backwards and catch the energy flowing
33393220	33399940	back to lake roosevelt producing energy and then catch it falling back into the columbia river
33399940	33405940	and harnessing it twice so basically you're using the water to store the energy by simply pumping
33405940	33415300	it to a higher elevation during that low demand time brilliant brilliant you know and again they
33415300	33422260	figured this stuff all out in the early 1900s so that's what they've got between lake roosevelt
33422260	33429460	and banks lake basically our motor generators that you can turn either way and you know either
33429460	33434900	turn it backwards pump the water up or catch the water falling and generate electricity
33445140	33451460	and this is simply the process of creating a magnetic field that attracts and opposes and
33452580	33456980	creating motion instead of motion being used to create a magnetic field
33457220	33461700	now we're harnessing the magnetic field to create motion with a dc motor
33462580	33468100	another area that uses electromagnetic fields tv radar computer terminals what we're talking
33468100	33473540	about is the old school monitor like that old school monitor like that basically in the back
33473540	33479300	of a monitor like that there's an electron gun so you get to get to go home tonight what did
33479300	33483220	you learn about in school my instructor was talking about them they're electron guns
33484020	33488980	it's gonna zap us now an electron gun basically sits in the back of a cathode ray tube and shoots
33488980	33496740	an electron beam out towards the screen that electron beam is going to be controlled through
33496740	33503540	deflection windings the deflection windings are horizontal and vertical and that's what's
33503540	33510100	going to be used to basically paint the image on the screen it's your x-axis and your y-axis
33510660	33517860	so that's how we'd use that to paint an image now with flat screen monitors we're doing things a
33517860	33523300	little bit different but it's kind of an evolutionary process based on what we were doing with that
33523300	33530980	magnetic field in summary we talked about magnets natural magnets
33533300	33539060	unnatural magnets artificial magnets and electromagnets come in many shapes and sizes
33539060	33544900	big thing to remember unlike poles a track like poles repel two theories of magnetism
33544900	33551700	electron spin and domains flux lines are those invisible forces that we can't see
33554500	33559780	you know this lecture wouldn't be complete if we didn't talk about you know anomalies
33559780	33566580	you've all heard of the bermuda triangle right well science or science fiction
33566580	33572980	i mean they've got some really good hard evidence of magnetic anomalies that occur there so
33572980	33581460	if you're navigating solely by compass and you encounter unusual magnetic fields
33581460	33585380	or you're flying an airplane that's again has a gyro compass in it
33588020	33593460	it could cause problems big problems for you magnetic disturbances there's actually on aeronautical
33593460	33598980	charts they put down areas that have big magnetic disturbance areas that they're that they're used
33598980	33603460	to the bermuda triangles one of them it's actually one of the things it's kind of interesting too
33603460	33610500	that i see a lot of these like ghost hunters using um is equipment to basically sense magnetic fields
33611380	33616100	and there you know there's there's um you know a school out there that basically says that
33616100	33622020	you know spirits possess this energy and this energy manifests itself as a magnetic field so if
33622020	33626260	you have sensitive enough equipment and you know i've i don't know anybody watching those shows on
33626260	33630900	tv you know i've watched enough that something's going on something's going on and actually quite
33630900	33637620	frankly i think we're very we're very naive if if you know we only believe what we could see
33637620	33645140	with our five senses you know so um you know i think there's probably some truth in some of this
33645140	33651460	stuff we talked about the magnetic field determining direction of flux lines we talked about
33651460	33658900	electromagnets strength polarity retentivity electromagnetic induction we talked about Faraday's
33658900	33666660	law right parallel perpendicular we not only talked about the left hand rule for generators but i
33666660	33673060	gave you a specific warning and not doing that in your car in your drive home as someone might think
33673060	33679140	you're giving a gang signs we talked about ac and dc generators big thing to remember about an ac
33679140	33688100	generator right slip rings dc generator commutator ac generator makes a wave that's half positive half
33688100	33695460	negative dc generator makes pulsating positive waves relays basically electromechanical switches
33697380	33703140	a moving armature or a series of ganged armatures contacts on armature
33703940	33708980	we talked about how we could use this for doorbell solenoids phonograph pickups loud
33708980	33715620	speakers magnetic recordings and then finally we talked about dc motors and yes meters that dr is
33715620	33720980	involved meter movement is nothing more than a permanent magnets and a coil when you pass
33720980	33724660	current through that coil you either attract or oppose causing the needle move
33725540	33733620	and then finally we talked about the electron beams created by electron guns
33734580	33742980	to the back of a crt that's how we used to create television signals radar displays oscilloscopes
33742980	33748740	and computer terminals and we have any questions on anything that we covered in this chapter there's
33748740	33755220	a lot of new terms to familiarize yourself with this less math more remembering new terms
33756420	33770980	question i have the flux capacitor in back to the future i have no idea what that is
33771540	33777620	and i probably wouldn't recognize it you know if i if i saw it so um yeah
33778740	33783060	there's no reference to the flux capacitor it's just a completely made up thing that they came
33783060	33788340	up with pretty much i don't know if there's any wikipedia references to it you know it could
33788340	33808020	be a fun project to try to build one i reckon well you guys are stomping me tonight
33809300	33813140	uh i don't know that's what they've always caused it yeah it should be like an electron beam
33813140	33822420	tube cathode ray tube cathode sends out an electron ray and it's a vacuum tube cathode ray tube
33824100	33828100	electron beam i don't know got me good question
33830420	33833540	yeah let me tell you if i was the pope of electronics all of this stuff would have been
33833540	33838980	called something easier simpler you know some of the stuff you just got to hit the i believe button
33838980	33844900	but suffice to say like say magnetism it is really really critical um that's actually one of things
33844900	33849780	too that i don't know if you um i can't confirm or deny but the the movie hunt for right october
33850740	33863220	you know um that was basically a hydrodynamic drive that was based on magnetic field and um
33864260	33868580	you know you could look at that and say science fiction science or science fiction i of course
33868580	33874500	cannot comment on it um but if you research that type of technology the japanese and the japanese
33874500	33879860	of course is an island nation they're very dependent and always have been dependent on trade
33879860	33884820	they've played around with that technology on barges to see if they could you know move a barge
33884820	33890500	using this you know hydrodynamic drive system and um you know again it's not mainstream but
33890500	33906500	they've played around enough with it so
33911300	33919380	yeah and to be honest with you um you know and i haven't i haven't wrote a nuclear submarine
33919380	33925620	in over 20 years um i know that we had submarines out there that were so quiet you wouldn't hear
33925620	33931620	the submarine what you would hear is the submarine blocking biological noise behind it
33931620	33937460	so it's like if you had something big going past your your ear you know something is there
33937460	33943300	because it's blocking the sound so i mean that was 20 plus years ago so we've never had a problem
33943300	33949620	keeping quiet and keeping keeping things real quiet um but performance is another issue see if
33949620	33953860	you want to go fast underwater you're going to make some noise and that that will give a location
33953860	33962980	you know give your your your tell basically so any questions any other questions comments concerns
33963060	33976180	all right the long anticipated lecture chapter 10 inductance
33980180	33987220	this is uh this is going to be an unusual property for us to discuss compared to what
33987220	33992420	we've talked about up to this point what we've talked about up to this point really is
33993620	34001220	conductance resistance period in discussing inductance you're going to see that things with
34001220	34010580	inductance change over time okay the property actually changes the influence it has in a circuit
34010580	34018420	changes over time so you're going to see that this is uh very dynamic literally dynamic component
34018420	34024980	and property chapter 10 inductance after completing this chapter you're going to be able to explain
34024980	34031300	the principles of inductance identify the basic units of inductance identify different types of
34031300	34041060	inductors determine the total inductance in series parallel circuits explain l r time constants and
34041060	34050740	how they relate to inductance now the property of inductance is that characteristic of an
34050740	34059540	electrical conductor that opposes a change in current flow opposes a change in current flow
34062020	34068420	the symbol that we use is the capital letter l so in a circuit if you see on a schematic
34068420	34077220	diagram l equals that means inductance is equal to whatever specific amount is identified
34079060	34086180	now an inductor is a specific device designed to possess this property of inductance
34086500	34097300	an inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field and it's important for us to
34097300	34101700	understand this property because we're going to counter this next chapter when we talk about
34101700	34108340	capacitance right i'll let the cat out of the bag capacitance is an electrostatic field
34109140	34116100	inductance is an electromagnetic field that's what's the magic behind an inductor
34118660	34123300	now once current is moving through a conductor inductance helps to keep it moving
34125860	34132580	as the magnetic flux lines build up they create an opposition to the flow of current
34133140	34137540	an opposition to the flow of current
34140180	34150260	lens's law talks about that lens's law states an induced emf in any circuit
34151300	34157940	is always in a direction to oppose the effect that produced it the amount of counter emf is
34157940	34162820	proportional to the rate of change the faster the rate of change the greater the counter emf
34163460	34169460	so what this means let's go back last chapter that we talked about remember magnetism
34170660	34175540	remember when we pass current through a conductor we create a magnetic field
34175540	34188820	lens's law says if the current was going data way it's going to create an electromagnetic
34188820	34199220	field like this make sense if we shut the circuit off that electromagnetic field is going to
34200180	34208180	collapse and it's going to produce a counter electromotive force that goes
34209540	34216660	that way the opposite way of what created it so if the emf goes that way and it creates some
34216660	34221140	magnetic field like this magnetic field collapses it creates a counter emf that goes in the opposite
34221140	34226660	direction so the second part there talks about the rate of change
34229220	34235140	the faster we turn that on and off on and off on and off expand collapse expand collapse
34235140	34238980	the more the faster we do it the more pronounced that effect is going to be
34240740	34247060	if you connect one of these one of them there inductors to a dc circuit it's going to happen
34247060	34253940	once when you close the circuit and energize it and when you de-energize it that field's
34253940	34257620	going to collapse and create that counter current so it's only going to happen once it's going to
34257620	34264820	expand once and it's going to collapse once now i'm going to let out a little secret because
34264820	34275140	you guys have all read ahead ac what's one thing that's constant about ac it's constantly
34276100	34283060	changing very good constantly changing so the higher the ac frequency is that we apply to one
34283060	34286980	of these devices the more pronounced this effect is going to be does that make sense
34288260	34294180	it goes back to lenses law and again anytime that in class i i say anything about a law
34295300	34298580	we should like ring a bell dim the lights hit some chimes
34299460	34308500	and hit a gong because laws you could take to the bank
34310900	34317380	you answer a question on your quiz using a law on an exam using a law you approach a project
34318020	34321940	or a lab assignment using a law you're going to get good results
34322420	34329780	now inductance is measured by the henry and this was invented by a guy whose name was
34330980	34331460	george
34334260	34337700	guy by the name of joe henry my main man
34339940	34342900	henry ironically is abbreviated with the letter h
34343860	34353780	and one henry is the amount of inductance required to induce an emf of one volt
34354900	34361060	when the current in the conductor changes at a rate of one amp per second
34362660	34370100	so one henry is equal to one volt of emf at one amp per second one is equal to one over one
34370180	34374100	one over one second
34377380	34381860	now in electronics the typical values that we're going to see
34384260	34390580	will be the mille henry times ten to the negative third the micro henry times ten to the negative
34390580	34396020	sixth in some high power applications you may see henry's
34400100	34404660	but generally speaking most of the stuff that we're working with in micro electronics mille
34404660	34413780	henry's micro henry's now inductors are those specific devices designed to possess the property of
34414340	34421460	inductance so they're designed to have a specific inductance that's why come they be invented
34422020	34433620	they consist of a conductor coiled around a core remember if we got like x amount of magnetism
34433620	34440740	by creating one turn how much would we get if we make two turns twice as much it's that simple
34440740	34447940	it's easy math consists of a conductor coiled around a core and it's classified by the type of
34447940	34453860	core material whether it's magnetic or non magnetic if we use a magnetic core material
34453860	34457940	we're going to get a higher amount of inductance out of it if we use non magnetic we're going to
34457940	34465060	get a little bit lower out of it so sometimes they'll use that core material to get it just
34465060	34475860	not too much not too little but just right this is the schematic diagram for a fixed inductor
34478180	34481940	and for those of you out there that want to go home and roll your own you could do that
34482820	34492580	you just need magnetic wire magnetic wire is basically thin copper wire solid core that has
34492580	34497700	a lacquer coating on it if you've ever looked into a transformer or motor and you see the windings
34498820	34504500	that's magnetic wire it's all you need some cases you don't even need magnetic wire
34504500	34509540	because you could you could roll a coil and as long as the wires aren't touching each other
34509540	34516660	you're using air as an insulation you could roll your own i've been known to roll my own on a few
34516660	34526340	times with mixed results i have no idea what i'm talking about actually i know exactly what i'm
34526340	34536020	talking about this is a variable inductor created with an adjustable core material now the way they
34536020	34541300	they come up with this is pretty fascinating what they'll do is they'll get a a ferromagnetic
34542260	34552100	core material typically like powdered iron and then they they basically form it into a material
34552100	34557700	precedent material and then they thread it and then they thread the center of the core
34557700	34565700	and what you could actually do with it right is righty tighty lefty lucy screw it in and as you
34565700	34572100	screw it in what are you doing you're you're increasing the magnetic influence of the iron core
34574420	34579780	so by simply adjusting that this is used for fine tuning in a lot of circuits that contain these
34579780	34586420	very fine subtle tuning another thing that you could do and i used to see this old school not as
34586420	34596660	much now they would use a brass insert and when you screw brass in what are you doing brass has a
34596660	34603060	high level of reluctance so it's going to oppose that magnetic field so by screwing it in you're
34603060	34609620	lowering the amount of inductance if it was iron core and you screwed it in you'd be increasing
34610100	34619060	so it's counter-intuitive and it gets worse because what would happen is typically the
34619060	34624660	questions that i used to be asked in a lot of my military navy equipment schools what we would
34624660	34629860	have were circuit card extenders so you would do is take the circuit card out put it in the
34629860	34634660	extender and then now the circuit card was was mounted above the rest so that you could get in
34634660	34640340	there and adjust make adjustments a lot of times you'd have to make the adjustments from the back
34640340	34646020	side they'd have a little hole physically in the in the board that you could put your adjustment
34646020	34653540	alignment tool in so then they'd ask if approaching it from the back side which direction needs you
34653540	34662020	turn the inductor to see a decrease in inductance so it's one of those things that you know you kind
34662100	34669300	of let's see if i'm turning it clockwise from the top that's going to be counterclockwise from the
34669300	34678820	backside but it's it's brass core so as i'm turning it counterclockwise i'm really moving i mean it's
34678820	34684340	just these questions that like you thought your head was going to explode but you know what you
34684340	34690340	kind of had a well i don't see how that really ever helped me in life knowing that stuff because
34690340	34694900	basically when you got out to the fleet you put a circuit you set up your test fixture and basically
34694900	34700180	as soon as you start turning it the wrong way you see needles go the wrong way and you turn it back
34700180	34704180	and you get it to where it needs to be and you're done with it you don't sit there and well let's
34704180	34710500	see if i approach and if i'm using a mirror i'm actually seeing the inverse i mean just crazy
34710500	34715700	stuff but think about that because these still and some of you may work on some legacy equipment
34715700	34721700	it's fun to repair legacy equipment to retrofit to do things like that
34723060	34729380	so you may end up finding some of this stuff this is my personal collection of inductors
34732180	34733540	guys actually believe me
34736420	34742900	this is an air core inductor this is a fixed value inductor and that's all it is this wire
34742900	34751780	wound around a magnetic core it's all it is all of these can type here are adjustable and actually
34751780	34758980	if you could look here this almost looks like this takes a hex head right like an allen an allen head
34762740	34770500	whatever you do don't use an allen wrench to try to adjust this because typically the allen wrench
34770500	34780100	in your toolkit is made out of iron steel ferromagnetic material so as soon as you get it in close
34780100	34786500	proximity and you adjust it and get it just so you're going to remove part of the magnetic
34786500	34794340	influence and your numbers are going to go caddywampus so all of these need to be adjusted with
34794340	34802340	non-magnetic alignment tools i've got a i've got a roll a tool roll at home from back in the day
34802340	34807460	i should bring it in as an example it's this big tool roll it's like every alignment tool known to
34807460	34815220	humankind and they're basically all plastic heads the other thing too is uh you know you stick your
34816020	34821780	a hex head in there you stand a chance of damaging that and even if you break off a little bit of
34821780	34827940	material that amount of material was designed engineered to be there to create x amount of
34827940	34835540	magnetic field so you kind of got to you kind of got to get it right so don't start if you don't
34835540	34841380	have the right tool don't touch this stuff so it's typically called an alignment tool or actually a
34841380	34849940	tweaker in the classical sense of the word a tweaker and you could always tell who the technicians
34849940	34856100	were you know because they'd always have the tweaker in their pockets and you knew it's kind
34856100	34860980	of funny back in uniform submarine base in connecticut i'd be walking around i'd see you with
34860980	34866180	tweaker in your pocket you know at the at the at the deli or whatever and i knew exactly what you
34866180	34870500	did for a living the only guys running around only goofballs running around with tweakers in
34870500	34874660	their freaking pocket were electronics techs that were regularly aligning equipment
34879060	34888580	air core this is an inductor well not without core material because it has air in the core that's
34888580	34897300	why it's called air core it's used for values up to five millihenries of inductance wrapped on
34897300	34902740	ceramic or phenolic core in this case it was probably wrapped around a dowel or something
34902740	34908260	and then removed and it has form in and of itself this is actually a really good photograph because
34908260	34912900	you could see the magnetic wire here and you could see where the insulation has been stripped
34912900	34918500	this is bare wire and then this is insulated a lot of times people see this and they think that
34918500	34925940	it's bare wire it's not bare wire it's insulated one of the best ways of getting this insulation
34925940	34932740	off if you're going to do a lot of this is with a chemical stripper chemical stripper
34934660	34937940	and basically it's it's like a thinning agent you dip it in
34939940	34946100	paint thinner paint a remover and it removes that right down to the the metal and it makes
34946100	34950420	it solderable you have to put a neutralizing agent on it but that's the best way of doing it
34950420	34954740	other than that you know you're going to get your wire strippers and your wire strippers are just
34954740	34962340	basically going to scratch the stuff off it's not going to really because this is a lacker coating on it
34965860	34970340	but that's this is an inductor believe it or not just a piece of wire making those five turns
34970900	34974820	it's going to give you x amount of inductance might be enough for you to get the job done
34974820	34979700	question on the last air core picture that you had there was a piece of metal going through it
34984740	34992820	this piece right here i think somehow this is mounted this this serves as a a form somehow to
34992820	35000340	keep that the shape of it i really don't know usually they're hollow though yeah oh yeah yeah
35000340	35005940	this is not here to influence the magnetic or all it's either there for aesthetics or to help the
35005940	35011700	way that's mounted or what have you it's a good observation some of these things are actually
35011700	35015940	pretty cool looking again anyway when you get into some of that older equipment they made it with a
35015940	35022660	certain level of elegance you know and um this would be an example of that if you opened up an old
35022660	35029860	in a 1930s radio you'd probably find that inductor that looks like that in there it's 1970s radio no
35029860	35040980	you're not going to find that in there iron core iron core could be either ferrite or powdered iron
35041780	35047860	it's a typo not ion ion core captain the ion core is melting down
35051540	35058740	damn damn you scotty that's why i'm not into drama right not a very dramatic kind of guy
35060420	35068260	it's iron core used for values of 200 millihenrys of inductance typically up to 200 millihenrys of
35068260	35074100	inductance schematic symbol shows these two parallel lines next to the coil that shows that
35074100	35086340	there's an iron core next to the coil torrid core these are donut shape but do not try to eat them
35089780	35096100	they offer a high inductance for a small size these are very prolific in a lot of contemporary
35096100	35102260	electronic applications because the magnetic field is contained in the core offers a very
35102260	35109540	high inductance for very small size if you opened up a computer power supply you'd find
35109540	35115620	a bunch of these inside a lot of inductance for a relatively small package
35118100	35123300	i've had graduates have gone to work for companies and they had to do this part of their job roll
35123300	35129220	their own they're giving the blank core spool of wire and you sit there and you
35129220	35134420	thread it through and tighten it up thread it through tighten it up clean the leads
35134420	35138420	solder it in the boards actually pretty good job most of the people that are playing around with
35138420	35144500	this stuff are for rf applications radio frequency high energy radio frequency mr. ground what's
35144500	35147860	going on man i had a question you just backed their waving man take
35152820	35153300	what's up
35153300	35164100	up
35167220	35173620	yeah yep so it's not wasting that field going outside it's containing it basically
35174900	35176100	increases the efficiency
35178100	35179300	which makes it more better
35183940	35190580	this is a shielded core shield of core have a shield of magnetic material to protect them from
35190580	35196020	the influence of other magnetic fields because if you've got a couple of these in close proximity
35196020	35202420	to each other one field could influence another device now if you just saw this if you didn't
35202420	35208580	know any better what would you think this device was now looks like a transformer and the only
35208580	35214980	tell that there is on this is there's only two wires if you look on the other side you wouldn't
35214980	35221540	find any other wires but it would look exactly like a transformer as a matter of fact you can
35221540	35228420	use a transformer as an inductor if you don't connect the secondary leads the primer if you
35228420	35237540	only use just the coil you could use a transformer as an inductor for some applications that's why
35237540	35243620	i've got a garage full of junk because i won't throw a transformer away because someday i may
35243620	35254340	want to use it as an inductor this is laminated core and again if you didn't know any better
35254340	35260820	you'd think it was a transformer we know it's an inductor because there's only two wires coming
35260820	35271060	out of it and the top is stamped 4.5 henry's 4.5 h and this was going to vary from 0.1 henry's all
35271060	35284580	the way up to 100 henry's this is also sometimes referred to as a choke as a choke used as a choke
35284660	35293940	in automotive applications noise filters meaning to choke off a change it's going to choke the change
35300340	35305460	just like resistors inductors could be connected in series parallel or series parallel
35305940	35314180	when you're dealing with inductors measured in henry's in series you treat them exactly like
35314180	35323460	resistors plain and simple if i've got two henry's and i put it in series with four henry's two plus
35323940	35333220	four equals six i now i now get six henry's worth of inductance in parallel you treat them like
35335140	35341060	resistors in parallel so the total inductance will always be less than the value of least
35343620	35347860	as long as you're dealing with the property measured in henry's
35347860	35355140	now this is where things get interesting everything else i've been talking up to this
35355140	35363940	point it's just been kind of hey it's trying to get to know you this the real deal this
35365460	35368100	dis is what it's all about
35368420	35377620	it's a series circuit it's a series circuit i've got a switch that has two positions one is called
35377620	35382820	the growth mode and the other is the decay mode okay so this switch i could toggle from either
35382820	35391460	growth to decay when it's in the growth mode i have a simple series circuit do i not and the
35391460	35398660	circuit contains an inductor actually what an iron core inductor because i see the parallel
35398660	35408420	lines the inductor in series with a resistor makes sense when i close the switch
35410580	35416820	as soon as i close the switch it's going to allow current to flow through this circuit do you agree
35416820	35424020	with me what's going to happen is that current is going to come racing through the circuit
35424020	35429700	negative the positive all of a sudden it's going to hit this curly piece of wire and that curly
35429700	35434900	piece of wire it's hitting is an inductor an inductor is a specific device designed to possess
35434900	35442100	the property of inductance inductance is that property which tries to oppose a change in current
35442740	35449780	so current was at zero it wants to go to 100 percent and this device is going to say uh-uh
35450580	35454740	i want you to stay at zero why because you've been at zero and i like it like that
35458180	35462820	but eventually as the current continues to come that magnetic field builds
35462820	35468100	and current eventually goes to maximum it goes to 100 percent for this circuit
35469060	35475620	but the inductor because of its property of inductance is going to fight the whole time
35476420	35482100	to try to prevent that change from occurring but eventually it's going to lose
35485620	35490820	so close the switch turn the circuit on the inductor is going to fight fight fight fight
35490820	35494740	fight fight and eventually give up and current's going to be at 100 percent flowing through this
35494740	35500500	circuit and by the way by the way when current is at 100 percent flowing through this inductor
35501700	35505540	electrons are like what's up with that it's a piece of curly wire
35507780	35512260	after a period of time the electrons it's like why am i going through a piece of curly wire
35512900	35515700	it just has no effect on them whatsoever
35516660	35525700	and the circuit runs and runs and runs soon as we get the switch and move the switch from the
35525700	35533700	growth mode to the decay mode the magnetic field that was built up around inductor l1
35534420	35538340	is going to collapse and it's going to collapse
35538740	35546100	into itself when it collapses into itself what is it going to do
35549540	35555460	it's going to act like a what happens when a magnetic field passes through a conductor
35560740	35566500	we induce we induce current if we move a conductor through a magnetic field we induce current
35566500	35571140	if the if the if the conductor is stationary and the magnetic field moves through a conductor
35572420	35579220	we're going to generate current right so as soon as i move this to the decay mode this magnetic
35579220	35586820	field is going to collapse into itself creating a counter current lenses law remember the opposite
35586820	35592740	of the force that created it and then that current is basically going to flow through the circuit
35593620	35594740	until it dissipates
35598740	35602820	but if this was just a series circuit made up of a resistor a resistor and a switch
35602820	35610420	you turn it on boom you go to a hundred percent you turn it off pow you go to zero now with an
35610420	35617700	inductor in here you turn it on it's going to come up and eventually get to a hundred percent
35617700	35622180	you turn it off the magnetic field's going to collapse and eventually it's going to get down
35622180	35628180	to zero percent you follow what i'm talking about you guys know what i'm talking about i'm beating
35628180	35635220	around the bush what am i talking about time constants time constants the time required
35635220	35643460	for current through a conductor to increase to 63.2 percent so if i apply 100 to it and that first
35643460	35651780	time constant it's going to rise 63.2 percent in the next time constant it's going to gain
35651780	35658820	63.2 percent of that's what is what's remaining the next time constant 63.2 percent of what's
35658820	35664820	remaining the next time constant 63.2 percent of what's remaining the next time constant basically
35664820	35670260	after five time constant we say enough is enough it's a hundred percent but is it really at 100
35670260	35678100	percent no because it's nonlinear so really it never reaches 100 percent we say after five time
35678100	35686540	constant's reached 100%. It's good enough for what we do. To calculate out this
35686540	35693020	time constant, it's actually relatively easy. Lr is the symbol used for the
35693020	35699340	time constant of an RL circuit, and the formula is t is equal to l divided by r,
35699340	35704220	period. It's that simple. Take the amount of inductance divided by the amount of
35704220	35712580	resistance that's going to give you the time constant. Measured in seconds. That's
35712580	35717900	what we use as our base unit of measurement in electronics, the second.
35718660	35736700	t is equal to l over r. Yes. If I gave you four inductors, you'd have to calculate out
35736700	35742380	the total inductance and plug that in the circuit right there. So I could give you
35742380	35747220	some real nightmare circuits right now. Think about it. It'd be fair game. I could
35747220	35751260	give you a circuit that's got, you know, 13 inductors and combination series
35751260	35756980	parallel and 22 resistors, combination and series parallel. The bottom line is
35756980	35763780	it's equivalent to this circuit here. You've got to figure that out. But you
35763780	35769980	should be able to do so without a whole lot of fuss. This is what a time constant
35769980	35773580	curve looks like.
35778180	35785540	Here's that first time constant. 63.2%. 63.2% of what's remaining. 63.2% of
35785540	35793540	what's remaining. 63.2% of what's remaining. What's remaining. And what is it
35793540	35797740	that I'm actually looking at here? What is this in blue? Is this voltage? What is
35797740	35806220	this? It's a current. Current. Number one, because the slide says so. But number two,
35806220	35815340	most importantly, because it's current that's going from zero, the inductors
35815340	35818700	trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the
35818700	35821660	change, trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the change, trying to
35821660	35829780	prevent the change. Alright. Current wins. Then as soon as you set that circuit off,
35829780	35834180	current's going to try to go from 100% to zero, but because that magnetic field
35834260	35839620	is collapsing, I don't want to decrease. I want to keep it 100%, but I can't. Oh,
35839620	35844820	crap. Oh, all the way down to zero. But because that field is collapsing, it's
35844820	35850580	going to try to prevent that change. That's why we use these. That's why we use
35850580	35859700	these. Absolutely. If we're affecting current, definitely we'll have an effect
35859700	35866740	on voltage. In summary, inductance is the ability to store energy in a magnetic
35866740	35874460	field. Just remember the key word for inductance is magnetic. That's how they
35874460	35879420	do their magic. The unit for measuring inductance is the Henry, measured by the
35879420	35887860	capital letter H. The letter L represents inductance. Inductors have specific
35887940	35897820	inductances. That's why they're designed. The symbol for a fixed inductor is down
35897820	35903140	here at the bottom. Symbol for a variable inductor has an arrow going through it.
35903140	35909380	The arrow means it's adjustable. Types of inductors include iron core, ferrite or
35909380	35917380	powdered iron core, torrid core, shielded core, laminated core. Formula for adding
35917380	35921380	up in series is like the same formula for adding up resistors in series. The only
35921380	35927380	thing you need to be aware of, you're adding up inductance measured in
35927380	35935740	Henry's. If it's not in Henry's, can't use this formula. The formula for total
35935740	35940100	conductance in inductors in parallel is a reciprocal formula. Use it same as you
35940120	35951420	would for resistors in parallel. Time constant formula T is equal to L over R. You
35951420	35955740	run this calculation, it shows you what one time constant is worth. I need to
35955740	35960460	multiply that by how many to figure out how long it's going to take to get to 100%?
35960460	35967780	Five. Five. Because it takes five time constants to reach 100%. So understand
35967820	35972940	that when you do this math, you only end up with one time constant. It takes five to
35972940	35979940	get the job done. Or as it says here, five time constants required to fully build
35979940	35986980	up or collapse the magnetic field of an inductor. Any questions on anything that
35986980	35988980	we discussed for the inductors? Yes.
35998980	36002860	Yup. And that's it. We have inductors because they create inductance. And
36002860	36008460	inductance is that property which tries to oppose the change in current. So we're
36008460	36016020	going to have a lot of different components that are going to want to
36016020	36020500	bring about a change in current in a circuit. And if we put an inductor in
36020500	36025860	there, an inductor could help stabilize that current flow because of that
36025860	36029460	electromagnetic property. So it's going to help stabilize current levels in a
36029460	36036460	circuit. The majority of applications that we're going to use inductors for is
36036460	36045100	really going to be filtration. Because once we're not there yet, some of you may
36045180	36052180	have read it far enough ahead, that when we apply an inductor to an AC circuit,
36052180	36058180	it starts doing some wacky stuff. And by harnessing that wacky property called
36058180	36067180	inductive reactance, we can use that to filter. We could use it in audio
36067180	36073700	applications where we want only certain frequencies to go to certain speakers.
36073780	36078780	And that's why we're going to be doing that wacky stuff. I knew a guy that was
36078780	36085780	getting some interference on one of his cable channels back in the day. And
36085780	36093780	because this friend of mine had extensive electronics background, he didn't
36093780	36098780	want to call the cable company and have them waste their time and come out and
36098860	36106860	call. Exactly. So this friend of mine built a filter circuit to filter out the
36106860	36112860	garbage signal that somebody was putting on this pay-per-view channel. And by
36112860	36117980	filtering out the garbage that got put on the channel, the reception was
36117980	36127980	enhanced and made the station viewable. And the key component in that hole, so
36128060	36135060	I'm told, project as an inductor. And ironically, it was an inductor that was
36135060	36144060	like three turns of wire. One, two, three turns of wire was adequate enough for
36144060	36153060	the reception to be enhanced. Mind-boggling, so I'm told. Question.
36153060	36163060	Yeah.
36163060	36173060	Oh, really? Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And a little did you realize that?
36173060	36180060	Yeah. Nobody knew why, but it worked. Now you know.
36180060	36186060	All right, let's go ahead and take a break. And at about 6.20, we'll start up with
36186060	36194060	chapter 17. Y'all ready for this?
36194060	36202060	Chapter 11. Capacitance. Capacitance. If you believed what I sold you last
36202060	36210060	chapter, this should not be a stretch for you. Because it's kind of like the same
36210060	36214060	thing is happening, but with a different property.
36214060	36220060	It's really what it's all about. Well, capacitance is actually kind of cool.
36220060	36224060	We'll talk about it. A lot of uses for capacitance. After completing this
36224060	36229060	chapter, the student, you, the student, will be able to explain the principles of
36229060	36234060	capacitance, identify the basic units of capacitance, identify different types of
36234060	36239060	capacitors, determine total capacitance in series and parallel circuits, explain
36239060	36246060	RC time constants, and how they relate to capacitance. Capacitance is the ability
36246060	36254060	of a device to store electrical energy. Capacitance is the ability of a device
36254060	36261060	to store electrical energy. Let me stop. The ability of a device to store electrical
36261060	36282060	energy. What does that sound like the definition of?
36282060	36290060	Mr. Carter. That sounds like the definition of a battery, doesn't it? The ability
36290060	36296060	to store electrical energy. So there's really not that big of a difference
36296060	36302060	between a capacitor and a storage cell. Typically, a storage cell is a small
36302060	36311060	amount of current over a long period of time. Unless you're a car battery.
36311060	36316060	But a capacitor generally is a large amount of current over a short period of time
36316060	36321060	that it's designed to expend, if you will. But the definitions are very, very,
36321060	36331060	very similar, very close. The key word on how a capacitor works is that
36331060	36337060	electrostatic field, electrostatic field. Remember inductors, they were
36337060	36345060	electromagnetic. This is electrostatic. Electrostatic. Talk about that
36345060	36351060	properly a little bit more in a bit. The letter C stands for capacitance. So inside
36351060	36359060	a schematic diagram, if you see a letter C equals its capacitor. If you see C22,
36359060	36369060	it's capacitor number 22 in the circuit. C47, capacitor number 47. A capacitor
36369060	36375060	is a device that possesses a specific amount of capacitance. How these things
36375060	36382060	are made are two conductors separated by an insulator. Two conductors separated
36382060	36388060	by an insulator. What does that sound like the definition for? Close your eyes
36388060	36391060	and think about it. Two conductors separated by an insulator. What does that
36391060	36399060	sound like? Banner. You made that up, man. What would the definition of an
36399060	36407060	extension cord be? Two conductors separated by an insulator. What would
36407060	36415060	speaker wire be? Yeah, so you know what? There are going to be a lot of things
36416060	36423060	that have capacitive properties because there are two electrical conductors
36423060	36428060	separated by an insulator. And a lot of these things that have capacitance is
36428060	36434060	stray capacitance and capacitance that we don't necessarily want. Engineers
36434060	36441060	don't want, but we have to deal with it because it's two conductors separated
36441060	36445060	by an insulator. Anytime you do that, you're going to end up with the property
36445060	36452060	of capacitance. Anytime you coil up your welding wire, your welding leads,
36452060	36457060	electro leads, you're going to create some inductive properties.
36463060	36466060	Yup.
36466060	36474060	Yup. And that actually, believe it or not, that style of twin lead antenna cable,
36474060	36479060	it was some of the most efficient. When properly installed, it had higher
36479060	36485060	efficiency than coaxial cable. The only thing is people would get that nice
36485060	36490060	ribbon cable and then back in the day, growing up in Connecticut, we had aluminum
36490060	36495060	windows and you'd run it through the window and slam the window down on it.
36495060	36499060	There goes any advantage that you had. But when you use the proper standoffs
36499060	36504060	and you use the proper bend radius and everything else directly to the back of
36504060	36509060	the set that had higher efficiency, it would get more RF energy into the back
36509060	36516060	of that television set than using coaxial cable. But it was two conductors
36516060	36523060	separated by a thick dielectric, thick insulator material. So that's one of the
36523060	36526060	things that really want you to come out of these lectures with is understanding
36526060	36532060	that, you know, this is not a lecture about capacitors. It's a discussion about
36532060	36539060	capacitance and capacitors. But the biggest thing is when you get into somebody
36539060	36545060	advanced classes like Peter Welty and his PCB design class, it's one of the
36545060	36552060	biggest challenges is determining stray capacitance inside a circuit.
36552060	36561060	When we're physically trying to create capacitance, we're going to call the
36561060	36568060	conductors plates. And we're going to call the insulator dielectric. So two plates
36568060	36575060	separated by a dielectric. Now that, Mr. Carter, is the definition of a capacitor.
36575060	36581060	Schematic diagram up at the top is a fixed capacitor, meaning what you see is
36581060	36593060	what you get within tolerances, of course. Down below is a variable capacitor. There's
36593060	36597060	actually different ways that they're going to be able to vary the capacitance. One is
36597060	36600060	going to be varying the distance between the plates. We'll talk about this more in
36600060	36604060	a bit. And the other is meshing the plates where they don't physically touch, but
36604060	36610060	they're just closer proximity, more and closer proximity to each other, less and
36610060	36617060	less proximity to each other. Make sense?
36617060	36627060	Treat all capacitors as though they were charged. Never touch both leads of a
36627060	36636060	capacitor with your hands. I've got a capacitor. Where the heck it went? I got to
36636060	36639060	get my stash better organized. Stuff disappears on here. I actually had a
36639060	36644060	student network for one of the biomedical companies, Medtronic, named the
36644060	36650060	Starter. Jumper kits for when you die. It's great. I see them. They got like Costco,
36650060	36658060	you know. You just got $680 worth of stuff in your cart at Costco. They revive you on
36658060	36665060	the spot. Make sure you pay your bill. Airlines got them now. We're going to charge
36665060	36670060	you $25 for that bag to check it. You know, you have a heart attack. They revive you.
36670060	36676060	So let me die here. Anyway, had a student network there, evening student of mine,
36676060	36682060	and he brought me a capacitor that was a key component in that. And right on the
36682060	36690060	capacitor was a label. The energy stored in this device could be lethal. The energy
36690060	36695060	stored in this device could be lethal. So if that capacitor is charged up and I
36695060	36702060	toss it until you touch it, it'll kill you dead. Because you're building up all of
36702060	36707060	that charge and then rapidly discharging it through your body, which is not designed
36707060	36712060	to do. Capacitor can hold that charge potential indefinitely if it doesn't have
36712060	36719060	a discharge path. A theoretically perfect capacitor will hold the charge forever.
36719060	36725060	Because of manufacturing flaws and defects and stuff, eventually that current will
36725060	36732060	dissipate. I remember when they were, I've been here for a while. Not when they were
36732060	36737060	building this building. Not when they were building that building, the new one. Not
36738060	36743060	when they were building this building, but when they were building that building, like
36743060	36748060	20 years ago. And there's actually a time capsule buried out there somewhere. And they
36748060	36753060	were looking for ideas from, you know, I'm like, let's charge up a capacitor and put it
36753060	36758060	in the time capsule. I mean, as an electronics guy, I think that'd be cool. Like, great,
36758060	36763060	let's take it out of its protective covering and see if any voltages still present. I
36763060	36767060	mean, I would have gotten a kick out of there all looking at me like I'm a goofball, you
36767060	36770060	know. I mean, I'll just think that would have been an outstanding freaking idea.
36777060	36784060	Because of the chemicals, a chemical cell will eventually dissipate. So it has a
36784060	36792060	shelf life. Lithium batteries have the longest shelf life. I mean, those, what are they,
36792060	36796060	the Energizer, whatever that you could buy, Lithium, best batteries they could buy, very
36796060	36800060	great product, innovative product, if you absolutely positively have to have a part of
36800060	36806060	electronic device work operate under extreme temperature conditions, whatever. Great shelf
36806060	36811060	life, use those batteries. So I just bought some and I think that it's good to the year
36811060	36815060	2025 or something on it. It's like, wow, that's a shelf life.
36816060	36823060	The basic unit of capacitance is the ferrad. A ferrad is the amount of capacitance that can
36823060	36831060	store one coulomb. Remember the coulomb? 6.24 x 10 to the 18th electrons of charge when a
36831060	36836060	capacitor is charged to one volt. So you've got a couple different things going on there.
36836060	36841060	You've got these two plates and what you're doing is you're charging it and what it's
36841060	36849060	doing is you're physically loading those plates up with a large number of electrons. And then
36849060	36855060	you're building up an electrostatic field across those two plates. So when you build up
36855060	36861060	one coulomb across the plates, we're able to store one coulomb of charge and bring the
36861060	36869060	capacitor up to one volt, we call that a ferrad. Now, typically the most important thing
36870060	36876060	that we're going to work with in electronics are going to be centered around the micro
36876060	36884060	ferrad. The typical value of measurement of capacitance is the micro ferrad, which is
36884060	36892060	times 10 to the negative 6th. And also the pico ferrad, which is times 10 to the negative
36892060	36904060	12th. So we go from the 6th to the 12th. What's between 6 and 12? Nano. You know, for the
36904060	36908060	longest time I used to put out in lecture, you will never see a nano ferrad capacitor
36908060	36912060	because they didn't use to make nano ferrad. Actually, you know what they used to call
36912060	36923060	nano ferrad capacitors? Millie micro. Millie micro. Three places past. Millie. No, micro.
36923060	36929060	Millie micro. Three places past micro, which would be nano. So we call that, they'd call
36929060	36936060	it millie micro ferrad, MMF, millie micro ferrad. Or they would call it tens of thousands
36936060	36946060	of pico ferrad. I don't know if it was a small letter N that just like freaked them out. Seriously.
36946060	36951060	I mean, sometimes it boils down to that. It was, you know, they'd have this congress that would meet
36951060	36956060	and analyze this stuff and they just wouldn't. So I used to put it out in lecture. You will never
36956060	36960060	see a nano ferrad capacitor. Whenever I put out absolute, somebody feels compelled to prove
36960060	36965060	geogrenic wrong. So the next day I was doing, hey, you know, I found this, my company is
36965060	36970060	using these. What's this? You know, it showed it to me. It was like a 20 nano ferrad capacitor.
36970060	36979060	Great. You're doing it. It should be a 20,000 pico ferrad capacitor. Or a 20 millie micro
36979060	36989060	ferrad capacitor. But, and I'm intentionally talking to you about this because traditionally
36989060	36995060	capacitor values have been all over the place. As far as how they label them and how they
36995060	37005060	identify them and sometimes determining what size capacitor is, it is, is very, very difficult.
37005060	37012060	And what a manufacturer labels it as. I mean, resistors were easy with color code. Sometimes you got to
37012060	37016060	trust the packaging on these things. What's up?
37016060	37021060	Do you remember what the ferrad rating of the capacitor the guy brought in from the distributor was?
37021060	37022060	No.
37022060	37024060	Hi.
37024060	37032060	Yeah. Yeah, I mean, enough to kill you. But yeah, you could really, don't do the stuff here.
37032060	37037060	I mean, that's one of the things. Again, we take safety seriously. But some of those big
37037060	37042060	capacities charge up, leave that there or, you know, in the Navy, which was different. We were
37042060	37047060	government property, you know, always used to do that crap, you know, charge it up and say,
37047060	37056060	hey, check this out, you know, here, catch. You know, stuff freaking hurt, man. It wasn't funny.
37056060	37060060	Go up to somebody with a charge capacitor and stick it on their neck.
37060060	37073060	Yeah, these people weren't trusted with our nuclear arsenal.
37073060	37078060	Basically, that's a high discharge device. You're using capacitors and inductors in there to create a high
37078060	37087060	voltage to make someone compliant.
37087060	37092060	A capacitor is either fixed or variable. A fixed capacitor has a definite value that cannot be
37092060	37099060	changed. It's made a certain way, if you will. A variable capacitor is one whose capacitance can be
37099060	37104060	changed by varying the space between the plates or by varying the amount of meshing between two
37104060	37110060	sets of plates. Although they say mesh, the plates never touch. They have to be kept electrically
37110060	37119060	isolated with an insulator in between, and that insulator could be air.
37119060	37127060	Factors affecting capacitance. Now, this is kind of important to understand these. If you understand these,
37127060	37139060	the math makes a lot of sense. The area of the plates, right? The bigger the area, well, actually,
37139060	37148060	let me put that formula up on the board. C is equal to Q over V. Remember that? Capacitance
37148060	37154060	measured in Farads is equal to Coulomb brought to a volt. One Coulomb brought to one volt equals
37154060	37160060	one Farad. It makes sense. So, area of the plate. What effect is that going to have? Is that going to
37160060	37166060	affect Q or is that going to affect V? Q. The bigger the plate, the more electrons that could
37166060	37172060	park on the plate physically, right? Because even though electrons are electrons, they still take up
37172060	37179060	space. They still are comprised of matter. So, very good. So, the bigger the plates, what effect
37179060	37190060	does that have on capacitance? Bigger plate? More capacitance. Smaller plate? Smaller
37190060	37198060	capacitance, right? Because Q and C are directly proportional, right? Because Q is sitting up on
37198060	37205060	top of this here. Distance between the plates. Distance between the plates. What's that going to
37205060	37217060	affect? So, what's that going to affect? Q or V? Think of the distance between the plates as like
37217060	37223060	regapping a spark plug. That's the distance between the electrodes. This is the distance between the
37223060	37230060	plates. The further that you move those plates away from each other, the higher the voltage you could
37230060	37236060	store on those plates. And that's where engineers have to determine what am I trying to do here? Am I
37236060	37243060	trying to store a lot of electrons? Am I trying to, you know, have a high voltage that I'm trying to
37243060	37251060	build up across it? What am I trying to do? So, engineers have to take that into account. So, if I
37251060	37259060	separate the two plates, that means my voltage that I could store will go up. If my voltage goes up,
37259060	37266060	what's my capacitance going to do? It's going to drop. So, engineers are faced with this compromise.
37266060	37271060	Higher voltage I could store, but I'm going to get less capacitance out of it. Why is capacitance
37271060	37276060	going to go down too? Well, when I separate those plates, that electrostatic field is going to diminish
37276060	37283060	because the plates are physically further away from each other. So, you separate the plates, get a
37283060	37289060	higher voltage on it, higher voltage, lower the capacitance. The type of dielectric material,
37289060	37296060	what effect is that going to have? Or what's that going to affect? There's a type of dielectric
37296060	37310060	material. Is that going to affect the Q or the V? Or the C? Well, I think it's going to affect the C.
37310060	37323060	Yeah. Why? Because of Q or V. Think about this one. What's it going to affect? Q, B, Z.
37323060	37338060	It's going to affect the voltage. Because if I've got two plates separated by air, and then now instead
37338060	37347060	of the air, I slip in a piece of mica. Mica has a higher dielectric constant than air, does it not?
37347060	37352060	Remember what I, you guys are deceiving me, man. Remember those lectures, early in the quarter?
37352060	37357060	We talked about different types of insulators. Mica was at the top of the chart. So, if I slip a piece
37357060	37361060	of mica between those two plates now, I could actually have those plates real close to each other
37361060	37368060	and slip some mica in there and really get a high voltage across those plates. Get a higher voltage
37368060	37377060	for the distance, because I'm using a dielectric material that has better dielectric properties.
37377060	37384060	So, that's how that's going to affect V. Effect V, it's going to affect C. And then temperature.
37384060	37393060	How is temperature going to affect this?
37393060	37408060	What changes with temperature? Yeah, but we're not talking about resistance here, so.
37408060	37413060	It's actually simpler than that. Something probably that you all knew even before you walked in here.
37413060	37421060	Things expand and contract with temperature. That's why there's expansion joints on bridges.
37421060	37428060	Because bridges expand and contract, and if not, they'd break. Oh no, it got over 70 degrees today.
37428060	37433060	The bridge broke. No, expansion joints, because things expand and contract.
37433060	37441060	Capacitors are going to expand and contract. So, as the plates expand, it can hold or affect Q
37441060	37449060	as the distance between the two changes, it's going to affect V. So, the bottom line is the amount of capacitance
37449060	37457060	will vary with temperature. For some circuits, like at room temperature, it's not that big of a deal.
37457060	37464060	For some stuff, I don't think in your wildest hallucinations, you've ever really thought it through
37464060	37472060	where a lot of electronic systems are used. I mean, it's a pretty harsh environment.
37472060	37481060	My favorite aircraft of all time, military aircraft, of all time, I just get so jazzed when I see one,
37481060	37489060	is the F-15 Fighting Falcon. These things were designed as high-altitude interceptors.
37489060	37495060	The closest to us right here are Portland, Oregon, the Oregon Air National Guard.
37495060	37500060	So, if you've ever flown commercially in and out of Portland or been down there, you might be on an Alaska Airlines jet
37500060	37506060	that has to give way to two F-15s that are taken off in front of you.
37506060	37515060	The F-15 still holds the unclassified time-to-climb record, 45,000 feet in one minute.
37515060	37521060	That basically means you're sitting at the end of the runway at Portland International Airport.
37521060	37527060	They give you the thumbs up, clear for takeoff. You advance the throttle as you kick in the afterburner.
37527060	37533060	And next thing, one minute later, 60 seconds later, you're passing through 45,000 feet.
37533060	37537060	These things are so good, they used them last summer when President Obama was in town.
37537060	37541060	And there was a small plane that penetrated the airspace up here.
37541060	37545060	The guy was flying into Kenmore in a float plane.
37545060	37550060	And they're watching them on radar, and they got concerned.
37550060	37553060	So, they called up the Oregon Air National Guard, and they said,
37553060	37556060	we know you've got a couple of fighters there and ready to stand by.
37556060	37560060	I think it's time to scramble them. And these guys were like, woo-hoo!
37560060	37566060	Because what they did is they not only got to take off, but they got to go supersonic.
37566060	37570060	They had to go on an intercept call. So, what they did is they went supersonic.
37570060	37577060	I'm sure you all heard about it, with the windows getting knocked out and the sonic booms.
37577060	37584060	Where I'm going with this, though, is imagine that airplane sitting on the runway down there in the middle of summer.
37584060	37589060	Sitting on the tarmac, 115, 120 degrees.
37589060	37595060	And then 60 seconds later, he's at 45,000 feet, where it's negative 45.
37595060	37601060	If electronics are not all in heated areas of that aircraft,
37601060	37607060	so if you've got a capacitor that is in an area that is prone to temperature change,
37607060	37609060	you're going to get different results.
37609060	37613060	Hopefully, that's not part of a targeting system on that aircraft,
37613060	37617060	where all of a sudden, you know, the military is smarter than that.
37617060	37624060	The reason temperature that it always strikes a chord with me, I was not always the best student.
37625060	37628060	Especially when I was in a lot of military schools.
37628060	37632060	I went to over 4500 hours of military schools, different systems.
37632060	37635060	I was in a great position, because as soon as the Russians came up with something,
37635060	37639060	we had to come up with something to detect it and counter it, and I was constantly in school.
37639060	37644060	I traveled to 46 of the 50 states on official business going to school, a lot of factory schools, a lot of stuff.
37644060	37648060	Long schools, and it was not a school day like yours. These are 8-hour days.
37648060	37651060	8-hour days, 5 days a week.
37651060	37656060	And it was back in the day, old school, so we used to go out for liquid lunches.
37660060	37665060	I used to sit in the back, and I was sitting there one day, and I'm like, you know,
37665060	37668060	falling asleep and hopefully not snoring too loud.
37668060	37671060	And I wake up, and the instructor is showing me this, you know,
37671060	37677060	they have the presentation, and they had, not PowerPoint, they had the view foils.
37677060	37681060	And they're showing this oven-ready light coming on.
37681060	37686060	And I'm like, oven-ready light, oven-ready light.
37686060	37691060	I like, I'm in electronic intercept and analysis.
37691060	37695060	Why is he talking about an oven-ready light coming on?
37695060	37699060	I mean, if this is like, I picked the wrong time to wake up,
37699060	37702060	because I don't have a freaking clue what he's talking about.
37702060	37705060	An oven-ready light, and I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it.
37705060	37709060	And actually what happened is this equipment was so sensitive,
37709060	37715060	it was very secret special equipment for measuring these very specific emissions from Soviet equipment,
37715060	37723060	that they put key sensitive temperature components in what was called an oven.
37723060	37729060	And what it was is a small metal box inside the piece of equipment.
37729060	37733060	And it had a heating coil, and it had a thermostat,
37733060	37737060	and it would keep that temperature stable,
37737060	37741060	so that the readings would be stable.
37741060	37745060	And if that oven-ready light was not on,
37745060	37748060	that told the technician that the oven wasn't on,
37748060	37752060	and the numbers, the results, could not be trusted.
37752060	37755060	So that was a big thing before you use that equipment,
37755060	37757060	is verifying that oven-ready light was on.
37757060	37760060	It was like, it's funny, because even though I slept through the lecture,
37760060	37763060	I still remember it like it happened yesterday.
37763060	37766060	This is not an endorsement to fall asleep in class.
37766060	37769060	But it was a blue light, it was this blue light.
37769060	37771060	And I always remember, because I'll tell you what,
37771060	37774060	we had, our labs were written tests,
37774060	37777060	and then we had practical labs that you had to go in and troubleshoot that equipment.
37777060	37780060	And I remember that the day I went into, you know,
37780060	37782060	I was basically being evaluated.
37782060	37784060	I had two instructors standing in there with clipboards,
37784060	37788060	and you know, let's see how Petty Officer Greenock evaluates this problem here.
37788060	37794060	So I walked in, and the first thing I noticed is the blue oven-ready light was not on.
37794060	37797060	So I knew immediately where the problem was.
37797060	37801060	And I, you know, I told them, oven-ready light's not on.
37801060	37803060	There's a problem with that circuitry, it got in there,
37803060	37805060	and basically it was like a fuse that was blown,
37805060	37808060	replace the fuse, boom, fix the problem.
37808060	37811060	If you're not a vigilant technician paying attention to that,
37811060	37817060	oh yeah, you could run through all the tests, oh everything's working okay.
37817060	37825060	So some key components like capacitors that are in real critical roles in circuits
37825060	37829060	may be put in a circuit or in a box called an oven
37829060	37832060	where they keep that temperature really stable.
37832060	37835060	For most stuff like this, you know, inside buildings and, you know,
37835060	37839060	whatever industrial controls, it's normally not an issue.
37839060	37843060	Normally even an automotive application, I've never heard about anybody, you know.
37843060	37848060	And actually cars are pretty freaking robust when you think about it.
37848060	37853060	I mean from, you know, I've been down in Arizona in the summer, you know,
37853060	37859060	it's like stuff is melting, plastic is melting, you know,
37859060	37863060	tires are melting on the cars, just nuts, you know.
37863060	37866060	And I went up to Alaska here in February,
37866060	37871060	and you know, that was like the week before I was up there, it was negative 47.
37871060	37875060	So you go to Fairbanks Airport, you land, you're going to rent a car,
37875060	37879060	and it's buried in snow, but you just follow the extension cord from the post
37879060	37882060	and it's all on a block heater, you dust it all off.
37882060	37885060	It's all powder snow up there because it's so cold and so dry.
37885060	37887060	Turn the key, fire it up.
37887060	37890060	Every place you go, the hotel's all have a place to plug into though,
37890060	37894060	I mean it's just, you know, but still that extreme cold is like, wow,
37894060	37900060	the electronics work reasonably well from Arizona to Alaska.
37901060	37905060	Keep these four factors in mind, they're critical.
37905060	37910060	Dielectric constant, this is the measure of the effectiveness of a material as an insulator.
37910060	37915060	Some materials of dielectric constant, paper, has a dielectric constant between two and three.
37915060	37919060	Typically what they're talking about here is wax paper.
37919060	37924060	Wax paper, wax paper used to be used as the dielectric, as the insulator
37924060	37928060	in a lot of capacitors prior to World War II.
37928060	37932060	I've actually restored many an antique radio by simply going in,
37932060	37935060	removing the paper caps that have deteriorated,
37935060	37939060	and putting in mica caps of the same value.
37939060	37941060	Right, just that easy, remove it.
37941060	37945060	Everybody always gets an old radio, and oh yeah, it must be them, they're tubes.
37945060	37949060	Them tubes there need to be replaced.
37949060	37952060	Every start a handful of radios haven't replaced one tube.
37952060	37956060	Got in there, replaced the capacitors, why paper capacitors?
37956060	37959060	What happens to paper over time, deteriorates?
37959060	37964060	If deteriorates, loses its dielectric constant, capacitor shorts out, doesn't work.
37964060	37970060	Micah, dielectric constant between five and six.
37970060	37974060	This should be tantalum, not titanium.
37974060	37980060	Titanium, they're using that in golf clubs, in Soviet submarines.
37980060	37982060	This is tantalum.
37982060	37986060	Tantalum is a material that has a high dielectric property.
37986060	37991060	So by putting it in a tantalum capacitor, it gives you a big bang for the buck.
37991060	37996060	Some of the best capacitors that money will buy, tantalum.
37996060	38000060	Electrolytic capacitors, these are large capacitance for size and weight.
38000060	38004060	Consist of two metal foils separated by fine gauze saturated with a chemical paste
38004060	38007060	called an electrolyte.
38007060	38011060	They're polarized, having a positive and negative lead.
38011060	38021060	If you put an electrolytic capacitor into a circuit backwards, it will explode.
38021060	38024060	Literally.
38024060	38028060	If you put one of these in a circuit backwards, it will explode.
38028060	38035060	Some of the smaller caps actually have, where like there's an X etched on the top
38035060	38040060	so when it blows, it'll blow outward and not necessarily build.
38040060	38044060	I knew a guy that played around with explosives and stuff in the past.
38044060	38046060	It's all about keeping it compressed.
38046060	38050060	Those gases are compressed and it's going to give you a bigger bang.
38050060	38053060	Some of those small caps that don't have a little release mechanism on it,
38053060	38055060	you can throw some shrapnel.
38055060	38058060	Some of the big caps actually have a release valve on it.
38058060	38060060	So if you put it in backwards, pow.
38060060	38063060	But I've seen smoke pouring out on like a smoke bomb.
38063060	38066060	If you ever want to blow up caps, let Peter and myself know.
38066060	38069060	And we want to do it in a controlled, contained environment.
38069060	38071060	You just do it for kicks in the lab.
38071060	38073060	Somebody could lose an eye. Seriously.
38073060	38076060	You know, there's a little metal cans and you put it in backwards.
38076060	38078060	These things blow.
38078060	38081060	Shrapnel is going to go flying.
38081060	38083060	You guys actually have to pull the area?
38083060	38086060	I've done it before out in the back.
38086060	38089060	You know, we rope off an area and it was actually funny.
38089060	38091060	We were doing that one evening, years ago.
38091060	38093060	Blown up capacitors, you know.
38093060	38095060	And pow, pow, pow.
38095060	38099060	Put them in series of parallel and doing all kinds of wacky stuff, you know.
38099060	38105060	And literally, I had, we were doing it in the back here.
38105060	38108060	And you know the second floor up above the restaurant,
38108060	38111060	that patio area between the two buildings?
38111060	38114060	I had debris raining down on that.
38114060	38119060	So nobody really cared about it until I went to the custodians
38119060	38124060	and I asked for like some, you know, brooms and stuff to clean it up.
38124060	38127060	And then it was kind of like, well, they all got puzzled and stuff
38127060	38129060	because they were like, oh, union here?
38129060	38132060	And they were like, if it's a mess, you know, we need to clean it up.
38132060	38135060	It's like, well, my students made this freaking huge mess out here
38135060	38136060	from blowing up crap.
38136060	38138060	No, no, we'll clean it up, you know.
38138060	38141060	Oh, I'm sorry, you know, it's file of grievance
38141060	38144060	because we're going to clean up the mess we made, you know.
38144060	38145060	It was just an odd time.
38145060	38148060	I guess it's still an odd time, you know, here.
38148060	38151060	But my personal collection of capacitors.
38151060	38153060	These are all electrolytic capacitors.
38153060	38156060	And on the electrolytic capacitors,
38156060	38158060	you've got to look for the markings here
38158060	38160060	to find which lead is the negative lead
38160060	38162060	and which one's the positive lead.
38162060	38165060	And there will be some discerning mark on it.
38165060	38167060	Some manufacturers identify the negative lead,
38167060	38169060	some identify the positive lead.
38169060	38171060	You just got to pay particular attention.
38171060	38173060	This here, like with the band on it,
38173060	38175060	that would signify the negative lead.
38175060	38177060	See that solid band?
38177060	38180060	You just got to look and be observant.
38180060	38182060	Put it in backwards.
38182060	38185060	It will explode.
38185060	38189060	Paper and plastic caps, construction by a rolled foil technique.
38189060	38193060	Plastic film is often used more often.
38193060	38197060	Basically, if you went and got two rolls of aluminum foil
38197060	38202060	and a roll of wax paper or a roll of saran wrap, right,
38202060	38205060	laid out one roll, put the insulator on top of it,
38205060	38207060	laid the other roll out, we rolled it all up,
38207060	38209060	dipped it in wax, attached leads to it,
38209060	38214060	dipped it in wax, you just made yourself a capacitor.
38214060	38217060	So if you want to roll your own, you can roll your own.
38217060	38220060	You make it out of paper, same thing.
38220060	38223060	And that's exactly what paper caps were.
38223060	38227060	Two pieces of foil with wax paper between them,
38227060	38231060	the leads attached, dipped in wax.
38231060	38235060	And that wax didn't prevent that paper
38235060	38239060	from deteriorating over time.
38239060	38242060	These are plastic caps here.
38242060	38245060	Basically, if you sliced that open with an exacto knife,
38245060	38249060	you'd find nothing but rolls of aluminum foil
38249060	38253060	wrapped around plastic.
38253060	38255060	Ceramic disc capacitors are popular
38255060	38257060	because they're inexpensive to produce.
38257060	38260060	They're used for values 0.1 microfarad and smaller.
38260060	38262060	Ceramic is the dielectric.
38262060	38266060	They're reliable general-purpose capacitors.
38266060	38270060	This is my personal collection.
38270060	38275060	I get all my ceramics from Mexico.
38275060	38280060	A lot of them manufactured there.
38280060	38285060	It's not electrolytic.
38285060	38289060	Ceramic, these don't have a positive or negative lead.
38289060	38294060	It's only the electrolytic that does.
38294060	38295060	Check out the value of this.
38295060	38297060	This is 3KV.
38297060	38299060	It'll hand up to 3,000 volts.
38299060	38302060	You exceed that, you destroy the capacitor.
38302060	38307060	You operate all day long underneath that.
38307060	38309060	Variable capacitors are also known as
38309060	38314060	patterns, tremors, or tuners.
38314060	38317060	This is a tuning capacitor.
38317060	38326060	This is something you'd find in a 1960s, 50s, 60s, 70s radio.
38326060	38329060	Elegant.
38329060	38330060	Elegant in design.
38330060	38333060	They don't make stuff like this no more.
38333060	38337060	How many of these went to the landfill?
38337060	38339060	A lot of these, the shaft right here,
38339060	38343060	this would actually be a ball bearing movement right there
38343060	38344060	with a heavy grease in there,
38344060	38346060	and you turn it ever so slightly.
38346060	38348060	And actually what they would do with this,
38348060	38350060	they'd put a big pulley on here,
38350060	38354060	and then there'd be a string that was attached to your tuning dial.
38354060	38356060	So when you move that knob just a little bit,
38356060	38359060	it would ever so slightly move that tuning cap.
38359060	38361060	And that's how you would adjust,
38361060	38365060	by adjusting the capacitance, you would tune your radio.
38365060	38369060	Now it's done all electronically.
38369060	38376060	So this is something kind of from a bygone era.
38376060	38380060	Which is good and bad in some ways, I don't know.
38380060	38384060	I don't think these new tuners have the sensitivity
38384060	38385060	that those old tuners had.
38385060	38387060	And I saw the transition of the military.
38387060	38390060	When I first got into electronic intelligence gathering,
38390060	38392060	they were manually operated tuners.
38392060	38396060	I used to have to sit there and manually tune through,
38396060	38400060	find a target of interest, intercept the analyzer.
38400060	38403060	I saw the transition to computer operated systems,
38403060	38405060	and it boggled my mind.
38405060	38407060	I was actually, I rode my submarine out here,
38407060	38409060	and my sub was going to get a new system.
38409060	38412060	So I rode it here, the work was being done in Bremerton,
38412060	38414060	then they flew me back to Connecticut for the summer.
38414060	38415060	I actually drove.
38415060	38418060	It was kind of funny, I used to tell the Navy I had a fear of flying.
38418060	38419060	That's why I'm in the Navy.
38419060	38422060	So because I rode to so many schools,
38422060	38424060	they would always, they'd pay me to travel.
38424060	38427060	So it was like, I don't know, 300 miles a day,
38427060	38429060	per diem and hotels and whatever.
38429060	38434060	So I used to get like 14 days off the drive to Connecticut.
38434060	38437060	So I'd like go to San Diego and goof off for a week and a half.
38437060	38443060	And I like marathon across the country or whatever, you know.
38443060	38446060	But anyway, I was getting sent to this school
38446060	38450060	where there's going to be computer controlled receivers.
38450060	38453060	And my computer controlled receivers,
38453060	38456060	I mean, it was like, it's like some robotic arm is going to come out
38456060	38458060	and like tune the dial.
38458060	38460060	I mean, how do you do that?
38460060	38461060	I mean, I'm serious.
38461060	38464060	I was just, I had no freaking clue what they were talking about.
38464060	38468060	And that's not what they were talking about.
38468060	38472060	But I just don't think we ever had the sensitivity
38472060	38475060	that those old manual tuners had.
38475060	38478060	The newer systems, of course, were much more efficient.
38478060	38480060	And they, you know, once you integrate computers,
38480060	38481060	you can process the data.
38481060	38484060	The data is only getting processed as well as it was programmed.
38484060	38491060	But yeah, those old tuners, boy, I could listen to some stuff way out,
38491060	38492060	way out there.
38492060	38494060	We'd be a way to heck out in the middle of nowhere
38494060	38498060	and I could tune stuff in with a good antenna and good receiver.
38498060	38500060	Series capacitors.
38500060	38502060	Yeah, you're not looking at a tight ball.
38502060	38510060	When you have capacitors in series, you treat them like resistors in parallel.
38510060	38513060	Does anybody know why that is?
38513060	38518060	Why do you suppose?
38518060	38524060	It's a good try.
38524060	38529060	Okay, these three capacitors are in series, are they not?
38529060	38531060	What am I really limited to here?
38531060	38535060	I'm limited to this plate area here, am I not?
38535060	38538060	And this plate area here.
38538060	38541060	What am I actually doing?
38541060	38543060	I'm increasing the distance between the plates,
38543060	38545060	which means that my voltage goes up,
38545060	38548060	that means my capacitance has to go down.
38548060	38549060	Makes sense?
38549060	38553060	That's why that formula works.
38553060	38559060	Plus, I got now, I've gotten one, two, three times the insulated material,
38559060	38561060	as opposed to one time the insulated material.
38561060	38562060	Makes sense?
38562060	38565060	So everything always goes back to this formula.
38565060	38567060	Everything in electronics always is explained away with the formula.
38567060	38579060	In parallel...
38579060	38582060	What am I doing here?
38582060	38585060	I've got this plate, this plate, and this plate.
38585060	38589060	Now here, I triple the size of my plates.
38589060	38594060	I triple the size of my electrostatic field that I could build up across the two.
38594060	38595060	So what am I doing?
38595060	38601060	I'm increasing my Q, which increases my C.
38601060	38604060	That's why that formula works.
38604060	38606060	So, I don't know if that helps you,
38606060	38609060	but it helps me remember formulas if I understand how the formula works.
38609060	38614060	If I just give you a formula, C is equal to Q over V.
38614060	38616060	Okay, I'll remember that.
38616060	38618060	That's not going to do you any good.
38618060	38620060	If you remember, C is equal to Q over V.
38620060	38622060	Increase the area of the plates.
38622060	38624060	I could store more Q.
38624060	38625060	Q goes up.
38625060	38628060	C goes up.
38628060	38631060	Distance between the plates increases.
38631060	38632060	V goes up.
38632060	38633060	C goes down.
38633060	38635060	Inverse proportional relationship.
38635060	38637060	Makes sense?
38637060	38643060	RC time constant reflects the time required for a capacitor to charge 63.2% of the applied voltage
38643060	38646060	or to discharge down 63.2%.
38646060	38648060	It's not a tight boat.
38648060	38650060	It's the way I worded it intentionally on this slide.
38650060	38653060	You're decreasing down 63.2%.
38653060	38660060	236.8%.
38660060	38662060	This is what the circuit's going to look like.
38662060	38663060	This is the formula.
38663060	38665060	T is equal to R times C.
38665060	38667060	It's going to take five time constants.
38667060	38670060	And physically, what's happening with this?
38670060	38673060	What kind of circuit is this?
38673060	38674060	Series.
38674060	38677060	Series RC circuit.
38677060	38679060	It's a series RC circuit.
38679060	38684060	And when I close this switch, this capacitor here is going to be at zero volts,
38684060	38688060	and it's going to start charging up to 100%.
38688060	38691060	How long is it going to take to get to 100%?
38691060	38693060	Five time constants.
38693060	38696060	How do I figure out what one time constant is equal to?
38696060	38698060	T is equal to R times C.
38698060	38707060	When this capacitor is at 100%, what voltage is going to be across R1?
38708060	38713060	When capacitor C1 is at 100% after the passage of five time constants,
38713060	38716060	what voltage is going to be present across R1?
38716060	38717060	Zero.
38717060	38719060	Zero.
38719060	38728060	When 63.2% of the voltage is across C1, where's the remaining voltage going to be?
38728060	38729060	R1.
38729060	38730060	Across R1.
38730060	38734060	So basically, as the capacitor is increasing in voltage,
38734060	38738060	the resistor is decreasing in voltage.
38738060	38744060	Because this is not only a series circuit, it's also a voltage divider.
38744060	38747060	It's a voltage divider.
38747060	38751060	After five time constants, this voltage will be equal to this voltage.
38751060	38756060	Voltage rise, voltage drop.
38756060	38762060	After five time constants, this is equal to this, which means there's zero left over.
38762060	38764060	Kirchoff's voltage law.
38764060	38767060	Everything always goes back to what we talked about.
38767060	38771060	I'm really not talking about a whole lot of new stuff here.
38771060	38774060	I'm getting paid to talk about the same old stuff.
38774060	38777060	Just every week I introduce a new word.
38777060	38780060	This week it was inductance.
38780060	38782060	Capacitance.
38782060	38784060	What is it five times?
38784060	38785060	Why?
38785060	38787060	Why not B2?
38787060	38793060	Because in five times, you basically get close to 100%.
38793060	38795060	That's why we call it five times.
38795060	38797060	It's really between five and six times.
38797060	38800060	Some books say six time constants.
38800060	38803060	Some say five.
38803060	38807060	But you're so close to 100%.
38807060	38815060	Because the six would be 63% of 99.3% for the sixth constant.
38815060	38823060	Because on the fifth constant, it would be 99.6%, right?
38823060	38826060	After five time constants, we call it even.
38826060	38831060	The books that you say do sometimes have a sixth time constant.
38831060	38836060	If you're dealing with real high power stuff, that could be a difference.
38836060	38840060	If it was high power and a high voltage, it could be the difference of a couple of volts.
38840060	38842060	That's a small percentage.
38842060	38845060	But generally, it's accepted five time constants.
38845060	38850060	Every exam you take here, it would be five time constants.
38850060	38856060	In summary, capacitance is that property that stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field.
38856060	38861060	A capacitor is a specific device designed to possess the property of capacitance.
38861060	38863060	Fixed capacitor symbol.
38863060	38866060	On the top, variable capacitor symbol on the bottom.
38866060	38872060	Capacitance is measured in farads, developed by a guy by the name of Joe Farad.
38872060	38877060	Microfarads, picofarads are typically the most often used values.
38877060	38883060	Instead of nano, you may see milli-micro, or you may see tens of thousands of picot.
38883060	38888060	The letter C represents capacitance, four factors affect capacitance.
38888060	38893060	Area of the plates, distance between the plates, types of materials, and temperature.
38893060	38898060	Capacitor types include electrolytic, paper, plastic, ceramic, or variable.
38898060	38904060	To add up capacitance in series, you use the parallel formula.
38904060	38909060	To add them up in parallel, you use the series formula.
38909060	38914060	And to determine capacitive time constants, we use the formula T is equal to R times C.
38914060	38920060	Any questions?
38920060	38926060	Alright, let's go ahead and take about a ten minute break.
38926060	38932060	And when we come back, section two of the book, AC circuits.
