1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Okay, since you know who I am and you know how I operate, I'm all about protocols, not

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,480
putting the proverbial cart before the horse.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,920
That being said, tonight, one night, one night only, we're going to put the cart before the

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,760
horse.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,560
The way that I want you to approach ELEC 110, and this is a recipe for success, because

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,520
like I said, I've been doing this for a couple of years, I know what works and I know what

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
doesn't.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,440
And I guarantee you, I guarantee you, if you follow the syllabus, if you do all the assignments

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
that you're given, if you follow that recipe for success, you will be successful, you'll

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
pass this class.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Guarantee it.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,080
I don't know if any of you also know, Lake Washington Technical College has a guarantee

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,840
that if you graduate our program, go into industry, and your local, whoever you go to

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,520
work for says you don't know what you're talking about, we will re-educate you for free to

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,520
get you to the standard that industry says, you know, how many students have been sent

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,480
back to the electronics program?

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Zero.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Zero.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,160
So I know it's working.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,200
So keep in mind, the way that this is supposed to work, I think this really is the best recipe

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,760
for success, is I like to read through the chapter very quickly.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,120
And what that does is like format your hard drive for what you're about to receive.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,360
That of course is a given that you've already reviewed the syllabus.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,080
In reviewing the syllabus, that shows you specifically, like on page one they start,

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,160
the course outcomes and objectives, and then you look at how those course outcomes and

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,160
objectives of the syllabus, which is really the training contract between you and I, how

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:03,040
closely the book and the chapter works meet those objectives.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,520
So read through the objectives in the syllabus first, then read through chapter one, or chapter

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,080
17, whatever chapter you're on, just like a book.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,960
But this isn't a book, it's a textbook.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,360
So when you get to the end, it's not going to be like, oh, I never knew it was going

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
to turn out like that, okay?

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,240
I mean, this is a textbook.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,360
It's a text slash reference book.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,960
After you've read through the chapter, then go through it with a fine tooth comb.

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,600
Whenever you come to an example or a problem, take out your calculator and do the math and

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,280
follow along and do every practice problem.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,960
Keep note of that because that's going to be part of your written assignment.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,680
Then when you're all done with the chapter, then I'd read through it again very, very

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,080
quickly just to make sure you retained all that information.

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Some of the stuff that we're going to talk about tonight in chapter one like atoms, molecules,

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
you probably have heard before, right?

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
The periodic table.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,680
A lot of you have heard that already before.

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,100
So keep that in mind that if you're going through the book and the book is talking about stuff

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,480
that you already know, you don't need to beat that to death.

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,640
And that's actually good because it's going to draw you to focus your attention on those

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
areas that you don't understand.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,920
And you're going to be able to dump all of your energy into the stuff you don't understand.

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Does that make sense?

51
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,840
I mean, it sounds really basic when you think about it like that, but that's really what's

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,200
going to be the most effective means of traversing this.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,640
Normally, I will not lecture on a chapter until you've read the chapter, done your homework,

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:53,440
and gotten together in your teams and completed a peer review, right, of your homework.

55
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,520
Once your homework has gone through that process and then you've got completed homework, then

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,640
come into lecture because you know what I want to spend my time and lecture, lecturing

57
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,080
on?

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,240
What you didn't get out of the book.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,280
What you didn't get out of the assignments.

60
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,160
That's how I want to spend the majority of my time in lecture.

61
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Fair enough?

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,800
Okay.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Let's get started.

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,680
These slides here actually follow the book.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,640
And these slides, by the way, are available online on the Google site.

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,360
The TAs helped you out on how to get that site.

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,640
The links are right there in your syllabus.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,760
So what you could do is you could download these from the site to your computer and then

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,840
put them on your laptop or home computer and have the same slides that I'm showing you

70
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
tonight.

71
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,000
Also, there are audio files of this lecture, an MP3 format, that you could download, Joe

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,680
Greenock on MP3, right, and listen to me when you're working out at the gym or running

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,200
from the police or whatever it is you do when you listen to MP3s.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,400
And then also, we're going to be adding to this now videotape of the lecture that we've

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,800
got our TAs back there working on right now.

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,680
So ultimately, we'll be able to upload that.

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,920
And the reason that I go out of my way with recordings, with the slides, I've got nothing

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
to hide.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I've got nothing to hide.

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,440
As a matter of fact, I want to give you as much information as I possibly can so that

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,240
you could benefit from that information.

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
And you know what?

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,840
How many of you here own any DVDs, your favorite movies?

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
Why would you own a copy of a movie?

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Why would you do that?

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,680
Isn't seeing it once good enough?

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Why would you go out and buy DVDs of a movie?

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Because they're cheap.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,120
Unless they're given away, so it costs money.

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
What's that?

91
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah.

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:03,200
If you could watch it any time you want, but why specifically would you purchase a particular

93
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
movie?

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Because it encompasses your interest.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Exactly.

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,400
It encompasses your interest.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,560
And for those of you that have movies, how many of you have watched a movie the second

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,600
time and picked up stuff out of it the second time around that?

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,640
There's some movies I've seen in the theater that I'm like, I got to go out and get that

100
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,000
DVD because I want to see this again.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Yeah, I know how it ends up, but I want to see it because I missed something in the beginning

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,840
and I want to look for that thing that I missed in the beginning or whatever.

103
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,360
So it's perfectly natural for you to want to hear this lecture over and over again.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,320
For some of you, once might be good enough.

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,560
I go to church on Sunday, my pastor normally, he gets up there and he preaches.

106
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I get it right the first time.

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,280
I don't need to hear it again.

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,200
For some other people though, and actually at my church they do audio recordings and

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,520
then people can listen to that content.

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,640
They want to hear it again.

111
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,920
Normally I get it the first time that's the kind of guy that I am, that's the type of

112
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,280
learner that I am.

113
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
Look at that.

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
That's the other thing too with taking notes.

115
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,000
Some of you, it's been a while since you've been in school.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Try to hone your note-taking skills.

117
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,680
When I emphasize something, I'm usually emphasizing it for a reason and that reason is you may

118
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,600
see it again in the future on a quiz, on an exam, but most importantly, you may see it

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,840
in industry because one of the things I don't want to do is teach you the exam, teach you

120
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
the quiz.

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,720
That's not what it's all about.

122
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,000
One of the things that I want to share with you is I'm not really concerned.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,520
I mean, I want all of you to pass my quizzes.

124
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,920
I want you to all pass my exam.

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,360
I want you to all pass this class, but to be totally honest with you, do you know how

126
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
I measure your success?

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:52,160
I measure your success as to where are you going to be five years from now?

128
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
Did I give you anything out of this course that helps you in that position you're in

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
in five years?

130
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,480
In ten years.

131
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,520
The payoff for me is when you call me and say, Joe, I'm in town or I'm passing through.

132
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,480
I'd like to buy you lunch.

133
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,680
I like lunch.

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Swing by, buy me lunch.

135
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Tell me what's going on.

136
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,960
Tell me what you're doing now and how I had an impact on that.

137
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,880
I actually, I went on a cruise over Spring Break, Caribbean.

138
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,280
I was just getting ready to get on the ship and I get all my emails forwarded to my phone

139
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,240
and I got an email from a student that I had in 1993 and he introduced himself and he says,

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,040
I don't know if you remember me.

141
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,160
My response back to him, of course I remember you, you know, because again, we established

142
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,280
a relationship, a professional relationship, but he graduated.

143
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,840
He went down to California, kind of dropped off the radar.

144
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,920
He was going to be in the area and was wondering if I'd be available next Friday to get together

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,720
and we could visit and I said, Alice, she's unfortunately I'm out of town and, you know,

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,200
that is how I measured the success.

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,320
Number one, that he remembered me.

148
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,800
Number two, what he learned here is part of his present reality.

149
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
So that's what I want all of you to think about.

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah, you want to pass the quiz, you want to pass the exam, you want to pass the class,

151
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
but where are you really going to use this stuff?

152
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,720
Anyway, kicking things off here, this is section one of the book, section one of the book.

153
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,400
Every of the texts that deals with what are called DC circuits, DC stands for direct

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,360
current and we're going to talk about the difference between direct current and alternating

155
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,240
current throughout this.

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:45,040
Chapter one deals with the fundamentals of electricity and I got to tell you that these

157
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,520
first few chapters are like sacred chapters, you know.

158
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,200
We should like ring bells and like hit gongs and chimes or whatever when we speak of some

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,880
of this stuff because if you want to be successful in electricity and electronics, these things

160
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,920
that we're going to speak of are critical attributes of what makes stuff work.

161
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,480
As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag from the get go.

162
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:26,680
The four, the big four things that we're looking at that drive this entire industry are four

163
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:35,440
properties, the properties are voltage, current, resistance, and power.

164
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
Voltage, current, resistance, and power, voltage, current, resistance, and power.

165
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
My cell phone works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.

166
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,120
My car computer works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.

167
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Satellite TV works because of voltage, current, resistance, and power.

168
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
Anything electrical or electronic works because of those four.

169
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,740
So what we really need to ensure is that these four properties that we're going to discuss,

170
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,680
we fully understand up one side and down the other.

171
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,880
As I said earlier, I've been doing this like since puberty, so you would think that I know

172
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,960
everything there is to know about voltage, current, resistance, and power, no, I do not.

173
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,600
Occasionally I get questions from students that are associated with those properties

174
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,160
that I can't quite answer, even though I've been doing this for so long.

175
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,480
So I'm on a continual journey to learn as much as I can about those four properties.

176
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,040
So we're going to kick things off of chapter one here, dealing with the fundamentals of

177
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,680
electricity, but pay special attention to those four properties, voltage, current, resistance,

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,960
and power, the big four, I like to call them the big four, because they are the big four.

179
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,040
It's what everything is based on.

180
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,520
If you know what's going on with voltage, current, resistance, and power, you know what's

181
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,280
going on inside the circuit, we're going to talk about that.

182
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,600
So kicking things off, fundamentals of electricity.

183
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,080
One of the things that I do at the start of every lecture is I review the objectives.

184
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:08,680
The objectives that I review are the same objectives that are on the syllabus.

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,160
That's a pretty good reason why I selected this textbook to use.

186
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,280
Although there's errors in this textbook, although it's not the best textbook on the

187
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:25,440
face of the planet, the objectives in the textbook reflect the objectives in the syllabus.

188
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,520
One of the other things I want you to fully understand is I don't teach the textbook.

189
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,720
I teach the curriculum.

190
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,520
The curriculum is contained in the syllabus.

191
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:46,400
The curriculum is derived through input from our local industry advisory committee.

192
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,920
This is a group of volunteers that get together on a regular basis, sit down and tell us what

193
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,280
we need to be doing for this program to stay competitive.

194
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,800
This book works really good because you're going to do all the chapters in it, but occasionally

195
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,520
in the future you may get some textbooks that the instructor is going to say you don't need

196
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
to do this chapter.

197
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Why?

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,600
It's not part of the curriculum.

199
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Local industry really doesn't think it's important that you learn that aspect of it.

200
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,160
So does that make sense?

201
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,200
One of the reasons that I review the objectives as well is to prepare you for what you're

202
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
about to receive.

203
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,640
It's like formatting your hard drive so that when I start talking about this stuff, you're

204
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,080
kind of like ready to store that information away on your hard drive, your mental hard

205
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,120
drive, your brain.

206
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
So let's take a look at this here.

207
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,040
Objectives after completing this chapter, the student will be able to define matter,

208
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,760
element, and molecule.

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,600
There's three questions right off the quiz.

210
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,440
Define matter, define element, define molecule.

211
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
It's an objective.

212
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,600
I hope at the end of this chapter you can define those.

213
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,080
Notice the parts of an atom.

214
00:13:52,080 --> 00:14:01,040
Define the valence shell of an atom and identify the unit for measuring current.

215
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Draw the symbol used to represent current flow in a circuit.

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,080
Describe the difference between conductors and insulators and semiconductors.

217
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,400
Define difference of potential, electromotive force, and voltage.

218
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Voltage.

219
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,640
Wasn't that one of the big four?

220
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,640
So again, if this was like church would be ringing bells or gong, you know, we'll talk

221
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
about projects later.

222
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,880
Some of you may want to build sound effects so that we could, you know, whenever we do

223
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:37,800
that stuff, or dim the lights, voltage.

224
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,520
Draw the symbol used to represent voltage.

225
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,440
Identify the unit used to measure voltage.

226
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
To measure voltage.

227
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,600
Define resistance, gong.

228
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
For the big four.

229
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,920
Identify characteristics of resistance, gong, in a circuit.

230
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,320
Identify the unit for measuring resistance and draw the symbol used to represent resistance

231
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,440
in a circuit.

232
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,600
Everything you are about to learn as it pertains to electricity and electronics is traceable

233
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,400
back to matter.

234
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,880
Do any of you here know anything about matter?

235
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,280
Do you know what matters?

236
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:38,200
Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight.

237
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Does anybody know where we could find the absence of matter?

238
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Does anybody know?

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,320
Can we create this condition here on planet Earth?

240
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Vacuum.

241
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
And I'm not talking about the auric five pound upright.

242
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,880
I don't think that's what you're talking about, right?

243
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,480
What kind of vacuum are you talking about?

244
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,100
It's called industrial vacuum.

245
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:16,560
And in essence, what we're talking about is pumping all of the matter out of a vessel.

246
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,560
So that all is that's left inside is space, empty space.

247
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
It's used a lot, a lot of you that go into high tech careers, you're going to see this

248
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,120
process used in the manufacturing process because it allows us to only put into the

249
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,840
chamber what we want to be into the chamber.

250
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,280
Where can we find a large abundance of an absence of matter?

251
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Space.

252
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,880
And you know the odd thing about it is that's why it's called space.

253
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,240
Because there's no matter.

254
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,080
There's no matter.

255
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,000
Now if you're in a spaceship traveling through space and you roll the window down and you

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,960
stick your butterfly net out and you pick up some cosmic debris in your butterfly net,

257
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,600
pretty odd thing to do, down a space suit if you're going to roll the window down in

258
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
the spaceship.

259
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:23,160
But if you find any cosmic debris in your net, that means that you have found matter.

260
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Because if it's something and it occupies space and it has weight, therefore it's matter.

261
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,520
Have any of you heard of antimatter?

262
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,320
We will not be talking about that here in this program.

263
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,280
I used to think it was science fiction until I was talking about it in a lecture like this

264
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,960
and I had a student raise their hand and we're not going to talk about it because I don't

265
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,000
know anything, you know, the absence of matter, antimatter, the opposite of matter.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,160
And he brought in an article the next week about a NASA project and these NASA teams

267
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,880
are all about funding.

268
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,960
So all these PhDs and all these scientists, it's all about getting money for them to continue

269
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,440
their research.

270
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,760
Well NASA was running out of money and there was a particular group that was doing research

271
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,400
and they were going to get their operation shut down.

272
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,320
So as soon as they all were basically put on notice, you all are no longer going to

273
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,120
have a job at NASA.

274
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,080
They're like, oh geez, you know, that's too bad, you know, that's really bad.

275
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,160
Well, why is it so bad?

276
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Well, we just discovered a cloud of antimatter and we think it's headed this way, you know.

277
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,960
So right away, you know, NASA gives them more money to continue the research and somewhere

278
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,400
in my archives, I've actually got a picture of this antimatter cloud that, you know, I

279
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,600
mean who knows if it even exists, but obviously if antimatter collides with matter, they cancel

280
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,840
each other out.

281
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,560
So if there was antimatter cloud that inundated our solar system, we'd be gone.

282
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,240
You know, I don't know where we'd go, but this is what they say.

283
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,440
Enough said, we won't be talking about antimatter in this class.

284
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,480
We're more concerned about matter.

285
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,880
Now the basic building block of all matter that we're aware of, and this is really interesting,

286
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,600
is what's known as an element.

287
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,720
An element can be found on the periodic table.

288
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
I must not be a real professor.

289
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,040
If I was a real professor, I'd have one of those pull down charts that's got the periodic

290
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,600
table in all the squares, you know.

291
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,880
That's the sign of a true professor.

292
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
I don't have one of those.

293
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,800
I could probably call it up on my computer screen, but it wouldn't be the same of having

294
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,880
one of those pull down charts where you go with the pointer, right?

295
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,200
And you've all seen that.

296
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
You all know what I'm talking about, right?

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,320
Probably saw it back in elementary school.

298
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,740
Elements of the basic building block in nature cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by

299
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,480
chemical means.

300
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:04,360
And believe it or not, there are only about a hundred known elements in existence, period.

301
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:19,640
That means me, you, that desktop, the chair, a cow, a monkey, a sports car, an airplane,

302
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:28,720
were all made up of a hundred of the same ingredients, period.

303
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,360
Isn't that amazing?

304
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,520
When I was one of the things they really didn't know about going to the moon, were they going

305
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,320
to go to the moon and find some new element?

306
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,160
They went to the moon and they found the same stuff we got here on Earth.

307
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,720
So basically, the assumption is in the scientific community that really, the entire universe

308
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,040
is made up of about a hundred of the same ingredients.

309
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,640
I mean, I got more crap in my pantry at home, spices, seasonings, you know, I got all kinds

310
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,920
of stuff all over the place.

311
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,640
But the fundamental essence of it all, a hundred plus elements, period.

312
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,760
Everything's made up of those same hundred plus ingredients.

313
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:17,000
Now, we're really focused on the parts of an atom.

314
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,440
So when we have an element, the smallest particle that we could break that element down into

315
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,880
and have it retain its identity is an atom.

316
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,120
So I know you think I'm going all wacky like chemistry, onion, everything, okay?

317
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Bear with me.

318
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,080
We have to understand the essence of matter so that we get electricity out of matter.

319
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
That's where we're going with this.

320
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,880
The first part of the atom you need to understand is called the nucleus and the nucleus is not

321
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
even really a part.

322
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,600
I misspoke that.

323
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:56,760
It's not a part, it's a place and that place is simply the center of the atom.

324
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:05,560
The first true subatomic particle that we're going to talk about is the proton.

325
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,840
Proton is a positively charged particle that's located in the nucleus, okay?

326
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,600
And I just said something that's very, very significant.

327
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
I just said the word positively charged.

328
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,040
For the first time in this program, we just spoke of something that has an electrical

329
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,760
characteristic, a positive charge.

330
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,560
So proton has a positive charge.

331
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:42,160
The other subatomic particle that's located in the nucleus of an atom is called the neutron.

332
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:50,560
And neutrons are uncharged particles, meaning no charge.

333
00:22:50,560 --> 00:23:01,040
One of the ways that I remember it always is proton, positively charged.

334
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:08,480
Both start with the letter P. Neutron, no, no, no, no, no, neutrally charged, okay?

335
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,800
They're not positive or negative, they're uncharged, they're neutrally charged.

336
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,120
That's where they're called neutrons.

337
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,640
Electrons, well, that's the other subatomic particle.

338
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:29,720
And if one's charged positive and one is neutral, then therefore the electron must be negatively

339
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,640
charged particles.

340
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:43,000
The electron actually orbits the nucleus where the protons and the neutrons are located.

341
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,600
This is a very, very significant slide.

342
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,400
Remember earlier I shared with you a little bit about my background?

343
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,720
I wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.

344
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:01,480
And as a matter of fact, when I was in the Navy on active duty, my uniform, the Navy,

345
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,040
even if you sail on a cruise ship, you have a symbol that identifies what division you're

346
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,640
part of.

347
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,320
And for me, I had on my arm my chevrons, you know, that signified, you know, my rank.

348
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,880
But then I had a helium atom on my arm.

349
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,520
And that helium atom was to signify matter.

350
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,200
And the helium atom with the electron orbiting around the outside was to signify electrons

351
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
orbiting the nucleus.

352
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Why?

353
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,240
Because I was an electronic technician.

354
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,000
And I basically went for like three years of my career before I realized, why is there

355
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,200
like an atom on my arm, okay?

356
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,480
What does that mean?

357
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,800
What it means is the electrons orbiting the nucleus because I was a subject matter expert,

358
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,200
a technician on the behavior of electrons.

359
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,120
That's what you're all here to learn.

360
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,560
If you're here to learn about electronics, you're here to study the behavior of the electron.

361
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,680
And that's what we're really going to talk about.

362
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,840
Makes sense?

363
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,720
One of the things I do not want you to study while you're here in this program.

364
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,240
And I'm pretty open-minded.

365
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,360
If you want to go off and do some projects and stuff like that, I'm all about it.

366
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,720
One of the things I really don't want you doing is anything with the nucleus of the

367
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,400
atom, okay?

368
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,520
And if you plan on doing anything with the nucleus of the atom, give me fair warning.

369
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,200
And I think I'll stay in federal way that day, okay?

370
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,000
And then you can have at it and try to split the atom or do whatever it is you're going

371
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
to do.

372
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,920
But when you start playing around with the nucleus of the atom, bad things happen.

373
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,800
As electronics professionals, we're only going to play around with electrons.

374
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,520
As a matter of fact, we're only going to play around with certain electrons.

375
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm going to share what those electrons are with you in a moment.

376
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,760
This is kind of sort of what it looks like, maybe.

377
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,200
This is an artist's depiction, and the scale is really, really off.

378
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,440
The proton is a very big particle.

379
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,040
The neutron is a very big particle.

380
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,440
So the nucleus, this is kind of working, okay?

381
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,480
This is kind of working for me.

382
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,920
The electron, though, is not the same physical size as the proton.

383
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,060
The electron would be like the spot of my laser pointer.

384
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:39,260
But in actuality, if this truly was the neutron and the proton, I don't think the spot of

385
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,720
my laser pointer would even be in the room anymore.

386
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,260
That's how far the orbit is around the nucleus.

387
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,980
I heard it once explained as like a cathedral.

388
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:57,980
If you had the size of a grapefruit in the center of the cathedral, the electrons orbiting

389
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,460
would actually be like on the outer walls.

390
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,820
It'd be, you know, really, really far out there.

391
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,500
So the scales here are off, but this gives you an idea of what's going on.

392
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:16,820
One thing I want you to understand also is that all matter, when in its neutral, natural

393
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:25,060
state, has an equal number of protons and electrons.

394
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,260
Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged.

395
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,780
They're equal numbers, so they cancel each other out.

396
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,100
That means that matter is in a neutral, natural state.

397
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,580
Did that answer your question?

398
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:45,020
You had a balanced, so there's an equal number of electrons and protons in atoms until we

399
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
do something to it.

400
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,860
We're going to talk about that in a minute, too, because we're not just going to let everything

401
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,860
stay in a neutral, natural state.

402
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,780
If we did, we wouldn't have, we'd be out of jobs.

403
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
We wouldn't have current flow.

404
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,700
It'd be a drag.

405
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,380
A couple of the numbers that you need to familiarize yourself with.

406
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,820
And one of the things that I want to stress to you is that all of you are here taking

407
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,340
electronics courses.

408
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,580
You're here to learn the language of electricity and electronics.

409
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,580
That's really what it is.

410
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,740
It's like taking a second language.

411
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,700
I've actually had a lot of students that speak different languages, and English is a second

412
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,420
language, and they wonder if they could come in and do it, and say, yeah, you could come

413
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,860
in and do it.

414
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,980
Because you know what, what I'm talking about here is another language.

415
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,220
So one of the technical terms that we may use in the future is a number called atomic

416
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,980
number.

417
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,060
An atomic number simply is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom.

418
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,020
And every one of those hundred plus elements that I talked to you about earlier has a unique

419
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,980
number of protons.

420
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,420
You don't have two different elements that have the same number of protons.

421
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,580
So the scientific community embraced this, and they said, you know what?

422
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,180
Why don't we just use the number of protons, and that's going to give it its position on

423
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,660
the periodic table.

424
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Make sense?

425
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Okay.

426
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,820
The next number I want you to familiarize yourself with is the atomic weight.

427
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,300
And the atomic weight deals with the mass of the atom.

428
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
It's weight.

429
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
It's physical weight.

430
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,700
And remember when I said that protons and neutrons were big, and they were contained

431
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,140
in the nucleus, and the electron was just like a little tiny subatomic particle orbiting

432
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,140
way outside.

433
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:34,340
Basically, to end up with atomic weight, all you do is count up the total number of protons

434
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,620
and neutrons in the nucleus.

435
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Count that up.

436
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,460
That gives you the atomic weight.

437
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:46,460
Every weight of every element on the periodic table is unique.

438
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,700
And basically, the mass of the electron is so insignificant, we don't even take that

439
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,020
into account in determining the atomic weight.

440
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Make sense?

441
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:03,780
Now, this is where things get interesting.

442
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,660
First term, shell.

443
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,220
This isn't the kind of shell you find by the seashore.

444
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:17,020
What we're talking about here for shells is simply an orbital path around the nucleus.

445
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,360
This is where the electrons orbit.

446
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,860
They form concentric circles around the nucleus, and they're filled in sequence.

447
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,080
Have any of you here been to a parking garage, like down at SeaTac Airport or Bellevue Square

448
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,480
or, you know, I don't know about you, and I'm, again, not the smartest guy, but normally

449
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,840
I want to park at, like, the first level like I find a space at.

450
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,640
So what I'll do is I'll go to the first level and I'll drive around, and if I can't find

451
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
a parking space, where do I go?

452
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
Up to the next level, okay?

453
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,600
And then I drive around, and if I can't find a space there, where do I go?

454
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
The next level, and I keep doing that.

455
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,220
This is how shells are filled in atomic structure.

456
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:07,280
When the first shell gets filled, then electrons start going out to the second shell, and then

457
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,440
the next shell, and then the next shell.

458
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:18,120
So our most complex atoms in existence have electrons in shells that are way out there,

459
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,680
because they have the highest number of electrons.

460
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,600
And the higher the number of electrons, the higher the number of protons, because remember

461
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
they have to be equal.

462
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,200
Make sense?

463
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Now, the shell that most, should most concern you is this valence shell.

464
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
This is the outermost shell.

465
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,620
If it's a complex atom, it may be way out there.

466
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,520
If it's a simple atom, it's going to be real close to the nucleus.

467
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,800
And I'll talk to you in a minute why that's, it's important for two different reasons.

468
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:07,760
The number of electrons contained in the valence shell also refers to the term valence.

469
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Now, this is the scheme that they came up with in naming the shells.

470
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,320
If we have a simple atom, let's say we've got an atom that contains one electron.

471
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,560
That one electron is going to be parked in the lowest level.

472
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,840
And we're not going to call it the lowest level, no, that'd be too easy.

473
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,880
We're not going to, we're not going to park it in what's called the first shell, because

474
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,440
that would be too easy.

475
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,560
You're here to attend college, okay, to get educated.

476
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,800
So we've got to not call this the first shell or the A shell.

477
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,960
We're going to call this innermost shell the K shell.

478
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Why?

479
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I don't know.

480
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,040
It helps us educated people justify our existence.

481
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,680
After the K shell comes the, this, this is the part that actually makes sense to me.

482
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,880
After K comes L, M, N, O, P, Q, so I did okay with the alphabet, so it kind of makes sense.

483
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:17,280
So what this means is the Q shell, the most complex element that we have found in the

484
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,040
universe contains electrons in the Q shell.

485
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,520
Does that make sense?

486
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:33,080
If it's a simpler element, an element with a lower atomic number, that means it's going

487
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,720
to have electrons maybe only in some of these shells.

488
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,320
But we have to fill a sequence first, fill this K shell before we bump an electron up

489
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
into the L shell.

490
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,160
When L gets filled, and some of you that have maybe taken chemistry and some physics classes

491
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,800
know there's a certain number, I don't want you to memorize that.

492
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,080
That's not going to help you become an electronics professional.

493
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,000
And just remember there is a limit of how many electrons you could park in a shell before

494
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,440
the electrons have to go into the outer shell.

495
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,520
Now why am I talking to you about all of this stuff?

496
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,960
Again, this was a question that plagued me for about three years since I was educated,

497
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,600
like why were they teaching me about all the subatomic stuff?

498
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,080
I'm not going to be some mad scientist, you know?

499
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,000
Why do I need to know about the periodic table?

500
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,280
Why do I need to know about subatomic structure?

501
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,280
You know, I want to learn how to use a multimeter to take voltage readings.

502
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,920
I want to know how to use an oscilloscope to take readings.

503
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Why do I have to understand subatomic shrubber?

504
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,960
Two reasons you need to understand subatomic structure.

505
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,280
Number one is so you could identify the properties of materials that we use in electronics.

506
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,680
That's first and foremost.

507
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,960
Secondly, you need to understand where voltage comes from.

508
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,160
And we're going to talk about that in a minute.

509
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,680
First let's talk about some of these materials and their properties.

510
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Conductors.

511
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,000
How many of you are familiar with conductors?

512
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,160
Conductors.

513
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,680
That's the guy that runs the train, right, that's the conductor.

514
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,280
Actually saw that the other night.

515
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
What's that?

516
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Movie?

517
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Unstoppable?

518
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
How many of you have seen the movie Unstoppable?

519
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Train?

520
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
It was actually a pretty good movie.

521
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
You haven't seen that one?

522
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Yeah, it was good.

523
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Wasn't it?

524
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Train?

525
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Running out of control?

526
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Based on true stories.

527
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,480
It was based on a true story, you know.

528
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Let's set the throttle and jump off the train and switch the track and jump back on it.

529
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,680
It just didn't work out very well.

530
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,400
Anyway, that's not even what we're talking about.

531
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Conductors.

532
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
We're not talking about train conductors.

533
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
We're talking about conductors, electrical conductors.

534
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,560
Materials that readily accept the flow of electrons or electricity, if you will.

535
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:58,800
Categorically, the textbook says they're materials that contain a large number of free electrons.

536
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,480
However, I want you to think of it in a different way.

537
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:12,560
When I speak of conductors, I am speaking of materials that have three or fewer electrons

538
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,760
in the valence shell.

539
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,600
And by the way, in this class, in this program, the only shell that you will ever work with

540
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,960
for safety reasons is the valence shell.

541
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,160
If you plan to experiment beyond the valence shell, again, let me know, and I'll probably

542
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,000
stay home that day, okay?

543
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,240
So it's only the valence shell.

544
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,840
So if you've got an element that has three or fewer electrons in the valence shell, it's

545
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,800
going to potentially be a good conductor.

546
00:36:49,800 --> 00:37:01,160
Now, in order of precedence, the material that has the best conductivity or conductance

547
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
is that of silver.

548
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
Silver, believe it or not, that's the best, found in nature.

549
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,160
Out of all the elements, silver is the best.

550
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:22,320
Gold by copper, gold, aluminum, tungsten, iron, nichrome, okay?

551
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,400
Silver is the best.

552
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:31,880
If silver is the best, why when you buy a stereo, why when you buy audio-video equipment, do

553
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,880
they try to sell you gold-plated patch cords?

554
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Okay?

555
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,080
We've got one response, they're money, yeah?

556
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,080
They could get more money out of you.

557
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,080
It's corrosion, it's, silver has a higher corrosive potential than gold.

558
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Absolutely.

559
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Absolutely.

560
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:58,800
And copper is a little bit more corrosive than gold, but not as much as silver.

561
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:07,880
So basically, gold is the least likely to oxidize and corrode.

562
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:15,320
So when we get copper wire and plate it with gold, we get a good conductor, because gold

563
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,400
is still a good conductor, but it won't oxidize.

564
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,480
If you're scuba diving in the Caribbean and you find a treasure chest full of gold that's

565
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,040
been sunken, hundreds of years underwater, and you dig it out of the sand and you open

566
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,320
it up underwater, salt water, hundreds of years, you open it up, you would know that

567
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:44,080
you found gold, because it would look as good as the day that that treasure chest fell off

568
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,720
the pirate ship.

569
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:56,520
If you found a treasure chest under the ocean in the Caribbean and it was filled with silver

570
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,480
and you pried it open, you'd be like, oh, what happened in there?

571
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Because it's all oxidized.

572
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,320
Of course, there's still good silver in there, but the exterior would be oxidized.

573
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,820
So that is why we use gold-plated connectors.

574
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,080
Don't oxidize.

575
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,560
We live in an oxygen-rich environment, so if I could have gold-plated connector to connector

576
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,080
and I could mate the two, I'm going to get the best possible electrical connection that

577
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
I can.

578
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,440
Now, do you really need to go out and buy those gold-plated audio-video connectors?

579
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,640
It's actually kind of funny, because I've seen a lot of people go out and spend good

580
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,520
money on those, and then they plug it into the back of a dusty amplifier.

581
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,240
It would have been better for you to go out and get some technical-grade alcohol, clean

582
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,680
the male-female connectors, connect them, and you'd get a better electrical connection.

583
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:50,520
Now, in a perfect world, a totally clean gold to totally clean gold, clean, nice, no dust,

584
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,160
is going to give you a superior connection.

585
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,960
We actually learned a lot of this was developed in the space program, because think about

586
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,400
it, to basically send people to the moon and have them get back and have those electronic

587
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,360
circuit boards needed to be highly reliable.

588
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,600
This is where NASA started playing around with everything is interconnected.

589
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,080
You can't permanently wire everything up.

590
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,840
You have to have boards and sockets, and everything is interconnected like that.

591
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,520
NASA did a lot of research, and I said, hey, we played the stuff with gold.

592
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,880
We'll be golden, you know, and literally that started that whole trend in electronics.

593
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,720
A lot of the circuit boards and stuff that you buy, your computer motherboard, your video

594
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,080
card have gold plating on it, so they make that connection, and it's a highly reliable

595
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,600
connection.

596
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,800
Big thing I want you to remember, though, three or fewer electrons in a valence shell.

597
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,120
Insulators are materials that prevent the flow of electricity.

598
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:56,320
The textbook says they're stabilized by absorbing valence electrons.

599
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:07,120
The material found on planet Earth that has the highest insulative quality in nature is

600
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
mica.

601
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,880
Any of you know what mica is?

602
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,440
It's found in rock formations.

603
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,860
It's very fragile.

604
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,560
It's a good thermal insulator, and it's a good electrical insulator.

605
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,400
A lot of times it's found in quartz formations, and it's almost like paper, like you can kind

606
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
of peel.

607
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,800
There's one layer and another layer and another layer, but it's highly fragile.

608
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,080
That for thickness is the best insulator that we have found in nature.

609
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,560
That's why it's at the top of the list.

610
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,000
That's what we compare everything to.

611
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,240
Glass is high, but not as high as mica, followed by Teflon paper, wax paper, which is used

612
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,280
in the manufacturing of some of the electronic components.

613
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,200
Rubber, bake light.

614
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
I know what bake light is.

615
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,400
Bake light is like the handle on your toaster oven, and when you drop it, it chips it, and

616
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,200
you can't glue it back together.

617
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,120
It's not only a good electrical insulator, it's a good thermal insulator.

618
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,120
It's that black stuff that, again, you chip on your pots and pans, and you can't fix.

619
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Isn't that the original form of plastic?

620
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
They started now?

621
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Yes.

622
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,720
It is one of the original forms of plastic, if you will, that they used as a composite,

623
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,720
if you will.

624
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Oils.

625
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,360
A lot of oils are used.

626
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:32,160
They used to use a lot of oils that had a lot of poison in them for electrical transformers,

627
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,400
but we kind of got out of that because oil is an insulator.

628
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,720
It's nice because oil will draw heat away from circuits.

629
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,640
If you had a circuit submerged in oil, if any, what do you call them, computer heads

630
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,040
here, PC files, you know.

631
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,200
One of the big problems we know with PCs are heat, the generation of heat in the processing.

632
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,120
So one of the big things is if you could super cool a computer, you'd get more performance

633
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,280
out of that computer.

634
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,760
So if we got the computer, don't try it again with my computers, but if we got it and submerged

635
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,960
it into a vat of oil, and then we cooled the oil and recirculated it, we could draw more

636
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,120
heat away from the circuit, and then we could start bumping up the speed of the computer

637
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,120
and in the industry, overdrive the chip.

638
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,160
Ask more of the chip than what it's rated for.

639
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,040
Yeah.

640
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,440
Porcelain.

641
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
And of course, air.

642
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,080
Air is an insulator, isn't it?

643
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:37,040
If you've driven under power lines, what's between the power lines?

644
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Air.

645
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,240
I don't know if you've ever driven under or walked.

646
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:49,000
Do some walking, hiking under the BPA power lines down south, and on a day that's damp,

647
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,560
you could actually hear the zzzz, it's like, wow.

648
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,120
Air is the insulator, and I guess it ain't working too good right now.

649
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,520
Hope it doesn't arc to me.

650
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,000
There's also a category of materials that are called semi-conductors.

651
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,640
conductors are materials that could be altered to function as either a conductor

652
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:18,480
or an insulator. Let me go back, I left out one thing here. Insulators are

653
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:28,000
materials that have five or more electrons in the valence shell. Five or

654
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:37,680
more electrons in the valence shell. So conductors were three or fewer, insulators

655
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,400
five or more. Anybody want to take a wild guess what a semi-conductor might be?

656
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,800
One that could be altered to function as either a conductor or an insulator. If you

657
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,480
want to take a wild guess. Four, you all could have been scientists back in the

658
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,440
1940s. Because that's basically what they came to the conclusion. We know the

659
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,000
properties of conductors. We know the properties of insulators. What happens if

660
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,600
we start playing around with something that has four electrons in the valence

661
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,320
shell? We could get it maybe to swing both ways depending on how we want it to

662
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,960
behave at that moment in time. And as you know, semi-conductors are the

663
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:22,920
fundamental building block of diodes and transistors. Transistors are the

664
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,000
fundamental building block of computer microprocessors. It's all a

665
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,920
microprocessor is. Now, in essence, billions of transistors on something the

666
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,680
size of a postage stamp. Made of materials that have four electrons in the

667
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,680
valence shell. Those materials that you're going to study later on in the

668
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,600
program, not real important now for you to know, but I think you'll recognize one

669
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:55,040
of the names. Germanium? That's not geraniums, that's what grows in the

670
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,320
gardens. Germanium, it's an element. Carbon, that's an element. And the most

671
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:08,680
prevalent? Silicon. Silicon Valley. You've all heard of Silicon Valley? Have any of

672
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,360
you know where Silicon Valley is? Have you ever been there? Vast mountains of

673
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,160
silicon everywhere. Now, it's fabrication facilities, labs, okay? You're talking

674
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:26,240
about the bay area. Make sense? And what they did is they harnessed the power of

675
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,040
semi-conductors and made transformers, or transistors, excuse me, not

676
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,440
transformers. It's another, it's another line. Trust me, we'll enjoy that lecture

677
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,760
when we get to it. The other big thing I want to address with you is negative ion,

678
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:51,000
positive ion. Because in essence, this is where voltage comes from. This is where

679
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,160
voltage comes from. If I get this calculator here on the desktop, it's

680
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,320
just been sitting on the desktop all day. It's just your average every day

681
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,840
calculator. I assume that since it was sitting on the, on the desktop, minding

682
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:16,160
its own business, it's electrically in a neutral, natural state. Because this

683
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:25,080
calculator is made up of matter, which is made up of elements. Sitting here,

684
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:35,560
neutral, natural state. So if I get this now, and I start rubbing it, I start

685
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,800
rubbing it. What effect do you think that's going to have on the calculator?

686
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:47,400
I'm cleaning it. No, it's a different class. That program's down the hall. Go

687
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:58,280
out the double doors. Static electricity causes friction. The friction does what?

688
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,200
Creates charge. How? And why?

689
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,400
Through the resistance of the fabric going across the plaster.

690
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,880
Close. Somehow. Close, kind of.

691
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:23,400
The difference of the electrical potential, and that you're rubbing that

692
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:31,640
cloth on the class calculator, which creates charge on there. And then when you

693
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,320
touch it, you're less charged than the cloth.

694
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,640
Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. In essence, by me rubbing this and

695
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,320
applying friction, which is a form of energy, when I apply energy to matter, and

696
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,840
I rub this, there's a pretty good chance that I am going to knock some subatomic

697
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,440
particles. Which ones? Electrons, off of what shell?

698
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,880
Valence shell. If I rub this so hard that smoke starts coming out of it and it bursts

699
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,760
into flames, chances are I've gone in too far. But if I just rub the valence shells

700
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:12,360
and I knock some of those electrons from this onto this, now we've got a disparity.

701
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,200
Now no longer. If I've removed electrons from something that was neutral, natural,

702
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,560
and I've taken electrons from it, what is the predominant positive? Why?

703
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:36,520
Exactly. Now I'm left with more protons on this than I have electrons. It wasn't a

704
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,440
neutral natural state, so I started rubbing it. So that's exactly what I've done.

705
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:49,640
So I just made this a positive ion. I just made this a positive ion by removing electrons from it.

706
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,520
If this was also in a neutral natural state until I started monkeying with it,

707
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,280
now I rubbed electrons from the calculator onto the cloth. What does this mean for the cloth?

708
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:11,480
It's now negatively charged. Why is that? Because it contains more electrons than it had

709
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:18,760
when it was in its neutral natural state. Now you know what? When I do this, when I do this,

710
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,920
both of these items, I don't want to make it sound like they have consciousness or whatever,

711
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,360
but their whole freaking goal in life now is to get back into a neutral natural state.

712
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,040
They cannot wait until I put them together and the electrons could jump off the cloth

713
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:42,200
back onto the calculator and they could be at rest in a neutral natural state in a perfect world.

714
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,560
Does that make sense? What I just shared with you is how we generate electricity.

715
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,600
That's how we generate electricity. In order for us to generate electricity, we must apply

716
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:04,520
energy to matter. When we apply enough energy to matter, we could knock electrons off

717
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:12,280
the valence shell, gather them, and then say, hey, what? You want to get back to the positive?

718
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:19,000
Have I got a deal for you? Come, travel through my circuit, make this light bulb,

719
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,840
illuminate, and I'll give you a complete path back to your neutral natural state.

720
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,560
That's what we end up doing as a career, making sure electrons that were harnessed

721
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,840
are ready, able, and willing to do work for us, and then we make sure that they follow the correct

722
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,040
path and do something for us. We just don't let them complete the path. If you're just letting

723
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,440
them complete the path, that's called a short circuit. Okay? That's not a good thing. We'll

724
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,680
talk more about that in future chapters. We just want to make sure that the electrons follow the

725
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,800
path and complete that path. Makes sense? Very critical. Talked about two big things already,

726
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:02,840
the properties of materials we use in electronics, and also the property of how we create voltage or

727
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,440
electricity. There's one other thing here the book does not go into. There's a

728
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,960
we have conductors, we have insulators, we have semiconductors. There's a fourth property that's

729
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,040
floating around out there in science right now. Does anybody know what property I'm talking about?

730
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:23,080
Superconductor. Superconductor. Very good. Very good. A superconductor, all of these, whether

731
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,000
you're a conductor, whether you're an insulator, whether you're a semiconductor, you have one

732
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,480
property associated with you. Everything has that property associated with it. It's a property of

733
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:37,320
resistance. We're going to talk about it in a bit. There is a material that exists. It's called a

734
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,280
superconductor. It has no resistance. The problem is, does anybody know where it exists?

735
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,320
It is at low temperatures, so therefore where it's going to exist is in a laboratory. They don't

736
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,480
have it operating at room temperature. I can't bring you next door and give you a tour of my

737
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,840
superconductor that I have set up over on a bench over here. I could if I had a cryogenics plant,

738
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:10,680
and I was a research facility and playing around with it. But when they harness superconductivity,

739
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,640
it's really going to rewrite the textbooks on how we manage electricity and electronics.

740
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,160
You think Bill Gates got a lot of money? The dude that captures and harnesses superconductivity

741
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,720
at room temperature, it's going to be very, very wealthy. Very, very wealthy.

742
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,160
Make sense? By the way, does anybody know what material they're having the best luck with

743
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:40,840
as it pertains to superconductivity? What's that? Graphene, they're doing some stuff with that.

744
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:49,400
That's not the best results yet. Believe it or not, it is ceramic. Ceramic at room temperature

745
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,240
is an insulator. It's a great insulator. We use it as an electrical insulator,

746
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,160
but when they bring these ceramics to really, really cold extreme temperatures,

747
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,840
they take on conductive properties, and they conduct with no resistance. Pretty cool.

748
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:12,280
Ionization, that's the process I described. It's the process of gaining and losing electron,

749
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,360
and it's significant in current flow.

750
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,200
Okay, without ionization, you wouldn't have voltage. Without voltage, you would not have

751
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:26,840
current flow. Current, again, we should ring bells.

752
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:36,280
Current is the movement of electrons from negatively charged atoms to positively charged

753
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:43,880
atoms. The letter that we use to abbreviate current with is the capital letter i, capital letter i.

754
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,640
One of the terms we need to familiarize ourselves with when dealing with these

755
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,480
electrical properties is the term coulomb. We'll talk more about the coulomb next chapter,

756
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:05,400
but what a coulomb is is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. This is a big, huge number.

757
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:16,840
This is basically 6.24 and 16 zeros after that four. It's too big to fit in your calculator.

758
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:23,640
That's why we refer to it in this as an engineering notation. We'll talk more about

759
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,360
engineering notation again in future chapters, because we get you used to dealing with these

760
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:34,600
extreme numbers. In electronics, we deal with a lot of extreme numbers, and we represent it

761
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:45,400
with the capital letter c. Now, in ampere, named after André-Marie Ampere, French physicist,

762
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:55,080
one coulomb, that big number of electrons, 6.24 with 16 zeros after it, that number of electrons

763
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:01,480
moving past a single point in one second is called the ampere. Have you all familiar with the term

764
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:07,160
ampere before? If you've ever burnt out a fuse, you make sure you get the fuse that's the proper

765
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,800
ampere rating. If you pop your circuit breaker, you need to make sure when you're resetting it

766
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,800
that you're not overloading the circuit and exceeding the amperage rating of the circuit.

767
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,440
And what that is is physically a given number of electrons that you're forcing through a conductor

768
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:33,160
in one second's time. One coulomb per second is one ampere. 15 coulombs per second is 15 amperes.

769
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,200
We'll talk again more next chapter on that. Currents measure in ampere is that it's represented

770
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,120
by the capital letter a. So if you go out to your fuse box in your car and pull a fuse out,

771
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:50,280
it says 15a next to it, that stands for 15 amps. Universally accepted. Universally accepted.

772
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,760
Potential, the ability of a source to perform electrical work. What we're talking about here

773
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:04,440
with potential is voltage. Difference in potential causes electrons to move or flow in a circuit.

774
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:12,200
This is referred to as EMF or Electromotive Force or Voltage. EMF, Electromotive Force,

775
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,680
Voltage, Difference in Potential, they're all synonymous.

776
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:27,000
Voltage, ring bells, chimes, hit the gong, is the force that moves electrons in the circuit.

777
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,800
It's the pressure or pump that moves electrons, represented by the capital letter e or the

778
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:41,160
capital letter v. Whether you use e or v, here the textbook uses e, you could use v if you want,

779
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,240
as long as you know what we're talking about. It's universally accepted. The unit of measure is called

780
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:59,080
the Volt. Resistance, the opposition to the flow of electrons, the degree of resistance depends on

781
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:07,240
size, shape, and temperature, and it's measured in ohms. Named after George Simon Ohm, represented

782
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,920
by the Greek letter omega. One of the things I want you to familiarize yourself with is,

783
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:21,480
you know what has resistance? Everything, everything except superconductors. And superconductors

784
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,800
only exist in the laboratory right now. Hopefully when you buy an extension cord,

785
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:33,400
that extension cord has a low amount of resistance. Okay? Hopefully when you buy new spark plug wires

786
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:38,920
for your car and they're insulated, hopefully the outside of the spark plug wires has a high

787
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:50,120
amount of resistance. Make sense? Conductors have low resistance to current flow. That's why

788
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:57,320
they're called conductors. They have many free electrons to transfer the energy. Insulators

789
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:06,120
have high resistance to current flow, very few electrons. In summary, tonight we talked about

790
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:12,440
matter. We talked about elements, the fundamental building block in nature. We talked about atomic

791
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:19,720
structure, specifically subatomic particles and a place, right? Nucleus is not a particle, it's a

792
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,320
place, which that place contains the protons, the neutrons, and the electrons. Protons are

793
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:32,040
positively charged, neutrons are neutrally charged, and electrons, well those are the other ones,

794
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:38,360
they're negatively charged. We talked about atomic number, number of protons in an atom. Atomic

795
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,920
weight, number of protons, and number of neutrons in an atom. We talked about shell. These are the

796
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,560
orbital arrangements of the electrons, starting with the K shell, going all the way up to the Q

797
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:52,920
shell. We talked about ionization, the process of taking things out of a neutral natural state.

798
00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:01,320
We talked about current. Current is the flow of electrons from negative to positive. Why?

799
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,800
Because it wants to get back into a neutral natural state. We talked about the coulomb,

800
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,400
6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. It's a number of electrons, like a dozen eggs,

801
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,640
a bushel of apples, a gallon of gasoline.

802
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:24,760
We talked about the ampere. The ampere is one coulomb per second. We talked about electronic

803
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,040
or electric current that is measured in the ampere. And then finally we talked about potential or

804
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,040
electromotive force. What we're talking about there is difference in potential or voltage.

805
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:40,280
Does anybody have any questions on anything that I covered in a lecture for chapter one?

806
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,920
Going once. Going twice.

807
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,960
What's that?

808
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,640
Yes, these slides are on the website. The audio recording is on the website,

809
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,880
and eventually we're going to get the video uploaded as well.

810
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,040
But the content will remain the same.

811
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,520
New Google site. Any other questions? Going once, going twice, going, going.

812
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:24,120
The new Google site. The last one that's listed there, the HTTPS sites, google.com,

813
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:29,080
LWTC electronics. I've got that turned on. Anybody with the address should be able to get in there.

814
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,600
We haven't uploaded this material to it yet, but it should be there.

815
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:49,320
So I'm like messed up. Is that what you're saying? All right. I messed up. Cool. Cool.

816
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,800
That's why you got the job as TA. You're here to keep me honest. Any other questions? Once, twice?

817
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,960
I honestly don't know. I mean, it's pretty far down. It is a conductor, of course.

818
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,800
It's real close on a periodic table. It's amazingly close to silver.

819
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:24,440
And that's why actually in solder, we used to contain lead, but because lead is lead,

820
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,320
and it's bad, they realized it was really, really bad. So we pulled it out of solder,

821
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:35,960
but it was used to join in complete electrical circuits. So it's pretty high.

822
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,600
I don't know its actual conductivity value, but it's pretty high.

823
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,560
And once, going twice, going, going. Go on. We're black.

824
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:53,560
The next questions that I have for ELEC 110, Chapter 1, you'll be answering for me on a quiz.

825
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,200
But don't worry. Well, you'll have another week or so before we take the quiz. I'll coordinate

826
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,120
with the class lead on that. Any other questions about protocol? Anything else we're doing here?

827
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,880
All right. I'm going to go ahead and cut you loose. We don't

828
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,280
know. Okay. Last week, wrapping up lecture, we're talking about electrical insulators.

829
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:20,600
We're talking about conductors, things of this nature, right? I dug out of my archives here.

830
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:31,160
Remember, I talked to you about mica? mica? I found my stash, my private stash of mica.

831
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:37,880
Please be very careful passing this around. It actually kind of flakes off, so you can

832
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,640
just handle it, look at it. This is found in nature. It's found in rock formations.

833
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:51,880
And this is the best insulator found in nature. This is a washer, an insulator washer that's

834
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,000
been made out of mica. Okay, so we'll pass these things around so you can see. But these are very

835
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,400
fragile. Don't try to bend it. You'll break it. It's almost like a real thin piece of glass,

836
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:11,320
if you will. So this is mica in the raw, and this is a processed piece that could be used as an

837
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:20,440
electrical insulator. So cool stuff. So anybody have any questions on anything else before we get

838
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:43,880
started here? Chapter number two. Okay, just to get us kind of ramped up from where we left off

839
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:51,320
last week. Really started our discussions last week talking about the fundamental properties

840
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:58,920
of electricity. And that discussion really started off with a discussion about matter.

841
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:08,040
Matter is everything. If there is no matter, the absence of matter is called space. We could

842
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:17,320
recreate the absence of matter here on planet Earth by using an industrial vacuum chamber.

843
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:23,160
That's where we pump all the gases out of the chamber, and we're left with nothing inside.

844
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:31,400
Industrial vacuum is used a lot in industry, in the manufacturing process, so that they could

845
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:37,720
remove everything from it and only introduce those materials that they want to be inside the

846
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:45,880
chamber. Remember that discussion? The next thing we talked about, which is very, very critical,

847
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:53,160
are the properties, the fundamental physics properties, if you will, of materials that are

848
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:58,760
used in electrical and electronics applications. The most popular that we talked about is the

849
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:05,960
conductor. The conductor is a material that has three or fewer valence electrons, electrons in

850
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:11,880
the valence shell. That means basically we talked about it like a parking garage. There's room for

851
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,840
electrons to park in this valence shell, therefore it's going to make it a good conductor. Materials

852
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,480
that have five or more electrons in the valence shell are good insulators, like that piece of

853
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:27,080
mica that we're passing around right now. If you looked at that, you'd see, again, more than five

854
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:32,520
electrons in the valence shell. That means if you're a free electron, you're not going to have any

855
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:40,360
place to park on that piece of mica. We also talked about semiconductor materials. Those are materials

856
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:46,040
that have four electrons in the valence shell, and for those of you that continue on in this program,

857
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,160
ELEC 120, that's right where we're going to pick up the discussion, back to fundamental properties

858
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:57,560
of physics as it pertains to materials. If any of you were in the classroom the other night last

859
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:03,480
week, I gave that lecture to ELEC 120, and we were talking about these fundamental properties,

860
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:10,040
subatomic structure, because that discussion was all about solid state materials, silicon,

861
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,720
germanium that we use in the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits.

862
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:24,120
The other big thing we talked about is, in essence, the beginning, the creation of electricity.

863
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:33,160
When we have matter and we impart energy on matter, we could knock an electron off

864
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,640
that valence shell. When we knock an electron off that valence shell, we end up with what's known as

865
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:50,360
a positive ion, a positive ion, because remember in nature, matter is typically in a neutral state.

866
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:54,920
That means it has an equal number of protons and an equal number of electrons. Remember that?

867
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:03,960
That's how we end up with the atomic weight. Atomic weight or atomic number? Which one is it?

868
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:12,440
A is weight, B is number on the quiz. C is both. D is none of the above. Which one's it going to be?

869
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:24,360
The number of protons is number. So that number, whatever number of protons we have,

870
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:29,080
we also have the same number of electrons. That's what puts it in a neutral natural state.

871
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:34,280
So when I impart energy on matter and I knock an electron off, now I have more protons that have

872
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:40,040
a positive charge than I have electrons in the atom that makes it a positive ion. In essence,

873
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:47,640
what I just did is created electricity. That's what electricity is. Electricity is also playing

874
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,840
energy to matter, knocking an electron off, gathering those electrons and then saying,

875
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,560
hey electrons, have I got a deal for you? You want to get back to your parent atom

876
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:03,960
and get it into a neutral natural state? Come this way. Go through this circuit. Do a little bit

877
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:11,800
of work for me and then I'll give you a path back to neutrality. And the electrons, they do this.

878
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:17,480
So part of your careers in the electronics industry is going to be simply managing

879
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:23,000
the behavior of electrons, making sure the electrons do what they're supposed to do.

880
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:31,480
I guess that's why they call this electronics, electronics, the study of the behavior of the

881
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:38,040
electron. So this is all about. The other thing we talked about last week briefly was the coulomb,

882
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:45,240
a unit of measure. A coulomb is like a gallon of gas, a dozen eggs, a bushel of apples.

883
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:53,880
A coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. It's a big, huge, herken number of electrons.

884
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,600
There was a guy by the name of Charles de Coulomb. He was counting electrons for a living and then he

885
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,960
died. And then he said, hey, anybody here want to continue on Chuck's work? Anyone? Anyone? All

886
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,280
right, we'll just call it even. We'll call the number that he came up with, 6.24 times 10 to

887
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:16,280
the 18th. We'll call that a coulomb. One coulomb per second is the ampere that was that was put

888
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:22,440
together by a guy by the name of Charles. Charles ampere? No, André ampere. Another Frenchman

889
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:31,720
or beret. André Marie ampere. And you know what? Universally that's accepted. See, the amazing

890
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,720
thing, I enjoy travel, travel all around the world. People speak different languages. We use

891
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:42,520
different coins, different monetary values. When it comes to current worldwide, the ampere

892
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:50,280
is the accepted value that we use, no matter where you go. So those of you that are learning

893
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:57,000
or if you have English as a second language and you struggle with this, we're all learning

894
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,720
a new language. It's the language of electronics. And the word we're going to study tonight

895
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:09,800
is current. Current. And you already know kind of a little bit about current based on our lecture

896
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,600
last week. Well, we're going to pull back to curtains and study a little bit more tonight.

897
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:20,360
After completing this chapter, you're going to be able to state two laws of electrostatic charges.

898
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,640
I'm going to give you a heads up. Anytime you see the word law, you should like sit up straight

899
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:32,040
and take note. Because if it's a law, the type of laws we're talking about here are not laws that

900
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:37,480
we could go to Olympia and have repealed. They're not talking about laws that we could go to the

901
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:42,920
Supreme Court and have overturned. That actually would be kind of fun, wouldn't it? Go to Washington,

902
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,240
D.C. Students from Lake Washington Technical College in Kirkland, Washington protested today

903
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:52,440
outside the Capitol to have the laws of physics repealed. We can't. These are laws of physics.

904
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:59,800
Okay? So these electrostatic charge laws are kind of critical. We're going to be able to define

905
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:07,480
coulomb. Identify the unit used to measure current flow. Define the relationship of amps,

906
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:16,680
coulombs, and time through formula. Describe how current flows in a circuit. Describe how electrons

907
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:25,800
travel in a conductor. Define and use scientific notation. And identify commonly used prefixes

908
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:32,520
for powers of ten. Some of you may be familiar with this law. You've probably heard it before.

909
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:39,720
The first law of electrostatic charges are like charges repel each other.

910
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:47,080
Have all of you heard that one before? Okay? The other thing that you're probably familiar

911
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:53,880
with is like opposites attract. Right? Opposites attract. That's not only in relationships. That's

912
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:00,280
actually the laws of electrostatic charges. Opposites attract is actually the second law

913
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:07,000
of electrostatic charges. So if I got a negative and a negative, they're going to oppose each other.

914
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,840
If I have a positive and a positive, they're going to oppose each other. If I got a negative and a

915
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,640
positive, pow, they're going to be attracted to each other.

916
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,280
Yep, very similar. That's not electrostatic. That's magnetism. It's a different property,

917
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:27,240
but the same thing. North's going to be attracted to south. You've got two north poles. They're not

918
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:31,080
going to be attracted. They're actually going to push back on each other. Two south poles, the same

919
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,760
thing. So we're actually going to study that in future chapters. But this is the law of electrostatic,

920
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:46,440
electromagnetic. So just keep those two separate. Coulomb. Coulomb is the unit adopted for measuring

921
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:54,200
charges. In last week in lecture, I gave you the number 6.24 x 10 to the 18th. I figure I'd

922
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,800
wait a week before I actually showed you what that number looks like. I mean, it's one thing for me

923
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:03,400
to say up on the board at 6.24, then 16 zeros after. But this is really what the number looks like.

924
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:12,680
Okay? It's really what the number looks like. One of the reasons that we need to use this form of

925
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:21,160
notation is that this number right here will not fit in your calculator. It won't fit in your

926
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:27,000
calculator unless you enter it in this form. And I'll show you. By the end of lecture, I'll show

927
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,800
you how to make sure you know how to enter it in that form. It's kind of funny because if you had

928
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,440
your neighbor down the street or whatever and you found out that they were going to college

929
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,960
in an accounting program, right? If they're going to go to school to become an accountant,

930
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:49,400
you'd probably say, wow, that person must be really good with numbers. Okay? Tell you what,

931
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:54,920
if you're Bill Gates accountant, you're not dealing with a number like this. Okay? But yeah,

932
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:59,160
regularly on a daily basis in the study of electronics, we're going to be dealing with

933
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:08,200
numbers like this. So if you're struggling with this form of notation, we'll work with you.

934
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,720
But don't be like me. When I was in school initially like this, I looked at this number and I looked

935
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:18,760
at this stuff and, ah, man, I don't know, that's too complex. It's like, you know, 6.24 times 10

936
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,480
to the 18th. That's a number like Mr. Spock would use or something on a Starship Enterprise. And

937
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:28,600
I'm a more down-to-earth guy, so I'm going to keep it basic, you know? And in very short order,

938
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,120
I realized you can't keep it basic in electronics because we're going to be dealing with these

939
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:40,280
extreme numbers. So we have to use this form of notation. So you see how we came up with this 10,

940
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:49,640
6.24 times 10 to the 18th? The decimal point here means there's 18 places past it. So if we

941
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:56,760
went ahead and actually counted here, all right, that's like us moving the decimal place from here

942
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:06,360
all the way up to here. So if we went ahead and count, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

943
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:22,280
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So 6 decimal point 2, 4 times 10 to the 18th. That means there's

944
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:27,480
18 places past the decimal point. In this particular case, since I have

945
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:38,440
0.24, that means there's going to be 16 zeros after it, right? 16, 17, 18. 16 zeros after that. Does

946
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:46,360
that make sense? Everybody see how I did that? All right. There's our first law of electrostatic

947
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:51,240
charges, negative and a negative, positive and a positive, negative and a positive, uh-huh,

948
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,520
uh-huh. Because remember, in the beginning, everything was in a neutral, natural state anyway,

949
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:05,560
right? So originally, everything was like harmonious, balanced. When we apply energy to matter, we

950
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:12,840
knock an electron off that valence shell, and all is that valence shell, that electron that we

951
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,720
knocked off has in mind is getting back and putting that atom in a neutral, natural state.

952
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,080
So if you put an electron in the same room with a positive ion, they're going to seek

953
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,640
each other out. They want to achieve balance and harmony. Makes sense?

954
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:41,480
Current. Current. And every time I use this word here, we should like ring bells, chimes,

955
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:47,000
hit a gong, something like that. Because this is like a holy word in electronics. There's four

956
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,520
properties that you really need to be infatuated with. And when I say infatuated with, I'm not

957
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:57,800
talking about just as a student, I'm talking about later on when you continue on with your career.

958
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:04,360
The worst day you have in this industry is a paid electronics professional. The problem will be

959
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,800
solved by understanding and knowing the behavior of voltage, current, resistance and power, period.

960
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,520
Do I sound like I'm oversimplifying it? I'm not. It gets that basic. If they've got an

961
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,520
electrical problem with the space shuttle and they can't, you know, they can't hit the button and

962
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:23,320
have it blast off, it's because voltage, current, resistance or power isn't doing what it's supposed

963
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,400
to be doing. So if you know everything about those four parameters on the space shuttle,

964
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,640
you could get in and look at those four parameters and quickly find where the problem is.

965
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,320
So today we're talking about current. We should ring bells, hit chimes, hit a gong,

966
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:43,080
or something because current is one of the big four properties. Now the textbook talks about

967
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:49,800
current as being the drift of electrons from an area of negative charge to an area of positive

968
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:55,320
charge. I don't like this definition, the drift of electrons. It makes it look like

969
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,640
I'm an electron and I'm drifting, I'm floating. Okay?

970
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:10,680
An electron is more like if I'm negative charge and there's like positive ions out in the freaking

971
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:21,240
hall, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be trying to get over there. Why? Because I want to fill

972
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:27,960
those holes. I want to fill the void that was created when energy was imparted on matter. Does

973
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,520
that make sense? So that's really the behavior of current. As a matter of fact, there's a kind of

974
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:39,080
mad dash. I bet you didn't think I had it in me, huh? It gets better than that. You know how quickly

975
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,240
electrons are going to go over there if you can complete the path at the speed of light,

976
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,200
at the speed of light. If we allow electrons to complete the path,

977
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,720
it's going to travel at the speed of light. So I don't call that the drift

978
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:04,360
of electrons, negative to positive. Now, Andre Marie Ampere came up with this term that he called

979
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:10,120
the Ampere, named it after himself. These dudes didn't have egos. You kidding? They didn't have egos.

980
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:17,800
Andre Marie Ampere invented a unit of measure called the Smith. Now, the Ampere. The Ampere is

981
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:23,960
the amount of current in a conductor when one coulomb of charge moves past the point in one

982
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:30,920
second. This is kind of emotional. This is your first real formula. It's your first real formula.

983
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:37,880
The relationship between Ampere's and coulombs per second can be as expressed as i, which is current,

984
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:53,480
is equal to q charge measured in coulombs divided by t time measured in seconds. So what we're saying

985
01:20:53,480 --> 01:21:05,400
here is one amp or ampere is equal to one coulomb per second. Now, be careful with this, because I

986
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:11,720
could ask you a question about number of electrons. Is number of electrons coulombs? Number of electrons

987
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:20,600
is number of electrons. Coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons. So this formula only works

988
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:30,360
if you're using coulombs. What happens if I have half a coulomb per second? It's not a trick question.

989
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:38,040
If I have half a coulomb per second, what's my current going to be? Half an amp. If I have

990
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:45,000
quarter a coulomb per second, what's it going to be? Quarter of an amp. If I have two coulombs per

991
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,840
second, this is a trick question. No, just kidding. Two coulombs per second. That means I'm going to have

992
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:59,400
two amps. So typically for household current in your home, we talked about this last week,

993
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,040
what was that number? What's your typical utility connection from the power company to your home?

994
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:15,640
That's the voltage. What's the typical box? Typically about 200 amps is a typical residential

995
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:21,560
connection. You know, you buy a home, you're going to see that it's typically 200 amp connection

996
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,120
from the power pole or if you have underground service to your box, that big gray box that's in

997
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:32,840
your house, 200 amps. From that box, the circuits in your home get distributed to circuits that are

998
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:41,240
typically either 15 amps or in some cases 20 amps. And for some of your appliances,

999
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:46,120
they'll be a little bit higher in some cases. If you have an electric hot water heater or

1000
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:51,640
things like that, I've got a hot tub. It requires more than 15 amps, more than 20 amps. I've got a

1001
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:59,000
high current connection going to that. So if you've got 15 amp outlet in your home, that means

1002
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:09,080
that outlet is capable of handling how many coulombs per second? 15. 15. I could also ask you,

1003
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:14,680
how many electrons per second can I handle? Then you'd have to get 6.24 times 10 to 18

1004
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:19,720
times 15, and that's how many electrons it would be, physically, that that's capable

1005
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:27,320
of supporting. That's why it's so critical that all of these components, when they're manufactured

1006
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,560
and they're given their specifications, that you don't exceed those specifications. Because if you

1007
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,560
try fitting more electrons through than it's physically capable of handling, you're going to

1008
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:42,280
start an electrical fire. Okay, so everything has ratings associated with the current ratings,

1009
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:47,720
and this is why, physically, it can't handle any more electrons. If you try pumping, you know,

1010
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:54,120
if you've got a garden hose and connected it to a fire engine, okay, and turn the pumps on high,

1011
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,960
what do you think's going to happen to that garden hose? It's probably going to blow up,

1012
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,480
it's probably going to explode, right? It can't handle that volume. That's why firemen have like

1013
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:08,920
big hoses, okay? Because they have a higher volume of water that they try to put, you know,

1014
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:15,160
from the truck onto the fire. That's why they're firefighters, fire people.

1015
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:21,800
Make sense? The other thing I want to share with you about formulas, okay?

1016
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,960
If there's shortcuts that I could teach you and you could remember, I'm all about that.

1017
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,320
This is college, so whenever I give you a formula, I'm just going to give it as formula and assume

1018
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,840
that all of you are like college students that have paid your dues and are here for the right

1019
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:42,840
reasons. So I'm not going to show you every possible variation of the formula. I'm going to

1020
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,240
expect you to know how to do it on your own. But I don't expect you to know how to do it on your

1021
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:52,280
own because all of you don't have a comprehensive algebra background yet. So I'm going to show

1022
01:24:52,280 --> 01:25:01,880
you a couple shortcuts here, a way to cheat. What I want you to do is start off with drawing a triangle.

1023
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,680
I'm going to draw a simple triangle.

1024
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,920
Then inside the triangle, I want you to draw a t.

1025
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:25,560
The one formula that you know, I want you to plug into this triangle. So i, in this particular

1026
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:37,720
case, i is equal to q over t. Does everybody see how I did that? i is equal to q divided by t.

1027
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:48,840
So that's the first formula that I gave you. i is equal to q over t. Now on a quiz or an exam,

1028
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,280
or simply when you're hanging out together working with each other in the lab,

1029
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,080
what happens if I gave you coulombs and I gave you current?

1030
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:07,960
Then what we could do is simply cover up the letter t and say t is equal to q over

1031
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:19,640
i. So I did that. So t is equal to q over i. That's the other algebraic manipulation of this.

1032
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:28,520
If I asked you on a quiz if I said if I gave you current and I gave you time and I want you to

1033
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:37,160
figure out how many coulombs, what the value of coulombs would be, then we simply cover up the q

1034
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:46,440
and then it's going to be i times t. See the i is next to the t, so it's going to be i times t.

1035
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:55,800
So that's going to be our other variation. q is equal to i times t. So with that one formula

1036
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:02,600
that I gave you, there's three basic algebraic manipulations that we could have, and this is

1037
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:08,600
all of them. So do you have to memorize these? No. Remember, do the triangle, put the t in the

1038
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,520
center, and then lay that one formula out, and then now you have all the algebraic variations

1039
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,800
of that formula. And you know what? You need to know how to do this, because I could ask you.

1040
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,680
I'll be honest with you. Everything right now is fair game. I could ask you to solve for current.

1041
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:28,360
You should be able to do it. I could ask you to solve for time. You should be able to do it.

1042
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,000
I should ask you to be able to solve for coulombs, and you should be able to do it.

1043
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:41,320
I should be able to give you a number of electrons, right? You have 30 gazillion electrons.

1044
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:46,600
How many coulombs is that? That gives you this value. Then you could figure out the rest. Does

1045
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,800
that make sense? So it's a stepping stone. But don't get hung up on what you don't know.

1046
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,000
Focus always on what you do know. And the one thing to remember is one amp is one coulomb per

1047
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:03,080
second. i is equal to q over t. And then if you lay that out, it gives you all the other variations.

1048
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:12,440
Does that make sense? Hold. An all-female progressive rock band from Seattle, Washington.

1049
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:30,840
Hold. That's a joke. Is hold even still around? No? No? No. When did they disband? Where did they go?

1050
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,600
She's doing her own thing. Dad, it's where I understand she's doing her own thing.

1051
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:45,960
It's a reference. What Beavis and Butthead do America, right? There's a reference to whole. Not

1052
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:50,760
this whole, but the other whole. Remember, they were... No, seriously. They were going...

1053
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,920
Remember Beavis and Butthead do America? They're looking for their TV, or the TV

1054
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,000
broke, and they stole one, and whatever they're doing. But they were going to go to Washington,

1055
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,400
like DC. But when they heard about Washington, they were like, Washington, that's cool. That's

1056
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:09,800
like where Seattle is. We could go see whole. Anyway, that's required viewing for all of you.

1057
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,440
Beavis and Butthead do America. That's going to help you understand. Anyway, no, I'm not talking

1058
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:21,400
about a different type of whole. Whole that I'm talking about here is the absence of an electron.

1059
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:30,120
If I have an atom, and I apply energy to matter, and I knock that electron loose,

1060
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:38,680
what do I leave behind? A whole. So a whole is nothing more than the absence of an electron.

1061
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:47,480
The reason I want to point this out to you is that here at Lake Washington Technical College,

1062
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:53,720
every other technical and community college in Washington State, in the country, the U.S.

1063
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:59,640
military, all branches of the U.S. military, technical schools, a lot of universities all

1064
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:08,200
embrace what we embrace, and that is electron flow. We call one amp 6.24 times 10 to the 18th

1065
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:12,440
electrons traveling per second. That's what we call one amp, right?

1066
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:24,040
Engineers, scientists embrace what's called whole flow. They think that the holes are flowing

1067
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,880
to get filled by the electrons. I don't want any of you to lose sleep over this.

1068
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,320
Whether 6.24 times 10 to the 18th electrons travel in that direction per second, that's an amp,

1069
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:40,840
or at 6.24 times 10 to the 18th holes that travel in that direction per second, that's going to be

1070
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:46,760
an amp. But whole is the absence of the electron. And the reason I'm pointing this out to you is

1071
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,400
I know all of you this weekend, as soon as you get a little bit of time off, you're probably

1072
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,240
going to go to the library and pick up some electronic books, start reading. I don't want

1073
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:58,840
you to call me a liar, and I want you to open up that book and say, hold on. This book shows

1074
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,320
that current flows positive to negative. That Joe Greenock over there at that Lake Wash,

1075
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:08,120
he doesn't know what he's talking about. He said that current flows negative to positive.

1076
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:14,200
Current does flow negative to positive. Electron flow. Current also flows positive to negative.

1077
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:21,240
Whole flow. Are any of you going to go home and lose sleep over this? Be honest with me.

1078
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,840
Let me know, because I did. Honestly, when I was in school, I got the same lecture I'm giving you

1079
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:30,680
right now, and I'm like, oh no, I didn't raise my hand, but then I went home and I'm like scratching

1080
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,920
head. What the heck was he talking about? You know, and I like months for months, I freaking

1081
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:41,560
tried to add, it's not that difficult of a concept. You just got to hit the I believe button. Joe says

1082
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:49,320
6.24 times 78T electrons per second equals one amp, so be it. We do want to talk about

1083
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:54,360
whole briefly so you can differentiate between electron flow and whole flow, and also to prepare

1084
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:59,880
you for what you are about to receive in the future. Because again, if you sat in on my lecture

1085
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:06,920
last week on ELEC 120, guess what? We started talking about whole flow again, because whole

1086
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:13,720
flow is significant in the study of semiconductor devices, solid state devices. If you want to

1087
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:21,160
understand how a transistor really works, you have to embrace whole flow. So we are going to

1088
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:26,440
talk about it more here at Lake Washington, but you don't need to beat yourself to death on it.

1089
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:33,240
Question? Well, you got to realize that the whole itself, though, is the absence.

1090
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:40,680
But if you're talking about matter that exists, and it's the absence of the electron,

1091
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,440
that we're really talking about a positive ion, and a positive ion does have mass,

1092
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:48,200
because you got all your protons, you got all your neutrons, and of course that's how we determine

1093
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:58,360
atomic weight. Very good answer. A, the atomic weight number of protons and neutrons. So whole

1094
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,840
is the movement of an electron from one atom to the next, creating the appearance of a positive

1095
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:10,360
charge moving in the opposite direction. So that's what we call whole flow. If you had a piece of

1096
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:18,200
copper, which we know copper is a good abundant conductor, this is kind of how the electron path,

1097
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:25,800
how it would work. Negative to positive, kind of copper atom, it would jump over here to copper

1098
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:33,240
atom, jump over here to copper atom. Make sense? Drifting along at the speed of light.

1099
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:41,480
This here we see, again, a conductor. We've got electron flow left to right,

1100
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:48,840
current flow left to right, whole flow right to left. Make sense?

1101
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:56,040
Okay. I want to show you something, how this really works, because the way they're making this

1102
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:01,880
look, and I think you guys are all buying this, right? Because, again, you kind of got to believe

1103
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:10,760
me, right? But this is kind of like the free electron is kind of like hopping from copper atom

1104
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:15,400
to copper atom, because there's three or fewer electrons in a valence shell, right? It's kind of

1105
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,440
hopping along, hopping along just another copper atom, you know? You ever jump across a stream,

1106
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:26,680
right? It's kind of what they make it look like here, right? Everybody at this table here, can you

1107
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:32,440
just back up here? Nobody has a coffee or anything on here, okay? Can you put your hand on the end

1108
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:37,320
of the table just like this, okay? Okay, let me know how quickly you feel this.

1109
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:47,080
That is how current flows through a conductor. That's how current flows through a conductor.

1110
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:54,280
The speed of light, instantaneous, instantaneous. If I've got a negative here and I've got a positive

1111
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:59,880
there, pow, instantly that is going to be felt on the other side. That's how current flows through

1112
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:07,880
a conductor. So it's not this. Got to have your tongue out when you're doing it too, right?

1113
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,840
It doesn't work like that. It's instantaneous. The speed of light, which is important,

1114
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:21,320
186,000 miles per second. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.

1115
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:26,680
Or for those of you on the metric system, 300 million meters per second.

1116
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:35,560
300 million meters per second. Or for those of you that keep track of all things nautical,

1117
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:41,400
161,000 nautical miles per second. And I got a couple of chuckles out there. It's kind of,

1118
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:46,920
well, Joe's ex-Navy, he would probably know that. No, I'll tell you what. If you know those three

1119
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:52,760
numbers, 186,000 miles per second, 300 million meters per second, 161,000 nautical miles per

1120
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:57,320
second. If you know those three numbers, you could probably get about eight or nine questions

1121
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:07,400
right on your FCC license exam. Because it's how RF energy transmits as well. If you're working on a

1122
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,680
radar, you want to get your radar endorsement to be able to work on a radar, the only radar in the

1123
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:20,600
world that I am familiar with that operates in statute miles is the radar that's operated by

1124
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:27,880
the police. If you're on a Washington state ferry and they're looking at a radar, that radar is

1125
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:34,680
calibrated for nautical miles. So all the math that takes place internal is 161,000 nautical miles

1126
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:40,120
per second. If you go to work for the Federal Aviation Administration and you work at Seattle

1127
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:45,480
Traycon that keeps track of all the aircraft arriving to Seattle and departing Seattle,

1128
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:52,680
the radar that they're looking at is calibrated in nautical miles. And the aircraft also travel

1129
01:36:52,680 --> 01:37:03,720
speed-wise in knots. In knots, which is nautical miles calibration standard. So that's why those

1130
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:08,520
numbers are very important. That's how fast current travels, that's how fast radio frequency

1131
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,560
energy travels at the speed of light or close to the speed of light. There's actually some

1132
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:19,080
atmospheric anomalies that kind of slow it up a little bit, but generally speaking it's a speed

1133
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:24,040
of light, which is also important to realize. That's why it's so great you got me as an instructor

1134
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:28,600
because you could learn from all of my goofy mistakes. Back when I was in the Navy, the only

1135
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:34,440
way that I could get a raise, the only way that I could increase rank was obviously not getting in

1136
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:42,120
trouble for a period of time, which is actually another funny story. I'll show that one with you

1137
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:48,200
in a second. I forgot all about it. But anyway, the other thing is by taking professional examinations

1138
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:53,000
twice a year. And I remember one of the exams, you would have thought I would have been ramped

1139
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,040
up with this stuff. I got to this whole section of the exam once when I was trying to go up and rank

1140
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:03,480
and they started talking about the behavior of antennas in outer space.

1141
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:11,000
And I was like, I'm a submarine guy. I have no freaking clue how this antenna is going to behave

1142
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,280
in outer space. What the heck are they talking about? The Navy's got like people in outer space

1143
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:20,120
and I just got myself into a tailspin and I just I couldn't even answer anything

1144
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:24,840
instead of looking at the obvious. How do antennas behave in outer space?

1145
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:30,600
Perfectly. Theoretically, perfectly. That's what they were looking at. So I got all those

1146
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,760
questions wrong because I could just, they're talking about going to freaking outer space.

1147
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:42,280
I'm not going outer space. I'm going to live beneath the sea. So more on that, on keeping

1148
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:46,360
out of trouble. Can't make this stuff up. I was looking at a copy of my medical record.

1149
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:50,360
I have a copy of my military medical record at home and I was looking through it and I came upon

1150
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:55,560
on a page. I got into a slight altercation and actually the medical record

1151
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:05,480
reveals 25 year old Caucasian reported to sick call reports being worked over by two bouncers

1152
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:13,160
and then it goes into how I slept well and I woke up somewhat sore and basically I reported

1153
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:18,200
the sick call and it was I had a crushed my cheekbone got broken and one eye was pointing one way

1154
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:21,800
and the other eye was pointing the other way and finally they said yeah you got to go get that

1155
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:27,640
looked at but right in there print reports being worked over by two bouncers called my son over

1156
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:32,280
I said check this out it's kind of cool I should have that frame put that in my office my medical

1157
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:44,280
record you know but anyway I was a good sailor. Voltage source and again we should almost ring

1158
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:48,920
bells chimes hit gongs when we're talking about voltage source and I hope you don't think that

1159
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:54,680
I'm over exaggerating this these first few chapters are what we're talking about are the

1160
01:39:54,680 --> 01:40:02,920
fundamentals you have to understand this stuff a hundred percent now you need at least a 70

1161
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:08,840
percent to pass this class if I were truly the pope of electronics I'd say no you don't move on to

1162
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:13,640
the next module the next chapter until you prove a hundred percent because this is how critical

1163
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:19,800
this information is voltage source what we're talking about here is a power supply

1164
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:30,040
it supplies electrons from one end of the conductor and it removes electrons from the

1165
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:35,880
other end of the conductor it can be thought of for those of you that like using analogies

1166
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:41,960
fluid systems it could be like a pump what does a pump do it sucks from one end it pushes out from

1167
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:50,200
the other end right this is what a voltage source does it basically supplies electrons from one end

1168
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:57,960
and then sucks them back from the other end that has to be taking place or it's not a valid voltage

1169
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:06,120
source so a battery is a voltage source we're going to talk more about batteries of future

1170
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:11,640
chapters right provides electrons on the negative end of the battery and it collects those electrons

1171
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:17,800
of the positive end of the battery that's what makes it a battery it's what makes it a voltage

1172
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:25,400
source and we need a viable voltage source in order for us to have a viable circuit

1173
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:34,840
well finally we're going to talk about scientific notation but we're not actually what i want to

1174
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:39,880
talk to all of you about tonight is what's known as engineering notation

1175
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:47,960
anybody here really comfortable using scientific notation if you're really comfortable using

1176
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:53,240
scientific notation i guess you keep using it but i would encourage you instead to use

1177
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:01,240
engineering notation the difference is scientific notation can be times 10

1178
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:08,760
to the first power second third fourth fifth sixth seventh they can be anything you follow what i'm

1179
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:16,920
saying can you dig it engineering notation is always going to be in groups of three

1180
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:24,280
it's always going to be in groups of three which lends itself very well to what we're doing here

1181
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:33,720
in electronics let me show you

1182
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,240
let's start off with a decimal point

1183
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:49,720
oops that is there's the decimal point okay so if i put something to the left of the decimal

1184
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:57,400
point this is going to be my base 10 this is going to be my ones column so this number here

1185
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:05,640
could be anywhere from zero to nine if i get nine and i add one to it nine plus one equals

1186
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:14,360
10 so i've got to go to my tens column so this is my tens column this is my ones column can you

1187
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:21,880
dig it this is the part that i did well in school too the number line okay if i get up to the

1188
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:31,800
number 99 and i add one to 99 now i go i increment to the hundreds column okay so we're familiar

1189
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:39,000
ones tens hundreds cool okay so those are going to be my basic units of measure this could be

1190
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:51,320
pounds ounces volts amps miles whatever now if i go here to my thousands column one thousand column

1191
01:43:51,880 --> 01:44:03,400
basically what i'm doing now is this is times 10 to the third times 10 to the third everything

1192
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:09,800
in here will be times 10 to the third this could be one times 10 to the third 22 times 10 to the

1193
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:17,800
third 943 times 10 to the third makes sense the reason that i'm so infatuated with having you

1194
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:29,160
put it in engineering notation is by 10 to the third we're going to call this value here in the

1195
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:40,920
metric system what what's thousands in in metric kilo very good kilo so what we're going to do is

1196
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:51,880
we're going to call this small letter k kilo so instead of saying 1000 i'll say 1k instead of

1197
01:44:51,880 --> 01:45:05,400
saying 943 thousand i'll say 943 kilo kilo pounds kilo ounces kilo miles kilo volts kilo ohms make

1198
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:26,280
sense kilo miles there's a new one for you well metrics it's in metrics but if you put it into

1199
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:32,920
engineering groups of three then it's going to fit directly into those prefixes those metric prefixes

1200
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:43,160
so three more places past the decimal point one two three this is times 10 to the sixth we're going

1201
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:56,040
to call this mega mega in an actuality it's like millions right one million ten millions hundred

1202
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:13,960
millions mega 10 to the ninth what's that giga very good capital letter g giga

1203
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,880
when i first got into this industry i'm dating myself i don't know why i say that make myself

1204
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:27,240
feel old this is as far like as we had gone in the electronics industry general electronics

1205
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:35,640
giga wow and i'll be honest with you where i used to work in electronic intelligence

1206
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:42,040
the only people that could that could afford to play up here in giga values were superpowers

1207
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:47,320
it was either us or the soviets and we knew what we had so if i detected something that was in

1208
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:57,720
giga hertz it had to be the soviets okay now giga commonplace after school today you could

1209
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:03,240
probably stop at fred meyer pick up a laptop computer that's got a you know 80 gigabyte drive in it

1210
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:09,960
for 49 that's actually too much money 49 bucks you could get a

1211
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,240
times 10 to the 12th terra

1212
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:26,520
terra also happens to be a barista down in federal way that's kind of got it going on if you know

1213
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:36,520
what i mean i don't i don't even know what i mean i don't even know what that is terra

1214
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:46,120
when i first started teaching here 20 years ago at like washington technical college

1215
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:53,960
i can't even remember i think i might have had like an 80 meg hard drive or something

1216
01:47:53,960 --> 01:48:01,160
i remember getting super jazzed by getting the sunday seattle times and i saw an ad in the paper

1217
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:08,680
that i could get like a 250 megabyte hard drive for less than a dollar per megabyte and i'm like

1218
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:14,440
you gotta be kidding me i could get less than you know less than a dollar per megabyte of storage

1219
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:18,920
i'm gonna go on and get one of those you know so i went on and paid my 250 bucks or whatever

1220
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:25,400
now you're getting a terabyte hard drive for 49 dollars now they have two terabyte hard drives

1221
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:32,280
they could get for 99 dollars so this is have i made my point about the numbers we're going to work

1222
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:40,280
with in high tech industry i mean the numbers are extreme they're extreme so again if you use

1223
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:45,320
engineering notation and put it into groups of three and most of you and your calculators have

1224
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:50,440
a mode that you could put it into engineering motet notation so ultimately the the answer is

1225
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:55,160
going to be given given to you in either times 10 to the third 10 to the sixth 10 to the ninth 10 to

1226
01:48:55,160 --> 01:49:01,640
the 12th if you don't know how to do that you might want to look at your owner's manual if you're

1227
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:07,480
ready through your owner's manual away do a google search on your on on your model it'll come up with

1228
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:13,640
a pdf of it okay you want to make sure you know how to access those modes in your calculator

1229
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:18,680
because again we're going to be using some extreme numbers but you know what i'm not done

1230
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:25,960
i've yet to begin we're about halfway done we're also going to be dealing with numbers that are

1231
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:33,960
smaller than one so when i go back one two three places

1232
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:41,880
anybody know what we call these times 10 to the negative third three places to the right of the

1233
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:47,400
decimal plates milley and actually if any of you come from a machining background or whatever

1234
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:52,280
like thousandths of an inch this would be a tenth of an inch right this would be hundredths of an

1235
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:58,200
inch this would be thousandths of an inch and use the term mill right how thick is that plastic

1236
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:09,240
three mil three milley okay so we're going to call this small letter m for milley m i l l i milley

1237
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:17,880
three more places past the decimal point gives me times 10 to the negative sixth anybody know what

1238
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:24,760
we call this micro very good micro micro is kind of kind of weird too it's a greek symbol

1239
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:33,160
kind of looks like this it's kind of like a backwards u it's actually the greek symbol called

1240
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:48,360
mu mu dirty jobs dirty jobs really he does that micro micro micro for our friends at home yeah

1241
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:54,840
micro he actually participated in a fundraiser here in the fall of like washington technical

1242
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:59,480
college via satellite actually the producer from that show dirty jobs is here and they

1243
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:05,640
as a fundraiser for a college foundation but micro was live via satellite speaking directly

1244
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:10,760
with all those that went to breakfast here at lake washington technical college i slept in that morning

1245
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,800
i was hoping hoping they were going to tivo the event so i could watch it at my leisure but nobody

1246
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:25,480
t-voted three more places past the decimal point times 10 to the negative ninth

1247
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:33,640
yep nano very good small letter m small letter m nano

1248
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,520
any of you have heard about nano technology this is kind of like where nano technology is playing

1249
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:54,200
around with now three more places past the decimal point times 10 to the negative 12

1250
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,280
pico small letter p pico

1251
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:05,080
suffice to say i could go further there's a couple places past this but it's beyond the

1252
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,760
scope of what we're talking about right now

1253
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:16,360
but as students at lake washington technical college you on a regular basis are going to

1254
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:23,800
be dealing with numbers times 10 than a negative 12 to times 10 to the positive 12 sometimes in

1255
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:30,680
the same problem so like i said earlier even if you're bill gates accountant

1256
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:36,840
even if you're the irs itself anybody here not filed their taxes yet

1257
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:42,520
two of us three be honest four

1258
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:49,960
it's actually funny i was with uh with friends on uh on saturday we stopped at starbucks for a cup

1259
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:55,240
of coffee and my friend saw this woman that she thought she recognized that she knew and you can't

1260
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:59,880
make this stuff up um you know it's like she's like you know you look like a good friend of mine

1261
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,560
blah blah blah and you know do you work do you work for quests no i don't work for quests well

1262
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:09,960
you know you know i work for the irs really excuse me ma'am but you look lovely today

1263
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:16,040
can i buy you a pastry to go with that cup of coffee and you don't want to take those people off

1264
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:21,000
too finely brought down al capone wasn't it right the irs

1265
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,400
anyway we're going to be dealing with numbers like this so we have to make sure we get it right

1266
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:34,600
so in most of your calculators you'll have a key ee a key ee and you could enter that whatever

1267
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:43,400
you do do not enter it as as it appears here on the uh don't go three hit the times key 10

1268
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:49,400
to the third power you're actually going to end up a decimal place off with that you have to enter

1269
01:53:49,400 --> 01:54:00,760
it the ee key exponential notation any questions on that all right um

1270
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:10,680
there's no harm in using your imagination when you're when you're dealing with an electoral system

1271
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:19,320
in equating it to a fluid system because let's be brutally honest you can't see electricity

1272
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:26,680
coursing through wires you can't see it our five senses are very very limited so sometimes analogies

1273
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:31,240
really really help us out so for those of you that understand fluid systems you know it all

1274
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:35,640
rolls downhill and you know pressure and pumps and that kind of stuff you could use the same

1275
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:40,200
analogies to figure out what's taking place inside an electoral circuit one of the things

1276
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:46,920
that i do because i just love seattle is i'll use the treat that the seattle freeway system

1277
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:55,640
to sometimes explain the behavior of current in a circuit i5 405 520 and we'll use those as

1278
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:03,160
analogies of how current behaves how traffic behaves on a friday before a three-day holiday weekend

1279
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:12,120
and it's sunny out and raining in the convergence zone and we'll use those analogies to kind of

1280
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:16,280
figure out what's taking place in a circuit so this here this analogy shows us the pump this

1281
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:22,040
would act like our voltage source right it's sucking and then discharging right so this is our

1282
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:26,040
source of electrons and this is where it's drawing the electron through for the pump

1283
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:34,920
the current flows through the plumbing the electrons flow through the circuit the only

1284
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:38,360
thing that i would have done differently if i drew this illustration i can't take credit for this

1285
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:42,840
i simply pulled it out of the text is the load this would have been nice if they had like a

1286
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:49,320
water wheel right here so as the water runs by it turns the wheel because that's what a load does

1287
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:53,880
a load converts one form of energy to another form of energy an electrical load converts

1288
01:55:53,880 --> 01:56:00,440
electric energy into light energy or electric energy into motion or or some other form does

1289
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:08,200
that make sense so you can use this if you care to since this chapter is talking about current

1290
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:14,120
typically in the study of electronics electronics not electrical but electronics

1291
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:21,800
we're typically only going to be using values associated with milli times ten to the negative

1292
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:28,440
third milli amps which don't be fooled milli amps could kill you there's enough even though it's

1293
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:34,200
it's thousands of an amp it's still enough to kill you more than enough to kill you

1294
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:42,360
and also we're going to be dealing with micro amps typically as a student here in the electronics

1295
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:47,240
program like washington technical college for those of you that go into the electrical trades at all

1296
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:53,720
you're going to be dealing with amps and lots of them we had a student that just got

1297
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:59,240
hired by bondable power administration bpa he's going to be working substations i don't even

1298
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:03,720
know how many amps you're dealing with out of substation what makes a substation a substation

1299
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:08,840
lots of amps i would imagine okay i never had an interest of working with that many amps

1300
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:14,280
since milli amps could kill you why would i want to work with more than more than enough to kill me

1301
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:22,760
in summary we talked about the laws of electrostatic charges the first law is that like charges

1302
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:28,440
oppose each other the second law is unlike charges attract each other a coulomb is six

1303
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:34,600
point two four times ten to the 18th electrons electric current is the flow not the drift the

1304
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:42,520
flow of electrons in a specified direction measured in amps conceived by the dude by the name of

1305
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:51,480
andre marie amp here and andre marie amp here stated that one amp is equal to one coulomb per

1306
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:56,520
second that's the relationship between current electrical charge and time formula we talked

1307
01:57:56,520 --> 01:58:02,040
about holes moving holes moving the opposite direction of electrons electrons travel negative

1308
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:07,880
the positive holes travel positive to negative we talked about scientific notation negative

1309
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:14,600
exponents specifically milli micro nano and pico and we talked about positive exponents

1310
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:20,200
specifically kilo mega giga and terra and terra also happens to be a

1311
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:32,680
in that's kind of got it outstanding if you know what i mean i don't even know what i mean

1312
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:40,120
we're going to talk about milli prefix typical these are the values of current that we'll see

1313
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:45,160
in electronic circuit and also micro times ten to the negative six these are also values

1314
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:51,640
of current we'll typically see inside an electronic circuit make sense anybody have any

1315
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:59,160
questions anything that we covered in chapter two chapter two all right let's go ahead take

1316
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:03,160
about a 15 minute break and at 645 we'll go ahead and kick things off again

1317
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:13,480
okay chapter three voltage chapter three voltage after completing this chapter you're going to be

1318
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:21,480
able to identify the six most common voltage sources describe six different methods of producing

1319
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:29,240
electricity define cell and a battery describe the difference between primary and secondary cells

1320
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:36,280
describe how cells and batteries are rated identify ways to connect cells or batteries to

1321
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:45,960
increase current or voltage output or both define voltage rise and voltage drop and identify the

1322
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:54,440
two types of grounds associated with electrical circuits this this kind of makes me laugh you

1323
01:59:54,440 --> 02:00:02,920
know the big buzzword now is alternative energy right alternative energy and um

1324
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:12,520
really worldwide we consume electricity that's the form that we've pretty much chosen electronics

1325
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:18,520
electricity you know i don't think there's any places that are installing oil lamps

1326
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:25,400
you know new hotel in the caribbean we light our place with oil lamps no we use electricity

1327
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:35,960
and there are six methods of producing electricity period so when i hear about alternative energy i

1328
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:41,960
kind of sit up i'm like well have they come up with a seventh method no as long as i have been

1329
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:49,160
in this industry there have been six methods there are only six methods if you come up with a seventh

1330
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:57,800
now maybe you're on to something those six methods are friction magnetism chemicals light

1331
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:05,320
heat and pressure period the first one we're going to talk about is friction

1332
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,320
probably the most familiar is the vandagraph generator how many of you are here familiar with

1333
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:20,600
the vandagraph generator um let me try that again uh how many of you here are familiar with with

1334
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:28,040
lightning storms that's probably the best example of friction producing electricity

1335
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:37,320
guy by the name of ben franklin figured that out by flying a kite in an electrical storm

1336
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:45,320
one of our brilliant forefathers it's amazing it didn't get uh electrocuted in the in the process

1337
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:53,320
so lightning is a form of friction caused by atmospheric friction if you will um

1338
02:01:53,320 --> 02:02:00,120
and that produces lightning another example is electrostatic discharge when you walk across

1339
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:05,800
a carpet or you move if you're wearing clothes just that movement you could generate static

1340
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:13,640
electricity tens of thousands of volts could be generated by seeing you simply wearing clothes

1341
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:21,240
okay the alternative is not wearing clothes you wouldn't generate static electricity by doing so but

1342
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,800
of course the world would be a different place

1343
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:31,800
the vandagraph generator some of you have maybe seen in a museum before i've got one in the back

1344
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:36,200
room it's out of commission right now but there's a big sphere on the top of it and then what it is

1345
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:42,120
is a belt pulls electrons off the bottom brings it up to the top so the sphere becomes charged

1346
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,920
and what we could do with that is if you were insulated and you put yourself at that electrical

1347
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:51,400
potential you've maybe seen the pictures where people's hair standing straight out on end that

1348
02:02:51,400 --> 02:03:01,400
effect could be created with a vandagraph generator friction not really the best best method of

1349
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:08,440
producing electricity you know i'm not going to hire tens of thousands of people to walk around

1350
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:16,360
on carpets and then you know touch a touch of you know of a conductor and power cities that way it

1351
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:22,360
just doesn't make sense on the other hand if there was a method of somehow harnessing lightning

1352
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:29,240
now that would be something that would be something i don't know how many of you are from the seattle

1353
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:34,600
area northwest uh originally your whole life uh i don't know if you've ever had the opportunity

1354
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:44,520
to travel like to the east coast the midwest monster storms tropics monster storms storms that even

1355
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:53,160
jet airliners can't get above you know 60 000 foot thunderstorms um just amazing i remember a few

1356
02:03:53,160 --> 02:04:01,480
years ago i was flying commercially down to the caribbean and um on the way back this monster

1357
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:06,200
storm outside and even the pilot was talking about it he's like you know in my 30 years of flying i

1358
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:11,320
have never seen a storm this big and he just looked out and the whole thing was just glowing

1359
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:17,960
constantly glowing it wasn't like lightning flash lightning flash was just constantly sitting there

1360
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:25,400
just like throbbing glowing was pretty frightening so if you could somehow harness that lightning

1361
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:31,080
that would almost constitute a form of alternative energy

1362
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:40,600
magnetism is the most common method of producing electrical energy this is how we produce electricity

1363
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:48,920
using something called a generator that generator could be powered by steam

1364
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:57,960
that steam could be generated from nuclear power coal water wind gas diesel it doesn't

1365
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:04,040
matter how you rotate the shaft the goal is you got to rotate the shaft

1366
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:12,040
it's actually very devastating the news from uh japan was watching the news this morning and i guess

1367
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:17,880
they upgraded it to a level seven accident now which is on par with chernobyl actually the amount

1368
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:21,800
of radioactivity that that puts out could exceed chernobyl if they don't get it figured out

1369
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:28,760
um it's really too bad i'm not necessarily i don't know if you want to call me a proponent of

1370
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:34,920
nuclear i mean i i worked on nuclear submarines for you know eight and a half years of my life

1371
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:41,240
and uh it's pretty cool i mean it's hot because it generates steam you know what i'm saying it's

1372
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:48,120
pretty pretty uh innovative technology because you know how often we i you know i commute and i got

1373
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:53,560
a i got to go to the back gas pumps about twice a week with my car and my car birds premium

1374
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:58,920
um height um high compression engine i got to burn premium in it you're talking about 50 bucks

1375
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:04,600
pop just fill up my car for me to commute you know how many times i saw my nuclear submarine refueled

1376
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:13,720
just kept going and going and going and going and going so you get a lot of use out of nuclear

1377
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:20,680
power commercial nuclear power plant um basically what they do is they refuel the reactor started up

1378
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:29,960
run it at full throttle for 18 months 100 flat out for 18 months then they shut it down refuel

1379
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:34,520
it most nuclear power plants have multiple reactors so when they're refueling one they got another one

1380
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:38,520
that's up and running and then just back and forth or so in some cases three reactors

1381
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:46,280
so it was actually getting quite a bit of momentum in the green movement a lot of the the the folks in

1382
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:50,760
the green movement were like no nukes no nukes and they realized that it's pretty clean energy

1383
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:56,440
yeah you got to worry about the nuclear waste afterwards but it's really a devastating uh you

1384
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:04,040
know not only for the folks in japan um but also really for uh you know energy energy efficiency

1385
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:11,320
and um non-dependency uh fossil fuel burning uh so hopefully they could get a handle on it

1386
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,720
i mean nuclear power all forms of energy are inherently dangerous you know i mean

1387
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:21,000
my my fuel tank splits open on my car and i drive home and i burst into flames that'll

1388
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,120
kill me just as dead as radiation you know what i'm saying so it's a matter of mitigating those

1389
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:31,400
risks but i want you to keep that in mind this is why again alternative energy

1390
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:38,680
you know i've been to holland before they got freaking windmills over windmills

1391
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:44,360
they were harnessing wind energy you know now we wind turbines you know all you're doing is

1392
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:51,080
rotating the shaft and you're turning a generator as opposed to grinding your grain with power from

1393
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:57,240
the wind so is it really alternative energy no it's just a different spin on it which is interesting

1394
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:02,760
because i've known this stuff since like puberty and i always in the back of my mind was thinking

1395
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:07,240
about like energy in different forms because i was always getting yelled up on my parents you know

1396
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:11,400
shut the door shut off the lights what do you think you live in a barn you know this type of

1397
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:16,920
stuff so i was yeah at a very young gauge i was thinking wow you know i what one of my duties as

1398
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:24,760
a child was cutting the grass and uh he used to amaze me the small amount of gas i could i was

1399
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:29,560
always hoping i'd run out of gas so like i don't have to i couldn't finish the lawn why i ran out

1400
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:34,520
of gas you know the thing would never run out of gas there was this little tiny tank and that motor

1401
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:37,320
would just keep you know the engine would keep going and going and going and going and going

1402
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:43,640
there's a way of harnessing that motor to a generator and that could like i could leave the

1403
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:47,640
lights on i could leave the doors open i'd get my parents off my back you know at a young age i

1404
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:51,720
was thinking about alternative energy and obviously i didn't understand all the formulas

1405
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:57,560
associated with it so no you can't necessarily power a home with a small three and a half horsepower

1406
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:06,760
brakes and strutting engine but with a ten horsepower you could do it and if you've got a

1407
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:14,120
backup generator that's a good enough size generator power home anyway that's how we harness

1408
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:21,880
magnetism the generator could be configured to produce either direct current direct current is

1409
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:29,080
the flow of electrons in only one direction negative the positive period negative the positive

1410
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:34,840
or alternating current alternating in current is actually current that goes back and forth back

1411
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:41,320
and forth what we what comes out of the outlets here in the school and at your home is alternating

1412
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:46,680
current the electrons never really go anywhere but they're getting shaken back and forth back

1413
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:52,520
and forth back and forth that's the harness that's the energy that we harness so we could have a

1414
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:59,160
generator connected to a shaft that produces either dc or ac dc generators are not that prevalent

1415
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:06,920
they're not that prevalent really ac is used predominantly throughout the industry because

1416
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:11,000
of it's a higher level of efficiency in transmitting the power

1417
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:19,960
this is the schematic symbol for an ac generator so if you saw this on a schematic

1418
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:25,400
you would say ah this means an ac power source ac generator

1419
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:40,280
chemical chemical the most common is a cell chemical means is the second most popular method

1420
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:45,880
of producing electrical energy a chemical cell what we're talking about here is batteries

1421
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:55,480
the original chemical cell consisted of two metals copper and zinc these were the old

1422
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:59,320
school batteries remember the kind that if you left them in your device too long they'd start to

1423
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:07,480
like ooze and ruin your portable electronic device those were just standard carbon or um

1424
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:12,040
yeah zinc cells copper zinc cells

1425
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:23,320
typically many cells can be connected to form a battery when we use the term battery

1426
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:30,040
we're actually talking about something that's made of multiple cells and part of why i'm telling

1427
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:34,520
you this is that you're all here to learn a second language and that second language is electronics

1428
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:40,200
so if you were going to go to fred my where you're going i'm going to fred meyer to get me some

1429
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:47,080
batteries if you said that to me i'm going to assume that you're going to get batteries and

1430
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:54,040
batteries are multiple cells that are put together where you're going i'm going to fred

1431
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:59,480
meyer to get me some batteries what do you need batteries for for this here flashlight

1432
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:05,080
that battery doesn't take that flashlight doesn't take batteries that flashlight takes

1433
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:12,600
cells and cells are the typical size batteries that we've come to know and love triple a

1434
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:23,800
double a c am i personal favor the d size cell d size means it's bigger since it's bigger it means

1435
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:33,160
it's got more chemical in it more chemical means it's gonna last longer if you had a d

1436
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:37,480
size battery and you connected it to your remote control it looks stupid but it would last forever

1437
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:45,160
okay i put triple a batteries in my remote and like they last for like longer than my tv lasts

1438
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:51,800
you know i just had a i just had some cells go out in a remote and i looked they were the original

1439
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:56,600
cells of the remote i'm like man i've had this thing for freaking 14 years it's got the original

1440
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:04,840
goofy brand batteries that came with it you know so typically many cells can be connected to create

1441
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:10,840
what's known as a battery now it's schematic diagrams when you see this symbol right here you

1442
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:19,480
can assume that this is a cell the short line is the negative lead the long line is the positive

1443
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:29,080
lead on a schematic diagram if you put a short one a long one a short one and a long one together

1444
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:35,320
we could make the assumption that this is a battery the other assumption that you could

1445
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:47,640
make on a schematic diagram is when you see this assume 1.5 volts because most cells triple a

1446
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:51,880
double a c and d all produce 1.5 volts dc

1447
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:58,360
so if we saw this what can we assume

1448
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:10,760
1.5 plus 1.5 is 3 so normally on a schematic diagram sometimes they'll draw two of these

1449
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:14,520
side by side sometimes they'll draw three but they won't draw any more than three

1450
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:24,760
so anytime you see two or more assume assume that it's either the value here or right next to this

1451
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:33,160
i could write 12v and if i write 12v well it's a 12 volt battery pack and if you split that battery pack

1452
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:39,800
open you would find that it's actually made up of multiple cells that are wired together internal

1453
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:45,560
to that battery pack make sense

1454
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:49,160
light

1455
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:57,400
light photovoltaic cell harnesses light

1456
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:06,680
a single cell can produce a very small voltage so therefore many cells must be linked together

1457
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:13,240
to produce a usable voltage and current these are primarily used in satellites

1458
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:18,760
because satellites would look stupid if they had like an extension cord connected to them

1459
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:23,160
you know you'd be like what the heck is that going up into the sky you know well it's an

1460
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:29,160
extension cord for you know communication satellite so we can't do that

1461
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:35,240
cost is high but it's declining

1462
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:42,040
what i suspect is going to happen with this photovoltaic basically to make a solar panel

1463
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:48,440
it uses the same technology that is used to make microchips so it's pretty costly process

1464
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:53,000
what i suspect to see and you're not going to find us on any textbook

1465
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:57,720
what i suspect you're going to see is a marriage between photovoltaic

1466
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:05,560
and nanotechnology and when those two merge together you're going to be able to go to

1467
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:11,880
Sherwin Williams and get paint for your house and they're going to say sir would you like the

1468
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:21,160
photovoltaic additive today for 1995 sure go ahead and a lot of photovoltaic additive and the

1469
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:28,520
fact that your paint on your house is outside and it's in daylight part of the time it's going to

1470
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:33,720
be producing voltage now we're not quite there yet but i suspect that that's where we're going to be

1471
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:38,520
they do have the technology now that there are companies that basically could spit out photovoltaic

1472
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:46,760
film almost like Reynolds wrap so you could you know go out buy a roll of photovoltaic and roll

1473
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:51,720
it out and connect your your connections and you're producing electricity so the cost is coming

1474
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:57,720
down on this stuff and think about it free voltage from the sun i mean how cool is that i mean it

1475
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:03,720
really is here in western washington well you know you probably have to pressure wash it twice

1476
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:08,200
so you're to keep the moss from growing on your panels i got moss growing on my car i'm getting

1477
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:14,760
in the other day and i'm like what the heck is it moss growing on it but other areas of the country

1478
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:22,520
they're doing us they're doing us was in arizona uh flagstaff several years ago and i checked into

1479
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:31,320
the hotel late at night and um got up in the morning and opened my wind and opened my curtain

1480
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:37,000
the hotel room i was on an upper floor and i was shocked number one it snowed out the night before

1481
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,760
and it was like six inches snow out there i'm like holy crap this arizona what's your snow doing out

1482
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:45,080
there it's flagstaff it's you know you're in the mountains the other thing that shocked me is wow look

1483
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:51,880
at this across the street was a solar farm and it was all photovoltaic panels connected directly

1484
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:57,560
to the power grid and these panels would all track the sun and and you know basically supplying

1485
02:17:57,560 --> 02:18:02,040
energy to the power grid so in some areas of the country uh they're already doing this

1486
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:09,320
when i run out tonight by solar panels for your home probably not but again it's free energy free

1487
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:18,440
voltage so keep your eye on this technology because uh i'd love to be an investor in the company that

1488
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:24,120
gets that photovoltaic nanotechnology harnessed you know just add a little pinch of it to your paint

1489
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:31,480
or whatever and paint whatever he just turned it into a solar panel science fiction now guarantee

1490
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:34,840
you within the next few years we're going to be seeing that technology it's one of those solar

1491
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:40,360
panels work uh look like and the problem is uh this is on a metal backing but basically it's

1492
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:46,680
glass it's glass it's pretty fragile you know you want to have it permanently mounted um

1493
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:57,640
still for out of space satellite it's the best option pointed towards the sun the sun comes out

1494
02:18:57,640 --> 02:19:01,960
every day actually if you're an outer space it never goes out because you know you're not rotating

1495
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:07,720
if you're a stationary satellite just looking at it unlimited electrical resources it was actually

1496
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:14,040
interesting i was at a conference i spoke at a conference a month ago that was like a month

1497
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:20,600
ago today in milwaukee wisconsin it was at the green energy summit i wasn't invited guest speaker

1498
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:27,480
and one of the other speakers was very uh it was very interesting he had one of our first

1499
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:33,160
satellites a mock-up of it and when they were developing the satellite it was this was in response

1500
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:38,920
to the russians uh launching spotnik and it was the whole thing with the space race and basically

1501
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:43,960
you know he who gets the satellite in space first and goes to space first is going to rule

1502
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:49,000
dominate the earth you know so this is all stuff that was going down the 1950s they um

1503
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:55,800
in a push to get our satellite up there in response to the russian satellite um

1504
02:19:55,800 --> 02:20:03,480
um basically what they had was a battery operated satellite launch it goes up beep beep beep beep

1505
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:09,880
and that's literally all this thing did it was a beacon just beeping in space and then as an after

1506
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:15,480
thought though the engineers were like let's put this on it this here is a photovoltaic cell

1507
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:20,920
let's put this on it so that when the battery dies it'll continue to beep and they're like

1508
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:25,720
what are you doing it's a stupid this is stupid this is no this is no you know this is not viable

1509
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:31,720
technology solar panel photovoltaic cell this doesn't make any sense well they finally convinced

1510
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:37,000
them to put it on well guess what happened after the battery died photovoltaic kicked on and then

1511
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,840
it kept going and going and going and going and I think finally it was like interfering with some

1512
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:47,560
other communication technology that developed they finally had to shut the thing off so that

1513
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:52,840
was proof of concept that photovoltaics really work and of course it's become mainstream ever since

1514
02:20:55,960 --> 02:21:00,280
this is a cool way now it's a hot way actually producing voltage

1515
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:07,560
we could use heat to produce voltage with what's called a thermo couple thermo couple

1516
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:13,800
these are two dissimilar wires twisted together when I say dissimilar I don't mean one blue wire

1517
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:20,040
and one red wire I'm talking about two dissimilar metals and they're not actually twisted together

1518
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:25,320
they're actually welded together so you get the two dissimilar metals

1519
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:31,800
and then you'll weld them together where they're welded together when you heat that joint

1520
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:39,560
because they're dissimilar metals it's going to produce a voltage voltage produced is directly

1521
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:46,600
proportional to the amount of heat applied these are going to be used in thermometers

1522
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:53,320
if you've had it seen a digital thermometer typically that's going to be a thermo couple

1523
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:59,080
because what it does is you apply heat it produces a voltage the voltage gets converted

1524
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:04,360
to an equivalency of either Fahrenheit or centigrade and then you read it out real

1525
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:11,320
simple way of doing it also called a pyrometer pyrometer had a student in this class several

1526
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:17,880
years ago whose father owned a company locally I forgot the name of the company but they basically

1527
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:24,600
produced thermal couple sensors and one of the big products that they were developing was

1528
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:34,040
specifically for the racing industry and what it was is about the size of my laser pointer

1529
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:37,880
it was nice stainless steel and I had a little probe on the end and that was the thermal couple

1530
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:44,040
and what was so popular in the race industry if you I don't know how many of you aren't a racing

1531
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:50,920
or whatever you know you take like NASCAR for example and ideally what you want to do with

1532
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:58,520
one of those race cars is set it up so that you distribute the weight evenly on every tire

1533
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:06,680
equally across the tire and if you could do that obviously you've got the most contact with the

1534
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:10,200
road it's going to give you the most handling on the track it's going to give you the best

1535
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:14,680
performance generally speaking there are some exceptions to that on road course versus whatever

1536
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:18,520
but basically you want full contact with all your tires on the track make sense

1537
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:25,960
also understanding with NASCAR rear wheel drive right you're going to have a lot more friction

1538
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:32,600
on your rear wheels so what happens is when that race car pulls in and they pull the tires off

1539
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:36,360
then they could sit there after the after they get the car out of the pits

1540
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:45,400
with their thermal couple probe and then measure across the tire outside inside or outside middle

1541
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:51,720
inside for my left rear my right rear take the same readings my front tire take the same readings

1542
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:57,560
my other front tire same readings so you should see consistency between the two fronts across

1543
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:01,960
temperature wise too that means you've got the car set up so that the tires are in full contact

1544
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:09,160
with the road so it's really a poor man's alignment tool so he gave me one of these

1545
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:12,440
it's kind of cool because it's the OEM it's just stainless it doesn't have any

1546
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:16,680
decal or sticker on it I mean they're the factory that built it and then sold in some racing

1547
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:21,960
companies so they can put their name on it and or you know snap on and charge you know an arm and

1548
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:27,160
leg for the thing so he gave me one of these things so I actually did some experimentation

1549
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:32,040
since I am a commuter I I did that a couple times in my drive home I want that I was wondering

1550
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:38,200
what the alignment on my car was so sure enough you know I drive home I pull off the exit hot

1551
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:42,760
federal way pull over the side of the road get out my fluke meter with this thing plugged in

1552
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:47,160
take temperature readings look for consistency I've basically been tweaking alignment my vehicles

1553
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:54,360
using nothing more than that temperature gauge pretty cool pretty cool thermal couple

1554
02:24:54,360 --> 02:25:02,120
simply applying heat to the device produces voltage that's simple apply heat it'll produce

1555
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:07,480
voltage this is what the schematic symbol for one looks like

1556
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:14,760
again understanding that these are going to be dissimilar metals two dissimilar metals

1557
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:17,320
and then you weld this together the bead

1558
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:24,040
so are they not actually

1559
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:37,480
actually that because they're in contact with each other it will produce

1560
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:45,320
where would you take the other tips yeah so simply by putting the the wires together they

1561
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:49,000
are going to be in contact with each other so you are going to get some reaction but

1562
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,920
these thermal couple probes are actually welded the tips are welded

1563
02:25:55,240 --> 02:26:01,160
believe it or not another method of producing voltage is simply by the use of pressure this

1564
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:07,480
is called the piezoelectric effect piezoelectric effect voltage is going to be very small

1565
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:12,440
so it must be amplified in order for it to be useful

1566
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:21,720
but just a pressure change on a crystal will produce a voltage this is used for crystal

1567
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:29,880
microphones phonograph pickups right and precision oscillators as well as some sensors

1568
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:35,160
pressure sensors you could get some really inexpensive pressure sensors now that are

1569
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:39,560
calibrated for barometric pressure standard barometric pressure so as the earth's pressure

1570
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:44,040
the atmospheric pressure changes on it the voltage will change you couple couple that

1571
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:50,040
with a weather station or couple that with actually you could use a fur altimeter if you're

1572
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:54,520
sending a rocket up and you want to know how high your rocket goes you know what your base pressure

1573
02:26:54,520 --> 02:27:01,480
is as you go up an altitude the pressure decreases so you can have an inexpensive little sensor that

1574
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:09,480
keeps track of your pressure also these are used in a lot of engine sensors now right you

1575
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:14,680
could monitor all types of different pressures your oil pressure your pressure your cooling system

1576
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:20,360
on board an aircraft your hydraulic pressure is all a little sensor that voltage gets amplified

1577
02:27:20,360 --> 02:27:23,880
sent into a computer and then you could look at all this virtual instrumentation

1578
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,560
simply doing it by applying pressure to a crystal

1579
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:32,840
this is what the schematic symbol looks like for piezoelectric crystal

1580
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:43,000
now we're going to talk about some different types of batteries

1581
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:48,920
battery of course is a combination of two or more cells

1582
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:57,560
now we have two different choices of cells one is called a primary cell the other is called a

1583
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:05,320
secondary cell let's first talk about primary cells primary cells are cells that cannot be

1584
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:14,040
recharged one time use these are like most of the cells that you and I buy right when you're

1585
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:20,760
done using them you recycle them don't throw them in the landfill right you recycle them

1586
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:27,240
bring them to the hazmat place and then they'll turn it in and get money and make your community

1587
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:32,600
more profitable based on you turning in your dead batteries some of the stuff you don't want

1588
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:37,560
going to the landfill although they've gotten better with the choice of chemicals that they're

1589
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:43,960
using but primary cells once you once you use them you throw them away this is designed after

1590
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:51,400
what's known as the La Clanche cell or dry cell also referred to as the carbon zinc battery

1591
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:56,040
carbon zinc battery this is the old school battery that we were talking about earlier

1592
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:09,320
I got a couple old timers in here remember that's all we had these are the only types of batteries

1593
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:14,760
that used to exist and then I believe was in the 1970s they came out with alkaline cells

1594
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:22,280
that's when alkaline became somewhat mainstream started to become mainstream these alkaline cells

1595
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:29,240
were still pretty expensive as compared to the carbon zinc batteries I remember Radio Shack

1596
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:32,600
because again I was a big electronics guy so I was like hanging out at Radio Shack like looking

1597
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:37,800
at all the parts and stuff and Radio Shack used to have a battery of the month club and you got a

1598
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:42,760
little card and you'd go in with the card and you'd pick out the battery that you wanted and then

1599
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:46,840
they'd punch your card you got a free battery it was a carbon zinc battery but it got you in the

1600
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:55,880
store kind of a cool thing alkaline cells really really good alkaline cells would work a lot better

1601
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:59,640
with a lot of electronic equipment when it came into being

1602
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:13,640
the latest cell and my personal favorite is the lithium cell these are the high end lithium batteries

1603
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:19,240
that Energizer produces they cost like

1604
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:31,160
16 bucks for eight batteries they're very very pricey but these lithium batteries

1605
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:39,160
will produce a voltage longer than any of these other types of primary cells they also have a

1606
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:45,640
longer shelf life I'll bring in a package we could look at it I just I bought some last week

1607
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:51,320
and I think it's the the expiration date on them is like 2022 some crazy time in the future

1608
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:56,280
we won't even need batteries like that we'll be flying to work in jet packs and stuff

1609
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:03,800
we won't even need a lithium batteries and the other thing that these are real great at is working

1610
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:09,800
at a variety of different temperatures from extreme cold which really kills batteries big time

1611
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:12,840
slows down that chemical reaction to extreme heat

1612
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:20,440
they've kind of known about lithium batteries for a while lithium cells for a while

1613
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:28,840
on my airplane there's something that's called an ELT emergency locate transmitter

1614
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:35,880
in the event of crashing there's a g-switch that triggers triggers a transmitter to start

1615
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:41,080
transmitting out a beacon that gives your position away so search aircraft actually they used to

1616
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:44,840
have satellites that looked for that signal but now they've long story they've switched those

1617
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:49,320
satellites off they've gone to some different frequencies now and but it would transmit so

1618
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:54,760
when this thing worked it had to work it's a safety device even like on a ship that goes down they

1619
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:59,800
have these e-perm systems that transmit to the satellite you want that when you got when it has

1620
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:05,640
to work you need the thing to work so this has always been the choice for those types of applications

1621
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:13,240
the lithium cell i was really really jazzed and excited when i saw these come on the market for

1622
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:20,680
a consumer based product because the lithium the lithium batteries before were unique you know to

1623
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:24,680
the manufacturer would put it together and you'd have to buy the replacement from them

1624
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:29,720
because like the f a a requires every 24 months you've got to replace that that cell whether you've

1625
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:36,440
used it or not so for them to come out the sizes that i'm aware of they have triple a and they

1626
02:32:36,440 --> 02:32:43,640
have double a size have any of you here used any of those if you use them highly recommend it if

1627
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:47,960
you're going on your dream vacation if you're doing photography and you want something for your

1628
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:53,000
flash and you want that flash to keep going off and you don't have to worry about it if you have a

1629
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:00,760
if you're going hiking i use it in my gps i use a bat i have a backup gps um you know that i use

1630
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:06,520
whenever i'm i'm going off the grid or anything i've got a pack i've got a pack that i bought

1631
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:11,640
energizer will sell you a pack that you could use to recharge your cell phone have you seen those

1632
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:17,640
things it's like a little pack and it comes with those lithium batteries and it's got a little cord

1633
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:21,960
so like if you're off the grid and you got to recharge your battery it comes with that style

1634
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:28,280
you know your micro usb or mini usb plug or you know kiesta everything now is micro usb that's

1635
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:34,760
kind of the standard for new newer cell phones but you put those lithium batteries in it you plug

1636
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:40,760
it in it'll give you another charge so if any of you do any backcountry stuff or anything like that i

1637
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:46,280
highly recommend you look into them it's a wise investment a very wise investment it's the best

1638
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,400
primary cell that money will buy

1639
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:59,080
this is kind of you got the diagrams in your book kind of a cutaway view of a standard carbon

1640
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:10,360
zinc cell another cutaway view there cutaway view of a nine volt battery is this really a nine volt

1641
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:18,920
battery is it really a battery yes it is it's made up of multiple cells that have been put together

1642
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:25,960
each cell is capable of 1.5 volt so they put multiple cells together to give them nine volts

1643
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:34,920
why nine volts actually this nine volt battery is also synonymous what was what was called a

1644
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:41,560
transistor battery back in the day there's no transistors in it why was it called a transistor

1645
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:47,560
battery because this is the type of battery that your transistor radio would take growing up in

1646
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:53,560
connecticut i used to have a little small eight transistor radio used to go to the beach and i

1647
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:57,720
used to tune in my little radio you know playing you know playing music listen to new york radio

1648
02:34:57,720 --> 02:35:04,600
stations playing all the top 40 hits and everything eight transistor radio took a nine volt battery or

1649
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:10,760
transistor battery this was typically the battery that i would get as a free battery at the battery

1650
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:18,280
of the month club for radio shack why my assumption was it's got nine volts the other ones have 1.5

1651
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:27,160
volts i'm getting more for my punch my free battery than than a 1.5 volt battery so this

1652
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:33,080
was typically the bad boy that i always used to get for the purpose of experimenting secondary

1653
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:38,280
cells or cells that cannot be recharged you're all familiar with this type of cell the lead acid

1654
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:41,400
battery or wet cell which is in your car right now

1655
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:52,600
these batteries are not just used for automotive applications these wet cells these lead acid

1656
02:35:52,600 --> 02:36:00,600
cells are also used for backup power supplies by the phone company for your landline they're also

1657
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:05,880
used at cellular sites for backup power in the event that power is interrupted to the

1658
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:12,600
cell sites automatically they'll switch over to battery backup they're typically lead acid cells

1659
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:22,680
absolutely and they use those for solar systems now because they're the cheapest secondary cell

1660
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:28,280
that's really on the market there's other technology that's more efficient that's more better

1661
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:35,000
okay but it costs more so if you just want to let's say you live out in the desert and you want

1662
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,320
want to run lights by day and harness the energy by day and you need a lot of solar panels and

1663
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:44,120
you're going to need a lot of secondary cells the cheapest secondary cells that you could buy

1664
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:53,160
our lead acid cells my submarine had a whole bank of lead acid cells located in the center of the

1665
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:59,640
submarine down in the keel the very lowest portion of the boat and it was the called ironically the

1666
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:06,520
battery well and in the battery well were batteries that were basically six feet tall

1667
02:37:07,640 --> 02:37:12,520
and they were about this big around and they were individual cells and it took a crane to be able

1668
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:18,520
to lower these things in and move them all in and then they had wooden shims wax and

1669
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:23,080
pregnated maple shims were all put in between these and it was all one giant bank and they were all

1670
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:33,160
wired up lead acid on a daily basis an electrician would strip all the metal off of their uniform if

1671
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:38,280
they had a belt on or anything metal and typically what they had is a special jumpsuit that they put

1672
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:43,640
on it had all acid burns in it and what they would do is they'd have to climb down in the battery well

1673
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:49,640
and they'd have to check the gravity the specific gravity this is the electrolyte fluid inside

1674
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:54,200
and basically when we charge your battery what are we putting into a battery

1675
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:04,600
who said electrons electrons that's really what we're doing when we charge your battery

1676
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:10,520
we're putting free electrons we're storing it in an electrolyte solution our electrons matter

1677
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:18,600
absolutely they're not very dense but they still are matter when you charge your battery what you

1678
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:24,760
do is you increase the specific gravity of that fluid that electrolyte fluid

1679
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:31,800
so what the electricians would do on a daily basis is they had a clipboard and they had a

1680
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:36,040
grid that showed all the locations of the battery they would go down in and they would

1681
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:41,720
check the specific gravity do you know what i'm talking about with specific gravity specific gravity

1682
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:49,480
is a comparison of the density of pure water h2o at room temperature standard temperature

1683
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:57,480
the specific gravity of h2o pure water at room temperature standard temperature is one

1684
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:04,520
1.000000 it's one it's what we compare everything else to

1685
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:11,080
now if i have pure water and i start to get some salt and i dissolve salt into the water

1686
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:16,200
what am i going to do the specific gravity i'm going to raise it i'm going to increase the density

1687
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:20,840
of the fluid and by taking a specific gravity reading i'm going to show that it's more dense

1688
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:24,120
that shows me that i've done what i've put matter into the solution

1689
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:30,520
if i dissolve sugar into it same thing if i pump electrons into it what am i going to do

1690
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:37,800
same thing i'm going to increase the density of it i use specific gravity i i brew my own beer

1691
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:43,240
and i use specific gravity to tell me what the alcohol content is

1692
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:51,720
in the brewing process i basically impart a lot of sugars into the beer and i take that reading

1693
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:58,920
the more sugars i put into the beer the specific gravity increases the density increases make

1694
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:07,000
sense then what i do is i get yeast i put the yeast into that solution and the yeast consumes the

1695
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:16,280
sugar converting it into co2 and alcohol so after the yeast has done its job i expect to see that

1696
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:23,160
specific gravity decrease because alcohol is less dense than water and then i take a read

1697
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:28,120
my first reading compare it to my last reading that gives me my alcohol content of what's inside the

1698
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:39,240
beer for a battery your battery in your car has six cells if you buy a hydrometer and you test

1699
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:44,200
those cells you should get consistency across all of those cells if you don't

1700
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:51,480
if this cell is good this cell is good this cell is a little bit lower this good good good

1701
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:57,160
the cell being a little bit lower you're probably developing an internal short in that cell

1702
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:05,160
need to replace your battery you can't just replace the individual cells you have to replace

1703
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:11,000
the whole entire battery so back on the submarine they were really concerned about that on a daily

1704
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:16,280
basis they sent somebody down in the battery well to take those readings because if they saw a cell

1705
02:41:16,280 --> 02:41:20,520
that started to develop an internal short or problem conceivably it could take all of that

1706
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:27,160
energy and dissipate that energy through that one bad cell that's bad news because oh by the way

1707
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:33,160
you know why we had a battery battery bank if our nuclear reactor shut down or we had a problem

1708
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:40,120
we could get to the surface when we get to the surface we could start up a diesel generator

1709
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:45,960
so from that transit from the deep up to the surface we needed to be on battery power

1710
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:53,320
if you can't get the diesel started while you're on the surface or actually at periscope depth

1711
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:58,280
because we had a snorkel they could just stick up where it's an induction system for the diesel

1712
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:03,640
run the diesel we had a generator connected where we could keep not as much power as we'd have to

1713
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:06,840
nuclear power but to keep all vital systems up and operational

1714
02:42:09,960 --> 02:42:13,720
actually i had a real scare once we were someplace we weren't supposed to be

1715
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:17,640
like someplace we were not supposed to be typically where we always went with my submarine

1716
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:25,000
and it was a half it was a national holiday for this country so all of their you know they'd

1717
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:28,840
take their submarines and drive them through red square and their tanks and their missile

1718
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:32,920
launchers and everything and you know we had nothing better to do so instead of like hey you

1719
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:37,320
know we're watching the soviets they're having a holiday let's us have a holiday because on the

1720
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:40,520
fourth of july we're going to be watching the soviets and they're not going to take into account

1721
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:45,960
our holiday you know the captain didn't think it was a very good idea that i had now as a matter

1722
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:49,560
of fact mr grinnock i think what we're going to do is we're going to do some drilling today

1723
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:55,880
you know and it's firefighting whatever well we did it we did a drill an exercise

1724
02:42:56,840 --> 02:43:02,440
that involves scrambling the reactor sounds ominous doesn't it scram the reactor oh no don't

1725
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:07,240
scram the reactor scrambling the reactor is actually a good thing scrambling the reactor is

1726
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:11,720
when you shut the reactor down you have control rods you move the control rods in you neutralize

1727
02:43:12,440 --> 02:43:18,600
the the reaction the nuclear reaction this is actually what they did too in japan after the

1728
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:23,720
earthquake as soon as there was seismic activity pow they shut those reactors down scram the reactors

1729
02:43:23,720 --> 02:43:29,800
the problem that they had afterwards was with the tsunami damaging i suspect it was their intake

1730
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:35,320
their seawater intake that for used for cooling and they couldn't dissipate all that heat that had

1731
02:43:35,320 --> 02:43:41,400
already been generated and then it became a you know an avalanche so to speak of circumstances

1732
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:45,720
anyway we're somewhere we're supposed we're not supposed to be and it was quiet

1733
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:49,800
so the captain figures we're going to do some nuclear drill scram the reactor pow scram the

1734
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:53,560
reactor normal procedure as we start to come up to periscope depth make sure that no we're not

1735
02:43:53,560 --> 02:43:58,200
going to hit anybody up on the surface come up raise the snorkel mast start the diesel generator

1736
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:01,640
well they try starting the diesel generator which is common commonplace wouldn't start

1737
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:08,440
wouldn't start and what had happened is there was this multi pin connector that for whatever

1738
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:14,280
reason disintegrated in the back of the of the diesel control panel so it's kind of like well

1739
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:20,680
that's going to take two days to put back together you know so we're on battery power to be honest

1740
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:26,360
with you we knew it was a drill and we were all real sloppy rigging for reduced electrical that's

1741
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:33,640
where we shut down on non-vital systems and we knew it was a drill so we were very slow in doing it

1742
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:39,880
we expended over half of our battery energy in that period of time so now all of a sudden the

1743
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:46,200
reactor shut down we can't start the diesel generator we've just consumed 50 of our battery

1744
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:52,600
power because we were screwing around kind of dragging our feet with this exercise so we realized

1745
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:59,800
what was happening and basically the decision was made restart the reactor well they try restarting

1746
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:06,120
the reactor and the reactor won't start and we've consumed all of our battery power so now

1747
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:11,160
we went to this like super super rig for reduced electrical where there's like you know emergency

1748
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:15,720
lighting and all the environmental systems are down so the air all of a sudden is almost

1749
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:21,720
unbreathable and it's it's it's in excess of 120 degrees and it's it's humid and it's just miserable

1750
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:28,120
can't get the reactor started and in my job surveillance i was down to one receiver i shut

1751
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:33,560
all my sophisticated stuff down i'm down to one receiver you can't make the story up it's like

1752
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:39,880
holy crap here comes the fleet it's like what are you talking about here comes the freaking

1753
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:47,320
soviet fleet headed right towards us like you gotta be kidding so it got really really hairy

1754
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:52,200
because this is the type of thing that like world war three could start over what's a submarine doing

1755
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:57,320
in our harbor you know violating our sovereign territory and all of this stuff you know we just

1756
02:45:57,320 --> 02:46:03,320
we couldn't get get caught so truth be told they were able to get the reactor started they

1757
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:12,040
had to kind of amend amend their procedures and come to find out it was actually a reactor control

1758
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:17,080
switch had failed it was a series of circumstances we called that day anybody that served on the boat

1759
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:23,560
in that era affectionately known as black tuesday because things were really really bad and i had

1760
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:30,360
it good i mean my space normally where i worked i had a wear like foul weather jacket to stay warm

1761
02:46:30,360 --> 02:46:33,960
because of all the air conditioning of course all the air conditioning was down

1762
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:38,280
but i tell you what the guys in the engineering spaces i mean they were stripped down to their

1763
02:46:38,280 --> 02:46:43,960
underwear and no shirts and they're just sweat and port sweat point i mean it's temperature skyrocketed

1764
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:48,200
you know 150 160 degrees back there in the engineering spaces you're trying to troubleshoot

1765
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:55,240
something but anyway it all worked out good in the end but that's the necessity of backup battery

1766
02:46:55,240 --> 02:46:58,520
now a lot of you may be saying well i'm never going to work on a nuclear submarine or a ship

1767
02:46:58,600 --> 02:47:02,520
or whatever no you might go to work as a biomedical electronics tech at a hospital

1768
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:07,240
guess what hospitals have backup battery banks you might go to work for the federal aviation

1769
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:13,640
administration federal aviation administration down in auburn washington at the mountain region

1770
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:17,320
air route traffic control center i don't know if any of you are aware of that facility if you've

1771
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:21,720
go to the like the muckleshoot casino down there it's like right across the street it's a big building

1772
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:26,680
fences around it garb guards all kinds of stuff like that that's where they control all the air

1773
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:32,200
traffic in the northwestern united states from western montana to the pacific ocean from the

1774
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:37,400
canadian border all the way to uh northern california if you're an airplane in flight you're talking

1775
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:43,160
to somebody in auburn washington they lose the power at that facility guess what the whole

1776
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:47,800
northwestern united states aircraft are flying blind so they were kind of smart about this they

1777
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:55,320
put in a battery backup system so as soon as the power ac crashes this these batteries have power

1778
02:47:55,320 --> 02:48:00,680
inverters and that brings it back up online so they don't miss a beat once the batteries are up

1779
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:05,480
online then they have diesel generators and another building on the property that will go

1780
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:09,560
ahead and kick in and they have huge huge fuel tanks so they could power that for a very very

1781
02:48:09,560 --> 02:48:14,120
long period of time if any of you have ever heard of the news of the past a lot of times if they

1782
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:18,520
have a glitch like an air traffic control system and switching over to backup power that's actually

1783
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:24,040
what what the problem is is going from ac to that battery backup if that if it if it doesn't happen

1784
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:28,920
seamlessly all of those systems go down you all know with computers you got to reboot computers

1785
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:33,240
so you have aircraft flying blind without air traffic control for a period of time

1786
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:41,080
so it could be somewhat of a inconvenience safety concern so a lot of you are going to see this

1787
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:47,000
actually one of the most reliable systems and this is uh i don't know how many of you still

1788
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:54,600
just have an old-fashioned power um old-fashioned telephone lying to your home pots it is called

1789
02:48:56,200 --> 02:49:00,840
and basically what that is is an old school just two wires coming to your home most of us now are

1790
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:07,000
on broadband and voice over ip and all this kind of crap the old school telephones were the most

1791
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:13,640
reliable you could have a power outage you could have earthquake whatever and you pick that phone

1792
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:18,680
up and you're still going to get a dial tone because that dial tone is being generated by backup

1793
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:24,360
battery banks at the central office and that's powering the phone system so you know i've

1794
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:30,280
experienced a lot of blackouts in my life where the power would go out and i never lost that dial

1795
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:37,880
tone on the phone now you know how many of you are like with comcast you know i mean what was i

1796
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:41,560
thinking when i went to actually believe it or not i'm not i'm not just talking to talk i'm walking

1797
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:46,440
to walk before i came to work today i actually called quest i want to get an old school line back

1798
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:51,480
into my house because i'm looking at my phone bill my freaking phone bill i don't like paying like

1799
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:56,680
70 bucks a month for you know call or id and call waiting and the only people that call me

1800
02:49:57,480 --> 02:50:04,040
are people that i don't want calling me okay so why am i paying 70 bucks a month to have

1801
02:50:04,040 --> 02:50:08,040
something that i don't want and i don't want to shut the line off because i have some other uses

1802
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:14,840
for that line so i called quest and i'm like it's kind of unusual request you have any of the

1803
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:21,560
old school lines that you know i could still have you know yeah yeah yeah and how much 13 dollars and

1804
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:28,360
50 cents a month plus tax i'm like that's what i want can you port my existing number out back

1805
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:33,320
to it yeah no problem so i'm gonna get that scheduled 1350 a month no you can't no long

1806
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:39,480
distance or anything but i don't want it for that i want it for that 911 i want it i don't know why

1807
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:42,680
i'm gonna disconnect the ringer because again the only people people that want to call me to call

1808
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:47,080
my cell number you know but i still need that if you have an alarm system at your home you need it

1809
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:53,960
if you've got a satellite tv box for updates and pay per view you need it so it could call into the

1810
02:50:53,960 --> 02:51:00,680
mother ship on a daily basis so battery backups are still out there so i don't think you're not

1811
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:05,800
going to go to work in the industry and never see a battery backup now you're all familiar with

1812
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:11,640
lead acid nickel cadmium nicad how many of you are familiar with nicad batteries nicad have been out

1813
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:17,720
for for a long period of time nicad's had a nasty habit of generating what was called a memory

1814
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:24,280
and what that memory was in essence is uh if any of you have ever had your arm or leg in a cast

1815
02:51:25,160 --> 02:51:30,520
and you don't use it basically the muscles forget how to fully exercise your range of motion you

1816
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:36,360
got to go through through some therapy to get your arm working again right kind of the same thing

1817
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:44,760
with a nicad a nicad if you didn't fully discharge it and then fully charge it it would only think

1818
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:52,040
that its range was in this narrow margin of performance so the problem with nicads with

1819
02:51:52,040 --> 02:51:57,480
like cam corridors and cell phones where as soon as that voltage started to drop a little bit you

1820
02:51:57,480 --> 02:52:02,840
start to get the low battery indicator and to preserve the electronic integrity of what you

1821
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:08,840
were doing it would shut off then you'd get it sticking in your charger charge it back up and

1822
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:13,640
what would happen it would only get used to operating in this little room right here some of

1823
02:52:13,640 --> 02:52:18,440
the manufacturers got smart and they put a little button on there and they could connect it to a load

1824
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:23,320
and drag it down all the way and then recharge it all the way i've gotten because i understand this

1825
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:29,480
stuff i've gotten exceptional exceptional use out of out of nicad batteries when my kids were

1826
02:52:29,480 --> 02:52:35,400
growing up my first video camera back in the 1980s i had one of those big vhs units don't laugh it was

1827
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:40,120
vhs at least it wasn't beta should have been beta beta was better but that's another story for another

1828
02:52:40,120 --> 02:52:46,040
day but it was one of these big herken vhs you know and it took this big 12 volt battery pack

1829
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:50,840
and i went to replace it and i was looking at some different vendors and they're looking at me

1830
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:55,160
and they couldn't believe that it was the original battery pack it's like we don't even carry

1831
02:52:55,160 --> 02:52:59,160
replacements for those anymore you know how long have you had this uh since the beginning

1832
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:05,480
well you know how could this be it's because i understood how to take care of nicads what i did

1833
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:10,600
is i made myself a dummy load and when the battery got low you know i mean obviously if it was a

1834
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:15,560
birthday party or something that i wanted a video i could recharge the battery but at least on a regular

1835
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:22,200
basis i would discharge it all the way and then charge it all the way and by the way with nickel

1836
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:26,680
cadmium cells when i say charge it all the way that doesn't mean slapping on your quick charger

1837
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:34,760
like if you've got a cordless drill at home a makita i got a quick charger for it worst thing

1838
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:40,680
you could do mine still works being all those quick chargers work they actually have a temperature

1839
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:47,960
sensor in the battery pack when the battery starts to get hot it must be full so it cuts the battery

1840
02:53:47,960 --> 02:53:55,880
off that's not a full charge the only true method of charging an icad properly is a timed charge

1841
02:53:55,880 --> 02:54:01,080
a trickle charge where you're trickling in a note amount of current and then you bring it gradually

1842
02:54:01,080 --> 02:54:07,800
up to that 100% now slam it and then the thing gets hot and then shuts off some of the early ones

1843
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:14,600
once it would stop charging it would cut it off right and then what would happen when the battery

1844
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:19,560
cooled down it started charging again and then would get hot and shut down so you ended up with

1845
02:54:19,560 --> 02:54:24,200
this cycle and these were the real cheap chargers and those would just eat these nicads so if you

1846
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:31,000
know about nicads nicads weren't that bad they really weren't the next thing was uh nickel metal

1847
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:36,440
hydride nickel metal hydride that was the next evolutionary process rechargeable battery secondary

1848
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:42,760
cells a lot of us had them years ago and our cell phones worked very very well less prone to that

1849
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:49,160
memory condition with all these secondary batteries though is it a limited unlimited number of charges

1850
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:55,880
and discharges and recharges no every rechargeable battery when it's brand new you only get so many

1851
02:54:55,880 --> 02:55:01,160
cycles out of it they're not going to last forever even if you take good care of them and then now

1852
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:06,840
lithium ion lithium ion if you've got a newer cell phone probably came with lithium ion that's

1853
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:21,320
really the best that's out there now i don't know i was just i don't know i was thinking about that

1854
02:55:21,320 --> 02:55:25,720
the other day because i've and i've actually gotten new battery put aside that i've never charged it

1855
02:55:25,720 --> 02:55:33,640
still in the package so um i don't know i've been keeping my eyes open in the store for that style

1856
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:38,280
pack and i'm sure it's available on the internet but what am i going to have to pay for it you know

1857
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:42,280
the other thing though too check this out because you know i'm not the smartest guy but i kind of

1858
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:48,440
understand some of this stuff some of those cases you could actually cut them open and you could

1859
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:53,800
replace the cells yourself you know and then re bond the plastic back together and i've done that

1860
02:55:53,800 --> 02:56:01,640
on several things myself as i've reconditioned put in new packs i had a i had some i forgot what the

1861
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:10,520
heck it was it took nycad batteries and then what i did is i cut it open and it was just standard

1862
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:16,120
nycad battery usually doesn't have the label on it but the sizes were the same and then what i did

1863
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:23,080
is i went to a harbor freight tools and i bought nickel metal hydride rechargeable cells and i put

1864
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:31,320
the pack back together soldered it up good to go good to go so in some some cases you could do that

1865
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:37,320
a lot of high performance things too even like jet aircraft if you're down drive past bowing field

1866
02:56:37,320 --> 02:56:42,360
you see a lear jet sitting out there believe it or not what they're typically going to use is not

1867
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:48,120
the lead acid they're actually going to have nycad packs so when they start the engines on the jet

1868
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:52,760
they're starting it off a nycad and those are very very expensive so it's kind of amazing

1869
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:57,320
you're a multi-millionaire flying around in a lear jet a lot of times you know what those guys will

1870
02:56:57,320 --> 02:57:02,760
ask for they want a starter pack to be brought over with a little tug and there's a cart with a

1871
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:07,800
bunch of batteries on it a lot of acid batteries and then you plug that into the aircraft and then

1872
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:13,240
what they'll do is they'll they'll use that so they don't have to put a charge discharge cycle in

1873
02:57:13,240 --> 02:57:17,960
their night nycads in their precious lear jet it's like man if you could afford a freaking lear jet

1874
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:24,280
you can afford a new freaking nycad you know but i used to work part you're the funnest job i ever

1875
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:29,160
had i worked part-time at an airport canada kept those guys always used to amaze me and a lot of

1876
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:33,240
them wouldn't a lot of them would tip you you know you bring that pack over whatever here you go go

1877
02:57:33,240 --> 02:57:38,840
go buy yourself a good lunch here son oh thank you sir you know i didn't mind somebody's dude so

1878
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:44,680
man i'm saving you money you're not even tossing me a bone come on man the heck next time i'm gonna

1879
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:53,400
park you out there this is the cutaway view of a lead acid cell now connecting cells and batteries

1880
02:57:54,920 --> 02:58:01,960
connecting cells and batteries we have series aiding this this chart here is is erroneous

1881
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:11,960
um let me draw this on the board here what we're talking about here series aiding means

1882
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:20,760
negative positive i can assume that this is what voltage

1883
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:29,480
1.5 volts so if i connect it to another cell

1884
02:58:31,640 --> 02:58:40,680
i can assume that this is 1.5 volts and if i go ahead and even connect the third cell down here

1885
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:49,160
i can assume that this is 1.5 volts what am i up to right here what's my total voltage

1886
02:58:49,160 --> 02:58:56,920
from this point to this point okay very good 4.5 volts everybody see that

1887
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:07,960
everybody see that so what i'm doing here is by series in series aiding i am increasing the

1888
02:59:08,040 --> 02:59:15,000
electrical pressure that's available to me the amount of current that's available here

1889
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:22,360
is going to stay the same because this is what we call a series configuration and current will

1890
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:29,080
always stay the same in a series configuration so by connecting up batteries or cells like this

1891
02:59:29,080 --> 02:59:36,680
i could get a higher voltage but current will remain the same does that make sense

1892
02:59:38,760 --> 02:59:44,920
now down below it talks about series opposing series opposing would be like

1893
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:48,600
okay i got a negative and a positive here

1894
02:59:51,160 --> 02:59:52,040
y'all agree with that

1895
02:59:54,920 --> 02:59:57,960
then i'm going to connect the positive and a negative here

1896
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:05,080
so i've got 1.5 volts here and how many volts do i have here

1897
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:17,720
minus 1.5 volts so what's my voltage across zero so

1898
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:26,280
my slide which is politically correct says it has little practical value it's actually stupid

1899
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:31,480
this is like you know you're you're putting a battery in backwards why come my flashlight no

1900
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:36,360
work and you take them out you realize you're putting one of the cells backwards has little

1901
03:00:36,440 --> 03:00:43,560
practical value this one's adding 1.5 volts this one's taking 1.5 volts away you're putting

1902
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:49,080
a negative and a negative here current's not going to want to flow again it has little practical

1903
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:55,800
value yeah challenging electronic students when they're going through a theory course like this

1904
03:00:56,440 --> 03:01:00,840
it really is because i could draw like five or six of these and then you got it let's see plus

1905
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:08,200
1.5 plus 1.5 minus 1.5 minus so we are going to give you some problems like that that have

1906
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:12,200
voltages because quite frankly when you do get into sophisticated electronic equipment

1907
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:17,000
you're going to see that there are some voltages that are being added to a circuit and some that

1908
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:22,200
are being taken away from a circuit so from a math standpoint a theory standpoint it does have value

1909
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:31,480
in studying it in parallel and again this is a this is a typo here these should not be equal

1910
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:37,480
signs this should be total current is equal to i1 plus i2 plus i3 let me show you this one

1911
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:42,920
actually let me just go to the next slide and i'll show you on the slide this is what we were

1912
03:01:42,920 --> 03:01:46,600
talking about or this is what i was talking about i don't know if we're talking about it it's what i'm

1913
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:53,800
talking about one point uh this is three volts three volts and three volts is equal to how much

1914
03:01:53,800 --> 03:02:00,040
across this six volts can you dig it all right so here we got three volts and three volts which is

1915
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:11,960
equal to six volts connected in parallel with six volts why why come why come i do this why would

1916
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:22,040
i possibly what is the advantage of this over this what's that is the voltage increased

1917
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:28,600
you said to increase the voltage in the current is the voltage increased

1918
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:39,240
no i still get how much electrical pressure am i getting out of the circuit six volts

1919
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:47,960
what's that increase the capacity tell me more about that i like that

1920
03:02:51,240 --> 03:02:56,680
very good batteries are measured in in amp hours how much current

1921
03:02:58,760 --> 03:03:04,520
over a period of time can they provide us with so let's look at this scenario for a

1922
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:08,520
minute let's say that we all have a sailboat wouldn't it be nice if we all had a sailboat

1923
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:14,680
we could sail off to the sunset let's sail up to the sand one islands and hang out up there

1924
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:23,960
okay i've got a six volt it's an unusual sailboat i've got a six volt anchor light

1925
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:32,040
so when i find a nice cove up in the sand wands and i drop my anchor by coast guard regulations

1926
03:03:32,040 --> 03:03:40,520
i'm required at night to turn on a light that says i'm anchored and it's a six volt light

1927
03:03:42,360 --> 03:03:49,720
the problem is this configuration here will only last for six hours

1928
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:58,760
and then the light gets dimmer and dimmer and dimmer until it goes out

1929
03:03:59,400 --> 03:04:05,880
and shortly after it goes out the fog rolls in and here comes along a washington state ferry

1930
03:04:07,160 --> 03:04:12,520
and it runs us down and it ruins ruins all of our fun that we're having on our sailboat in sand

1931
03:04:12,520 --> 03:04:21,640
one islands so i'm a pretty smart guy what i did is i went out and i got another battery pack

1932
03:04:21,640 --> 03:04:29,480
and i i put it in parallel with the original battery pack the original battery pack lasted

1933
03:04:29,480 --> 03:04:37,080
for how many hours how many is this going to last for for the same size load it's going to last

1934
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:41,080
twice as long how's about them apples

1935
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:51,160
that's how it works so basically he or she who has the most batteries in parallel is going to

1936
03:04:51,160 --> 03:04:58,680
last the longest playing it simple it was actually kind of a funny story

1937
03:05:01,160 --> 03:05:07,800
um going to sea for extended periods of time under the water there are very few things i mean even

1938
03:05:07,800 --> 03:05:15,160
reading material books how many books can you bring with you what can you do so back in the day

1939
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:19,960
the only the only form of media for me basically for music was cassette tapes

1940
03:05:21,400 --> 03:05:27,000
so i had my little i didn't even have a sony walkman i eventually upgraded to a sony walkman

1941
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:34,280
but originally i had some you know off brand cassette player and actually that was a big

1942
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:38,920
advancement because prior to that you needed the big cassette player put the cassette in headphones

1943
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:45,480
you know no eight track i'm talking strictly the cassettes we this was high tech cassettes

1944
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:52,920
so i bought something that looked like a walkman but of course walkman is a trademark of sony

1945
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:58,360
corporation and this was some off brand so it was so funny too because uh you know everything

1946
03:05:58,360 --> 03:06:02,760
that we did was super secret you couldn't tell anybody we couldn't even tell our spouses that

1947
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:09,400
we were going so all of a sudden you see a guy in uniform you know at the at the exchange

1948
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:15,400
you know buying like you know five tubes of toothpaste and seven bars of soap and you

1949
03:06:15,400 --> 03:06:21,080
know a hundred packs of batteries and he's in uniform with his unit you know on his ball cap

1950
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:26,040
and you know it's kind of like ah you're stocking up you guys are going to see you know so you didn't

1951
03:06:26,040 --> 03:06:30,840
have to be like an intelligence expert to figure out who's coming and going so anyway we're going

1952
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:35,720
to go to see and it was going to be like a seven month operation that doesn't mean that we'd be

1953
03:06:35,720 --> 03:06:42,040
totally in communicato or away from civilized uh you know shopping or whatever but for at least

1954
03:06:42,040 --> 03:06:50,120
a minimum of 90 days we're going to be underwater so i go out and my my cassette player took

1955
03:06:50,120 --> 03:06:56,520
double a batteries so i bought a bunch of these double a batteries well come to find out that this

1956
03:06:56,520 --> 03:07:06,920
thing was such a piece of crap that i could want i could listen to 1.5 sides of a cassette tape

1957
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:14,040
before the batteries would die and i'm like i'm not a math expert but i'm like i'm going to run out

1958
03:07:14,040 --> 03:07:20,120
of batteries like really quick so after i used up all my double a batteries and i still want

1959
03:07:20,120 --> 03:07:25,160
that to listen to music because again you're living with 120 other people in a steel tube 285

1960
03:07:25,160 --> 03:07:30,600
feet long 28 foot diameter when you could put those headset on and you could kind of zone out

1961
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:36,200
that was you know a little piece of piece of tranquility you could have so i'm like well i'm

1962
03:07:36,200 --> 03:07:40,200
a smart guy i got electronics background how tough can this be so i cracked the thing off i figured

1963
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:48,360
out what voltage i could wire in externally so then what i did is um uh every every division on

1964
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:53,000
the submarine had different consumable products they were responsible for stocking because you

1965
03:07:53,000 --> 03:08:00,360
didn't have a store so actually for my division it was pens pads paper so if you were a nuclear

1966
03:08:00,360 --> 03:08:05,320
reactor guy you'd come to me and say hey joe you know can i need some pens look screw you

1967
03:08:05,320 --> 03:08:11,240
you know but i'd give you the pens or the paper whatever you need well ironically the division

1968
03:08:11,240 --> 03:08:18,200
that was responsible for first um uh providing batteries ironically were the electricians so

1969
03:08:18,200 --> 03:08:21,240
when i went back and i said you know i need some batteries what do you guys got well you know we

1970
03:08:21,240 --> 03:08:25,720
got these sizes here and they were the you know the big d size and they were military you know olive

1971
03:08:25,720 --> 03:08:32,600
drab green big batteries and i'm like yeah give me like eight of them you know so i got these eight

1972
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:39,160
batteries and i wind them all up wired them all up combination series parallel and then i got

1973
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:45,080
electrical tape and i like this big freaking brick you know and so i got this this nice little

1974
03:08:45,080 --> 03:08:49,880
portable cassette player that i paid you know an exorbitant amount of money for and then i got this

1975
03:08:49,880 --> 03:08:57,480
big brick i'm like so it was truly a portable device you know so anyway it worked and it worked

1976
03:08:57,480 --> 03:09:03,800
fine and then i got so used to carrying this thing around that it was like months later we're in port

1977
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:09,000
and i'm still carrying this brick and i even with a handle on it it was and it kept working and i'm

1978
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:13,000
like why am i doing this this thing is stupid i finally i actually cut it off and i threw it

1979
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:16,520
over the side of the boat it's probably sitting in the bottom of the Thames river in connecticut

1980
03:09:16,520 --> 03:09:25,880
still but the moral of the story is that portable cassette recorder operated off of 1.5 volt cells

1981
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:33,000
did it not what was the difference when i added the brick to it those are 1.5 volt cells right

1982
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:42,280
capacity physically more chemical physically more capacity higher amp hour rating and it

1983
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:47,560
kept going and going and going and going and going so this is one of the principles for a lot of

1984
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:56,760
you that may pursue alternative energy whatever that means basically it's the efficiency of your

1985
03:09:56,760 --> 03:10:05,080
cells how many cells do you have how much energy can you store actually had a student that is a

1986
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:13,960
project he owns the property in central washington and um living off the grid had a backup generator

1987
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:19,480
also put in some photovoltaic cells and as a project he basically did the math and figured out

1988
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:25,800
like on the shortest day of the year how many appliances am i going to want to run in my little

1989
03:10:25,800 --> 03:10:32,040
cabin and will i have enough electrical energy to make it through the night and that's basically

1990
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:38,120
what his target was and he says i need this much storage capacity and that's what he used as a target

1991
03:10:38,120 --> 03:10:45,160
actually increased that i think by about 20 percent and then in the summer how many how many hours

1992
03:10:45,160 --> 03:10:50,200
could he use photovoltaic to charge that and then what's the minimum amount of time that he needs to

1993
03:10:50,200 --> 03:10:56,440
run his generator to get those batteries up to that full capacity charge so if you understand

1994
03:10:56,440 --> 03:11:00,200
the math behind this let me tell you your commodity out there because a lot of people

1995
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:07,560
don't have a freaking clue they don't they don't when i was on a cruise a couple weeks ago on

1996
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:12,200
vacation i met a uh i'm trying to i'm trying to get on better terms with this guy and actually

1997
03:11:12,200 --> 03:11:20,200
we've been corresponding via email he owns a 52 foot yacht in miami and an airplane high-performance

1998
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:29,880
aircraft and um he likes taking his his yacht down to the bahamas in dropping anchor and he

1999
03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:34,600
doesn't like running the generator so we had a whole discussion about energy management photovoltaic

2000
03:11:34,600 --> 03:11:40,120
what's the minimum amount of time that you could run your generator can you add batteries to augment

2001
03:11:40,120 --> 03:11:46,440
the system and i mean this guy he's a couple masters degree highly intelligent and he didn't

2002
03:11:46,440 --> 03:11:51,640
have a clue of what i was talking about so if you understand this let me tell you

2003
03:11:53,240 --> 03:11:55,960
you got it going on when it comes to this type of stuff makes sense

2004
03:11:58,840 --> 03:12:03,800
voltage rise is the energy we put into a circuit voltage drop is the energy that we take out of

2005
03:12:03,800 --> 03:12:08,520
the circuit if you will is given up as the electrons encounter resistance to the circuit

2006
03:12:11,160 --> 03:12:15,240
so voltage rise would be like your batteries voltage drop is what you're powering

2007
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:22,120
and you know what they should always be equal to each other if you've got a five-volt battery pack

2008
03:12:22,120 --> 03:12:27,480
and you're powering a radio that radio should be consuming five volts five volt voltage rise five

2009
03:12:27,480 --> 03:12:34,520
volt voltage drop makes sense should never end up with energy left over if you are that's what we

2010
03:12:34,520 --> 03:12:39,960
call a malfunction you've got a malfunction you've got voltage not going from the source to the load

2011
03:12:40,920 --> 03:12:46,200
the voltage rise that the power company provides my house with is 240 volts a c

2012
03:12:47,240 --> 03:12:54,120
my voltage drop for my home is 240 volts a c if it was 239 that means a volt is being dropped

2013
03:12:54,120 --> 03:13:00,440
somewhere underground or in the overhead it's not supposed to be getting dropped there question

2014
03:13:10,920 --> 03:13:11,640
voltage rise

2015
03:13:19,960 --> 03:13:27,560
yeah that's your question is more related to power i'm talking simply voltage i'm talking simply

2016
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:33,160
voltage so that if i've got and i'm keeping it real simplistic and you need to understand it in a

2017
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:40,520
simplistic manner if this calculator takes three volts dc the three volts dc is going to be my

2018
03:13:40,520 --> 03:13:47,880
voltage drop right if i want this thing to operate properly i need to give it a voltage rise of

2019
03:13:49,320 --> 03:13:55,880
three volts so that's all i'm saying voltage rise is the power is the elect the voltage pressure

2020
03:13:55,880 --> 03:14:02,200
you apply to it the voltage drop is the pressure that gets consumed by the load and they should

2021
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:07,400
always be equal if they're not wherever the missing voltages that's a problem

2022
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:17,080
if you're consuming less than what the power company's providing you with you've got a problem

2023
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:22,680
because that missing voltage has got to be somewhere and where you find it that's the problem

2024
03:14:24,520 --> 03:14:29,560
make sense okay we'll talk more about that concept but right now i just want you to understand

2025
03:14:30,520 --> 03:14:32,280
voltage rise equals voltage drop

2026
03:14:35,080 --> 03:14:43,400
ground ground this is an interesting concept and if you hear ever driven over snow qualmi pass

2027
03:14:44,520 --> 03:14:48,760
how do you know you're going over snow qualmi pass it's not a trick question

2028
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:56,360
how do you know you're going over the pass there's a sign on the side of the road that says

2029
03:14:57,320 --> 03:14:58,760
snow qualmi pass

2030
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:09,240
i try to keep it basic here now that sign also says snow qualmi pass and there's another bit

2031
03:15:09,240 --> 03:15:19,720
of information there elevation elevation above what north bend seattle above where

2032
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:25,400
sea level you guys are all smart you guys are one of my smartest classes here in a while

2033
03:15:27,080 --> 03:15:37,080
high tide or low tide average you know what we call that

2034
03:15:39,800 --> 03:15:46,840
msl mean sea level mean sea level so one of the things that al gore is talking about like sea

2035
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:53,720
level rising that's what he's talking about so his big concern is all the expense of changing all

2036
03:15:53,720 --> 03:16:00,280
the signs elevation now obviously it's going to cause a lot of problems if mean sea level if

2037
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:05,320
the polar ice caps melt and sea level rises it's going to be a lot of flooding and devastation

2038
03:16:05,960 --> 03:16:12,120
okay especially during hurricanes and high tide events and tsunamis and everything else

2039
03:16:14,600 --> 03:16:21,240
so we use the height of the ocean mean sea level as a reference for all of our height measurements

2040
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:26,120
it's actually really important when i fly my airplane it's one of the first things instruments

2041
03:16:26,120 --> 03:16:32,600
i calibrate when i get in is the altimeter and that shows me how high i am above sea level

2042
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:39,560
it's kind of important i flew my airplane friday night i went across the top of c-tac airport

2043
03:16:40,360 --> 03:16:44,440
i had airplanes taken off and arriving and i'm flying through there in my small plane

2044
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,480
you kind of think it's important that i know what else to do what i'm at

2045
03:16:48,440 --> 03:16:53,720
yeah and as a matter of fact they check back with you when you establish radio communications

2046
03:16:53,720 --> 03:16:59,880
they say you know hold maintain 1500 forces kilo what's your current altitude 1500 roger we got

2047
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:04,520
you at 1500 you're cleared through our airspace because they want to make sure you're not off

2048
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:09,880
it's important to me so that's how we calibrate if you're in hiking driving even boating mean sea

2049
03:17:09,880 --> 03:17:15,000
level is kind of critical isn't it high tide low tide if you're at low tide you hit a freaking rock

2050
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,560
it's kind of important you have the right charge and you understand low tide

2051
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:29,800
mean mean no mean me and mean which is average so when we started playing around with electricity

2052
03:17:29,800 --> 03:17:37,720
we had to come up with a methodology if you will to what's what's what can we compare what's a

2053
03:17:37,720 --> 03:17:41,160
benchmark of something that's in a neutral natural state

2054
03:17:45,480 --> 03:17:53,720
earth why because this is where we be okay this is where we're standing so literally what we got

2055
03:17:53,720 --> 03:18:00,760
is a ground rod an eight foot ground rod drive it into the earth and say you know what you connected

2056
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:09,320
you're connected to ground and you're connected to zero potential it's not positive it's not

2057
03:18:09,320 --> 03:18:16,120
negative it's neutral why because it's driven into the freaking ground so what happens is

2058
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:24,280
the idea kind of caught on so the power company out at the power pole or your transformer if you

2059
03:18:24,280 --> 03:18:29,640
have underground they got a rod and they drove it into the ground they said you know what we're

2060
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:41,240
going to sell you 240 volts ac in reference to ground at your home at your load you should get

2061
03:18:41,240 --> 03:18:49,640
240 volts in reference to ground the electrical generating plant where they generate the electricity

2062
03:18:49,640 --> 03:18:56,200
they drove a ground rod in and they reference that voltage to ground so we use it as a reference to

2063
03:18:56,200 --> 03:19:01,000
all of our voltages which are really quite critical i'm kind of making fun of this in a in a in a

2064
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:08,360
goofy way but in all honesty it's actually really really critical like right now at my home i've got

2065
03:19:08,360 --> 03:19:17,240
the electrical connection coming from the power company in reference to hopefully ground i get my

2066
03:19:17,240 --> 03:19:24,040
telephone line soon to be replaced kicking at old school and that needs to be referenced to

2067
03:19:24,920 --> 03:19:31,960
ground i've got a satellite receiver that has the antenna up on the roof that antenna needs to

2068
03:19:31,960 --> 03:19:38,040
be referenced to ground the satellite receiver also plugs into the electrical outlet that should

2069
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:43,480
be referenced at ground and it also needs to be plugged into the telephone connection that should

2070
03:19:43,480 --> 03:19:51,720
be referenced at ground actually when i had con cast installed in my home it was over the summer

2071
03:19:51,720 --> 03:19:56,600
i had time off i was watching these dudes install it and because i teach electronics i'd always like

2072
03:19:56,600 --> 03:20:00,520
to say hey dude what's going on man how long you've been with comcast these people treat you okay

2073
03:20:00,520 --> 03:20:05,160
what's the deal what's your educational background what's going down you know how are you doing that

2074
03:20:05,160 --> 03:20:08,520
if i could learn something from you somebody that doesn't installs all day long i'm gonna pick your

2075
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:13,560
brain and see what i can learn anyway see this dude hooking his freaking contraption up to my

2076
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:18,120
my my faucet i'm like what are you doing he said i'm connecting this to ground we got a reference

2077
03:20:18,120 --> 03:20:24,120
at the ground i'm like hold on cease and desist what are you doing well i got to connect this to

2078
03:20:24,120 --> 03:20:27,880
ground i says my freaking water connection well yeah but this is you know water pipe is a good

2079
03:20:27,880 --> 03:20:34,760
ground no you see that right there driven into the ground that's a ground rod okay that's the

2080
03:20:34,760 --> 03:20:39,560
same ground rod that the power company's providing me with the ground it's the same ground that everything

2081
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:43,400
else in the house is connected to so why are you going to connect it to this faucet coming out all

2082
03:20:43,400 --> 03:20:48,360
you don't know if it's pvc inside he really got an attitude and i'm like no boom cease and desist

2083
03:20:48,360 --> 03:20:53,640
i got a supervisor out there and i had assigned paperwork modified install modified install

2084
03:20:56,120 --> 03:21:02,040
customer request i want ground and i wrote that right in there me want ground to be connected to

2085
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:06,760
ground rod you know so they all really got an attitude and stuff you know but it's kind of like

2086
03:21:06,760 --> 03:21:10,200
no i mean it really needs to happen because especially too this is back in the day when

2087
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:14,920
you had a computer modem you could have that modem you could have your computer power supply you

2088
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:20,360
could have all these things and if they're not all connected to ground they could develop a difference

2089
03:21:20,360 --> 03:21:27,160
in potential and if they develop a difference in potential you know how that's going to manifest

2090
03:21:27,160 --> 03:21:34,120
itself with highly sophisticated electronic systems not necessarily sparks of fire could be gremlins

2091
03:21:34,680 --> 03:21:41,160
it could just be real wacky behavior all of a sudden your satellite receiver starts rebooting

2092
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:45,720
itself all of a sudden your computer reboots itself all of a sudden your modem kicks you out

2093
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:51,640
so when they started doing all of this interbuilding networking and everything it became a real big

2094
03:21:51,640 --> 03:21:58,280
issue to make sure that ground was really ground years ago when they built this building uh well

2095
03:21:58,280 --> 03:22:03,400
actually they renovated this building behind here they pulled up the concrete they drilled down into

2096
03:22:03,400 --> 03:22:09,000
the earth and they put in this huge ground for the school to make sure it wasn't just a standard

2097
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:13,320
ground rod this was like drilled way down into into the earth you know you can see like the

2098
03:22:13,320 --> 03:22:19,320
core and stuff and i'm just kidding but it was it was it was pretty far down in this is actually

2099
03:22:19,320 --> 03:22:24,360
one of the problems they have like in arizona because of the sand and in the desert and it's

2100
03:22:24,360 --> 03:22:29,880
we have good ground here because it's like all wet but in arizona they have some problems so

2101
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:34,280
i think there's some uh code variants down there where they're like actually connecting

2102
03:22:34,280 --> 03:22:39,480
like rebar in the concrete you know foundation and such and they do some different stuff down there

2103
03:22:39,480 --> 03:22:43,480
i'm not totally familiar with it but some of those dry climates they have to do it john

2104
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:52,600
it was and they were actually adding chemicals to almost create like a p and an n type material

2105
03:22:52,600 --> 03:22:57,400
there so current would only have one way to travel through that like a giant diode buried in the

2106
03:22:57,400 --> 03:23:02,760
ground behind here so i wish i'd take a picture it's like i know you know you're not believing me

2107
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:07,560
but it was like a drilling rig out there it's like black gold texas tea we're going to hollywood

2108
03:23:09,480 --> 03:23:17,320
anyway the other type of electrical ground is electrical ground and this provides a common

2109
03:23:17,320 --> 03:23:29,160
reference point we use this electrical ground because the 747 taking off would look stupid

2110
03:23:29,800 --> 03:23:37,240
with a big reel spool wired trailing behind it okay it just wouldn't look right so for pure

2111
03:23:37,240 --> 03:23:43,720
aesthetic purposes we can't do this so we use what's called electrical ground your car uses

2112
03:23:43,720 --> 03:23:50,440
electrical ground airplanes use electrical ground ships use electrical ground and what that in

2113
03:23:50,440 --> 03:23:57,800
essence means is a chassis ground now most of our home appliances use both we ground the chassis

2114
03:23:59,240 --> 03:24:06,680
the electrical ground to earth ground so that if you have a three prong plug one of those plugs

2115
03:24:06,680 --> 03:24:10,520
that round plug is ground and that's connected to the chassis

2116
03:24:13,480 --> 03:24:18,520
so be aware of this in the lab you're going to have some problems with ground

2117
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:26,760
because you don't understand what i'm talking about some of the equipment that we have in the

2118
03:24:26,760 --> 03:24:32,440
lab is isolated from ground so when you connect the negative lead like on a power supply you think

2119
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:37,240
you're connecting ground as a chat you're not that negative if you have a dc power supply in the

2120
03:24:37,240 --> 03:24:43,160
lab you have a positive you have a negative they're isolated from ground they have nothing to do with

2121
03:24:43,160 --> 03:24:48,360
earth ground so in some cases you could create a ground loop in there and they get wacky results

2122
03:24:48,360 --> 03:24:55,400
with your equipment most commercial consumer industrial products are for the purposes of

2123
03:24:55,400 --> 03:25:00,120
electrical safety that chassis will be a ground and that's connected also to earth ground question

2124
03:25:02,600 --> 03:25:05,240
electrical ground can vary from whatever you want

2125
03:25:07,320 --> 03:25:11,400
absolutely absolutely and that's one of the things that could be a real problem

2126
03:25:11,400 --> 03:25:16,120
is you might think you get into a piece of equipment and say oh wow look at this big metal

2127
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:21,080
look at this big um if this was inside this is actually a dc power supply like we use in the lab

2128
03:25:21,720 --> 03:25:27,720
okay this in the back here is a heat sink if this was installed inside some big piece of

2129
03:25:27,720 --> 03:25:32,520
equipment like a radar system you see this metal you assume that oh this metal here that's that's

2130
03:25:32,520 --> 03:25:39,000
that's ground that must be ground because it's metal right and all of a sudden you know you put

2131
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:46,200
your hand on there you lean into it and you get electrocuted this in some cases could be electrically

2132
03:25:46,200 --> 03:25:53,640
isolated from ground this could be connected to some big high power transmitter tube for the purpose

2133
03:25:53,640 --> 03:25:58,040
of dissipating energy and it could actually have like that mica that i passed round earlier

2134
03:25:58,600 --> 03:26:04,760
it could have a big sheet of that mica there electrically insulating it from the rest of

2135
03:26:04,760 --> 03:26:09,880
the chassis or frame of the piece of equipment and that's taken out many a good technician

2136
03:26:09,880 --> 03:26:16,440
so never assume never assume generally yes some of the worst shocking experiences i've ever had

2137
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:21,160
were working on a lot of tube circuits because sometimes those tube circuits were notorious

2138
03:26:21,160 --> 03:26:26,360
for too prong old school tube amplifier you plug it in too prong and you didn't have that

2139
03:26:26,360 --> 03:26:30,040
electrical ground in there all of a sudden you you go up against the chassis and you're getting

2140
03:26:30,040 --> 03:26:41,560
getting zapped by 300 volts make sense all right we talked about current flow of electrons

2141
03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:46,440
in a specified direction happens at the speed of light voltage and there's only six different

2142
03:26:46,440 --> 03:26:52,120
methods of producing voltage friction magnetism chemicals light heat and pressure we talked about

2143
03:26:52,120 --> 03:26:57,960
voltage rise that's the energy that we put into a circuit voltage drop is the voltage we get out

2144
03:26:57,960 --> 03:27:03,080
of the circuit voltage rise and voltage drop should equal each other if they don't you got a problem

2145
03:27:03,080 --> 03:27:10,360
am i being silly am i keeping it basic yeah but you know what i have fixed in my career dozens

2146
03:27:10,360 --> 03:27:16,840
of problems that that was the symptom and the symptom is the equipment doesn't work right what's

2147
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:21,880
the first thing that i do check the voltage coming in if the voltage coming in isn't good

2148
03:27:21,880 --> 03:27:27,080
it's not going to work right then you got to find out where the missing voltages maybe it's a brown

2149
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:32,680
out maybe it's a brown out maybe the power company they're having a problem with with with generating

2150
03:27:32,680 --> 03:27:38,840
power and giving you know the feed but those two always need to equal each other we also talked

2151
03:27:38,840 --> 03:27:46,600
about ground earth ground is a freaking rod driven into the earth why the earth well it's where we

2152
03:27:46,600 --> 03:27:51,000
stand it's where we live it is what it is neutral natural state and we talked about electrical

2153
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:58,040
ground which is typically the chassis could be the airframe of an airplane which is actually kind of

2154
03:27:58,040 --> 03:28:03,080
odd it's kind of odd when they talk about an airplane because what's Boeing building now

2155
03:28:03,880 --> 03:28:12,200
787 what's that thing made out of aluminum composite think about this one by using the

2156
03:28:12,200 --> 03:28:17,160
chassis of your automobile as ground you know how much wiring it saves on your car

2157
03:28:20,360 --> 03:28:23,560
go ahead make a stab at it you know how much how much wiring it saves on your car

2158
03:28:24,920 --> 03:28:32,360
saves half the wiring if your car was made out of composites and it was not a conductive material

2159
03:28:32,360 --> 03:28:38,520
you would have double the amount of wires on your car because we use the chassis as an electrical

2160
03:28:38,520 --> 03:28:48,680
connection make sense okay i've got a question for you and i'm going to ask you about this uh in

2161
03:28:48,680 --> 03:28:59,800
our next lecture and i want you to discuss this in teams and as a class since there are six different

2162
03:28:59,800 --> 03:29:13,240
methods of producing voltage i am going to design a deep space probe to boldly go where no man has

2163
03:29:13,240 --> 03:29:24,680
gone before so this deep space probe is going to probe deep space that's why it's called deep space

2164
03:29:24,680 --> 03:29:37,800
probe what method should i use to power this thing in outer space so that it keeps going

2165
03:29:37,800 --> 03:29:45,000
and going and going and sending data back to earth through a high power transmitter so we could we

2166
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:51,320
could monitor its journey from afar i want you to think about this i want you to discuss it as teams

2167
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:57,800
in next week when we lecture on e-lc 110 i'm going to expect an answer from unit better b

2168
03:29:57,800 --> 03:30:05,720
and the right answer they're all hell's going to break loose any questions question

2169
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:18,120
um

2170
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:28,120
radiating something absolutely

2171
03:30:35,880 --> 03:30:39,720
sounds like you got some good ideas that are worth pursuing

2172
03:30:42,920 --> 03:30:50,680
enough said we've got somebody in here that's thinking that's cool question how do you measure

2173
03:30:50,680 --> 03:30:59,720
ground it is measured in ohms um what you do is you have to it's a comparative process of what

2174
03:30:59,720 --> 03:31:09,320
you assume is a good ground and um you're basically comparing your ground unknown ground to that good

2175
03:31:09,320 --> 03:31:17,400
ground but there's an assumption may made that by getting an eight foot long rod in in driving it in

2176
03:31:17,400 --> 03:31:22,200
that that is providing you with an adequate adequate ground you need something else to compare it to

2177
03:31:22,760 --> 03:31:32,440
in order for your assessment to be accurate what are you measuring it in reference to

2178
03:31:41,720 --> 03:31:47,080
okay well you're doing from an electrical outlet if i wanted to verify that this is a good ground

2179
03:31:47,800 --> 03:31:52,200
um in actuality what i need to do here is i could measure ground against my neutral

2180
03:31:52,200 --> 03:32:00,040
those two should be connected back at that box okay so between the hot lead and ground

2181
03:32:00,040 --> 03:32:04,520
in between the hot lead and neutral i should end up with the same difference in potential

2182
03:32:04,520 --> 03:32:09,880
then going with a multimeter to that box i should get that same difference in potential across the

2183
03:32:09,880 --> 03:32:14,760
two and that basically is letting me know that the ground and the neutral for that particular

2184
03:32:14,760 --> 03:32:24,920
circuit are valid but for you to compare a good earth ground to a not so good earth ground

2185
03:32:27,160 --> 03:32:30,840
i don't know how you'd go about that other than you you've got to you've got to basically know

2186
03:32:30,840 --> 03:32:37,320
that one of them is is good and that's actually one of the things about ground too that um i don't

2187
03:32:37,880 --> 03:32:47,480
any of you are aware a lot of am radio stations are located in swamp lands it's the best place

2188
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:54,120
that you could put an am radio station because in a swampy area you get a really good ground

2189
03:32:54,760 --> 03:32:59,400
so you get a really good ground plane and because the frequencies that you radiate at

2190
03:33:00,200 --> 03:33:07,080
it's going to ensure much better transmission of that rf signal a second choice is also a field

2191
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:15,160
a pasture where cows graze and urinate and keep everything nice and moist okay and healthy

2192
03:33:15,960 --> 03:33:20,280
that's why even in new york city grown up in connectica all the new york city radio stations

2193
03:33:20,280 --> 03:33:26,520
wabc wnbc wcbs all of their transmitters were located in new jersey the meadowlands

2194
03:33:27,160 --> 03:33:31,880
okay if there's any giant fans here through all their transmitters were located why because it was

2195
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:38,440
a marshy location fm transmitters different if you're in new york city where do you want to

2196
03:33:38,440 --> 03:33:44,600
put an fm transmitter top of the empire state building why because it's the highest it doesn't

2197
03:33:44,600 --> 03:33:49,320
have as much to do you still need a good ground but it's not as essential as that low frequency

2198
03:33:49,320 --> 03:33:54,360
transmitters so ground is important folks we're going to talk more about it we can have a course

2199
03:33:54,360 --> 03:34:00,360
in ground we honestly could five credit class and just talk about ground testing processes um

2200
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:03,400
you know some of the some of the different things that that we've encountered with ground

2201
03:34:04,200 --> 03:34:09,000
50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago ground wasn't that big of a deal ground right now is very

2202
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:15,400
very big because a difference equates to a difference in potential and even a small difference in

2203
03:34:15,400 --> 03:34:21,080
voltage could create could create a circuit it caused that circuit to go here's your final technical

2204
03:34:21,080 --> 03:34:27,000
term for the night cattywampus all right all right it's all i got folks have a good

2205
03:34:27,320 --> 03:34:35,480
okay let's get started chapter four chapter four

2206
03:34:38,280 --> 03:34:41,160
just kind of as a review to get us up to speed with

2207
03:34:45,240 --> 03:34:52,440
what we've talked about thus far we talked about the fundamental physics of electricity

2208
03:34:52,920 --> 03:35:03,640
where does electricity come from and uh what subatomic properties mean to both materials

2209
03:35:04,440 --> 03:35:13,800
the type of materials that we use in harnessing electricity and electronics and also how materials

2210
03:35:13,800 --> 03:35:21,480
are affected when we apply energy to them when we apply energy to matter we could

2211
03:35:21,560 --> 03:35:27,240
knock some electrons free from the valence shell when we knock those electrons free from

2212
03:35:27,240 --> 03:35:34,680
the valence shell that represents potential energy right because we could uh we could direct

2213
03:35:35,480 --> 03:35:42,680
those free electrons through a circuit and make them do some work for us right

2214
03:35:43,400 --> 03:35:52,520
so we call that flow of electrons current current the flow of electrons in a specified

2215
03:35:52,520 --> 03:35:59,400
direction and that specified direction is negative to positive and every 6.24 times 10 to the 18th

2216
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:09,000
electrons equals one coulomb one coulomb per second equals one ampere

2217
03:36:09,400 --> 03:36:15,800
so we talked about current already the next thing we're going to talk about tonight

2218
03:36:16,360 --> 03:36:26,920
chapter four is resistance or as the french would say resistance right i mean resistance

2219
03:36:29,320 --> 03:36:35,560
and this is kind of easy to remember one of the questions that i'm going to ask you in the future

2220
03:36:36,120 --> 03:36:44,600
in lecture is going to be what has resistance and the answer is easy everything has resistance

2221
03:36:46,280 --> 03:36:53,320
everything some things have more resistance than others but basically everything has resistance

2222
03:36:53,320 --> 03:37:00,920
there's only one thing that i'm aware of that doesn't have resistance and it only exists in a

2223
03:37:00,920 --> 03:37:14,200
laboratory what am i talking about superconductor superconductor superconductivity is the utilization

2224
03:37:14,200 --> 03:37:25,400
of materials that have no resistance zero resistance so once we get that stuff up and running once

2225
03:37:25,400 --> 03:37:31,080
science masters that they're going to be dealing with materials that have no resistance

2226
03:37:32,520 --> 03:37:36,920
that's going to revolutionize the industry because right now it's something we just got

2227
03:37:36,920 --> 03:37:43,320
to deal with and there's a lot of losses associated with it the power companies would love to get a

2228
03:37:43,320 --> 03:37:49,960
whole superconductivity at room temperature they'd love to harness that question

2229
03:37:50,040 --> 03:37:57,560
do modern computers have superconductors no no it is not feasible right now for any

2230
03:37:57,560 --> 03:38:06,360
everyday use it only exists in a laboratory at extremely cold temperatures the use of a cryogen

2231
03:38:06,360 --> 03:38:12,920
cryogenics and believe it or not i shared with you right what what material are they having the

2232
03:38:12,920 --> 03:38:23,640
best luck with ceramics who would have thunk ceramics ceramic a great insulator at room temperature

2233
03:38:23,640 --> 03:38:29,960
but at these extremely cold temperatures some of these ceramics take on superconductive properties

2234
03:38:29,960 --> 03:38:34,520
anyway we're not going to talk anymore about that i'd love to but we just don't have time

2235
03:38:35,080 --> 03:38:39,480
what we've got to do is embark on our journey here chapter four resistance

2236
03:38:39,480 --> 03:38:46,200
after completing this chapter you're going to be able to define resistance and explain its

2237
03:38:46,200 --> 03:38:55,160
effect in a circuit determine the tolerance range of a resistor identify carbon composition

2238
03:38:55,160 --> 03:39:04,280
wire wound and film resistors identify potentiometers and rheostats describe how a variable

2239
03:39:05,080 --> 03:39:13,800
resistor operates decode a resistor's value using a color code or alphanumeric code

2240
03:39:14,760 --> 03:39:20,520
identify the three types of resistor circuits and calculate out total resistance in series

2241
03:39:20,520 --> 03:39:31,720
parallel and series parallel circuits resistance is the opposition to electron flow in a circuit

2242
03:39:34,440 --> 03:39:41,800
what has resistance everything except superconductors everything everything has resistance

2243
03:39:42,440 --> 03:39:49,640
if you went out and bought a new extension cord over the weekend even though you paid a lot of

2244
03:39:49,640 --> 03:39:56,040
money and it's a really good high quality extension cord still has resistance if you went out and bought

2245
03:39:57,880 --> 03:40:02,120
cable for your speakers you're rewiring your house and you're putting in some new speakers

2246
03:40:02,120 --> 03:40:09,720
and you went out and got some of that monster cable cost your fortune still has resistance

2247
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:15,400
everything has resistance it's expressed by the symbol r

2248
03:40:17,320 --> 03:40:26,840
it's measured in ohms ohms discovered by a guy by the name of john ohms

2249
03:40:27,560 --> 03:40:37,640
abbreviated with the greek symbol omega the greek greek symbol omega

2250
03:40:40,440 --> 03:40:46,360
and although everything has resistance the amount of resistance varies from material

2251
03:40:46,360 --> 03:40:57,240
to material silver is the best meaning it has the least found in nature so if we if you went out

2252
03:40:57,240 --> 03:41:03,480
the periodic table and played around with it and tried to find what materials on the periodic table

2253
03:41:03,480 --> 03:41:13,800
you could find and which one had the least resistance it would be silver copper is the most common

2254
03:41:13,800 --> 03:41:22,760
meaning it's really the cheapest even though it's expensive in the grand scheme of things that's why

2255
03:41:22,760 --> 03:41:28,360
you got these people like cannibalizing stuff taking stuff apart to steal the freaking wire

2256
03:41:29,960 --> 03:41:34,760
what took the cake was did you hear down in Tacoma a couple months ago they've got the uh

2257
03:41:34,760 --> 03:41:38,600
that drawbridge that go down down by downtown Tacoma the big ships go underneath

2258
03:41:39,320 --> 03:41:44,440
the cannibal they just got in there one night and they tore it all up the control panel it's

2259
03:41:44,440 --> 03:41:50,280
gonna i don't know it's like millions of dollars to rebuild this thing and they just stole all the

2260
03:41:50,280 --> 03:41:55,800
wire out of it gutted it and i just started turning into a recycling place yeah i got all this wire

2261
03:41:57,080 --> 03:42:06,520
sure you know how much you're kidding

2262
03:42:09,480 --> 03:42:15,160
huh that's nuts

2263
03:42:17,400 --> 03:42:19,560
for legitimate people that's nuts

2264
03:42:21,640 --> 03:42:26,120
now washington or oregon washington washington huh

2265
03:42:26,360 --> 03:42:39,720
gold doesn't tarnish so although gold is not as good a conductor as silver by plating it

2266
03:42:41,720 --> 03:42:46,200
by plating copper with gold then you get the best of both worlds you have something that

2267
03:42:46,200 --> 03:42:52,360
doesn't tarnish because the problem with silver if any of you have any silver jewelry or silver

2268
03:42:52,360 --> 03:42:58,760
wear about the same time you're done polishing it you need to polish it again because being exposed

2269
03:42:58,760 --> 03:43:09,080
to oxygen oxidizes it gold that doesn't happen no oxidation means you get a superior connection

2270
03:43:09,080 --> 03:43:17,400
when you use it as a termination on an electrical connector resistance is affected by temperature

2271
03:43:17,480 --> 03:43:28,040
it is affected by temperature typically resistance has a positive temperature coefficient we call it

2272
03:43:28,760 --> 03:43:34,280
positive temperature coefficient meaning as temperature increases the amount of resistance

2273
03:43:34,280 --> 03:43:42,120
in a conductor increases which is a problem if you have an extension cord and it starts to get hot

2274
03:43:43,080 --> 03:43:49,320
the extension cord is going to possess more resistance if it possesses more resistance that

2275
03:43:49,320 --> 03:43:54,600
means less current makes it to your load and the extension cord is going to get even hotter if it

2276
03:43:54,600 --> 03:43:59,480
gets even hotter its resistance is going to increase more limiting the amount of current even more

2277
03:43:59,480 --> 03:44:03,400
that's going so that's where you end up with a vicious cycle you let that go on long enough you

2278
03:44:03,400 --> 03:44:11,480
end up with an electrical fire so keep that in mind if you've got an extension cord or a cable

2279
03:44:11,480 --> 03:44:22,760
that's getting warm getting hot it's a problem it's also affected by size size does matter

2280
03:44:22,760 --> 03:44:29,560
when it comes to conductors basically the individual that has the thickest conductor

2281
03:44:31,640 --> 03:44:37,400
will have the least amount of resistance so earlier in lecture when i said about connecting

2282
03:44:37,400 --> 03:44:44,200
up your speakers using that monster cable if you really are using monster cable and that

2283
03:44:44,200 --> 03:44:51,240
cable is really thick the thicker it is the least resistance it has the more energy you transfer

2284
03:44:51,240 --> 03:44:58,920
from the source to the load from your amplifier to the speaker and that's a good thing so generally

2285
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:05,480
speaking you want to use the thickest conductor that you can afford or of course adhere to standard

2286
03:45:06,440 --> 03:45:11,800
manufacturing processes and there's tables that you could find that show specifically

2287
03:45:11,800 --> 03:45:14,920
what is required electrical code dictates that

2288
03:45:17,160 --> 03:45:22,520
in your home the majority of circuits in your home are 15 amp circuits they can handle up the

2289
03:45:22,520 --> 03:45:30,200
15 amps standard electric code code dictates that you need to use at least 14 gauge wire for those

2290
03:45:30,200 --> 03:45:36,520
circuits for 20 amp circuits you have some 20 amp circuits in your in your house maybe in your

2291
03:45:36,520 --> 03:45:42,600
kitchen or out in your garage your workroom your utility room electrical code dictates that you

2292
03:45:42,600 --> 03:45:50,920
have 12 gauge wire minimum that means that the wire is thick enough to support the flow of 20 amps

2293
03:45:50,920 --> 03:46:01,560
of current resistivity is the resistance of a material to current flow resistivity is going to

2294
03:46:01,560 --> 03:46:11,240
be different for different materials even good conductors have different levels of resistivity

2295
03:46:11,240 --> 03:46:25,080
here is a table that shows us the resistivity and what we use as a benchmark is the resistivity of

2296
03:46:25,080 --> 03:46:33,080
silver there's a lot of things in science that we we do like this one we were talking about last

2297
03:46:33,080 --> 03:46:39,720
week remember i talked about specific gravity remember specific gravity specific gravity

2298
03:46:39,720 --> 03:46:48,280
is a benchmark that we use with fluids and we compare everything to the specific gravity

2299
03:46:49,160 --> 03:46:56,200
of pure water h2o at room temperature typically 65 degrees standard temperature

2300
03:46:57,080 --> 03:47:01,080
and we say that it has a specific gravity of 1.000

2301
03:47:01,880 --> 03:47:14,760
in dealing with conductors we use resistivity which compares resistivity to that to the best known

2302
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:22,520
conductor that we have found in nature which is silver so we say that resistivity has a or excuse

2303
03:47:22,520 --> 03:47:39,240
resistivity of 1.000 copper 1.0625 lead 1.370 gold 1.5

2304
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:49,720
and you can see the rest of the table there this compares all resistivity of all materials so silver

2305
03:47:50,040 --> 03:47:57,080
has the least resistance it's the best so therefore it has a resistivity we use as a benchmark of 1.000

2306
03:47:57,080 --> 03:48:02,600
so do you understand the difference between resistivity and resistance

2307
03:48:05,240 --> 03:48:12,280
resistance is measured in ohms resistivity compares everything to silver

2308
03:48:12,760 --> 03:48:23,880
conductance the ability of a material to pass electrons conductance

2309
03:48:25,960 --> 03:48:32,280
it's expressed as the capital letter g and believe it or not i'm not making this up

2310
03:48:32,760 --> 03:48:43,720
the unit that we measure this in is called the mo mho its ohms felt backwards and that's not by a

2311
03:48:43,720 --> 03:48:50,360
mistake basically the dude that came up with this said i'm going to spell ohm backwards take the

2312
03:48:50,360 --> 03:48:57,560
reciprocal of resistance and call it the mo and see if that makes the textbooks well it made the

2313
03:48:57,560 --> 03:49:07,720
textbooks but it's not the unit of measure that we've adopted for measuring resistance

2314
03:49:08,920 --> 03:49:14,760
it is the unit we measure conductance with it's abbreviated with the greek symbol

2315
03:49:15,720 --> 03:49:21,240
it should be an upside down omega i don't know why it gives me like an orthodox cross

2316
03:49:21,560 --> 03:49:29,240
but since that orthodox cross appeared on my slide i'm not inclined to remove it if you

2317
03:49:29,240 --> 03:49:36,040
know what i mean it's it may be a sign but all this should be as an upside down omega

2318
03:49:38,840 --> 03:49:43,640
a guide by the name of seamans came up with this have any of you heard of seamans before seamans

2319
03:49:43,640 --> 03:49:51,160
corporation well this was like great great great granddad seamans and he made the textbooks by

2320
03:49:51,320 --> 03:49:56,920
playing around with electrical properties and the rest of that company of course is history

2321
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:03,560
and what seamans said i guess he was in a big argument with ohm back in the day

2322
03:50:05,800 --> 03:50:11,720
ohm said we should measure the materials all for their resistance seamans said no we

2323
03:50:11,720 --> 03:50:14,520
shouldn't we should measure it all for their conductance

2324
03:50:14,520 --> 03:50:23,160
resistance is measured in ohms seamans is like uh conductance is measured in

2325
03:50:24,040 --> 03:50:31,400
mose it's ohms spelt backwards well how do you calculate it well it's real simple what you do

2326
03:50:31,400 --> 03:50:39,960
here is you take the reciprocal of resistance one over resistance equals conductance i mean i

2327
03:50:39,960 --> 03:50:46,120
guess the guy said this to his face with a straight face so what do you say the answer

2328
03:50:46,120 --> 03:50:51,400
is you know i say the answer is a thousand ohms well one divided by a thousand well that's how

2329
03:50:51,400 --> 03:50:58,040
many mose i think it is and actually since it's thousands of ohms taking the reciprocal of it

2330
03:50:58,040 --> 03:51:08,040
means that most of our answers will actually be in millie mose millie mose or micro mose

2331
03:51:09,720 --> 03:51:18,200
you can't make this stuff up it used to be that i put out in lecture you will never see a

2332
03:51:18,200 --> 03:51:27,960
conductivity meter anytime i put out any absolutes in lecture somebody feels compelled to prove the

2333
03:51:27,960 --> 03:51:34,360
prof wrong so i stated you will never see a conductivity meter and then almost immediately

2334
03:51:34,360 --> 03:51:40,920
i had a student of my class raise their hand it said i use one every day at work really i've

2335
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:46,600
never seen one in my life where do you work and the individual worked actually at a water treatment

2336
03:51:46,600 --> 03:51:53,880
facility a water treatment facility and what they use the conductivity meter for

2337
03:51:54,040 --> 03:52:04,680
or literally is to see how much stuff is left over in the water after they treat the water

2338
03:52:05,800 --> 03:52:14,920
because i don't know if any of you realize this is water a conductor or is it an insulator

2339
03:52:24,120 --> 03:52:36,520
very good very good pure water h2o pure water

2340
03:52:38,200 --> 03:52:43,240
basically is an insulator current will not pass through pure water

2341
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:50,680
so if i'm in my hot tub filled with pure water my neighbor's wife comes over and joins me

2342
03:52:51,000 --> 03:52:57,640
and my wife comes home this is why you look comfortable in there would you like a piece of

2343
03:52:57,640 --> 03:53:04,760
toast and throws a toaster oven that's plugged in provided the tub was filled with pure water

2344
03:53:04,760 --> 03:53:13,400
h2o it wouldn't be a shocking experience but due to the fact that my water chemistry actually if

2345
03:53:13,400 --> 03:53:18,280
i get in the tub there's going to be salts and oils from my body that are going to contaminate that

2346
03:53:18,280 --> 03:53:21,720
and immediately take that pure water into the conductive realm

2347
03:53:23,720 --> 03:53:29,400
so again the conductivity meter that my former student was using was to measure the conductivity

2348
03:53:29,400 --> 03:53:33,080
of the water the more stuff you have in the water the more conductive it's going to be

2349
03:53:36,040 --> 03:53:42,760
i had a terrible bout of um bronchitis several years ago the flu with bronchitis

2350
03:53:42,760 --> 03:53:49,080
was terrible the verge of pneumonia was coughing fever felt miserable got up went to the doctor

2351
03:53:50,360 --> 03:53:54,440
it's in the middle of winter you know how dry our air gets in our homes in the middle of winter

2352
03:53:54,440 --> 03:54:00,760
he recommended i go and get one of those humidifiers fill it up with water plug it in makes humidity

2353
03:54:01,400 --> 03:54:02,520
puts humidity in the air

2354
03:54:05,960 --> 03:54:11,800
so i stopped that wall green picked one up brought it home it didn't even have an on off switch

2355
03:54:13,000 --> 03:54:17,800
you know it's just a tank of water you put the thing on you plug it in and it puts humidity

2356
03:54:17,800 --> 03:54:24,840
into the air how tough can this be so i mustered every ounce of courage that i had because i really

2357
03:54:24,840 --> 03:54:32,600
felt like i was dying filled the thing up with water climbed under my covers and i'm looking at

2358
03:54:32,600 --> 03:54:40,840
the thing sitting over on my uh on my uh nightstand and it's just sitting there so i look at the clock

2359
03:54:40,840 --> 03:54:47,400
and i continue to watch it nothing's happening i'm like you've got to be kidding me okay this

2360
03:54:47,400 --> 03:54:54,120
thing's busted or worse yet i got to read the owner's manual on something that doesn't even

2361
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:59,320
have an on off switch so i go ahead and i open the owner's manual i'm reading it and stuff

2362
03:54:59,320 --> 03:55:03,960
and they say right in there if you plug this in and it doesn't produce steam

2363
03:55:04,200 --> 03:55:10,840
in a certain number of minutes i think it was five minutes your your water may be too soft

2364
03:55:13,400 --> 03:55:22,040
and add no more than an eighth of a teaspoon of salt to the two and a half gallons in the tank

2365
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:28,040
any more than this could corrode the electrodes blah blah blah blah blah blah so i'm like you know

2366
03:55:29,160 --> 03:55:33,000
i'll read the instructions i'll follow the instructions but i don't think an eighth of

2367
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:36,760
a teaspoon of salt in two and a half gallons is going to make much of a difference

2368
03:55:38,360 --> 03:55:42,040
so i got an eighth of a teaspoon which is a pinch i mean that's just a pinch of salt

2369
03:55:42,760 --> 03:55:48,440
put it in there plug the thing in got back under the covers by the time i was tucked in under the

2370
03:55:48,440 --> 03:55:54,680
covers i look over to think steams steams pouring out of it that small amount of impurity was enough

2371
03:55:54,680 --> 03:55:59,720
to make that water conductive because those don't boil the water what they physically do their

2372
03:55:59,720 --> 03:56:07,720
electrodes and they flash it to steam so its operation is contingent on having water that

2373
03:56:07,720 --> 03:56:11,640
has some impurities in it that being said what does this say about our water tap water here in

2374
03:56:11,640 --> 03:56:21,880
western washington really good water what's that really where where where do you where are you that

2375
03:56:21,880 --> 03:56:28,520
you don't think the water is that good all right they're getting a little slew out there don't they

2376
03:56:29,720 --> 03:56:37,720
also depends on which side of red in here generally speaking though here yeah generally speaking here

2377
03:56:37,720 --> 03:56:42,440
in western washington in the northwest in general we have pretty good water um if any of you've ever

2378
03:56:42,440 --> 03:56:47,480
lived in southern california i mean i'm by i was buying bottled water back there before bottled

2379
03:56:47,480 --> 03:56:52,520
water was in vogue you know i was buying bottled water because it tasted like it it didn't have

2380
03:56:52,520 --> 03:57:00,360
a taste to it that was super hard yeah um in the midwest i mean you know i stayed with a cousin of

2381
03:57:00,360 --> 03:57:05,800
mine that lives in missouri once and you know get the water softener you got like stalactites and

2382
03:57:05,800 --> 03:57:10,440
stalagmites in the shower you know because all the minerals that are you know i mean it's just

2383
03:57:10,440 --> 03:57:15,880
crazy stuff it's very hard on plumbing i grew up in the east coast actually an artesian well well

2384
03:57:15,880 --> 03:57:22,440
water until the city came in and finally you know put but water was perfect so to some areas of

2385
03:57:22,440 --> 03:57:29,320
country that are really bad but keep that in mind pure water h2o is an insulator so we have to add

2386
03:57:29,320 --> 03:57:40,520
some impurities to it to be able to convert it now everything has resistance but we in electricity

2387
03:57:40,520 --> 03:57:47,480
and electronics have a component that is designed to have this property of resistance and amazingly

2388
03:57:47,480 --> 03:57:57,640
enough you know what they call it the resistor so a resistor is a specific device designed to

2389
03:57:57,640 --> 03:58:05,480
possess the property of resistance it's designed to have resistance it's designed to possess a specific

2390
03:58:05,480 --> 03:58:14,840
value of resistance that's predictable comes in two different classifications one is a fixed value

2391
03:58:14,840 --> 03:58:26,600
meaning what you see is what you get and the other is a variable value variable meaning we can adjust it

2392
03:58:26,840 --> 03:58:35,000
variety of shapes and sizes to meet specific circuit space and operating requirements

2393
03:58:37,400 --> 03:58:40,680
so there are all kinds of resistors on the market

2394
03:58:45,480 --> 03:58:49,640
these components all have a tolerance associated with them

2395
03:58:50,280 --> 03:58:56,520
them tolerance is the amount that the resistor may vary and still be acceptable

2396
03:59:02,440 --> 03:59:06,360
the larger the tolerance typically the cheaper it is to manufacture

2397
03:59:09,160 --> 03:59:16,520
now believe it or not in electronic components we could have values of tolerances that go

2398
03:59:16,520 --> 03:59:23,160
anywhere from plus or minus 20 percent 10 percent five two one percent but 20 percent

2399
03:59:23,160 --> 03:59:29,560
can you imagine that everybody get their taxes in on time how do you think that would go over here

2400
03:59:29,560 --> 03:59:35,800
irs uh you know i did my taxes and i think they're accurate within 20 percent i think that'd go over

2401
03:59:35,800 --> 03:59:43,400
pretty big what about if your employer said you know here's your paycheck on friday but

2402
03:59:44,200 --> 03:59:50,840
uh plus or minus 20 percent we're not really sure if it's accurate plus or minus 20 and if you're on

2403
03:59:50,840 --> 04:00:00,760
the plus side cool but if you're on the negative 20 it's no either plus plus 20 or minus 20 but

2404
04:00:00,760 --> 04:00:07,160
it's a difference yeah it well i don't even know if it's a difference of 40 percent is it i guess it

2405
04:00:07,160 --> 04:00:16,280
would be yeah but the way we say it so we're allowed plus 20 or minus 20 but it's a difference

2406
04:00:16,280 --> 04:00:21,880
yeah you know if you had a if you've got a hundred ohm resistor keep the math simple right

2407
04:00:21,880 --> 04:00:27,560
that means that that resistor out of the package could be anywhere from 80 to 120 ohms

2408
04:00:28,920 --> 04:00:35,080
and it's still okay you got what you paid for so it's kind of wacky thing here because

2409
04:00:35,480 --> 04:00:41,480
i make you follow all these procedures and policies here dot your eyes cross your t's make sure your

2410
04:00:41,480 --> 04:00:46,840
paperwork is accurate you're answering to your team lead the class lead we have all this protocol

2411
04:00:46,840 --> 04:00:52,680
here and everything i expect your answers to be very very accurate but when you get over here to

2412
04:00:52,680 --> 04:00:55,960
the lab when you get out into industry you're going to find that you're working with components that

2413
04:00:55,960 --> 04:01:04,040
have tolerances up to plus or minus 20 percent very very frustrating it's actually one of the

2414
04:01:04,040 --> 04:01:09,800
challenges that i had in this industry because in here everything we talk about is theoretical

2415
04:01:09,800 --> 04:01:18,520
perfect in industry it's a plus or minus 20 percent and it's okay it's okay

2416
04:01:22,680 --> 04:01:26,920
so keep that in mind when you're when you're working with any of these components

2417
04:01:27,160 --> 04:01:36,520
some of the different types of resistors we have molded carbon resistors that are made out of

2418
04:01:37,320 --> 04:01:46,600
carbon that is molded it's the most commonly used it's inexpensive and it's manufactured in

2419
04:01:46,600 --> 04:01:52,680
standard resistor values by standard resistor values what i'm talking about you know like how

2420
04:01:52,680 --> 04:02:00,520
tires come in different sizes you know you i mean i'm sure you could if you wanted to go take a

2421
04:02:00,520 --> 04:02:06,200
machine class and then make your own wheels on a lathe or whatever on a milling machine down here

2422
04:02:06,200 --> 04:02:11,640
you could make your own wheel whatever size you want knock yourself out you could make your own

2423
04:02:11,640 --> 04:02:16,360
wheel can you find a tire that's going to fit your wheel probably the first thing that you would do

2424
04:02:16,360 --> 04:02:21,880
is look and see what standard tire values are and then make a wheel if you're going to make a custom

2425
04:02:21,880 --> 04:02:25,560
wheel that fits standard tire sizes because you're going to end up making a wheel that you can't even

2426
04:02:25,560 --> 04:02:30,360
find a tire for it makes sense so resistors are the same thing when we say they come in standard

2427
04:02:30,360 --> 04:02:39,560
sizes they come in standard sizes don't expect to go out and find a 103.5 ohm resistor

2428
04:02:41,880 --> 04:02:48,120
don't expect to find that on the market you could go buy a package of resistors that are

2429
04:02:48,120 --> 04:02:54,280
100 ohm resistors that are plus or minus 10% and start going through and see if you could find one

2430
04:02:54,280 --> 04:03:01,720
that's 103.5 but an engineer is never going to specify and say i want 103.5 ohm resistor in the

2431
04:03:01,720 --> 04:03:11,960
circuit they'll say i want 100 ohm resistor standard sizes another type of resistor manufacturing

2432
04:03:11,960 --> 04:03:19,400
process comes up with what's called a wire wound resistor these are used in high current circuits

2433
04:03:20,120 --> 04:03:34,520
and they are made out of wire that is wound because we know that wire has resistance so

2434
04:03:34,760 --> 04:03:40,760
if i get a certain amount of wire in one turn then i can make another turn and get

2435
04:03:42,200 --> 04:03:45,240
twice the amount and it's literally how it works

2436
04:03:48,440 --> 04:03:54,680
the resistance of these varies from a fraction of an ohm to several thousand ohms question

2437
04:04:05,240 --> 04:04:13,560
it could change over time it could typically it's going to stay pretty close to what it was

2438
04:04:13,560 --> 04:04:18,680
but again since these heat up things could change in the composition of it and alter its

2439
04:04:18,680 --> 04:04:24,840
characteristics but that's not a big factor to worry about there's a lot more components

2440
04:04:24,840 --> 04:04:29,480
in electronics that are a lot more sensitive than resistors good question

2441
04:04:35,000 --> 04:04:43,800
yeah um the question is do tolerances add up is there a cumulative effect yes

2442
04:04:44,360 --> 04:04:49,640
i worked um as a contract employee for a biomedical company before i came to tea chair

2443
04:04:49,640 --> 04:04:55,640
at lake washington you know 20 plus years ago and this um unmentioned biomedical company i was

2444
04:04:55,640 --> 04:05:00,360
working on this product and it was pretty expensive motherboard and um

2445
04:05:03,640 --> 04:05:08,840
every component this board kicked my butt i could fix these boards pretty much you know

2446
04:05:08,840 --> 04:05:12,920
a lot of them were common problems i'd look at the symptoms you know kind of hold it to

2447
04:05:12,920 --> 04:05:19,240
my forehead let me guess resistors you know our r 22 needs to be replaced i'd replace it

2448
04:05:19,240 --> 04:05:26,840
fired up the thing works okay i had this one board that i couldn't fix i just could not fix it

2449
04:05:26,840 --> 04:05:32,120
and when i looked and evaluated the integrity of every component every component was within

2450
04:05:32,120 --> 04:05:37,480
tolerances but when you put it all together one tolerance was pulling it this way another

2451
04:05:37,480 --> 04:05:41,960
tolerance was pulling it that way when you put it all together the board would not work it was

2452
04:05:41,960 --> 04:05:48,200
an anomaly because everything individually functioned and i kind of got in trouble over it

2453
04:05:48,200 --> 04:05:53,320
it was kind of like my ego like i'm not going to let no stink and board kick my butt and um

2454
04:05:53,320 --> 04:05:59,320
believe it or not this company had it figured out where every circuit board a technician was allowed

2455
04:05:59,320 --> 04:06:05,720
allotted basically 0.65 hours to troubleshoot it so what i would do is if i was given a big

2456
04:06:05,720 --> 04:06:11,000
production run to do on racks what i would go through is fix all the easy problems first

2457
04:06:11,000 --> 04:06:15,000
and then go to the next easiest problems and work my way so that when i was done i had all

2458
04:06:15,000 --> 04:06:19,640
the real difficult problems left and then i'd look and see how much time i had left statistically

2459
04:06:20,360 --> 04:06:23,720
see a lot of a lot of you i don't even think realize that this is how you're

2460
04:06:23,720 --> 04:06:28,360
met you're measured when you get to industry they know exactly how long it takes to fix this board

2461
04:06:29,160 --> 04:06:33,480
okay so if it takes you if it's 0.65 hours and it takes you three hours you're gonna have a

2462
04:06:33,480 --> 04:06:37,560
discussion with the boss you're in the wrong profession you're in the wrong so anyway i knocked

2463
04:06:37,560 --> 04:06:42,280
out all my boards and i ended up with like four days left so i could go take breaks for four days

2464
04:06:42,280 --> 04:06:47,720
goof off and still end up statistically ahead of the game but i want that to fix this board i ended

2465
04:06:47,720 --> 04:06:51,960
up screwing around with this board for two and a half two and a half days and then finally you

2466
04:06:51,960 --> 04:06:57,160
know my boss saw that you know i'm all i don't have a lot of boards i'm on what are you doing

2467
04:06:57,160 --> 04:07:00,280
i'm working on this board since kicking my butt you know i've been working on it two and a half

2468
04:07:00,280 --> 04:07:04,840
day two and a half days you know got the thing through to cross the freaking floor we're not

2469
04:07:04,840 --> 04:07:09,640
paying you to screw with that and i never was able to fix it but what it was again were tolerances

2470
04:07:10,200 --> 04:07:13,960
pulling in different directions so sometimes you could have something that individually

2471
04:07:13,960 --> 04:07:17,640
everything is functional you put it together as integrated as a system just doesn't work why

2472
04:07:18,200 --> 04:07:20,600
because of what you said tyler's just pulling in different directions

2473
04:07:26,520 --> 04:07:29,080
you know it's probably more common than we think

2474
04:07:30,840 --> 04:07:35,480
but yeah generally speaking it's it's uncommon one of the and that's why i'm not mentioning the

2475
04:07:35,480 --> 04:07:42,840
name of this company one of the things that they did is the majority of boards that were rejected

2476
04:07:42,840 --> 04:07:49,560
were because of this capacitor that they use 20 percent tolerance capacitors and the circuit would

2477
04:07:49,560 --> 04:07:56,680
not tolerate that it had to be right in the zone so what i would do is i would go to stores and i'd

2478
04:07:56,680 --> 04:08:03,400
get a bin of capacitors i'd sit there and then i would test every one and basically sort from

2479
04:08:03,400 --> 04:08:08,760
20 percent tolerance to like a five percent tolerance and keep those capacitors so when i

2480
04:08:08,760 --> 04:08:12,040
ran into that problem i would just unsotter that cap with the new cap in

2481
04:08:12,920 --> 04:08:16,920
wrote it you know employees wrote a beneficial suggestion that a company saying you know why

2482
04:08:16,920 --> 04:08:22,200
don't we just buy five percent tolerance capacitors and all these things wouldn't have to be reworked

2483
04:08:22,200 --> 04:08:25,720
you know you don't know what you're talking about you know just do your own job or whatever

2484
04:08:25,720 --> 04:08:29,400
instead of looking at the big peter i think it was like in a production manager i think his brother

2485
04:08:29,400 --> 04:08:33,560
in law sold cheap capacitors for a living or something and he was buying them by the semi load

2486
04:08:33,560 --> 04:08:39,960
or it just made no sense it just made apps it is a biome is a well-known biomedical company

2487
04:08:39,960 --> 04:08:45,400
it's kind of like why are you doing this why not just use a tight tolerance component to begin with

2488
04:08:45,400 --> 04:08:50,200
and avoid somebody having to solder and unsotter and you know repair these boards it's costing them

2489
04:08:50,200 --> 04:08:59,240
a ton of money but what do i know film resistors are becoming increasingly popular there's three

2490
04:08:59,240 --> 04:09:07,000
different types carbon film metal film and tin oxide film and by film what we mean is a manufacturing

2491
04:09:07,000 --> 04:09:14,360
process that lays down a thin film of this material on a substrate and then that becomes the resistive

2492
04:09:14,360 --> 04:09:24,040
material so it's um some of the manufacturing processes actually are on par with manufacturing

2493
04:09:24,040 --> 04:09:30,360
solid state semiconductor devices surface mount resistors ideal for small circuit applications

2494
04:09:30,360 --> 04:09:36,360
available in both thick and thin film if you're working with surface mount resistors and you

2495
04:09:36,360 --> 04:09:43,640
have a package open and you sneeze they're gone so don't sneeze near a package of open because

2496
04:09:43,640 --> 04:09:49,160
these are tiny these are some of these are almost the size of a head of a pin tiny tiny components

2497
04:09:49,400 --> 04:09:55,960
that's what goes into making your cell phones and digital watches and tv's on your wrist that you

2498
04:09:55,960 --> 04:10:06,680
could watch and all of that kind of stuff we also have variable resistors variable resistors allow

2499
04:10:06,680 --> 04:10:20,200
resistance to vary both linear and logarithmically linear and logarithmically when i say linear do

2500
04:10:20,200 --> 04:10:32,920
you know what i'm talking about linear linear means a straight line so if i if i have something on a

2501
04:10:32,920 --> 04:10:39,480
linear scale if i adjust if i adjust it a little bit i get a little bit of response if i go to 100

2502
04:10:39,480 --> 04:10:45,880
percent i get 100 percent if i go to 50 percent i get half if i go to 25 percent i get a quarter

2503
04:10:47,560 --> 04:10:55,560
make sense that's linear it's a straight line logarithmically is on a curve it's on a logarithmic

2504
04:10:55,560 --> 04:11:02,840
curve so if i turn a little bit i'm not necessarily it's it's it the whole response is on a curve

2505
04:11:04,200 --> 04:11:10,040
so anybody know why we would want to have a control that is not linear that intentionally puts

2506
04:11:10,040 --> 04:11:25,400
things on a curve for us very good logarithmic is used for audio

2507
04:11:25,480 --> 04:11:36,360
applications because audio is not linear audio is not linear audio some of you may be aware is

2508
04:11:36,360 --> 04:11:45,320
measured in decibels and that's on a logarithmic scale so if you want to control something that is

2509
04:11:45,320 --> 04:11:52,840
non-linear you need to use a control that's non-linear and audio is that example so that's

2510
04:11:52,840 --> 04:12:01,800
why we have this logarithmic control one of the things if you're shopping for these variable

2511
04:12:01,800 --> 04:12:09,400
resistors you may also see it say audio on the box because it's for use with audio so volume control

2512
04:12:09,400 --> 04:12:16,120
on a radio on a stereo would be a logarithmic control because it's controlling something that is

2513
04:12:16,120 --> 04:12:21,720
non-linear and what we're trying to do is get somewhat of a linear response out of it right

2514
04:12:21,800 --> 04:12:25,640
when you turn the volume all the way up to a hundred percent you expect to get a hundred percent

2515
04:12:25,640 --> 04:12:31,160
when you turn to fifty percent you expect to get fifty percent but since audio is not a linear

2516
04:12:31,160 --> 04:12:37,640
we need to use a logarithmic control to get a linear type response make sense

2517
04:12:41,560 --> 04:12:50,840
these variable resistors when they're configured as a potentiometer potentiometer

2518
04:12:50,840 --> 04:13:03,720
or pot also known as pot a pot when we configure it to control voltage we call it a potentiometer

2519
04:13:05,400 --> 04:13:10,600
and i'll show you how we do that in a second but i want you first to hit the i believe button

2520
04:13:11,560 --> 04:13:16,520
what type of a device do we use to control voltage variable resistor do we use to control voltage

2521
04:13:16,520 --> 04:13:27,640
the answer is potentiometer when we use a variable resistor to control current we call it a rheostat

2522
04:13:30,680 --> 04:13:32,360
we call it a rheostat

2523
04:13:37,080 --> 04:13:39,080
and basically the way that this thing works

2524
04:13:46,600 --> 04:13:57,400
what i just illustrated here on the board is a resistor right and what i've got here

2525
04:13:59,320 --> 04:14:09,960
is i've got terminal a and i've got terminal b when i put my meter across terminal a and b

2526
04:14:09,960 --> 04:14:18,440
what am i going to what am i going to measure the resistance the resistance between a and

2527
04:14:19,160 --> 04:14:28,680
b the total resistance you all agree with me with that okay so if i go ahead now and connect this

2528
04:14:28,680 --> 04:14:33,400
up to a circuit

2529
04:14:40,040 --> 04:14:47,800
this is the negative terminal this is the positive terminal okay current is going to want to flow

2530
04:14:50,520 --> 04:14:56,040
in a counterclockwise direction here and it's going to flow through this resistor

2531
04:14:56,040 --> 04:15:03,400
and when it encounters this resistance it's going to limit how much current flows through this circuit

2532
04:15:04,440 --> 04:15:08,360
do you agree with me with that okay

2533
04:15:12,280 --> 04:15:21,800
so if i go ahead now this is a this is a fixed resistor if i go ahead and turn this into a

2534
04:15:21,800 --> 04:15:26,120
variable resistor a variable resistor has a third lead on it

2535
04:15:30,440 --> 04:15:31,800
and i'll label this this

2536
04:15:35,880 --> 04:15:43,480
terminal c so i have between a and b is my total resistance and then i have

2537
04:15:43,800 --> 04:15:53,400
c and what this is is a wiper arm this is a wiper arm and physically what it's going to do is move

2538
04:15:53,960 --> 04:16:00,040
up and down and come in contact with either more resistive material or less resistive material

2539
04:16:00,040 --> 04:16:07,560
it all depends on your perspective if i have this adjusted right now smack dab in the middle

2540
04:16:08,200 --> 04:16:10,840
how much resistance do i have between a and c

2541
04:16:15,000 --> 04:16:25,000
half how much resistance do i have between c and b half if i adjusted just just barely touch it just

2542
04:16:25,000 --> 04:16:35,480
a little bit now i'm 49 percent on one side 51 on the other tweak it more i'm 40 60 right

2543
04:16:35,480 --> 04:16:41,960
80 20 90 10 99 1

2544
04:16:44,200 --> 04:16:48,120
so i'm i'm moving this wiper arm coming in contact with a different amount of

2545
04:16:48,120 --> 04:16:53,640
resistive material i'll agree with that does that make sense okay now in this particular

2546
04:16:53,640 --> 04:16:58,840
configuration i could move this wiper arm up and down all day long am i going to have any effect

2547
04:16:58,920 --> 04:17:01,800
on current flowing through the circuit why

2548
04:17:04,760 --> 04:17:11,240
it's just flowing between point a and point c excuse me point a and point b point c is

2549
04:17:11,240 --> 04:17:15,640
effectively not even part of the path so i can move that wiper arm hey look mom

2550
04:17:17,160 --> 04:17:19,480
right nothing's going to change nothing's going to happen

2551
04:17:19,640 --> 04:17:23,800
now what if

2552
04:17:26,440 --> 04:17:28,440
what if i break this connection here

2553
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:36,600
and come and move this and connect to point c directly

2554
04:17:41,480 --> 04:17:44,040
now what's going to happen when i move that wiper arm

2555
04:17:44,440 --> 04:17:55,640
what's that total resistance is going to change in the circuit absolutely if i adjust this thing

2556
04:17:55,640 --> 04:18:02,120
all the way to the end right here i may have what 100 percent

2557
04:18:04,120 --> 04:18:07,960
well if i move it all the way here and it's not in contact with any any resistance 100

2558
04:18:08,040 --> 04:18:14,120
percent current flow zero resistance or as close to zero as i could get

2559
04:18:15,000 --> 04:18:20,280
when i move the wiper arm all the way to the bottom here now i get 100 percent resistance

2560
04:18:21,320 --> 04:18:26,520
minimum current flow so literally when i'm adjusting this wiper arm here i'm adjusting

2561
04:18:26,520 --> 04:18:34,280
the amount of you said current in the circuit so i've got this configured right now is what

2562
04:18:34,520 --> 04:18:45,080
a real stat a real stat so when i'm using only two terminals of a three terminal device i've

2563
04:18:45,080 --> 04:18:51,880
got it configured as a real stat when i adjust my wiper arm i'm literally adjusting the total

2564
04:18:51,880 --> 04:18:56,600
amount of resistance and that total amount of resistance is going to affect the total amount

2565
04:18:56,600 --> 04:19:06,360
of current flowing in that circuit makes sense i'm going to disconnect this

2566
04:19:11,080 --> 04:19:18,440
reconnect this and let's assume that i'm going to have make another connection over here

2567
04:19:19,240 --> 04:19:21,480
and this is going to be a voltmeter

2568
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:31,160
i'm going to connect a voltmeter between a and c and i'm going to connect a voltmeter

2569
04:19:31,160 --> 04:19:36,760
another voltmeter why because they're cheap right between b and c

2570
04:19:41,000 --> 04:19:47,640
when i have this adjusted smack dab in the middle what voltage am i going to get across this

2571
04:19:47,720 --> 04:19:55,480
voltmeter half i like you you keep it a basic half that's why i want you to keep it you know

2572
04:19:55,480 --> 04:19:59,080
i asked that question i see somebody going for their calculator you know it's i haven't given

2573
04:19:59,080 --> 04:20:03,240
you any numbers you can't calculate this one if i've got it set smack dab in the middle i'm

2574
04:20:03,240 --> 04:20:09,400
going to get half my voltage here which means i'm going to get my other half voltage down the bottom

2575
04:20:10,120 --> 04:20:14,840
okay so if this is 10 volts i get five volts here and five volts here

2576
04:20:16,840 --> 04:20:28,360
as soon as i begin to move that wiper arm slightly now i'm that 51 49 60 40 but i'm not

2577
04:20:28,360 --> 04:20:37,000
talking about resistance now i'm talking about what voltage so when i connect all three i could

2578
04:20:37,000 --> 04:20:43,720
use this as a voltage divider a hundred percent of the voltage it gets applied between a and b gets

2579
04:20:43,720 --> 04:20:50,040
divided proportionally between the wiper arm and the outer terminals

2580
04:20:52,200 --> 04:20:58,520
when i have it configured like this and i'm dividing voltage or controlling voltage we call that a

2581
04:21:00,600 --> 04:21:04,920
potentiometer this is how the volume control on your stereo is connected

2582
04:21:04,920 --> 04:21:13,720
this is basically what you're doing and that voltage that voltage that you're controlling

2583
04:21:13,720 --> 04:21:20,440
is going typically to a transistor and it's telling that transistor here's more voltage i want you

2584
04:21:20,440 --> 04:21:28,040
to amplify more and make the music louder or turn it down and make the music softer i'm going to give

2585
04:21:28,040 --> 04:21:36,040
you less voltage to the amplifier the transistor this is how it works so keep that in mind that's

2586
04:21:36,040 --> 04:21:43,400
how that's how we say we're either controlling current or or voltage could i use a potentiometer

2587
04:21:43,400 --> 04:21:49,960
as a real stat how would i do that

2588
04:21:52,840 --> 04:22:01,080
only connect two of the terminals so if you go to radio shack and say do you have any real stats

2589
04:22:01,080 --> 04:22:05,320
here that would be a fun question i should give you that as an out of class assignment everybody

2590
04:22:05,320 --> 04:22:11,000
go to radio shack and ask if you got any real stats and they'd probably scratch their head and bring

2591
04:22:11,000 --> 04:22:17,320
you know but we have some potentiometers you could use a potentiometer as a real stat you only

2592
04:22:17,320 --> 04:22:27,160
need to connect to the terminals if you went out and bought special ordered a real stat and it came

2593
04:22:27,160 --> 04:22:35,320
in the box and it said real stat could you use a real stat as a potentiometer if it only came

2594
04:22:35,320 --> 04:22:42,840
with two terminals now you need that third terminal to be able to divide the voltage make sense

2595
04:22:46,120 --> 04:22:52,760
okay resistor identification there's a couple different methods that we use to identify resistors

2596
04:22:55,240 --> 04:22:58,200
does anybody know the easiest method of identifying resistors

2597
04:22:59,160 --> 04:23:11,640
i love it now the easiest method is when they put the value right on the outside of it with numbers

2598
04:23:11,640 --> 04:23:17,400
and letters i always sucker people in with that one because everybody knows resistor color code

2599
04:23:17,400 --> 04:23:21,400
now the easiest method is is really when they use numbers and letters and they just say if it's like

2600
04:23:21,400 --> 04:23:27,480
a 1000 ohm resistor you know one k ohm it's right in there in black and white you read it you're

2601
04:23:27,480 --> 04:23:38,120
good to go another method that they use is alpha numeric code and for a lot of these resistors you're

2602
04:23:38,120 --> 04:23:45,640
going to have to like a secret agent use a decoder ring or decoder chart to figure out exactly what

2603
04:23:45,640 --> 04:23:54,920
the code means the third easiest method is the color code and of course you can't have a successful

2604
04:23:54,920 --> 04:23:59,560
career in electronics unless you understand the color code first thing we're going to take a look

2605
04:23:59,560 --> 04:24:09,400
at here is the alpha numeric code if you looked at a small resistor and it had an rn 60d 5 1 1 2 f

2606
04:24:09,400 --> 04:24:19,960
on it and you came up to me and you said hey joe what kind of a component is this i would probably

2607
04:24:20,040 --> 04:24:27,400
hold my head and say i have no freaking idea what you're going to have to do is you're going to have

2608
04:24:27,400 --> 04:24:35,320
to call up this code and decipher it if you work at a company this is one of the things

2609
04:24:35,320 --> 04:24:40,120
this is a very difficult judge tough job i got i got to train all of you generically but what

2610
04:24:40,120 --> 04:24:44,360
happens is when you go to your specific industries you're going to see some of the same components

2611
04:24:44,360 --> 04:24:47,720
day in and day out day in because you're going to get used to your company's product line

2612
04:24:47,960 --> 04:24:53,720
but here it's very difficult i'm teaching you generic electronics and there's a lot of different

2613
04:24:53,720 --> 04:24:59,800
schemes that are you know that they use this is one of them so the rn 60 identifies the

2614
04:24:59,800 --> 04:25:10,840
resistor style what what is it carbon comp wire wound film the d are its temperature characteristics

2615
04:25:11,560 --> 04:25:16,120
how does this behave and they'll normally include some tables or charts in there to say

2616
04:25:16,120 --> 04:25:22,680
you know for every five degrees rise in Fahrenheit this is how many ohms it's going to change so

2617
04:25:22,680 --> 04:25:33,000
it's going to be its temperature characteristics question yes yeah no don't memorize this the

2618
04:25:33,000 --> 04:25:40,600
point of this is that you're dead in water unless you get the code the five one one two that shows

2619
04:25:40,680 --> 04:25:50,040
the resistance value the five one one the two represents the number of zeros at the end so this

2620
04:25:50,040 --> 04:25:58,120
would be five one one zero zero putting that most common terms be fifty one point one k ohms

2621
04:25:59,640 --> 04:26:03,560
fifty one thousand one hundred ohms and the tolerance would be f

2622
04:26:04,440 --> 04:26:11,480
i don't know if that's good bad you're gonna have to look it up and see what it equates to five percent

2623
04:26:11,480 --> 04:26:18,040
two percent ten percent twenty percent i don't know but that's how you would decode that if you saw

2624
04:26:18,040 --> 04:26:26,920
that on the side of the resistor if you saw colors on the side of the resistor well there they are

2625
04:26:28,760 --> 04:26:33,000
you've got this in your book the way the color code works you have your first band second band

2626
04:26:33,000 --> 04:26:40,760
third band fourth band if you have a resistor that's well first thing you want to do is hold it

2627
04:26:40,760 --> 04:26:47,720
so that one of the bands is closest to the edge you normally want to put that closest on the left

2628
04:26:47,720 --> 04:26:58,440
and then read it like a book if i had a resistor and i held it in my hand and it was orange white

2629
04:26:58,520 --> 04:27:05,960
red gold orange on the color code equals the number three white is the number nine

2630
04:27:06,680 --> 04:27:14,360
red is the number two so that means i'm going to add two zeros after the three nine three nine zero

2631
04:27:14,360 --> 04:27:20,600
zero and gold means it's a five percent tolerance putting that most common terms means this would be

2632
04:27:20,600 --> 04:27:27,240
a three thousand nine hundred ohm resistor or three point nine k ohm resistor five percent

2633
04:27:34,120 --> 04:27:45,560
question i hate the word memorization question is we have to memorize it you gotta know it

2634
04:27:46,120 --> 04:27:54,040
but you've got to know it and to be honest with you a lot of job interviews they're gonna ask you

2635
04:27:54,040 --> 04:27:58,360
to do that the best thing though i'm not going to go out of my way i'm going to be honest with you

2636
04:27:58,360 --> 04:28:03,320
i'm not going to go out of my way on a quiz to hammer you on it you're not going to fail this

2637
04:28:03,320 --> 04:28:07,800
quiz because you don't know the resistor color code one of the big things with the resistor

2638
04:28:07,800 --> 04:28:13,160
color code is simply your experience doing your labs you're going to you're going to come to learn

2639
04:28:13,160 --> 04:28:17,800
this and the more you work with it you're going to understand it and you're going to remember it

2640
04:28:17,800 --> 04:28:23,560
but i don't want to make flash cards other programs do that you know we could give you

2641
04:28:23,560 --> 04:28:28,120
flash cards and identify this resistor i could keep you occupied and entertained for but then when

2642
04:28:28,120 --> 04:28:32,680
you're all said and done you know you're ready to go get a job and identify resistors for a living

2643
04:28:32,680 --> 04:28:37,240
not a lot of money in that so this is just something that you need to learn you need to know you need

2644
04:28:37,240 --> 04:28:47,480
to be able to decode it make sense i'll let you study the acronyms at your own leisure in a group

2645
04:28:47,480 --> 04:28:54,600
form see i'm ex-navy and we had some acronyms that basically if i repeated here i would be

2646
04:28:55,160 --> 04:29:02,280
handcuffed and dragged off and start with bad boys that was one of them that's a lot of you

2647
04:29:02,280 --> 04:29:07,560
you know so i'll let you discuss some of these amongst yourselves and they they do work it's

2648
04:29:07,560 --> 04:29:13,240
actually funny because having interviewed potential faculty member i'll of course always throw in

2649
04:29:13,240 --> 04:29:20,040
there identify this resistor and you see some man making charts and you know i've never once given

2650
04:29:20,040 --> 04:29:25,720
anybody a resistor you know what size of this resistor oh that's a 1.2 k 5 percent resistor

2651
04:29:25,720 --> 04:29:29,720
you know actually if somebody identified i'd probably you know you're a freak you're a freak of

2652
04:29:29,720 --> 04:29:35,000
nature yeah but it is something that again through experience you're going to get used to

2653
04:29:35,000 --> 04:29:40,520
and when you're prototyping a circuit you're going to say i'm looking for a 1.5 k ohm resistor you

2654
04:29:40,520 --> 04:29:47,720
know and you find it you plug it in your circuit and you move on so resistors and circuits

2655
04:29:49,640 --> 04:29:54,040
resistors are typically configured in a circuit in one of three different ways

2656
04:29:54,040 --> 04:30:05,320
either series parallel or compound and to be honest with you i hate to let the cat out of the bag

2657
04:30:05,320 --> 04:30:14,600
put the cart before the horse but you know what in the entire world of electronics and the entire

2658
04:30:14,600 --> 04:30:21,720
entire universe of electronics there's only three types of circuits and here you are week number three

2659
04:30:21,800 --> 04:30:28,840
learning about them it's that simple the most complex circuit you ever work on in your life

2660
04:30:28,840 --> 04:30:37,160
will be one of these three it's either going to be a series circuit a parallel circuit or it's called

2661
04:30:37,160 --> 04:30:47,640
a compound circuit or a combination yeah the first circuit we're going to talk about is a series

2662
04:30:47,640 --> 04:30:57,080
circuit and the simple thing to remember with a series circuit is resistance is additive

2663
04:30:59,240 --> 04:31:05,480
resistance is additive so the formula that we need to remember

2664
04:31:07,320 --> 04:31:11,880
and this is not accurate this should have an equal sign right here there's an error in this formula

2665
04:31:11,880 --> 04:31:20,120
should be rt total resistance is equal to resistor one plus resistor two plus resistor three plus

2666
04:31:20,120 --> 04:31:27,480
etc etc etc if you got 5000 resistors in a circuit you're gonna have 5000 resistances to add up

2667
04:31:28,280 --> 04:31:29,240
it's cumulative

2668
04:31:33,640 --> 04:31:38,360
so in this particular circumstance all is we have to do is pick a point in the circuit and start to

2669
04:31:38,360 --> 04:31:44,120
count we'll start right here at the negative terminal the first resistor I encounter has

2670
04:31:44,120 --> 04:31:55,560
30 ohms of resistance 30 plus 20 is equal to 50 plus 10 is equal to 60 that completes the circuit

2671
04:31:55,560 --> 04:32:02,280
in this circuit there are a total of 60 ohms of resistance does that make sense

2672
04:32:02,840 --> 04:32:11,960
sounds real basic doesn't it it's all fun and games until you have a bad battery connection

2673
04:32:11,960 --> 04:32:16,680
right here there's some corrosion that adds some resistance you got a bad solder joint right here

2674
04:32:16,680 --> 04:32:24,200
it adds a little bit more resistance so in in in a theory class like this how many ohms of

2675
04:32:24,200 --> 04:32:28,680
resistance are they supposed to be in a circuit 60 you get in there and measure it with your meter

2676
04:32:28,680 --> 04:32:35,080
and you get 67 ohms then you realize you have tolerance of these resistors did you take that

2677
04:32:35,080 --> 04:32:40,280
into account yeah but that only accounts for a small percentage based on that then all of a

2678
04:32:40,280 --> 04:32:45,240
sudden you realize why i've got corrosion in the circuit or i've got a bad solder joint in the circuit

2679
04:32:46,520 --> 04:32:50,360
so that's where there's a disconnect sometimes between the world of theory that we live in

2680
04:32:50,360 --> 04:32:55,320
here in a classroom a lecture environment and the world of reality in the lab that's why i want to

2681
04:32:55,320 --> 04:32:59,800
see all of you getting in the lab doing your lab assignments because you're basically going to

2682
04:32:59,800 --> 04:33:04,600
start scratching your head saying hey i thought joe i kind of believed what joe was saying in a

2683
04:33:04,600 --> 04:33:10,440
lecture but it isn't quite working like that it's going to work like i say but there's going to be

2684
04:33:10,440 --> 04:33:16,680
also a lot of variables that take place in the lab and in the real world as i said before that's

2685
04:33:16,680 --> 04:33:21,640
the toughest thing that i had when i got out into industry i went through a bunch of theory

2686
04:33:21,640 --> 04:33:29,080
schools when i started seeing things for real i was like wow this doesn't make sense is this good

2687
04:33:30,040 --> 04:33:34,200
can this possibly be good this doesn't look like a good reading and it's not what the book says

2688
04:33:34,840 --> 04:33:37,800
how could this be you know so that's the only way you're getting that is experience

2689
04:33:40,360 --> 04:33:42,440
any questions on series resistance

2690
04:33:45,000 --> 04:33:48,440
parallel this is my favorite slide of the entire

2691
04:33:48,680 --> 04:33:54,280
entire quarter because like watch i'm going to hit the key and the formula is going to fly in from

2692
04:33:54,280 --> 04:34:05,880
the side oh it's not cool you ever see how people like abuse powerpoint use too much animation this

2693
04:34:05,880 --> 04:34:10,840
is just right all right and i'm going to do it one more time it's the last time i'm going to do the

2694
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:16,440
entire quarter the last slide that i have that's animated is this slide okay you ready oh

2695
04:34:20,680 --> 04:34:21,720
just kidding one more time

2696
04:34:25,960 --> 04:34:31,960
now in order for us to calculate out the total resistance in parallel this is kind of different

2697
04:34:31,960 --> 04:34:39,720
this is this is kind of odd right what we're going to do is this reciprocal formula

2698
04:34:41,160 --> 04:34:50,200
the reciprocal of resistor one plus the reciprocal of resistor two plus the reciprocal of resistor

2699
04:34:50,200 --> 04:34:56,840
three on and on and on what that sounds awful familiar to me what is the reciprocal of resistance

2700
04:34:59,880 --> 04:35:05,720
conductivity remember that one over r equals conductivity

2701
04:35:06,120 --> 04:35:21,880
so what we're saying here is by adding up all of the conductivities of all of these branches to

2702
04:35:21,880 --> 04:35:28,840
a parallel network then taking the reciprocal of that we end up with total resistance

2703
04:35:28,840 --> 04:35:38,760
so this is kind of like a bar trick how can you add resistors to a circuit

2704
04:35:39,800 --> 04:35:48,280
and yet make the resistance of the circuit less the answer is add them in parallel because that's

2705
04:35:48,280 --> 04:35:56,360
exactly what we're doing here it's exactly what we're doing think of this as the seattle

2706
04:35:57,320 --> 04:36:09,240
traffic system seattle traffic system okay this is a uh it's a friday afternoon before a three-day

2707
04:36:09,240 --> 04:36:14,440
weekend and these are all the people that are in seattle and they want to get the bell view

2708
04:36:17,000 --> 04:36:22,520
and they've got multiple paths to take how do you get from seattle to bell view

2709
04:36:22,760 --> 04:36:33,480
five twenty how else i-90 how else up and around the north end of the lake

2710
04:36:33,480 --> 04:36:38,280
or down around the south end of the lake so basically we have four let's say let's just

2711
04:36:38,280 --> 04:36:45,160
talk about three for the case of our example here if you're in seattle i'm a big commuter so i

2712
04:36:45,160 --> 04:36:50,120
like these analogies they really work well for me they work all too well for me if i'm in seattle

2713
04:36:50,120 --> 04:36:55,560
and i want to get the bell view and it's a friday three-day weekend what path is probably going

2714
04:36:55,560 --> 04:37:05,160
to be the best for me to take and why what's that no if i'm in seattle and i want to go to bell

2715
04:37:05,160 --> 04:37:16,520
view three-day weekend which is the best path for me to take and why why most lines it's going to

2716
04:37:16,520 --> 04:37:27,160
move the most traffic it's got the least amount of resistance after i-90 what would be my second

2717
04:37:27,160 --> 04:37:38,840
choice before the toll the toll will quickly make this number three choice at least for me i'm a

2718
04:37:38,840 --> 04:37:49,160
tightwad i'll take the ferry to vancouver and drive down around before i get a boat five twenty

2719
04:37:49,880 --> 04:37:54,600
five twenty has fewer lanes it's got more resistance it doesn't move the same amount of traffic

2720
04:37:55,480 --> 04:37:59,240
and then finally the other option is driving around the north end of the south end of the lake

2721
04:38:00,760 --> 04:38:08,680
not an easy way of doing it a lot more traffic less flow so comparing that now to this we could

2722
04:38:08,680 --> 04:38:14,120
say that i-90 is like the equivalent of 10 ohms of resistance because even though i-90 it's a super

2723
04:38:14,120 --> 04:38:20,840
interstate highway and it's got multiple lanes does it still have resistance oh yeah oh yeah if it

2724
04:38:20,840 --> 04:38:28,600
didn't have resistance there would never be any brake lights on it this would be like five twenty

2725
04:38:28,600 --> 04:38:34,200
would be like twice the amount of resistance meaning it moves half the amount of traffic

2726
04:38:34,520 --> 04:38:42,200
and then the north end of the lake three times the amount of resistance meaning even less traffic

2727
04:38:43,480 --> 04:38:51,640
does that make sense so every one of these is a viable current path every one of those routes

2728
04:38:51,640 --> 04:39:04,760
is a viable traffic path let's say for example that bill gates he really wanted a give back

2729
04:39:04,760 --> 04:39:11,000
and he loves the people of the puja sound region and he wants to build another bridge across lake

2730
04:39:11,000 --> 04:39:16,600
washington and he he he is so into it he's even going to let the bridge like come off of his property

2731
04:39:16,840 --> 04:39:23,560
okay and because he's building the bridge it's going to be called the bill gates memorial bridge

2732
04:39:25,800 --> 04:39:31,960
when he builds that bridge across lake washington what's it going to do to this flow here what's

2733
04:39:31,960 --> 04:39:39,240
it going to do it's going to it's going to make the overall circuit have less

2734
04:39:39,960 --> 04:39:48,520
resistance because he built another viable path is the path he builds going to be perfect

2735
04:39:48,520 --> 04:39:54,920
is it still going to have resistance yes but is it going to have an overall effect on increasing

2736
04:39:54,920 --> 04:40:01,560
the flow in the seattle metropolitan area of traffic absolutely so that's how we can add

2737
04:40:01,560 --> 04:40:08,920
resistances on this circuit yet lower the overall resistance of the total circuit

2738
04:40:09,880 --> 04:40:15,320
and that's why we have to use this formula we're actually adding up the conductivity

2739
04:40:15,320 --> 04:40:19,480
we end up with the total conductivity for the circuit take the reciprocal of that that gives us

2740
04:40:19,480 --> 04:40:27,560
the total total resistance for the circuit makes sense okay now i'm going to give you some thumb

2741
04:40:27,560 --> 04:40:30,840
rules thumb rules

2742
04:40:34,040 --> 04:40:39,320
the first thumb rule that i want to give you it's very very important when you're analyzing a

2743
04:40:39,320 --> 04:40:49,480
circuit like this the total resistance of the circuit will always be less than the value of least

2744
04:40:49,560 --> 04:40:55,240
resistance if not you made a mistake plain and simple

2745
04:40:58,360 --> 04:41:04,360
absolutely and if you come up with something other than that you're done screwed up plain and simple

2746
04:41:07,240 --> 04:41:11,560
so the total resistance of a parallel network will always be less than the value of least

2747
04:41:12,360 --> 04:41:18,920
resistance and your assumption is correct in this circuit it's got to be less than 10 ohms

2748
04:41:20,280 --> 04:41:28,120
the other thumb rule that i'm going to give you is if the values of resistance are all equal

2749
04:41:31,400 --> 04:41:37,320
you simply count up the number of resistors take the resistance and divide it by that number

2750
04:41:37,960 --> 04:41:49,400
as an example if this is if our three is 30 ohms our two is 30 ohms and our one is 30 ohms

2751
04:41:50,280 --> 04:41:54,520
30 divided by how many resistors equals

2752
04:41:58,120 --> 04:42:03,720
30 divided by 3 equals 10 the answer to this is going to be

2753
04:42:03,720 --> 04:42:12,520
10 ohms that's a thumb rule so if i've got four 100 ohm resistors in parallel 100 ohms divided

2754
04:42:12,520 --> 04:42:21,080
by four equals 25 if i have two 50 ohm resistors in parallel with each other

2755
04:42:21,080 --> 04:42:34,520
250 ohm resistors 25 50 divided by 2 25 so that's a thumb rule only if the values are equal

2756
04:42:35,400 --> 04:42:40,120
so a lot of times in the lab you may be looking for a certain value of resistance

2757
04:42:40,120 --> 04:42:44,840
i need 20 ohms of resistance or you could put two tens in series with each other

2758
04:42:44,840 --> 04:42:47,800
or you could put two forties in parallel with each other

2759
04:42:49,800 --> 04:42:53,080
there's a couple different ways of doing it it's one of the reasons we're teaching about this stuff

2760
04:42:53,080 --> 04:42:57,080
make sense

2761
04:43:03,320 --> 04:43:11,080
okay

2762
04:43:11,880 --> 04:43:17,640
the number of resistors only if they're equal it's only works if they're equal

2763
04:43:19,640 --> 04:43:20,440
it's a thumb rule

2764
04:43:23,880 --> 04:43:27,160
if you don't need to use the thumb rule it's just another tool in your toolbox

2765
04:43:28,200 --> 04:43:33,720
to make it easier for you if you doubt me well you could always use that formula

2766
04:43:35,880 --> 04:43:40,280
there is another formula i want to show you it's not in the book but i want you to know it

2767
04:43:40,280 --> 04:43:50,520
learn it

2768
04:43:55,960 --> 04:43:59,320
this is called the product over some formula

2769
04:44:00,360 --> 04:44:07,560
product over some this only works if we have two resistors in parallel with each other

2770
04:44:07,560 --> 04:44:12,200
period two resistors in parallel with each other period

2771
04:44:15,480 --> 04:44:24,360
so this literally is the product over some the product is r1 multiplied by r2 r1 times r2

2772
04:44:25,400 --> 04:44:31,560
divided by r1 plus r2 the product over the sum

2773
04:44:31,560 --> 04:44:47,560
this works if you only have two resistors in parallel with each other

2774
04:45:01,560 --> 04:45:08,840
if you've got two or more resistors you have to use this formula here

2775
04:45:09,400 --> 04:45:12,520
i just drew it a little bit differently but that's basically the same formula

2776
04:45:16,200 --> 04:45:23,400
the reciprocal of r1 which is the conductance of r1 plus the conductance of r2 plus the sum of

2777
04:45:23,400 --> 04:45:29,880
the conductances total conductance the reciprocal one over the total conductance equals the total

2778
04:45:29,880 --> 04:45:37,160
resistance so this formula works for two or more resistors in parallel this one here works for

2779
04:45:37,720 --> 04:45:41,560
two resistors in parallel period

2780
04:45:45,240 --> 04:45:50,440
the reason i want you to start using this is because in the future we're going to take

2781
04:45:50,440 --> 04:45:55,080
this formula and we're going to adapt this formula for some other use

2782
04:45:55,480 --> 04:45:59,960
so it's better that you just learn it now and it's another tool in your toolbox

2783
04:46:01,000 --> 04:46:06,200
product over sum easy enough to remember product over sum

2784
04:46:11,320 --> 04:46:17,400
when we execute the math on this formula here the reciprocal of r1 plus r2 plus r3

2785
04:46:18,040 --> 04:46:23,160
we had those conductances up take the reciprocal of it we end up with 5.405 ohms is that answer

2786
04:46:23,160 --> 04:46:29,880
sound right why does it sound right it's less than 10 works for me

2787
04:46:31,320 --> 04:46:41,320
and that's like at r3 you consider rn as well no our rn would be like r4 5 r22 r447

2788
04:46:41,960 --> 04:46:48,520
r to the nth degree means to the nth degree that this formula works to infinity if we keep adding

2789
04:46:48,600 --> 04:46:54,840
resistors in parallel we just keep adding the reciprocal of that resistance on it that's what

2790
04:46:54,840 --> 04:47:01,800
we mean by that so they drew it like this plus one r to the nth i did it etc etc etc

2791
04:47:05,320 --> 04:47:12,120
this is a complex circuit now again i know you want to do the math you want to get it right

2792
04:47:12,120 --> 04:47:16,680
that's cool okay i want to keep things real i want to keep things basic

2793
04:47:17,480 --> 04:47:25,720
the first thing that i notice in this circuit is that these two resistors are in parallel with each

2794
04:47:25,720 --> 04:47:32,440
other so this is an actual ideal situation for us to use this product over some formula

2795
04:47:33,880 --> 04:47:37,800
50 times 25 divided by 50 plus 25

2796
04:47:37,800 --> 04:47:44,040
why don't we just do it right now you got your calculators let's do it

2797
04:47:46,440 --> 04:47:47,160
just do it

2798
04:47:49,800 --> 04:47:52,760
but i want to do it in stages here for those folks at home

2799
04:47:58,280 --> 04:48:00,280
this is how i'm going to start off with the formula

2800
04:48:02,200 --> 04:48:07,320
now what i'm going to do is substitute in my numbers i what is that 50 and 25

2801
04:48:08,200 --> 04:48:22,840
so it's going to be 50 times 25 divided by 50 plus 25 okay i know that this is going to 50 plus 25

2802
04:48:22,840 --> 04:48:32,120
i could do that in my head right that's 75 okay but the 50 plus 25 50 excuse me times 25 equals

2803
04:48:33,080 --> 04:48:35,560
1250

2804
04:48:38,040 --> 04:48:43,320
so 1250 divided by 75 equals

2805
04:48:51,480 --> 04:48:58,440
16.67 ohms so does everybody see how i did that isn't that a cool formula

2806
04:48:58,680 --> 04:49:04,600
oh it's cool i like that formula i don't know why because the answer is always like

2807
04:49:05,240 --> 04:49:11,080
come out i don't know i like that formula you could do the same thing down here and you're

2808
04:49:11,080 --> 04:49:17,480
going to get the same results so i know that i've got and the way i want you to look at these

2809
04:49:17,480 --> 04:49:24,280
parallel circuits the way that i want you to think of these parallel circuits is how much

2810
04:49:24,280 --> 04:49:35,160
resistance is there between between this point here and that's actually called a node a node

2811
04:49:35,160 --> 04:49:42,360
are where two or more wires are joined together how much resistance is there between node a and node b

2812
04:49:45,480 --> 04:49:47,720
so to lay this out mathematically

2813
04:49:54,440 --> 04:50:06,120
the way that i would actually calculate out this whole problem

2814
04:50:07,640 --> 04:50:16,760
is rt for this circuit total resistance is going to be equal to the resistance of resistor one

2815
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:33,000
plus the resistance between node a and b plus the resistance of resistor

2816
04:50:36,920 --> 04:50:37,240
three

2817
04:50:40,040 --> 04:50:41,960
four four thank you

2818
04:50:42,040 --> 04:50:50,600
why this is a dry erase board so r1 plus rab plus r4

2819
04:50:52,920 --> 04:50:57,560
now before i could solve for this i'm going to have to calculate out what

2820
04:50:59,160 --> 04:51:05,880
rab is equal to rab is going to be equal to

2821
04:51:06,200 --> 04:51:16,680
r2 times r3 divided by r2 plus r3 you agree with that

2822
04:51:20,280 --> 04:51:26,360
so then it's just a matter of me we already did this this is 16.67 ohms

2823
04:51:26,680 --> 04:51:37,880
plus 30 ohms plus 20 ohms gives me my total amount of resistance in the circuit

2824
04:51:41,880 --> 04:51:46,200
so i highly recommend until you really got a handle on this you lay it all out like this

2825
04:51:47,000 --> 04:51:51,080
although so many formulas whatever i don't look at them as formulas these are tools

2826
04:51:52,040 --> 04:51:59,560
these are tools yeah they're formulas but they're tools to solve the problem to unlock the key to the problem

2827
04:52:01,560 --> 04:52:02,520
use the right tool

2828
04:52:05,000 --> 04:52:11,640
you get the right results use the wrong tool on your car you strip the knot

2829
04:52:13,960 --> 04:52:19,320
use the right tool you get about the results that you desire make sense

2830
04:52:22,040 --> 04:52:29,880
when you first see a problem like this though one of the things that i'm going to stress

2831
04:52:29,880 --> 04:52:35,320
in this program is that you keep it real what's the what was this total resistance

2832
04:52:35,320 --> 04:52:43,400
going to be between these between this a and b it's going to be less than 25 so i've got 30 ohms

2833
04:52:43,400 --> 04:52:49,720
here and 20 ohms there 30 plus 20 is 15 and less than 25 what do i know my answer is going to be

2834
04:52:49,720 --> 04:52:58,440
less than what less than 75 if you could do that in your mind looking at this stuff i want

2835
04:52:58,440 --> 04:53:04,760
you on my team i'll be honest with you i want you on my team those are the people that i want

2836
04:53:05,640 --> 04:53:09,640
if i give you this problem and immediately you're with the calculator and you know you're

2837
04:53:10,520 --> 04:53:14,280
i don't mind if you use the calculator but if you're turning it upside down your you know

2838
04:53:14,280 --> 04:53:21,240
sideways and you know no what i want out of all of you is to look at this i got 30 ohms here i got

2839
04:53:21,240 --> 04:53:30,760
20 that's 50 50 and 25 less than 25 my answer is going to be less than 75 ohms do not try to take

2840
04:53:30,760 --> 04:53:39,480
my quizzes doing that if you do you'll probably be very successful with a lot of my quizzes i could

2841
04:53:39,480 --> 04:53:43,560
take most of my quizzes not even use a calculator and get them all right well it has something to

2842
04:53:43,560 --> 04:53:51,320
do with the fact that i wrote my quizzes but what i want you to do is that thumb rule as a litmus

2843
04:53:51,320 --> 04:53:57,080
test at the end or even before you calculate it i should get less than 75 ohms as an answer

2844
04:53:58,600 --> 04:54:04,280
my answer should be less than 75 ohms i came up with 66.7 ohms does that sound about right

2845
04:54:05,800 --> 04:54:11,560
if you come up with an answer of what's the total resistance in a circuit 1250

2846
04:54:12,360 --> 04:54:17,000
well that's not less than 75 houston we got a problem there's probably a math error

2847
04:54:18,840 --> 04:54:23,480
if i were pope of electronics i would require you to all get a hundred percent on all of these

2848
04:54:23,480 --> 04:54:27,240
quizzes because if you use the right tool you get the right results make sense

2849
04:54:29,320 --> 04:54:35,480
in summary we talked about resistance what has resistance everything everything

2850
04:54:36,920 --> 04:54:41,240
we talked about specific devices that are designed to possess the property of resistance

2851
04:54:41,240 --> 04:54:47,480
it's known as a resistor can you imagine some dude wakes up every day and like you know instead

2852
04:54:47,480 --> 04:54:52,840
of it's off to make the donuts it's off to design the resistors there are engineers in the world that

2853
04:54:52,840 --> 04:55:03,160
design resistors for a living huh talk about a career path resistivity that property that we

2854
04:55:03,160 --> 04:55:12,600
compare the resistivity of everything to that of silver silver the best conductor found in nature

2855
04:55:12,600 --> 04:55:21,160
conductivity conductivity the reciprocal of resistance measured in mose or typically millimose

2856
04:55:22,920 --> 04:55:30,120
resistor identification for fixed value variable values we talked about fixed resistors variable

2857
04:55:30,120 --> 04:55:33,800
resistors that could be configured as potentiometers if they're used to control

2858
04:55:36,040 --> 04:55:43,160
voltage real stats if they're used to control current if i'm using three leads i'm using it to

2859
04:55:43,160 --> 04:55:50,280
control voltage if i'm using two leads i'm using it to control current and then finally we talked

2860
04:55:50,280 --> 04:55:56,920
about certain configurations first was a series configuration in a series configuration how do

2861
04:55:56,920 --> 04:56:05,000
i determine total resistance simply add it up it's additive in a parallel circuit

2862
04:56:06,760 --> 04:56:12,520
how do i determine total resistance add up the reciprocal sounds like i'm adding up the conductivity

2863
04:56:12,520 --> 04:56:24,040
of the paths in a compound circuit what do i got to do both thumb rules for parallel circuits total

2864
04:56:24,120 --> 04:56:32,840
resistance will always equal less than the value of least and if i have like resistor same size

2865
04:56:32,840 --> 04:56:37,720
then i could simply take that number take the value divide it by the number of resistors that

2866
04:56:37,720 --> 04:56:43,160
i have and that will give me the total resistance any questions out of this chapter

2867
04:56:46,680 --> 04:56:52,440
in parallel you got to divide it out so if i've got four one hundred ohm resistors it's a hundred

2868
04:56:52,440 --> 04:56:57,480
ohms a hundred ohms a hundred ohms hundred ohms 100 divided by how many resistors for 100 divided

2869
04:56:57,480 --> 04:57:06,280
by 4 equals 25 i should have approximately 25 ohms across that circuit all right let's go ahead

2870
04:57:06,280 --> 04:57:14,520
and take a about a 10 little 12 minute break and we'll start up at about 10 after

2871
04:57:22,920 --> 04:57:29,560
chapter five ohms law

2872
04:57:33,240 --> 04:57:37,880
again we should like hit a gong ring a bell ring some chimes

2873
04:57:40,360 --> 04:57:41,320
ohms law

2874
04:57:44,120 --> 04:57:49,880
ohms law has more of an effect on being able to predict the behavior of electricity than

2875
04:57:50,120 --> 04:57:57,480
really anything else so anybody know how predictable the behavior of electricity is

2876
04:57:58,120 --> 04:58:02,920
percentage wise we're talking about tolerance is last chapter anybody know how accurate we

2877
04:58:02,920 --> 04:58:11,640
could predict the behavior 100 it's bold statement it's absolutely correct 100 you use ohms law you

2878
04:58:11,640 --> 04:58:19,160
could predict with 100 accuracy what's going to take place inside a circuit it's pretty powerful

2879
04:58:20,440 --> 04:58:25,160
it's pretty powerful tool especially when you're going to be paid to go out into industry and fix

2880
04:58:25,160 --> 04:58:29,000
broken electronic equipment get this tool working for you you got something

2881
04:58:31,720 --> 04:58:36,200
after completing this chapter you're going to be able to identify the three basic parts of a circuit

2882
04:58:37,400 --> 04:58:42,040
identify three types of circuit configurations describe how current flow can be varied in a

2883
04:58:42,040 --> 04:58:48,920
circuit state ohms law with reference to current voltage and resistance solve problems using ohms

2884
04:58:48,920 --> 04:58:54,280
law for current resistance voltage in series parallel in series parallel circuits describe how

2885
04:58:54,280 --> 04:59:00,920
the total flow differs between series and parallel circuits describe how the total voltage drops

2886
04:59:00,920 --> 04:59:05,640
differs between series and parallel circuits describe how the total resistance differs between

2887
04:59:05,640 --> 04:59:13,160
series and parallel circuits state and apply kerfs current and voltage laws and verify answers using

2888
04:59:13,160 --> 04:59:21,080
Ohm's law with Kerchoff's law.

2889
04:59:21,080 --> 04:59:25,380
First of all, electric circuits.

2890
04:59:25,380 --> 04:59:33,140
The path that current follows is called an electric circuit.

2891
04:59:33,140 --> 04:59:38,280
All circuits consist of, and this is important, and it sounds really basic and it sounds very

2892
04:59:38,280 --> 04:59:41,640
simplistic, but I'll tell you what.

2893
04:59:41,640 --> 04:59:48,160
Doing this helped me on my worst day of my career as an electronics professional because

2894
04:59:48,160 --> 04:59:55,560
it's so easy to get turned around and lose track of what the problem is, and if you could

2895
04:59:55,560 --> 05:00:00,120
get back to basics, you're always going to do well.

2896
05:00:00,120 --> 05:00:11,400
The basics are all electric circuits must consist of a voltage source, a load, and a

2897
05:00:11,400 --> 05:00:15,640
conductor.

2898
05:00:15,640 --> 05:00:18,520
The voltage source is the source of your electric energy.

2899
05:00:18,520 --> 05:00:24,360
It could be any of those six different types that we talked about last week.

2900
05:00:24,360 --> 05:00:30,800
The load is what converts one form of energy into another form of energy.

2901
05:00:30,800 --> 05:00:38,440
An example of an electric load would be a light bulb, a motor, a heater.

2902
05:00:38,440 --> 05:00:46,360
It converts electric energy into light, heat, motion.

2903
05:00:46,360 --> 05:00:55,400
A conductor, a conductor, electrical conductor transfers the energy, the electric energy,

2904
05:00:55,400 --> 05:01:01,400
the current from the source to the load.

2905
05:01:01,400 --> 05:01:08,120
You have to have those three parts of a circuit, or it's not a circuit.

2906
05:01:08,120 --> 05:01:15,320
I'm going to add two other optional parts that are not in the book.

2907
05:01:15,320 --> 05:01:26,200
The other optional device, most circuits have them, not all do, is a controlling device.

2908
05:01:26,200 --> 05:01:31,920
A simple example of a controlling device is a switch.

2909
05:01:31,920 --> 05:01:38,520
A simple example of a complex controlling device is a microprocessor with 1.9 billion

2910
05:01:38,520 --> 05:01:42,640
transistors on it.

2911
05:01:42,640 --> 05:01:47,800
You see, that's where we're going in this course, by the way, from one switch to 1.9

2912
05:01:47,800 --> 05:01:56,240
billion switches in a microprocessor.

2913
05:01:56,240 --> 05:02:00,320
Controlling device is used to control the flow of current in the circuit.

2914
05:02:00,320 --> 05:02:08,200
The fifth optional device that you could have inside a circuit is a protective device.

2915
05:02:08,200 --> 05:02:20,080
An easy example of this is a fuse, a circuit breaker, a fusible link, a thermal circuit

2916
05:02:20,080 --> 05:02:22,960
breaker.

2917
05:02:22,960 --> 05:02:27,440
These are all examples of protective devices.

2918
05:02:27,440 --> 05:02:34,800
On my worst day of my career as an electronics professional, it involved a nuclear submarine,

2919
05:02:34,800 --> 05:02:40,600
someplace we weren't supposed to be, and it involved, unfortunately, my equipment that

2920
05:02:40,600 --> 05:02:41,600
I was responsible for.

2921
05:02:41,600 --> 05:02:47,920
There were three of us that were responsible for that system, big system, $16 million system,

2922
05:02:47,920 --> 05:02:53,760
and that was like a $1982 expensive.

2923
05:02:54,200 --> 05:03:00,840
The system was sold to the Navy, and it was designed with what was called graceful degradation.

2924
05:03:00,840 --> 05:03:08,920
That means bits and pieces could fail, and the whole system would keep up and running.

2925
05:03:08,920 --> 05:03:12,960
That's what the vendor told the Navy when the Navy bought the system.

2926
05:03:12,960 --> 05:03:16,280
Here we are someplace we're not supposed to be, doing stuff we weren't supposed to

2927
05:03:16,280 --> 05:03:21,840
be doing, and it was showtime for my equipment to do its thing.

2928
05:03:22,840 --> 05:03:24,160
It didn't work right.

2929
05:03:24,160 --> 05:03:25,160
It didn't work at all.

2930
05:03:25,160 --> 05:03:29,520
As a matter of fact, it was totally down, 100%.

2931
05:03:29,520 --> 05:03:33,040
And the captain, like, Mr. Greenock, how can this be?

2932
05:03:33,040 --> 05:03:37,080
The system was designed with graceful degradation, it should never be 100% down.

2933
05:03:37,080 --> 05:03:43,000
Well, Skipper, it's like this, it's totally busted.

2934
05:03:43,000 --> 05:03:46,520
I don't care what you gotta do, I want you to fix it.

2935
05:03:46,520 --> 05:03:55,800
Now we literally worked on that system non-stop, three days in a row, stayed up, popping no-dos,

2936
05:03:55,800 --> 05:03:58,760
drinking coffee, just working on it, working on it, working on it.

2937
05:03:58,760 --> 05:04:01,960
Two other guys might, they finally gave up, they're like, we just cannot fix this, it's

2938
05:04:01,960 --> 05:04:02,960
not fixable.

2939
05:04:02,960 --> 05:04:06,440
It just cannot, we can't bring it back from the dead.

2940
05:04:06,440 --> 05:04:10,200
Me, I went back to these basics.

2941
05:04:10,200 --> 05:04:14,400
It's an electronic system, it's made up of nothing but circuits.

2942
05:04:14,400 --> 05:04:19,640
Circuits have a voltage source, they have a load, you have inter-connected with conductors,

2943
05:04:19,640 --> 05:04:24,080
have controlling devices, and have protective devices.

2944
05:04:24,080 --> 05:04:26,680
It's something not doing what it's supposed to be doing.

2945
05:04:26,680 --> 05:04:28,920
It's gotta be, that's what's causing the problem.

2946
05:04:28,920 --> 05:04:31,120
It's narrowing it down.

2947
05:04:31,120 --> 05:04:36,800
And I stuck with the problem, I ended up fixing the problem, save the day, whoop-de-doo, I

2948
05:04:36,800 --> 05:04:39,800
basically did my job and fixed the equipment.

2949
05:04:39,800 --> 05:04:47,200
But I had to take a couple steps back and say, here's a $16 million system, fills half

2950
05:04:47,200 --> 05:04:52,000
a room with equipment racks, none of it works.

2951
05:04:52,000 --> 05:04:55,240
Can I verify the voltage sources for everything?

2952
05:04:55,240 --> 05:05:00,000
Can I narrow it down and say, this stuff's not working, but this stuff is working?

2953
05:05:00,000 --> 05:05:05,760
Can I look at the loads, what's not working, what's not converting electric energy into

2954
05:05:05,760 --> 05:05:09,000
the form of energy that we need to be getting out of it?

2955
05:05:09,000 --> 05:05:12,760
So if you know all of these systems, then you're gonna be an effective troubleshooter,

2956
05:05:12,760 --> 05:05:15,160
but always go back to basics.

2957
05:05:15,160 --> 05:05:20,000
Okay, God forbid you get out of class tonight, go out to your car, out in the North Parking

2958
05:05:20,000 --> 05:05:22,360
lot, turn the key, and you've got an electrical problem.

2959
05:05:22,360 --> 05:05:25,240
If you do have an electrical problem, approach it like this.

2960
05:05:25,240 --> 05:05:27,720
Do I have a good source?

2961
05:05:27,720 --> 05:05:29,720
Is my load functional?

2962
05:05:29,720 --> 05:05:30,880
Is it the interconnects?

2963
05:05:30,880 --> 05:05:34,680
Can I prove that the interconnects are viable?

2964
05:05:34,680 --> 05:05:37,280
Is it a controlling device?

2965
05:05:37,280 --> 05:05:40,720
And to be honest with you, in this day and age, most of the problems we encounter are

2966
05:05:40,720 --> 05:05:43,120
controlling devices.

2967
05:05:43,120 --> 05:05:49,920
Okay, it's not a simple switch, toggle switch, that was easy to troubleshoot.

2968
05:05:49,920 --> 05:05:56,080
I do a lot of traveling, I forgot what brand car it was.

2969
05:05:56,080 --> 05:05:59,520
I got the rental car, I flew in, it was on the East Coast, and I'm there late at night

2970
05:05:59,520 --> 05:06:04,040
and I got in and I'm like, I couldn't figure out where to put the key.

2971
05:06:05,040 --> 05:06:08,440
Where do I put the key to start the car?

2972
05:06:08,440 --> 05:06:12,600
There was no place to put the key, and I'm looking at it, you know, I got a little flashlight

2973
05:06:12,600 --> 05:06:15,080
and I'm looking, there's no place to put the key.

2974
05:06:15,080 --> 05:06:16,640
I didn't need a place to put the key.

2975
05:06:16,640 --> 05:06:19,960
The fact that the key was on my person was good enough for the car.

2976
05:06:19,960 --> 05:06:23,600
Just hit the start button, ooh, it started.

2977
05:06:23,600 --> 05:06:31,160
Alright, so the controlling device there was the FOB, RFID talking to the computer saying

2978
05:06:31,160 --> 05:06:35,080
this is a valid operator to be inside the car to operate it.

2979
05:06:35,080 --> 05:06:41,280
Kind of a complex controlling device, but a controlling device nonetheless.

2980
05:06:41,280 --> 05:06:48,320
And of course protective devices, and sometimes wacky stuff is done with protective devices.

2981
05:06:48,320 --> 05:06:53,520
I was working on my Tivo about a month ago, I had problems with my Tivo, and I've got

2982
05:06:53,520 --> 05:06:58,600
an older Tivo, it's a direct Tivo, so it's got two dual receivers, I could record two

2983
05:06:58,600 --> 05:07:00,920
shows and watch another show.

2984
05:07:00,920 --> 05:07:08,240
It's non-HD, because I don't have HD, I don't want to pay for HD, I'm a cheapskate, okay?

2985
05:07:08,240 --> 05:07:13,560
Feed my nice plasma screen, high resolution plasma screen with my basic signal, it's great.

2986
05:07:13,560 --> 05:07:16,200
It's great, it's all good.

2987
05:07:16,200 --> 05:07:18,440
My Tivo crapped out, okay?

2988
05:07:18,440 --> 05:07:22,520
So all the Tivo's got a hard drive in there.

2989
05:07:22,520 --> 05:07:27,880
So I got a new hard drive, I configured that and everything, and I was just through putting

2990
05:07:27,880 --> 05:07:32,080
it together, and something happened, and I heard a pop, and all of a sudden Tivo wouldn't

2991
05:07:32,080 --> 05:07:33,080
fire up anymore.

2992
05:07:33,080 --> 05:07:39,320
And I'm like, oh man, if this thing is dead, I don't want to go out and buy a new direct

2993
05:07:39,320 --> 05:07:46,880
TV DVR, and I got, it's a higher, I'm grandfathered into paying the older Tivo value, and plus

2994
05:07:46,880 --> 05:07:52,600
quite frankly, I don't know if any Tivo users here, Tivo's the bomb.

2995
05:07:52,600 --> 05:07:56,240
It truly is, because it could do word searches and all kinds of additional stuff that a normal

2996
05:07:56,240 --> 05:07:59,000
DVR will not necessarily do for you.

2997
05:07:59,000 --> 05:08:02,000
So I want that to bring this thing back from the dead, and I'm like, what the heck, I was

2998
05:08:02,000 --> 05:08:06,560
pretty ticked off, because I already wasted a whole weekend screwing with this thing.

2999
05:08:06,560 --> 05:08:12,160
So I'm looking through the circuit for something obvious, and I find this device, and basically

3000
05:08:12,160 --> 05:08:17,120
it's got shrink wrap, black shrink wrap over it, two leads coming out of it, and I measure

3001
05:08:17,120 --> 05:08:18,920
across it, and I'm getting it open.

3002
05:08:18,920 --> 05:08:21,920
I mean, I just got in there with the thing unplugged, and I'm poking around, and what

3003
05:08:21,920 --> 05:08:24,440
the heck is this?

3004
05:08:24,440 --> 05:08:28,400
So anyway, I unsodder it, and I inspect it, and with an exacto knife, I cut the heat

3005
05:08:28,400 --> 05:08:29,400
shrink out.

3006
05:08:29,400 --> 05:08:30,400
You know what it is?

3007
05:08:30,400 --> 05:08:31,400
It's a fuse.

3008
05:08:31,400 --> 05:08:35,080
It's a fuse, and the manufacturer tried to disguise and get by putting a piece of heat

3009
05:08:35,080 --> 05:08:39,840
shrink around it, and sticking it on the circuit board, and that's what was burned out.

3010
05:08:39,840 --> 05:08:44,960
I found a suitable replacement that I had at home, and my tin can, soldered it back in

3011
05:08:44,960 --> 05:08:46,880
place, fired it up, I was good to go.

3012
05:08:46,880 --> 05:08:50,160
Tivo's been working nonstop ever since.

3013
05:08:50,160 --> 05:08:51,320
Okay?

3014
05:08:51,320 --> 05:08:52,320
And that's a hidden.

3015
05:08:52,320 --> 05:08:56,160
A lot of companies do that type of stuff, so that if you don't know, if you're not the

3016
05:08:56,160 --> 05:09:00,640
authorized service center, you don't know to get in there and even check that.

3017
05:09:00,640 --> 05:09:06,760
I've seen some companies that will encapsulate a fuse, inside silicon or epoxy, you don't

3018
05:09:06,760 --> 05:09:08,720
even know what's in there.

3019
05:09:08,720 --> 05:09:11,480
So keep your eye open for all these basic parts of the circuit.

3020
05:09:11,480 --> 05:09:15,920
I know this sounds basic, and I'm beating it to death, but I tell you, you will deceive

3021
05:09:15,920 --> 05:09:21,240
me in the future when you get in the lab, and it's going to be like, I can't fix this.

3022
05:09:21,920 --> 05:09:23,680
The problem's too complex.

3023
05:09:23,680 --> 05:09:26,120
It's never a complex problem.

3024
05:09:26,120 --> 05:09:29,000
It's usually a real simple problem.

3025
05:09:29,000 --> 05:09:30,000
Very rarely.

3026
05:09:30,000 --> 05:09:31,000
All of you are here.

3027
05:09:31,000 --> 05:09:34,080
You want to get into advanced electronics and work on sophisticated equipment.

3028
05:09:34,080 --> 05:09:37,960
The problems with sophisticated equipment are always very, very simple.

3029
05:09:37,960 --> 05:09:38,960
Okay?

3030
05:09:38,960 --> 05:09:41,920
You've got to follow this protocol, though.

3031
05:09:41,920 --> 05:09:45,000
So use this as a checklist.

3032
05:09:45,000 --> 05:09:46,080
This is a series circuit.

3033
05:09:46,080 --> 05:09:51,040
We talked about series circuits already.

3034
05:09:51,040 --> 05:10:00,200
The most important thing for you to remember about a series circuit is that current is

3035
05:10:00,200 --> 05:10:04,160
constant in a series circuit.

3036
05:10:04,160 --> 05:10:11,840
The most important thing to remember is that current is constant in a series circuit, meaning

3037
05:10:11,840 --> 05:10:15,080
I've got a resistor here, a resistor here, a resistor here.

3038
05:10:15,080 --> 05:10:21,000
These three resistors cumulatively add up to the total amount of resistance in the circuit.

3039
05:10:21,120 --> 05:10:26,240
This electrical pressure here encounters this total resistance and allows this amount of

3040
05:10:26,240 --> 05:10:29,620
current to flow.

3041
05:10:29,620 --> 05:10:34,240
This current has to travel the entire path of the circuit.

3042
05:10:34,240 --> 05:10:39,560
That is the most important thing about a series circuit, period.

3043
05:10:39,560 --> 05:10:43,960
The second thing I want you to remember about a series circuit is a series circuit is also

3044
05:10:43,960 --> 05:10:57,960
known as, like FBI lingo, a.k.a., a series circuit is also known as a voltage divider.

3045
05:10:57,960 --> 05:10:59,680
A voltage divider.

3046
05:10:59,680 --> 05:11:02,040
What voltage gets divided up?

3047
05:11:02,040 --> 05:11:03,880
The total voltage.

3048
05:11:03,880 --> 05:11:04,880
Remember this?

3049
05:11:04,880 --> 05:11:06,680
We call this voltage rise.

3050
05:11:06,680 --> 05:11:09,040
How many voltage drops do I have in this circuit?

3051
05:11:09,040 --> 05:11:10,840
This circuit.

3052
05:11:10,840 --> 05:11:12,200
Three.

3053
05:11:12,200 --> 05:11:18,240
So voltage rise is going to get divided into three proportional values.

3054
05:11:18,240 --> 05:11:22,560
The biggest resistance gets the biggest voltage drop, the smallest resistance gets the smallest

3055
05:11:22,560 --> 05:11:29,000
voltage drop, and the resistance that's just right gets a voltage drop that's just right.

3056
05:11:29,000 --> 05:11:30,000
Make sense?

3057
05:11:30,000 --> 05:11:33,680
That's the series circuit.

3058
05:11:33,680 --> 05:11:39,160
The parallel circuit, the most important thing I want you to remember about the parallel

3059
05:11:39,160 --> 05:11:47,720
circuit is that voltage is constant across a parallel network.

3060
05:11:47,720 --> 05:11:49,720
This is a parallel network.

3061
05:11:49,720 --> 05:11:54,240
Here there are three resistors in parallel with each other.

3062
05:11:54,240 --> 05:12:04,760
The voltage rise will be distributed equally, equally, across all three branches.

3063
05:12:04,760 --> 05:12:09,080
So whatever this is, if this is 120 volts, this is going to have 120 volts across it.

3064
05:12:09,080 --> 05:12:12,200
This is going to have 120 volts across, and this is going to have 120 volts across.

3065
05:12:12,200 --> 05:12:16,080
Kind of like how your house is wired.

3066
05:12:16,080 --> 05:12:17,960
Your house is wired in parallel.

3067
05:12:17,960 --> 05:12:22,680
Each of the outlets has the same voltage across them, or they should.

3068
05:12:22,680 --> 05:12:26,360
If not, you've got a problem.

3069
05:12:26,360 --> 05:12:32,040
That's the most important thing about a parallel network.

3070
05:12:32,040 --> 05:12:36,920
A series circuit was also known as a voltage divider.

3071
05:12:36,920 --> 05:12:43,040
A parallel circuit is going to be known as a current divider.

3072
05:12:43,040 --> 05:12:45,520
Because what happens to current in the circuit?

3073
05:12:45,520 --> 05:12:50,640
This total current here gets divided here at this node and here.

3074
05:12:50,640 --> 05:12:53,600
Then current gets divided here and here.

3075
05:12:53,600 --> 05:12:58,520
The current flowing through R3 and the current flowing through R2 join up at this node and

3076
05:12:58,520 --> 05:13:00,880
flow onto this node.

3077
05:13:00,880 --> 05:13:07,680
Currents current plus this current equals total current.

3078
05:13:07,680 --> 05:13:10,360
Series circuit, current's constant.

3079
05:13:10,360 --> 05:13:13,040
Series circuit also known as a voltage divider.

3080
05:13:13,040 --> 05:13:20,040
Parallel circuit, voltage is constant, also known as a current divider.

3081
05:13:20,040 --> 05:13:25,240
Complex circuit, well, that's got both going on.

3082
05:13:25,240 --> 05:13:31,160
I've got current division going on here in my parallel network and I've got voltage

3083
05:13:31,160 --> 05:13:41,880
division going on here between this resistor and this resistance.

3084
05:13:41,880 --> 05:13:43,160
This resistance.

3085
05:13:43,160 --> 05:13:50,480
The best thing you could do in this circuit is label this A, node A, or in B, or X and

3086
05:13:50,480 --> 05:13:52,840
Z, or whatever you want to label it.

3087
05:13:52,920 --> 05:13:58,080
I like using letters because numbers typically equate to components.

3088
05:13:58,080 --> 05:14:03,840
Letters I could use to, and there's no rule on this, but it works for me.

3089
05:14:03,840 --> 05:14:07,760
So I'm going to label this node A and this node B.

3090
05:14:07,760 --> 05:14:15,920
The resistance between node A and B is equal to the product over some of R2 and 3.

3091
05:14:15,920 --> 05:14:16,920
Remember that?

3092
05:14:16,920 --> 05:14:18,880
I studied that last chapter.

3093
05:14:18,880 --> 05:14:27,480
The total resistance of the circuit is going to be equal to R1 plus RAB.

3094
05:14:27,480 --> 05:14:35,560
This voltage drop, RAB plus the voltage drop across R1 equals RT.

3095
05:14:35,560 --> 05:14:39,200
Voltage rise, and really, how many voltage drops do I have in the circuit?

3096
05:14:39,200 --> 05:14:41,760
Really, how many voltage drops do I have in the circuit?

3097
05:14:41,760 --> 05:14:42,760
Two.

3098
05:14:42,760 --> 05:14:46,320
And what are they?

3099
05:14:46,320 --> 05:14:51,640
R1 and RAB, or R2 and R3.

3100
05:14:51,640 --> 05:14:54,880
If I say R2, it's really the same thing.

3101
05:14:54,880 --> 05:14:57,000
R2 is the same as R3.

3102
05:14:57,000 --> 05:14:59,440
You could argue and say, well, you really got three voltage drops here.

3103
05:14:59,440 --> 05:15:00,440
You got a voltage drop here.

3104
05:15:00,440 --> 05:15:03,080
You got a voltage drop here, and you got a voltage drop here.

3105
05:15:03,080 --> 05:15:07,200
Well, this voltage drop and this voltage drop are the same voltage drop.

3106
05:15:07,200 --> 05:15:11,360
It's the same difference in potential, so I really, I don't want to call it different.

3107
05:15:11,360 --> 05:15:12,360
It's the same.

3108
05:15:12,800 --> 05:15:16,600
Make sense?

3109
05:15:16,600 --> 05:15:21,520
Some different circuit conditions that I want to talk about, and this is very important.

3110
05:15:21,520 --> 05:15:24,400
I want you to use the proper terminology with me.

3111
05:15:24,400 --> 05:15:28,880
It's part of why you're here at Lake Washington Technical College studying this stuff is to

3112
05:15:28,880 --> 05:15:34,880
learn to speak another language, the language of electronics.

3113
05:15:34,880 --> 05:15:41,640
The circuit condition that I want to talk about is called a closed circuit.

3114
05:15:41,640 --> 05:15:47,920
Is a closed circuit a good thing, or is it a bad thing?

3115
05:15:47,920 --> 05:15:48,920
Depends on what you want.

3116
05:15:48,920 --> 05:15:49,920
Thank you.

3117
05:15:49,920 --> 05:15:52,520
It depends on what you want.

3118
05:15:52,520 --> 05:15:59,760
Right now, the circuit in this room for the interior lights is closed, meaning the circuit's

3119
05:15:59,760 --> 05:16:05,600
energized, and we have an appropriate amount of illumination in here.

3120
05:16:05,600 --> 05:16:08,680
That's a good thing.

3121
05:16:08,680 --> 05:16:15,280
If I go and operate the switch and try to open the switch and the lights won't go out,

3122
05:16:15,280 --> 05:16:17,920
that could be a problem.

3123
05:16:17,920 --> 05:16:20,160
That could be a problem.

3124
05:16:20,160 --> 05:16:25,000
If you're operating an electric tool and you try to shut it off and you can't shut

3125
05:16:25,000 --> 05:16:30,560
it off, that's a problem.

3126
05:16:30,560 --> 05:16:34,320
Be a closed circuit is causing you a problem.

3127
05:16:34,320 --> 05:16:37,320
I had this problem with a pressure washer.

3128
05:16:37,320 --> 05:16:43,160
One of these $100 pressure washers, Costco special, great pressure washer for what I

3129
05:16:43,160 --> 05:16:44,160
do.

3130
05:16:44,160 --> 05:16:52,120
Got a patio, I got a deck, I don't need 40 horsepower, fire breathing, peel the paint

3131
05:16:52,120 --> 05:16:56,000
off the Queen Mary pressure washer.

3132
05:16:56,000 --> 05:16:58,800
But it's my pressure washer, and I like it.

3133
05:16:58,800 --> 05:17:04,720
I got a lot of tools, got a lot of neighbors, I know I got a lot of tools.

3134
05:17:04,720 --> 05:17:09,400
My neighbor Tom, he's since moved, it's another story, I'll tell you about that some other

3135
05:17:09,400 --> 05:17:10,400
time.

3136
05:17:10,400 --> 05:17:14,400
I finally drove him out of the neighborhood.

3137
05:17:14,400 --> 05:17:17,800
Tom's an engineer, an electrical engineer with Boeing.

3138
05:17:17,800 --> 05:17:21,040
Hey Joe, I'm going to stain my deck.

3139
05:17:21,040 --> 05:17:22,640
Can I borrow your pressure washer?

3140
05:17:22,640 --> 05:17:26,720
I'm a nice guy, but I hate loaning out tools because nobody takes care of stuff like I want

3141
05:17:26,720 --> 05:17:27,720
to take and care of.

3142
05:17:27,720 --> 05:17:32,480
I mean, if I borrow somebody's tool, I take care of it 10 times better than my own, and

3143
05:17:32,480 --> 05:17:34,840
if I break it, I buy it, I replace it.

3144
05:17:34,840 --> 05:17:45,040
So Tom, that's fine, I'll loan you my pressure washer, but only plug it in a dedicated outlet

3145
05:17:45,040 --> 05:17:48,480
and do not use any extension cords.

3146
05:17:48,480 --> 05:17:52,720
Because it's right on the label, it's not that I'm that smart a guy, I just read the

3147
05:17:52,720 --> 05:17:55,040
label, the tag that's on it.

3148
05:17:55,040 --> 05:18:01,000
Because this motor requires a lot of current to be able to turn and be effective.

3149
05:18:01,000 --> 05:18:04,320
If you plug it in an extension cord, it doesn't get the right amount of current.

3150
05:18:04,320 --> 05:18:08,600
Remember that whole thing, the cord gets hot, the hotter it gets, the more resistance, the

3151
05:18:08,600 --> 05:18:11,680
more resistance, the less current, the less current, the hotter it gets, it's a vicious

3152
05:18:11,680 --> 05:18:12,680
cycle.

3153
05:18:12,680 --> 05:18:15,840
So I loaned him my pressure washer.

3154
05:18:15,840 --> 05:18:16,840
How did it work out?

3155
05:18:16,840 --> 05:18:17,840
Oh, pretty good.

3156
05:18:17,840 --> 05:18:19,840
Thanks Joe.

3157
05:18:19,840 --> 05:18:23,760
Fast forward a couple of weeks later, I go out to wash my sidewalk.

3158
05:18:23,760 --> 05:18:29,600
I plug the thing in, turn it on, and it's on, continuously on.

3159
05:18:29,600 --> 05:18:31,000
It won't shut off.

3160
05:18:31,000 --> 05:18:35,840
Normally what happens, it's a real simple circuit.

3161
05:18:35,840 --> 05:18:40,760
This switch right here on a pressure washer, one of those cheap Costco specials, what it

3162
05:18:40,760 --> 05:18:43,640
does is there's a water pressure sensor.

3163
05:18:43,640 --> 05:18:48,560
When the water pressure builds up, what it physically does is open the switch.

3164
05:18:48,560 --> 05:18:52,840
So what you do in the handle, when you release the switch or release the pressure, as soon

3165
05:18:52,840 --> 05:18:57,400
as you release the pressure, you close the switch, you turn your motor on, the motor

3166
05:18:57,400 --> 05:19:00,480
turns the pump on, and you're pressure washing.

3167
05:19:00,480 --> 05:19:06,760
You release the trigger, you build the pressure up, you open the switch.

3168
05:19:06,760 --> 05:19:11,880
Mine will never shut off unless I unplug it.

3169
05:19:11,880 --> 05:19:18,600
If I unplugged it and it still kept operating, well, that'd be something.

3170
05:19:18,600 --> 05:19:19,600
Keeps operating.

3171
05:19:19,600 --> 05:19:24,280
I'd ripped the thing apart, and what had happened was, I guarantee you, I didn't see

3172
05:19:24,280 --> 05:19:28,920
him do it, but what, because I had no problem with that, and I had it for years.

3173
05:19:28,920 --> 05:19:33,160
He plugged it in a non-dedicated circuit, it built up a lot of heat, and physically,

3174
05:19:33,160 --> 05:19:36,600
the switch, the contacts got welded.

3175
05:19:36,600 --> 05:19:40,240
I took the switch apart, the contacts were welded to each other.

3176
05:19:40,240 --> 05:19:44,600
That's how hot it got.

3177
05:19:44,600 --> 05:19:49,040
So I went to my file cabinet, opened the drawer, pulled out the manual, got the parts list,

3178
05:19:49,040 --> 05:19:50,200
contacted the company.

3179
05:19:50,200 --> 05:19:55,480
The new switch would be $65 plus shipping.

3180
05:19:55,480 --> 05:20:03,800
A new pressure washer at Costco, $109, I can have it right now.

3181
05:20:03,800 --> 05:20:06,640
The old one's in a landfill somewhere.

3182
05:20:06,640 --> 05:20:08,880
After I cannibalized some parts off of it.

3183
05:20:08,880 --> 05:20:12,000
You thought your neighbor called?

3184
05:20:12,000 --> 05:20:14,800
No, I ran him out of the neighborhood.

3185
05:20:14,800 --> 05:20:18,480
I finally ran him out of the neighborhood.

3186
05:20:18,480 --> 05:20:23,400
There was a chainsaw involved.

3187
05:20:23,400 --> 05:20:24,400
Trees falling.

3188
05:20:24,400 --> 05:20:25,400
Long story.

3189
05:20:25,400 --> 05:20:26,400
Long story.

3190
05:20:26,400 --> 05:20:36,200
Now actually, what pushed Tom over the edge was, he had problems in his basement, flooding,

3191
05:20:36,200 --> 05:20:39,360
split level house, and water would get in.

3192
05:20:39,360 --> 05:20:44,440
So what he dug, did is he dug a trench around the entire foundation of his house, and then

3193
05:20:44,440 --> 05:20:48,000
what he's going to do is he's going to put a treatment on the outside concrete, and then

3194
05:20:48,000 --> 05:20:50,640
he was also going to backfill it, put in drainage and everything.

3195
05:20:50,640 --> 05:20:52,520
So he had this ditch dug.

3196
05:20:52,520 --> 05:20:54,080
It was a lot of backbreaking work.

3197
05:20:54,080 --> 05:20:55,080
He did it all by hand.

3198
05:20:55,080 --> 05:20:59,040
Got to respect that.

3199
05:20:59,040 --> 05:21:00,720
But it took him forever to do it.

3200
05:21:00,720 --> 05:21:02,080
It took him years to do it.

3201
05:21:02,080 --> 05:21:03,880
So I used to accuse him of having a moat.

3202
05:21:03,880 --> 05:21:09,160
It's like, Tom, what's the deal with the moat?

3203
05:21:09,160 --> 05:21:14,200
So anyway, again, I had a buddy of mine over, and it was the wee hours of the morning, and

3204
05:21:14,200 --> 05:21:19,320
we were enjoying some libations and some cigars.

3205
05:21:19,320 --> 05:21:24,080
And actually, my buddy who's got my sense of humor, he's like, hey, Joe, is that Tom's

3206
05:21:24,080 --> 05:21:25,080
moat?

3207
05:21:25,080 --> 05:21:26,080
What's up with that?

3208
05:21:26,080 --> 05:21:27,080
Doesn't he want that thing full?

3209
05:21:27,080 --> 05:21:29,440
I'm like, that's a good point.

3210
05:21:29,440 --> 05:21:32,440
Why have a moat if it's not?

3211
05:21:32,440 --> 05:21:36,920
So anyway, we turned on his garden hose and started filling the moat, and then we're just

3212
05:21:36,920 --> 05:21:40,600
laughing and like busting a gut, and then Tom came out and he's pretty freaking ticked

3213
05:21:40,600 --> 05:21:41,600
off.

3214
05:21:41,600 --> 05:21:43,920
Then we're filling his moat with water.

3215
05:21:43,920 --> 05:21:47,800
I mean, he woke up to the sound of running water, like, why is water running in my house?

3216
05:21:47,800 --> 05:21:52,680
And hey, man, we thought we were doing you a favor by filling your moat, you know?

3217
05:21:52,680 --> 05:21:56,640
He was out of there within six months.

3218
05:21:56,640 --> 05:22:00,040
Open circuit, is this good or bad?

3219
05:22:00,040 --> 05:22:01,040
Depends.

3220
05:22:01,040 --> 05:22:02,040
Depends.

3221
05:22:02,040 --> 05:22:05,560
Now, my pressure washer, this would have been highly desirable.

3222
05:22:05,560 --> 05:22:12,920
When pressure builds up, it opens the switch, interrupts the flow of current to the motor.

3223
05:22:12,920 --> 05:22:20,820
Another circuit condition is called a short circuit.

3224
05:22:20,820 --> 05:22:23,520
Have you all heard of a short circuit before?

3225
05:22:23,520 --> 05:22:30,440
God blessed my wife, but she's been my wife now for a long time, and I've been in this

3226
05:22:30,440 --> 05:22:31,920
industry since puberty.

3227
05:22:31,920 --> 05:22:36,280
So hanging out with a guy that teaches electronics and does electrical stuff, you'd think something

3228
05:22:36,280 --> 05:22:37,280
would rub off.

3229
05:22:37,280 --> 05:22:43,320
Constantly, I get a call, and it's kind of like, the blunder's not working, I think

3230
05:22:43,320 --> 05:22:48,640
it's got a short circuit, and I'm like, holy crap, you tell short circuit to me, I'm like

3231
05:22:48,640 --> 05:22:51,480
ready to call the fire, but I mean, short circuit is like what you see in a Star Trek

3232
05:22:51,480 --> 05:22:55,920
when they get hit by a phaser, you know, and the, you know, I mean, that's a short circuit.

3233
05:22:55,920 --> 05:22:58,160
That literally is what a short circuit is.

3234
05:22:58,160 --> 05:23:02,960
A short circuit will cause an electrical fire.

3235
05:23:02,960 --> 05:23:06,680
And then on further probing, what exactly is the blunder doing?

3236
05:23:06,720 --> 05:23:09,280
Well, I plug it in, I hit the button, but nothing happens.

3237
05:23:09,280 --> 05:23:14,360
Oh, you mean it's an open circuit, not a short circuit, big difference.

3238
05:23:14,360 --> 05:23:18,720
The majority of household appliances that I've encountered that have failed have failed

3239
05:23:18,720 --> 05:23:23,360
because of an open circuit condition.

3240
05:23:23,360 --> 05:23:25,360
That's where nothing works.

3241
05:23:25,360 --> 05:23:31,960
Now you've got to be careful, because sometimes a short circuit will cause a protective device

3242
05:23:31,960 --> 05:23:39,040
to open and render the piece of equipment dead.

3243
05:23:39,040 --> 05:23:44,680
So you've got to get in, and like that direct TV, direct TVO, that was dead.

3244
05:23:44,680 --> 05:23:46,640
That was open intentionally.

3245
05:23:46,640 --> 05:23:51,080
I found the open, it was that fuse with heat shrink around it, trying to disguise it to

3246
05:23:51,080 --> 05:23:55,480
make it look like a fuse with heat shrink around it.

3247
05:23:55,480 --> 05:23:57,120
Make sense?

3248
05:23:57,120 --> 05:24:01,320
So keep that in mind, open circuit, short circuit is always bad.

3249
05:24:01,760 --> 05:24:07,040
There's never an intentional reason to short anything.

3250
05:24:07,040 --> 05:24:11,800
Current flow in a circuit can be varied by changing the voltage applied to the circuit.

3251
05:24:11,800 --> 05:24:14,640
As voltage increases, current increases.

3252
05:24:14,640 --> 05:24:18,840
As voltage decreases, current decreases.

3253
05:24:18,840 --> 05:24:22,960
And also changing the resistance in the circuit.

3254
05:24:22,960 --> 05:24:28,960
As resistance increases, currents going to decrease.

3255
05:24:28,960 --> 05:24:33,240
So these first values we call these directly proportional, right?

3256
05:24:33,240 --> 05:24:37,920
If voltage increases, current increases, directly proportional.

3257
05:24:37,920 --> 05:24:41,400
Voltage decreases, current decreases, directly proportional.

3258
05:24:41,400 --> 05:24:48,400
Resistance increases, current decreases, inversely proportional.

3259
05:24:48,400 --> 05:24:55,400
Now, in the beginning when Ohm gave his like sermon, I don't know if it was a sermon, Ohm's

3260
05:24:59,720 --> 05:25:06,720
sermon on the mount, somehow I think I'm getting my history messed up.

3261
05:25:10,760 --> 05:25:14,920
This is what Ohm said.

3262
05:25:14,920 --> 05:25:18,680
I think the speech was given down at the king dome.

3263
05:25:18,680 --> 05:25:22,760
And he was at the king dome, and he got up, hello, hello, hello.

3264
05:25:22,760 --> 05:25:26,160
This is, this is, I'm the happiest man, man, man, alive.

3265
05:25:26,160 --> 05:25:33,160
Alive, alive, because, because, because, I know, no, no, Ohm's law, law, law, law.

3266
05:25:33,240 --> 05:25:35,360
Y'all ready, ready for this, this, this, this?

3267
05:25:35,360 --> 05:25:40,360
E, E, E is equal to I, I, I times times times R, R, R.

3268
05:25:40,360 --> 05:25:42,080
And the crowd went nuts.

3269
05:25:42,080 --> 05:25:45,120
Forty-five thousand people on their feet.

3270
05:25:45,120 --> 05:25:48,000
Ohm's law, Ohm has spoke.

3271
05:25:48,000 --> 05:25:50,120
Actually, I think I'm getting my history mixed up a little.

3272
05:25:50,120 --> 05:25:56,640
I don't think it went down like that, quite like that.

3273
05:25:56,640 --> 05:25:58,040
So this is Ohm's law.

3274
05:25:58,040 --> 05:25:59,320
This is what Ohm really said.

3275
05:25:59,320 --> 05:26:03,560
Voltage is equal to current times resistance in the circuit.

3276
05:26:03,560 --> 05:26:10,160
And of course, instead of the letter E, we could use the letter V, V is equal to I times R.

3277
05:26:10,240 --> 05:26:17,840
Now remember that trick that I showed you with the triangle T in the center?

3278
05:26:17,840 --> 05:26:23,640
Let's put this in that, V, I, R.

3279
05:26:23,640 --> 05:26:27,160
So now you've got all the other variables.

3280
05:26:27,160 --> 05:26:31,400
If I ask you how much resistance is in there in a circuit, you cover R up, it's voltage

3281
05:26:31,400 --> 05:26:33,720
divided by current.

3282
05:26:33,720 --> 05:26:37,520
If I ask you how much current is there in a circuit, you cover up the I and you say

3283
05:26:37,520 --> 05:26:39,800
it's V over R.

3284
05:26:39,800 --> 05:26:44,520
If I ask you how much voltage is there in a circuit, it's I times R.

3285
05:26:44,520 --> 05:26:50,440
So by knowing that one formula, you can figure out all the other algebraic manipulations

3286
05:26:50,440 --> 05:26:51,440
of it.

3287
05:26:51,440 --> 05:26:53,640
Does that make sense?

3288
05:26:53,640 --> 05:27:01,920
So in essence, that is Ohm's law in all of its variables or variations, I should say.

3289
05:27:01,920 --> 05:27:02,920
Algebraic variations.

3290
05:27:02,920 --> 05:27:09,640
So you don't even need to be a math whiz to be able to do it.

3291
05:27:09,640 --> 05:27:14,960
Ohm's law states relationship between current, voltage, and resistance or I is equal to E

3292
05:27:14,960 --> 05:27:20,760
over R or E is equal to I times R or R is equal to E over I, however you want to look

3293
05:27:20,760 --> 05:27:22,760
at it.

3294
05:27:22,760 --> 05:27:29,360
But in the beginning, beginning, beginning, it was V, V, V, or actually E, E, E is equal

3295
05:27:29,360 --> 05:27:37,760
to I times R, R, R, R, 45,000 people on their feet applauding the man with the beret.

3296
05:27:37,760 --> 05:27:43,120
I don't know if you wore a beret or not.

3297
05:27:43,120 --> 05:27:51,320
If I was Ohm, I'd wear a beret.

3298
05:27:51,320 --> 05:27:58,480
Some of the algebraic formulas, if you will, and when I say that, I know there's some people

3299
05:27:58,480 --> 05:28:01,560
in here that cringe like, I got to know all this math or whatever.

3300
05:28:01,560 --> 05:28:02,880
All this is a recipe.

3301
05:28:02,880 --> 05:28:03,880
That's all this is.

3302
05:28:03,880 --> 05:28:07,360
By laying it out like this, it shows you how it needs to be laid out to explain the

3303
05:28:07,360 --> 05:28:08,360
behavior.

3304
05:28:08,360 --> 05:28:12,240
In a series circuit, the same current flows throughout the circuit.

3305
05:28:12,240 --> 05:28:15,240
Total current is equal to the current through resistor one plus the current through resistor

3306
05:28:15,240 --> 05:28:18,440
two plus the current through resistor three, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

3307
05:28:18,440 --> 05:28:26,400
It's a fancy way of saying current is constant in a series circuit.

3308
05:28:26,400 --> 05:28:30,400
Total voltage is equal to voltage drop across one across two across three, et cetera, et

3309
05:28:30,400 --> 05:28:31,400
cetera.

3310
05:28:31,400 --> 05:28:32,400
That's what I'm saying.

3311
05:28:32,400 --> 05:28:40,120
A series circuit is also known as a voltage divider.

3312
05:28:40,120 --> 05:28:44,440
Total resistance in a circuit is the sum of the individual resistances in a circuit.

3313
05:28:44,440 --> 05:28:47,640
That's a fancy way of saying you got to add it all up.

3314
05:28:47,640 --> 05:28:51,480
Resistance is additive in a series circuit.

3315
05:28:51,480 --> 05:28:57,080
In a parallel circuit, total voltage is constant across the parallel network.

3316
05:28:57,080 --> 05:29:00,200
Resistance is formula.

3317
05:29:00,200 --> 05:29:05,920
Down below, total current is equal to i or one plus i or two.

3318
05:29:05,920 --> 05:29:12,840
This says that a parallel circuit is also known as a current divider.

3319
05:29:12,840 --> 05:29:16,200
Oops, there it is.

3320
05:29:16,200 --> 05:29:18,000
That's another formula.

3321
05:29:18,000 --> 05:29:25,800
The reciprocal of the resist, the sum of the reciprocal of the resistances equals the

3322
05:29:26,360 --> 05:29:31,480
reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals equals the total resistance in the circuit because

3323
05:29:31,480 --> 05:29:33,960
when we add resistors in parallel, what are we doing?

3324
05:29:33,960 --> 05:29:40,320
We're actually adding up the conductivity of the individual branches.

3325
05:29:40,320 --> 05:29:44,200
To determine unknown quantities in a circuit, you can kind of use this as a checklist.

3326
05:29:44,200 --> 05:29:45,200
Draw schematic of the circuit.

3327
05:29:45,200 --> 05:29:50,040
You've got to start off with the schematic of the circuit.

3328
05:29:50,040 --> 05:29:55,080
If one has not been provided to you, you need to draw one.

3329
05:29:55,520 --> 05:29:58,680
Troubleshooting circuits off the top of your head doesn't really work well.

3330
05:29:58,680 --> 05:30:03,080
You've got to be looking at the big picture, pun intended.

3331
05:30:03,080 --> 05:30:06,960
Label all known quantities.

3332
05:30:06,960 --> 05:30:13,960
Sometimes you may need to get these known quantities from manufactured data sheets.

3333
05:30:15,680 --> 05:30:19,320
Solve for equivalent circuits.

3334
05:30:19,320 --> 05:30:24,920
Solve for equivalent circuits.

3335
05:30:25,920 --> 05:30:31,440
When I say redraw the circuit, remember when we were dealing with a parallel network,

3336
05:30:31,440 --> 05:30:35,760
two resistors in parallel with each other, you could redraw that circuit and just show

3337
05:30:35,760 --> 05:30:37,920
one resistance.

3338
05:30:37,920 --> 05:30:40,720
Two resistors equals one resistance.

3339
05:30:40,720 --> 05:30:44,200
I could do a simplified, do you want me to do a simplified drawing of my car, electrical

3340
05:30:44,200 --> 05:30:45,440
system right now?

3341
05:30:45,440 --> 05:30:52,440
Want to see this?

3342
05:30:54,920 --> 05:31:01,920
Battery.

3343
05:31:01,920 --> 05:31:05,920
Car.

3344
05:31:05,920 --> 05:31:12,920
And to be honest with you, I'm not being silly.

3345
05:31:14,760 --> 05:31:20,120
I could redraw every circuit of my car and come up with an equivalency and this is what

3346
05:31:20,120 --> 05:31:21,640
it is.

3347
05:31:21,640 --> 05:31:25,920
And I'll tell you what, if you go out to your car and you turn the key and there's nothing

3348
05:31:25,920 --> 05:31:30,680
and you open the door and the dome light doesn't come on, nothing works in the car and all

3349
05:31:30,680 --> 05:31:35,880
of a sudden this is exactly what you've got and there's an open in this circuit and it's

3350
05:31:35,880 --> 05:31:38,760
a pretty big open or your battery's dead.

3351
05:31:38,760 --> 05:31:40,440
I don't think your whole load is dead.

3352
05:31:40,440 --> 05:31:42,760
It's like oh my goodness all my load is dead.

3353
05:31:42,760 --> 05:31:49,760
I've got to replace the load, save the battery, you know what I'm saying?

3354
05:31:50,760 --> 05:31:52,440
It doesn't work like that.

3355
05:31:52,440 --> 05:31:54,920
But do you see the power of troubleshooting like that?

3356
05:31:54,920 --> 05:31:55,920
What's working?

3357
05:31:55,920 --> 05:31:56,920
My car's dead.

3358
05:31:56,920 --> 05:31:57,920
What do you mean it's dead?

3359
05:31:57,920 --> 05:31:58,920
It's a conversation with my wife.

3360
05:31:58,920 --> 05:31:59,920
The car's dead.

3361
05:31:59,920 --> 05:32:00,920
What do you mean it's dead?

3362
05:32:00,920 --> 05:32:02,120
It's dead.

3363
05:32:02,120 --> 05:32:03,680
When you turn the key does it click?

3364
05:32:03,680 --> 05:32:04,680
No.

3365
05:32:04,680 --> 05:32:06,040
When you open the door does dome light come on?

3366
05:32:06,040 --> 05:32:07,040
No.

3367
05:32:07,040 --> 05:32:08,040
Oh it's dead.

3368
05:32:08,040 --> 05:32:10,880
But you've got to ask those questions because it's different.

3369
05:32:10,880 --> 05:32:14,560
When you open the door the dome light comes on but you turn the key, does anything, do

3370
05:32:14,560 --> 05:32:16,480
you hear a click or anything?

3371
05:32:16,480 --> 05:32:19,600
Immediately your troubleshooting, you're narrowing it down to what circuits perhaps

3372
05:32:19,600 --> 05:32:22,000
could be faulty.

3373
05:32:22,000 --> 05:32:26,840
So redraw to simplify.

3374
05:32:26,840 --> 05:32:33,920
There's another big law out there, it's Kirchhoff's law, GR Kirchhoff extended Ohm's law with

3375
05:32:33,920 --> 05:32:40,240
two important statements, Kirchhoff's current law, the algebraic sum of all currents entering

3376
05:32:40,240 --> 05:32:44,880
and leaving a junction is zero, equal to zero.

3377
05:32:44,880 --> 05:32:49,000
Kirchhoff's law is kind of like this, everybody know the intersection down here at the bottom

3378
05:32:49,000 --> 05:32:51,360
of the hill.

3379
05:32:51,360 --> 05:32:55,800
Let's say that you're a traffic cop and you're directing traffic down there in the center

3380
05:32:55,800 --> 05:32:58,520
of the intersection.

3381
05:32:58,520 --> 05:33:03,440
And you've got three cars coming at you this way and you've got five cars coming at you

3382
05:33:03,440 --> 05:33:05,560
this way.

3383
05:33:05,560 --> 05:33:10,520
In a few moments how many cars are going to be going away from you?

3384
05:33:10,520 --> 05:33:13,440
Eight.

3385
05:33:13,440 --> 05:33:17,640
Because three are coming from one way, five are coming the other way, chances are our cars

3386
05:33:17,640 --> 05:33:20,840
don't come and we're just kidding, we're going to back up.

3387
05:33:20,840 --> 05:33:29,400
I've seen them do that down here, but generally speaking, three plus five equals eight.

3388
05:33:29,400 --> 05:33:31,240
Pretty profound, isn't it?

3389
05:33:31,240 --> 05:33:36,440
That's what Kirchhoff came up with, and he made the textbook, you laugh, his name's

3390
05:33:36,440 --> 05:33:39,720
in the textbook, my name's not.

3391
05:33:39,720 --> 05:33:45,080
That's Kirchhoff's current law, and what Kirchhoff is saying is again the total current entering

3392
05:33:45,080 --> 05:33:46,080
has to exit.

3393
05:33:46,840 --> 05:33:52,520
And it's really a profound troubleshooting tool because what you could do, what you could

3394
05:33:52,520 --> 05:34:00,960
do is I say, I've got three amps of current flowing at me and I've got eight amps flowing

3395
05:34:00,960 --> 05:34:02,960
away from me.

3396
05:34:02,960 --> 05:34:05,320
What does that tell me?

3397
05:34:05,320 --> 05:34:09,760
I must have five more amps coming in from another direction that I'm not aware of and

3398
05:34:09,760 --> 05:34:12,760
there's only one other circuit, so I must have five amps.

3399
05:34:12,760 --> 05:34:19,440
And I tell you what, you could take that information to the bank, it's a law of physics, and it's

3400
05:34:19,440 --> 05:34:26,560
so powerful in troubleshooting, it's extremely powerful in troubleshooting.

3401
05:34:26,560 --> 05:34:32,320
There was a guy that was in my division, one of our techs in the Navy, goofy guy, I'll

3402
05:34:32,320 --> 05:34:37,200
tell you some stories about him and his wife in the future.

3403
05:34:37,200 --> 05:34:45,040
But this dude, it just, you know, every day was a mystery what you'd see this guy into.

3404
05:34:45,040 --> 05:34:51,400
So military equipment is put together really, really, really well and we didn't have cordless

3405
05:34:51,400 --> 05:34:55,160
screwdrivers, so you used to have to take stuff apart by hand.

3406
05:34:55,160 --> 05:34:57,560
So I come in and I'm like, you know, what are you working on?

3407
05:34:57,560 --> 05:35:01,320
He's like, yeah, we've got a problem with this unit here and I want to take this current

3408
05:35:01,320 --> 05:35:05,200
reading, you know, and you know, in order to take a current reading I've got to open

3409
05:35:05,200 --> 05:35:09,080
the circuit.

3410
05:35:09,080 --> 05:35:14,360
So you're going to remove this access plate here with 64 screws and you're going to remove

3411
05:35:14,360 --> 05:35:18,520
that, you're going to get in there and take that reading, you know, why don't you use

3412
05:35:18,520 --> 05:35:21,880
this here which is called Kirchhoff's law, okay?

3413
05:35:21,880 --> 05:35:25,320
You got this amount of current going this way, this amount of current coming in and

3414
05:35:25,320 --> 05:35:30,560
the unknown is what you want to measure here, you're going to use Kirchhoff's law and determine

3415
05:35:30,560 --> 05:35:35,160
with 100% accuracy how much current is flowing through that point, you don't have to take

3416
05:35:35,240 --> 05:35:40,760
the panel off, you don't have to remove the screws, you don't even have to use a meter,

3417
05:35:40,760 --> 05:35:46,760
you could use math, put the meter down, math, solve the problem and to be honest with you,

3418
05:35:46,760 --> 05:35:51,480
these are the technicians that I look for, these are the technicians that I want to hire.

3419
05:35:51,480 --> 05:35:57,120
If you start the troubleshooting process with the manual and then you're going through tracing,

3420
05:35:57,120 --> 05:36:04,620
redrawing, applying these principles, these laws, before you go ripping into stuff, you're

3421
05:36:04,660 --> 05:36:09,260
going to save yourself a lot of grief, a lot of grief.

3422
05:36:09,260 --> 05:36:14,980
It's like going to work for Boeing, Boeing builds big airplanes, on the tail of their

3423
05:36:14,980 --> 05:36:20,020
airplanes they put a light that blinks so other airplanes don't hit their airplane when

3424
05:36:20,020 --> 05:36:25,740
it's flying, you know, I'm not making this stuff up, it's kind of like the light doesn't

3425
05:36:25,740 --> 05:36:26,740
work.

3426
05:36:26,740 --> 05:36:29,620
Well let's get a man lifting, get up there and take it apart and whatever, you get a

3427
05:36:29,620 --> 05:36:34,300
man lift, you get all harnessed up, you know, your five stories in the air, you're manipulating

3428
05:36:34,300 --> 05:36:39,580
the controls and all of a sudden, oops, you put a dent in the rudder.

3429
05:36:39,580 --> 05:36:44,460
When you could have done some troubleshooting, probably through an access panel down below,

3430
05:36:44,460 --> 05:36:48,740
using Kirchoff's law, how much current do I have flowing up there, what's going on,

3431
05:36:48,740 --> 05:36:53,300
then make some determinations, is it really essential for you to get up there and take

3432
05:36:53,300 --> 05:36:58,420
that assembly apart, get a man lift, harness yourself up, run the risk of plowing into

3433
05:36:58,420 --> 05:37:02,920
the rudder by accident, I mean accidents happen, so always look at that kind of stuff.

3434
05:37:02,920 --> 05:37:07,440
Is there an easier way of going about getting the reading that I want?

3435
05:37:07,440 --> 05:37:14,320
That's the power of Ohm's law, that's the power of Kirchoff's law.

3436
05:37:14,320 --> 05:37:22,600
Kirchoff's law also has a voltage application and Kirchoff says the algebraic sum of all

3437
05:37:22,600 --> 05:37:26,860
voltages around a closed circuit equals zero.

3438
05:37:26,860 --> 05:37:36,180
This is a fancy way of saying voltage rise equals voltage drop, and you know how much

3439
05:37:36,180 --> 05:37:38,900
you're left over with, zero.

3440
05:37:38,900 --> 05:37:41,560
We talked about this last week, didn't we?

3441
05:37:41,560 --> 05:37:44,680
We talked about this last week.

3442
05:37:44,680 --> 05:37:48,960
If you put 12 volts in, how many volts are going to get used, 12.

3443
05:37:48,960 --> 05:37:53,700
If you're troubleshooting and you can only account for 11.5 volts, that half a volt

3444
05:37:53,700 --> 05:37:57,660
is somewhere that it doesn't belong.

3445
05:37:57,660 --> 05:38:00,540
You got 120 volts that are supposed to be coming out of these outlets.

3446
05:38:00,540 --> 05:38:05,780
If you plug it in, you only get 98 volts, something's wrong.

3447
05:38:05,780 --> 05:38:10,180
If you could go to that box and prove that you got 120 across each leg, but you go to

3448
05:38:10,180 --> 05:38:14,580
an outlet in your home and you get 98, something's wrong.

3449
05:38:14,580 --> 05:38:17,780
You find where the missing voltage is, you find the problem.

3450
05:38:17,780 --> 05:38:21,220
So again, does this sound really basic?

3451
05:38:21,220 --> 05:38:24,260
What goes in must come out.

3452
05:38:24,260 --> 05:38:25,260
It is.

3453
05:38:25,260 --> 05:38:30,180
But I'll tell you what, when you get to industry, you'll deceive me.

3454
05:38:30,180 --> 05:38:33,180
You're going to get your head to all, ooh, wow, ooh, it's complex.

3455
05:38:33,180 --> 05:38:36,660
I never worked on one of these before, oh, geez, it's got to be something really, it's

3456
05:38:36,660 --> 05:38:40,060
got to be the flux capacitor must have failed.

3457
05:38:40,060 --> 05:38:43,420
I missed that day when Joe talked about the flux capacitor.

3458
05:38:43,420 --> 05:38:46,060
Keep it basic.

3459
05:38:46,060 --> 05:38:47,660
Keep it basic.

3460
05:38:47,660 --> 05:38:52,300
The fundamental parts of the circuit, the source, the load, the internal wiring, the

3461
05:38:52,300 --> 05:39:00,300
controlling device, the protective device, you got to be able to prove every one of those

3462
05:39:00,300 --> 05:39:05,660
parts, functional parts is functional.

3463
05:39:05,660 --> 05:39:09,420
And how are you going to learn how to do that in the lab by doing your labs?

3464
05:39:09,420 --> 05:39:13,060
Theoretically, how are you going to come to appreciate that by attending a lecture and

3465
05:39:13,060 --> 05:39:15,020
doing your rent assignments?

3466
05:39:15,020 --> 05:39:17,620
Because that's what this industry is about.

3467
05:39:17,620 --> 05:39:20,100
It's about the written theory, which is kind of cool.

3468
05:39:20,100 --> 05:39:26,260
Some of you had back-breaking jobs in the past, okay?

3469
05:39:26,260 --> 05:39:29,300
I never worked a hard day in my life.

3470
05:39:29,300 --> 05:39:31,580
Actually I did, but it was all mental.

3471
05:39:31,580 --> 05:39:36,340
And I'll tell you what, there were days working on my system.

3472
05:39:36,340 --> 05:39:38,700
That's the other thing too, you know, it's one of the reasons that we all try to treat

3473
05:39:38,700 --> 05:39:40,660
you as professionals here in this program.

3474
05:39:40,660 --> 05:39:42,940
When you go to industry, you're going to be professionals.

3475
05:39:42,940 --> 05:39:46,700
If your equipment ain't broke, they don't care what you're doing.

3476
05:39:46,700 --> 05:39:52,420
But when it's broke, they expect you to be there bringing it back from the dead.

3477
05:39:52,420 --> 05:39:53,420
No questions asked.

3478
05:39:53,420 --> 05:39:58,660
Well, I'm a union guy and do I get time and a half and fix the freaking gear?

3479
05:39:58,660 --> 05:39:59,660
Get it up and running.

3480
05:39:59,660 --> 05:40:01,300
That's all they care about.

3481
05:40:01,300 --> 05:40:06,060
And actually there are some union maintenance jobs that, you know, do pay you well if you've

3482
05:40:06,060 --> 05:40:08,620
got to put in that over time.

3483
05:40:08,620 --> 05:40:12,940
But generally speaking, this is where you make your money.

3484
05:40:12,940 --> 05:40:15,980
This is the most, I tell you what, I'm taking a lot of time with this chapter.

3485
05:40:15,980 --> 05:40:18,940
This is one of the most important chapters of the book.

3486
05:40:18,940 --> 05:40:24,140
It's one of the most important chapters of this entire program.

3487
05:40:24,140 --> 05:40:27,340
I could talk for a week about just this chapter.

3488
05:40:27,340 --> 05:40:30,340
And you know what the beauty of it is?

3489
05:40:30,340 --> 05:40:31,340
You've all been here.

3490
05:40:31,340 --> 05:40:32,740
This is your third week in this program.

3491
05:40:32,740 --> 05:40:34,460
You understand what I'm saying?

3492
05:40:34,460 --> 05:40:37,620
Do you understand what I'm saying?

3493
05:40:37,620 --> 05:40:41,540
The message isn't going to get any worse.

3494
05:40:41,540 --> 05:40:43,540
It's not.

3495
05:40:43,540 --> 05:40:51,180
The most complex electronic systems could be rapidly troubleshot, keeping these fundamental

3496
05:40:51,180 --> 05:40:52,900
skill sets in mind.

3497
05:40:52,900 --> 05:40:57,580
Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's Law, five basic parts of a circuit.

3498
05:40:57,580 --> 05:40:58,580
Is my source good?

3499
05:40:58,580 --> 05:40:59,580
Is my load good?

3500
05:40:59,580 --> 05:41:00,580
Is it the interconnects?

3501
05:41:00,580 --> 05:41:01,780
Can I prove that?

3502
05:41:01,780 --> 05:41:06,980
The other thing you've got to do as a technician is just pay attention to what can you check

3503
05:41:06,980 --> 05:41:09,100
quickly?

3504
05:41:09,100 --> 05:41:10,980
What can you check quickly?

3505
05:41:11,740 --> 05:41:17,500
Again, like my former esteemed colleague on the submarine, Mike Wirep, was his name.

3506
05:41:17,500 --> 05:41:21,340
Wirep, weird name.

3507
05:41:21,340 --> 05:41:26,020
He'd be the kind of guy like, well, you know, I think it's the wiring, Joe.

3508
05:41:26,020 --> 05:41:28,620
I want to look at the, I want to do continuity checks.

3509
05:41:28,620 --> 05:41:31,940
I mean, you're talking these big multi-pin connectors and you're going to disconnect

3510
05:41:31,940 --> 05:41:32,940
and check the continuity.

3511
05:41:32,940 --> 05:41:36,260
It could take months.

3512
05:41:36,260 --> 05:41:38,700
You really think that's the problem?

3513
05:41:38,700 --> 05:41:44,420
You really think a wire like broke in the middle of the night behind that equipment

3514
05:41:44,420 --> 05:41:45,420
rack?

3515
05:41:45,420 --> 05:41:48,980
You know, I don't think so.

3516
05:41:48,980 --> 05:41:52,900
I think it's, you know, maybe something like controlling device.

3517
05:41:52,900 --> 05:41:57,060
Have you tried reloading the software, you know, the virgin version of software that

3518
05:41:57,060 --> 05:41:58,060
we have in that safe?

3519
05:41:58,060 --> 05:42:01,620
Why don't you try reloading the version of software?

3520
05:42:01,620 --> 05:42:04,020
Controlling device is what I'm thinking, right?

3521
05:42:04,020 --> 05:42:06,180
Reload the firmware, software.

3522
05:42:06,180 --> 05:42:07,180
Reboot the system.

3523
05:42:07,180 --> 05:42:08,740
That's what the problem manifests itself.

3524
05:42:08,740 --> 05:42:11,460
Oh, Joe, most amazing thing happened.

3525
05:42:11,460 --> 05:42:13,260
We loaded the software, started working.

3526
05:42:13,260 --> 05:42:14,260
Wow.

3527
05:42:14,260 --> 05:42:18,020
Good thing it didn't like take, you know, six months and check the continuity of all

3528
05:42:18,020 --> 05:42:20,860
them wires in the back of the equipment rack.

3529
05:42:20,860 --> 05:42:25,060
What would the odds have been?

3530
05:42:25,060 --> 05:42:30,940
In summary, the electric circuit contains a voltage source, a load, a conductor, the

3531
05:42:30,940 --> 05:42:35,220
two optional ones, controlling device, protective device.

3532
05:42:35,220 --> 05:42:36,220
Don't second-guess those.

3533
05:42:36,260 --> 05:42:41,580
Hey, you want another troubleshooting hint?

3534
05:42:41,580 --> 05:42:47,020
Another type of protective device, it's called a resettable fuse.

3535
05:42:47,020 --> 05:42:49,020
Resettable fuse.

3536
05:42:49,020 --> 05:42:57,100
A lot of consumer electronic products, DVD players, VHS players, stuff like that, tuners,

3537
05:42:57,100 --> 05:42:59,660
TV tuners, have these resettable fuses.

3538
05:42:59,660 --> 05:43:04,540
And a lot of times what happens is the device will not work.

3539
05:43:04,540 --> 05:43:05,540
So it's kind of funny.

3540
05:43:06,180 --> 05:43:09,500
You know, my family, they all know, you know, Joe, and the family, he's the electronics

3541
05:43:09,500 --> 05:43:10,500
guy.

3542
05:43:10,500 --> 05:43:12,900
You've got a problem, you know, and they always call me with the problem.

3543
05:43:12,900 --> 05:43:17,300
So it's amazing how many things I've fixed from afar.

3544
05:43:17,300 --> 05:43:19,820
They tell me what the problem is, you know.

3545
05:43:19,820 --> 05:43:24,620
And a lot of these have been with DVD, VHS players, things like that in the past.

3546
05:43:24,620 --> 05:43:29,340
So what I'm going to have you do is I've got a ritual that I'm going to go through here

3547
05:43:29,340 --> 05:43:30,340
on the West Coast.

3548
05:43:30,340 --> 05:43:35,180
I want you to unplug that device, okay, and what's the most comfortable chair you have

3549
05:43:35,180 --> 05:43:36,180
in the house?

3550
05:43:36,180 --> 05:43:39,860
I want you to remove it and put it in the most comfortable chair of the house overnight.

3551
05:43:39,860 --> 05:43:45,780
And I've got some rituals and some telepathic, you know, things that I'm going to do.

3552
05:43:45,780 --> 05:43:48,860
And then I'm going to call you back in the morning and let you know when I'm done.

3553
05:43:48,860 --> 05:43:50,420
Okay, and I'll go plug it in.

3554
05:43:50,420 --> 05:43:51,420
Holy cow, it works!

3555
05:43:51,420 --> 05:43:53,580
How did you do that, you know?

3556
05:43:53,580 --> 05:43:59,660
It's all about chi, okay?

3557
05:43:59,660 --> 05:44:01,780
Freakin' resettable fuse.

3558
05:44:01,780 --> 05:44:04,620
For whatever reason, there was a glitch that tripped that.

3559
05:44:04,620 --> 05:44:08,660
You got to unplug it, totally discharge the whole unit, plug it back in, it reboots thinking

3560
05:44:08,660 --> 05:44:09,660
it's back at the factory.

3561
05:44:09,660 --> 05:44:13,620
The first day it was ever made, problem goes away.

3562
05:44:13,620 --> 05:44:16,420
You got to make sure you give it overnight to be able to do that.

3563
05:44:16,420 --> 05:44:17,860
So I've brought back countless.

3564
05:44:17,860 --> 05:44:23,340
I've had a lot of people come in here, colleagues, hey Joe, my amplifier, this amp doesn't work

3565
05:44:23,340 --> 05:44:24,340
anymore.

3566
05:44:24,340 --> 05:44:28,220
I can have, you could have it if you could fix it, okay, because I went out and bought

3567
05:44:28,220 --> 05:44:29,220
a new one.

3568
05:44:29,220 --> 05:44:31,060
I figured this thing is toast.

3569
05:44:31,060 --> 05:44:34,980
I go plug it in, it works.

3570
05:44:34,980 --> 05:44:39,820
By you unplugging it, you fix it, I don't even go on to it with people.

3571
05:44:39,820 --> 05:44:42,860
We would be surprised the amount of stuff that you could fix by simply unplugging it

3572
05:44:42,860 --> 05:44:46,380
for 24 hours, plug it overnight, not even 24 hours, plug it back in, you're good to

3573
05:44:46,380 --> 05:44:47,380
go.

3574
05:44:47,380 --> 05:44:49,900
Why does it take time?

3575
05:44:49,900 --> 05:44:54,340
Because these resettable fuses, there's a time delay before they're actually solid

3576
05:44:54,340 --> 05:44:58,620
state devices, before they physically reset and allow the circuit to function properly

3577
05:44:58,620 --> 05:44:59,620
again.

3578
05:44:59,620 --> 05:45:03,500
So you want to get it back to that neutral state of when it left the factory.

3579
05:45:03,500 --> 05:45:09,860
I don't know, in mobile audio, did you encounter any of that stuff?

3580
05:45:09,860 --> 05:45:14,180
Or by disconnecting it for a period of time, would fix the problem?

3581
05:45:14,180 --> 05:45:20,620
Yeah, I mean, when you did a harder reset, touch positive, negative together, make sure

3582
05:45:20,620 --> 05:45:28,620
the circuit's completely different on the EnerGuy, airbag lights, some control systems

3583
05:45:28,620 --> 05:45:36,620
if you get a hard reset, would do that to make sure that everything just paints inside.

3584
05:45:36,620 --> 05:45:39,620
So the fastest way would be to...

3585
05:45:39,620 --> 05:45:40,620
Yeah.

3586
05:45:40,620 --> 05:45:43,620
And that's the other thing that you can do even with a DVD player, if you just short

3587
05:45:43,620 --> 05:45:47,660
it, not unplug it, make sure it's unplugged and then short it, keep the leads shorted

3588
05:45:47,660 --> 05:45:50,780
together, then that's a kind of a fast track.

3589
05:45:50,780 --> 05:45:54,620
But still, there are some capacitors we'll talk about in the future, store energy in

3590
05:45:54,620 --> 05:45:58,500
the form of an electrostatic field that may keep stuff alive for a considerable amount

3591
05:45:58,500 --> 05:45:59,500
of time.

3592
05:45:59,500 --> 05:46:00,500
So...

3593
05:46:00,500 --> 05:46:03,500
Flux capacitors.

3594
05:46:03,500 --> 05:46:06,940
Flux capacitors.

3595
05:46:06,940 --> 05:46:10,540
Current path, we talked about series circuits, parallel circuits and complex circuits, series

3596
05:46:10,540 --> 05:46:11,540
parallel circuits.

3597
05:46:11,540 --> 05:46:16,580
We talked about current flow, negative to positive, varied by changing the voltage or the resistance.

3598
05:46:16,580 --> 05:46:22,060
We talked about Ohm's Law and also determining unknown quantities in a circuit as well as

3599
05:46:22,060 --> 05:46:23,660
Kirchhoff's Law.

3600
05:46:23,660 --> 05:46:29,460
For current, current is constant in a series circuit, Ohm's Law.

3601
05:46:29,460 --> 05:46:33,460
All the current entering a node must exit the node, Kirchhoff's Law.

3602
05:46:33,460 --> 05:46:41,860
Powerful, powerful stuff prevents you from removing 64 screws by hand to take one reading.

3603
05:46:41,860 --> 05:46:44,300
He used to think I was an A-hole.

3604
05:46:44,300 --> 05:46:46,900
This here is Kirchhoff's Law.

3605
05:46:46,900 --> 05:46:48,660
I stayed awake during that class.

3606
05:46:48,660 --> 05:46:52,620
You could use this here tool to prevent yourself from removing 64 screws.

3607
05:46:52,620 --> 05:46:53,620
Chronic.

3608
05:46:53,620 --> 05:46:55,620
Chronic, you're a freaking jerk.

3609
05:46:55,620 --> 05:46:56,620
No.

3610
05:46:56,620 --> 05:46:57,620
No, I'm not.

3611
05:46:57,620 --> 05:47:03,020
I think the guy that's removing 64 screws and then is going to strip the screws, break

3612
05:47:03,020 --> 05:47:04,660
the heads off.

3613
05:47:04,660 --> 05:47:05,660
That's another story.

3614
05:47:05,660 --> 05:47:08,780
There was a dude, a local company, can't make this stuff up.

3615
05:47:08,780 --> 05:47:09,780
Broke heads of screws off.

3616
05:47:09,780 --> 05:47:14,940
The product's ready for shipping, got freaking instant glue, glued the heads back on.

3617
05:47:14,940 --> 05:47:18,580
First time it was out in the field and they took a panel off for maintenance, snap, snap.

3618
05:47:18,580 --> 05:47:19,580
What the heck is this?

3619
05:47:19,580 --> 05:47:20,580
What is that on there?

3620
05:47:20,580 --> 05:47:21,580
They look at it.

3621
05:47:21,580 --> 05:47:22,580
It's like this instant glue.

3622
05:47:22,580 --> 05:47:23,580
Who worked on it last at a company?

3623
05:47:23,580 --> 05:47:24,580
Why'd you do that?

3624
05:47:24,580 --> 05:47:27,020
But, well, I didn't want to get in trouble.

3625
05:47:27,020 --> 05:47:29,860
You're out of here, you know, that instant.

3626
05:47:29,860 --> 05:47:32,540
You can't make stuff like this up.

3627
05:47:32,540 --> 05:47:35,540
Try to avoid it.

3628
05:47:35,540 --> 05:47:36,540
Questions?

3629
05:47:36,540 --> 05:47:45,180
Yes, and that's basically what we're studying is the theory.

3630
05:47:45,180 --> 05:47:46,740
Laws of physics.

3631
05:47:46,740 --> 05:47:54,180
We have proven that although this is theory, these are laws of physics, voltage, the relationship

3632
05:47:54,180 --> 05:48:00,300
between voltage current and resistance, the relationship between voltage current and power,

3633
05:48:00,300 --> 05:48:02,300
Kirchoff's laws, they're laws of physics.

3634
05:48:02,300 --> 05:48:09,300
We know that we could prove with 100% accuracy that this is how they behave.

3635
05:48:09,300 --> 05:48:18,300
Also, in science, generally, a theory is something that is provable all to an infinitesimal

3636
05:48:18,300 --> 05:48:23,860
degree and a postulate is something that's unproven.

3637
05:48:23,860 --> 05:48:24,860
Very good.

3638
05:48:24,860 --> 05:48:25,860
Thank you.

3639
05:48:25,860 --> 05:48:26,860
Okay.

3640
05:48:26,860 --> 05:48:30,380
Hey, before we wrap things up, because we've got another chapter to do, okay?

3641
05:48:30,380 --> 05:48:34,660
Well, fortunately, one of the reasons that I took this amount of time here is this other

3642
05:48:34,660 --> 05:48:38,340
chapter is not a chapter that I am going to lecture on.

3643
05:48:38,340 --> 05:48:44,460
It's another chapter that you've got to watch some videos on.

3644
05:48:44,460 --> 05:48:46,460
There are four videos.

3645
05:48:46,460 --> 05:48:52,740
When you go to the Google site, it's going to say, follow this link to watch test equipment

3646
05:48:52,740 --> 05:48:57,180
videos, okay?

3647
05:48:57,180 --> 05:49:05,100
And there are four videos that I want you to watch and you're responsible for the information.

3648
05:49:05,100 --> 05:49:11,860
I think all of you kind of figured out that I'm the kind of guy that likes lectures, okay?

3649
05:49:11,860 --> 05:49:13,780
I like to have fun with lecture.

3650
05:49:13,780 --> 05:49:18,460
Hopefully you're not falling asleep during my lectures, but I like lectures and it gives

3651
05:49:18,460 --> 05:49:21,900
me quality face-to-face time with all of you.

3652
05:49:22,300 --> 05:49:27,260
However, that being said, I also, I'm not the smartest guy, but I know that a picture

3653
05:49:27,260 --> 05:49:29,380
is worth a thousand words.

3654
05:49:29,380 --> 05:49:32,940
So if I could have you watch a 15-minute video, that's a lot of frames.

3655
05:49:32,940 --> 05:49:34,060
That's a lot of pictures.

3656
05:49:34,060 --> 05:49:35,740
That's a lot of data.

3657
05:49:35,740 --> 05:49:39,380
More time than I have to preach to you about this stuff.

3658
05:49:39,380 --> 05:49:40,660
The four videos.

3659
05:49:40,660 --> 05:49:47,900
The first video is going to be a basic introduction to digital multimeters versus analog meters,

3660
05:49:47,900 --> 05:49:48,900
okay?

3661
05:49:48,900 --> 05:49:51,580
The analog, when I speak of analog, this is what I'm talking about here.

3662
05:49:51,580 --> 05:49:56,500
We can, old school.

3663
05:49:56,500 --> 05:50:01,340
The digital meter is going to be based on a Fluke 70 series meter that quite frankly

3664
05:50:01,340 --> 05:50:07,660
all meters are really measured against.

3665
05:50:07,660 --> 05:50:15,500
The second video is going to talk specifically about how to perform resistance and continuity

3666
05:50:15,500 --> 05:50:22,740
measurements using an analog meter and a digital multimeter.

3667
05:50:22,740 --> 05:50:26,420
Resistance and continuity.

3668
05:50:26,420 --> 05:50:33,160
The third video is going to talk about measuring current and voltage.

3669
05:50:33,160 --> 05:50:38,860
So by the end of those three videos, you're going to know how to measure resistance, current,

3670
05:50:38,860 --> 05:50:44,860
and voltage.

3671
05:50:44,860 --> 05:50:49,140
If you know how to do that, let me tell you, you've got it going on.

3672
05:50:49,140 --> 05:50:50,780
You've got it going on.

3673
05:50:50,780 --> 05:50:55,940
Because those are three of the big four properties that all of this is based on.

3674
05:50:55,940 --> 05:50:57,660
So these are very, very important videos.

3675
05:50:57,660 --> 05:51:01,860
One of the reasons that we have them on videos and upload it is so that you can watch over

3676
05:51:01,860 --> 05:51:06,540
and over again to make sure you understand exactly what the process is.

3677
05:51:06,540 --> 05:51:10,340
So by the time you get into the lab, you can apply that.

3678
05:51:10,340 --> 05:51:12,220
Very, very critical.

3679
05:51:12,220 --> 05:51:14,260
Like how to diffuse a nuclear bomb.

3680
05:51:14,260 --> 05:51:18,380
You want to get it right the first time.

3681
05:51:18,380 --> 05:51:23,180
The fourth video is produced by Fluke Corporation.

3682
05:51:23,180 --> 05:51:25,940
How many of you know about Fluke?

3683
05:51:25,940 --> 05:51:27,900
Fluke is the real deal.

3684
05:51:27,900 --> 05:51:29,980
The real deal.

3685
05:51:29,980 --> 05:51:32,340
Expensive local company.

3686
05:51:32,340 --> 05:51:33,860
John Fluke.

3687
05:51:33,860 --> 05:51:37,300
John Fluke, former submarine guy.

3688
05:51:37,300 --> 05:51:38,900
Got to support his product.

3689
05:51:38,900 --> 05:51:41,380
He was before my time.

3690
05:51:42,380 --> 05:51:47,860
But yeah, John Fluke is a former submarineer.

3691
05:51:47,860 --> 05:51:51,420
They produce this video and it kind of, it's a drama.

3692
05:51:51,420 --> 05:51:52,420
Not a drama.

3693
05:51:52,420 --> 05:51:55,700
Like, oh, I can't believe he's going to test the voltage.

3694
05:51:55,700 --> 05:51:57,940
You know, it's got a story behind it.

3695
05:51:57,940 --> 05:52:01,620
There's a kid who's working on the job and he blows up something and his boss is like,

3696
05:52:01,620 --> 05:52:05,540
you know, you need to go out to the community college and talk with the electronics professor.

3697
05:52:05,540 --> 05:52:11,540
And basically it reviews how to perform basic measurements, resistance, current, and voltage

3698
05:52:11,540 --> 05:52:15,380
with a Fluke 70 Series DMM.

3699
05:52:15,380 --> 05:52:16,740
That's the fourth video.

3700
05:52:16,740 --> 05:52:19,220
So all of the information of those videos is testable.

3701
05:52:19,220 --> 05:52:21,940
The link is on the Google sites.

3702
05:52:21,940 --> 05:52:23,500
You can watch it at the privacy of your own home.

3703
05:52:23,500 --> 05:52:29,620
You can watch it on these machines, but that is what we are doing in lieu of this chapter

3704
05:52:29,620 --> 05:52:30,620
on test equipment.

3705
05:52:30,620 --> 05:52:34,540
Does anybody have any questions on anything that I covered tonight?

3706
05:52:35,540 --> 05:52:36,540
Yes.

3707
05:52:38,540 --> 05:52:40,540
No, the Google site.

3708
05:52:40,540 --> 05:52:42,540
It's the sites that were in the syllabus.

3709
05:52:42,540 --> 05:52:43,540
Okay.

3710
05:52:43,540 --> 05:52:44,540
This right here.

3711
05:52:44,540 --> 05:52:49,900
If you go to that Google sites, the electronics, LWTC electronics, you're going to see a link

3712
05:52:49,900 --> 05:52:50,900
in there.

3713
05:52:50,900 --> 05:52:53,260
Follow this link for test equipment videos.

3714
05:52:53,260 --> 05:52:58,980
You click on that and then it brings you to some server in Peru that we've uploaded those

3715
05:52:58,980 --> 05:53:01,580
videos to.

3716
05:53:01,580 --> 05:53:03,980
We got stuff all over the place.

3717
05:53:03,980 --> 05:53:06,700
You know what the alternative is?

3718
05:53:06,700 --> 05:53:09,060
You got to sit here and watch it all.

3719
05:53:09,060 --> 05:53:10,060
We've really tried.

3720
05:53:10,060 --> 05:53:14,980
I got my TAs working very, very hard to get as much stuff as we can uploaded to the web

3721
05:53:14,980 --> 05:53:19,780
so that you could look at this stuff morning, noon, and night.

3722
05:53:19,780 --> 05:53:23,940
Any other questions on anything in general?

3723
05:53:23,940 --> 05:53:27,740
Make sure you get that video watched over the next 24, oh, those videos watched over

3724
05:53:27,740 --> 05:53:29,740
the next 24 hours.

3725
05:53:30,500 --> 05:53:32,000
All right.

3726
05:53:32,000 --> 05:53:40,740
A chapter that I really like talking about is chapter seven because the title is Power

3727
05:53:40,740 --> 05:53:43,500
and I like power.

3728
05:53:43,500 --> 05:53:44,500
I like power.

3729
05:53:44,500 --> 05:53:45,500
Remember what was it?

3730
05:53:45,500 --> 05:53:46,500
Tim the tool man?

3731
05:53:46,500 --> 05:53:47,500
Remember power?

3732
05:53:47,500 --> 05:53:49,340
You could never have enough power.

3733
05:53:49,340 --> 05:53:51,660
The gas-powered blender.

3734
05:53:51,660 --> 05:53:53,500
I think it's a great idea.

3735
05:53:53,500 --> 05:53:57,700
If you've ever mixed any frozen concoctions, having a little bit extra power to chop that

3736
05:53:57,700 --> 05:54:03,220
ice up and get just the perfect consistency is not a bad thing.

3737
05:54:03,220 --> 05:54:05,140
I've never driven a car.

3738
05:54:05,140 --> 05:54:09,020
I've never driven a car that's had too much power.

3739
05:54:09,020 --> 05:54:12,260
Actually, no, and I did have the opportunity.

3740
05:54:12,260 --> 05:54:15,980
I went through Richard Petty's driving school two years on a row.

3741
05:54:15,980 --> 05:54:18,900
This was probably about 10 years ago.

3742
05:54:18,900 --> 05:54:21,380
I thought these cars would have governors on them.

3743
05:54:21,380 --> 05:54:26,060
You go through and they're going to turn some goofball like me loose in a Winston Cup car

3744
05:54:26,100 --> 05:54:27,100
at the time.

3745
05:54:27,100 --> 05:54:28,100
No governors.

3746
05:54:28,100 --> 05:54:29,980
That car had a lot of power.

3747
05:54:29,980 --> 05:54:30,980
Putting the right hand.

3748
05:54:30,980 --> 05:54:31,980
It's scary.

3749
05:54:31,980 --> 05:54:37,180
I got the Drive Las Vegas Motor Speedway and I'll tell you the whole story sometime, but

3750
05:54:37,180 --> 05:54:39,780
actually I got the fastest times of the day.

3751
05:54:39,780 --> 05:54:44,460
I was at the top of the reader board, Joe Greenock, it was pretty freaking cool.

3752
05:54:44,460 --> 05:54:49,780
So I was thinking about quitting my day job and becoming a NASCAR driver.

3753
05:54:49,780 --> 05:54:55,140
Luckily I have good friends that woke me up to reality, but the power was fabulous.

3754
05:54:55,140 --> 05:55:00,300
So I think as much as I love aviation and aerospace, I see the Blue Angels in town.

3755
05:55:00,300 --> 05:55:05,500
I look at those F-18s and knowing my own piloting skills, and I think I'm a pretty good pilot,

3756
05:55:05,500 --> 05:55:10,340
but knowing my own pilot skills, I probably last probably five or six seconds in one of

3757
05:55:10,340 --> 05:55:13,780
those things before there'd be a fireball going down the runway, a little bit too much

3758
05:55:13,780 --> 05:55:17,460
power for me.

3759
05:55:17,460 --> 05:55:24,020
Power in electronics is in electrical is very, very important because it's the metric that

3760
05:55:24,020 --> 05:55:27,220
we use to determine output.

3761
05:55:27,220 --> 05:55:31,300
It's the metric that we use to determine efficiency.

3762
05:55:31,300 --> 05:55:37,020
It's the metric that we use to show us how much energy we're converting into work.

3763
05:55:37,020 --> 05:55:40,580
So this is a really big chapter.

3764
05:55:40,580 --> 05:55:47,780
If you fully understand the implications of power, you're going to be a better technician.

3765
05:55:47,780 --> 05:55:52,260
You truly are, because looking at inconsistencies in power output is going to start to paint

3766
05:55:52,260 --> 05:55:58,340
a story, tell you a story, and paint you a picture of what's taking place with a system.

3767
05:55:58,340 --> 05:56:03,660
So with that being said, let's jump and immerse ourselves into chapter seven power.

3768
05:56:03,660 --> 05:56:07,940
After completing this chapter, we're going to be able to define power as it relates

3769
05:56:07,940 --> 05:56:15,020
to electric circuits, state the relationship of current and voltage, solve for power consumption

3770
05:56:15,020 --> 05:56:21,380
in electrical circuit, determine the total power consumption in a series parallel and

3771
05:56:21,380 --> 05:56:24,980
a series parallel circuit.

3772
05:56:24,980 --> 05:56:32,620
Now power relates to the rate at which work is being done.

3773
05:56:32,620 --> 05:56:36,560
Relates to the rate at which work is being done.

3774
05:56:36,560 --> 05:56:42,220
Work is done when a force causes motion.

3775
05:56:42,220 --> 05:56:46,940
I'm sure my kids, I got three kids, three boys, they're all grown, the youngest is going to

3776
05:56:46,940 --> 05:56:52,100
graduate, new dub here in June.

3777
05:56:52,100 --> 05:56:55,140
Business finance, he's going to make me, he's going to make a bunch of money and then hire

3778
05:56:55,140 --> 05:56:59,020
me to hang out with them.

3779
05:56:59,020 --> 05:57:00,340
He's going to do really well.

3780
05:57:00,340 --> 05:57:04,860
My kids probably all think I'm a jerk because I know stuff like this.

3781
05:57:04,860 --> 05:57:10,220
We'd have family cleanup day around the yard, and I'm out in the front yard digging ditches

3782
05:57:10,220 --> 05:57:15,300
and doing whatever, and the kids are in the back yard, it's supposed to be raking leaves.

3783
05:57:15,300 --> 05:57:21,860
When I come around the corner and they're standing there leaning on the rake, what are

3784
05:57:21,860 --> 05:57:22,860
you guys doing?

3785
05:57:22,860 --> 05:57:23,860
We're working.

3786
05:57:23,860 --> 05:57:29,780
No, you're not because work is done when a force causes motion, right?

3787
05:57:29,780 --> 05:57:34,740
So by simply standing there bracing yourself against the rake, you're definitely not working

3788
05:57:34,740 --> 05:57:41,420
to get back to raking, so obviously me knowing this stuff, they think I'm a jerk.

3789
05:57:41,420 --> 05:57:45,540
So work is done when a force causes motion.

3790
05:57:45,540 --> 05:57:51,420
Now check this out, force, voltage, current, motion.

3791
05:57:51,420 --> 05:57:55,740
Voltage creates current causing electrons to move in a circuit.

3792
05:57:55,740 --> 05:57:59,420
So if you've got a voltage and you've got current, you're doing work.

3793
05:57:59,420 --> 05:58:03,940
May not be the work you want to get done, but you're doing work because a force causes

3794
05:58:03,940 --> 05:58:09,260
motion, voltage causes current, and we know voltage is pressure, current is movement,

3795
05:58:09,780 --> 05:58:14,420
it's got to be power, make sense?

3796
05:58:14,420 --> 05:58:23,660
Now electric power rate is the instantaneous rate at which work is done, instantaneous.

3797
05:58:23,660 --> 05:58:27,660
That means take a snapshot right now, how much work is being done right now?

3798
05:58:27,660 --> 05:58:28,660
What's the pressure?

3799
05:58:28,660 --> 05:58:29,660
What's the current?

3800
05:58:29,660 --> 05:58:32,340
Right now, instantaneous value, make sense?

3801
05:58:32,340 --> 05:58:36,460
Now that's not how the power company, it's actually odd the power company is called the

3802
05:58:36,460 --> 05:58:39,820
power company, let's go back to that.

3803
05:58:39,820 --> 05:58:44,580
Power relates to the rate at which work is being done, work is done when a force causes

3804
05:58:44,580 --> 05:58:45,580
motion.

3805
05:58:45,580 --> 05:58:49,620
How many of you here pay money on a monthly basis to the power company?

3806
05:58:49,620 --> 05:58:51,180
Why are they called the power company?

3807
05:58:51,180 --> 05:58:54,740
All they're really providing us with is voltage, you know who the power company is?

3808
05:58:54,740 --> 05:58:55,740
It's you.

3809
05:58:55,740 --> 05:58:59,740
It's to take money out of our wall, it's exactly.

3810
05:58:59,740 --> 05:59:00,740
Who's the power company?

3811
05:59:00,740 --> 05:59:04,820
You're actually the power company, you're providing the current path if you will for

3812
05:59:04,820 --> 05:59:05,940
the current to flow.

3813
05:59:05,940 --> 05:59:07,900
They're just providing you with the voltage.

3814
05:59:07,900 --> 05:59:10,980
They should be called the voltage company, okay?

3815
05:59:10,980 --> 05:59:13,300
I mean realistically, that's all they're doing.

3816
05:59:13,300 --> 05:59:18,100
When you pay for electrical service to your home, all they're providing you with is a

3817
05:59:18,100 --> 05:59:22,020
voltage, a electrical pressure at your box.

3818
05:59:22,020 --> 05:59:26,020
It's up to you to hit the breakers, turn the circuits on, turn your lamps on, turn your

3819
05:59:26,020 --> 05:59:28,580
appliances on, turn your loads on.

3820
05:59:28,580 --> 05:59:33,500
That gives current a path to flow, now you're consuming power, power company.

3821
05:59:33,740 --> 05:59:37,580
I always, you know, I see, I take this stuff to literal, which is one of the reasons that

3822
05:59:37,580 --> 05:59:39,980
I'm here and you're there, okay?

3823
05:59:39,980 --> 05:59:42,180
But it just doesn't make sense, does it?

3824
05:59:42,180 --> 05:59:43,180
It really doesn't.

3825
05:59:43,180 --> 05:59:48,620
Now the power company, the voltage company, charges you in watts.

3826
05:59:48,620 --> 05:59:56,340
Actually, the power company charges you in what are called kilowatt hours, kilowatt hours.

3827
05:59:56,340 --> 05:59:58,100
I'll talk about more of that in a second.

3828
05:59:58,100 --> 05:59:59,100
Measure in watts.

3829
05:59:59,100 --> 06:00:05,420
Wattage is greater when work is done in a short period of time than when the same amount

3830
06:00:05,420 --> 06:00:11,620
of work is done in a longer period of time.

3831
06:00:11,620 --> 06:00:16,740
Wattage is greater when work is done in a short period of time than when the same amount

3832
06:00:16,740 --> 06:00:20,900
of work is done in a longer period of time, right?

3833
06:00:20,900 --> 06:00:26,900
A mild example of this, it's an area of I enjoy motorsports in general, I enjoy mechanical

3834
06:00:26,940 --> 06:00:28,580
things, you know?

3835
06:00:28,580 --> 06:00:33,900
No offense to any of you here that are into any of the fine arts, but if I had a chance

3836
06:00:33,900 --> 06:00:41,140
on a Sunday afternoon of going to the opera, which I've attended, the opera, the symphony

3837
06:00:41,140 --> 06:00:47,900
orchestra, musicals, plays, not a big musical guy, no offense, but it's not how I roll,

3838
06:00:47,900 --> 06:00:52,460
or going down a bowing field and standing at the edge of the fence and watching the

3839
06:00:52,460 --> 06:00:54,020
heavy metal takeoff, okay?

3840
06:00:54,020 --> 06:00:56,820
I'd probably be down a bowing field, it's just how I roll.

3841
06:00:56,820 --> 06:00:59,700
So I've always been a big advocate of motorsports.

3842
06:00:59,700 --> 06:01:05,180
One area of motorsports that I never was really that intrigued with, I respect it, but I'm

3843
06:01:05,180 --> 06:01:11,540
not that intrigued with pursuing it, is drag racing, but I respect it immensely.

3844
06:01:11,540 --> 06:01:17,860
Drag racing is about getting as much end power out of the engine and coupling it to the wheels

3845
06:01:17,860 --> 06:01:24,180
and getting the car down the track, a quarter mile track as quickly as you possibly can.

3846
06:01:24,180 --> 06:01:28,180
If any of you have ever watched drag racing, I mean some of the rockets, rockets, strap

3847
06:01:28,180 --> 06:01:32,820
yourself in, go pow wow, quarter mile, you know, a matter of seconds and they're down

3848
06:01:32,820 --> 06:01:34,420
that quarter mile track.

3849
06:01:34,420 --> 06:01:39,820
I've always been, I've enjoyed NASCAR racing and Formula One is just, Formula One for me

3850
06:01:39,820 --> 06:01:44,700
is, because they not only go down the track that fast, but they turn around and come back

3851
06:01:44,700 --> 06:01:48,420
and they make some turns in between, so that's really amazing technology.

3852
06:01:48,420 --> 06:01:53,500
But, follow what I'm saying, drag racing takes all of that power, couples it to the

3853
06:01:53,500 --> 06:01:57,540
wheels, the tires, traction, and accelerates, okay?

3854
06:01:57,540 --> 06:02:01,300
So they're consuming a huge amount of power and converting it into energy to get down

3855
06:02:01,300 --> 06:02:02,300
the track.

3856
06:02:02,300 --> 06:02:07,300
Would that be the same concept if you had a car that did 45 miles in one hour, versus

3857
06:02:07,300 --> 06:02:12,300
a car that did 80 miles in one hour, and you would be consuming more power in the amount

3858
06:02:12,300 --> 06:02:14,820
of an hour, would you get there faster?

3859
06:02:14,820 --> 06:02:15,820
Absolutely.

3860
06:02:15,820 --> 06:02:16,820
Yep.

3861
06:02:16,820 --> 06:02:20,940
And to get that work done in a shorter period of time, it's going to take you more power.

3862
06:02:20,940 --> 06:02:23,900
So that's one of the reasons that, you know, with gas prices going up, getting off that

3863
06:02:23,900 --> 06:02:28,380
pedal, it does make a difference, it does make a difference.

3864
06:02:28,380 --> 06:02:34,300
The epitome for me, and it's a toss-up, it's a toss-up, NASCAR was involved in both of

3865
06:02:34,300 --> 06:02:35,300
them, right?

3866
06:02:35,300 --> 06:02:36,300
Space Shuttle.

3867
06:02:36,300 --> 06:02:41,420
Space Shuttle, or old, kicking at old school, NASCAR, the Saturn V rockets.

3868
06:02:41,420 --> 06:02:47,780
Saturn V rockets, a little tiny capsule up on the top, big, huge freaking rocket, okay?

3869
06:02:47,780 --> 06:02:48,780
Light it.

3870
06:02:48,780 --> 06:02:51,380
The dude that lights it, lights it, and then goes like three miles away and goes into a

3871
06:02:51,380 --> 06:02:53,820
concrete bunker, okay?

3872
06:02:53,820 --> 06:02:57,060
And then literally with the Space Shuttle, it's the same thing, they light it, and then

3873
06:02:57,060 --> 06:03:01,020
they like run three miles away, and you know, that thing goes off, right?

3874
06:03:01,020 --> 06:03:04,060
Seven minutes later, they're in outer space.

3875
06:03:04,060 --> 06:03:05,900
Seven minutes later, they're in outer space.

3876
06:03:05,900 --> 06:03:10,620
NASA throws power at the problem to get the Space Shuttle into orbit, okay?

3877
06:03:10,620 --> 06:03:15,380
So obviously we're talking about, if NASA could meter out that power, you know, you

3878
06:03:15,380 --> 06:03:19,020
could probably light several cities for a good deal of time.

3879
06:03:19,020 --> 06:03:24,340
Instead, they say, how can we get that power and concentrate it in liquid fuels, solid

3880
06:03:24,340 --> 06:03:29,260
rocket boosters, and then be able to concentrate that energy so we could get that Space Shuttle,

3881
06:03:29,260 --> 06:03:34,180
which is freaking huge, it's a big thing, into outer space in seven minutes.

3882
06:03:34,180 --> 06:03:38,980
Not eight minutes, not nine minutes, but it's seven minutes, they're in orbit.

3883
06:03:38,980 --> 06:03:39,980
Tremendous amount of power.

3884
06:03:39,980 --> 06:03:42,340
Have any of you here ever seen a Space Shuttle launch?

3885
06:03:43,340 --> 06:03:49,060
Yeah, I had the opportunity back in the 80s, I actually saw the Challenger, fortunately

3886
06:03:49,060 --> 06:03:54,580
not the time that it had its malfunction, I saw it before that, and actually ironically

3887
06:03:54,580 --> 06:04:00,940
Dick Scobey, who's from Auburn, Washington, I saw a mission that he flew prior to the

3888
06:04:00,940 --> 06:04:07,140
catastrophic accident that they had, but I was in Titusville, Florida, and you're listening

3889
06:04:07,140 --> 06:04:11,660
to the radio and you hear the countdown and everything, three, two, one, and you know,

3890
06:04:11,660 --> 06:04:16,180
I don't know how many miles away you are, like 10 miles, 12 miles, you know, you see

3891
06:04:16,180 --> 06:04:22,300
it going up, going up, and then all of a sudden the wall of sound hits you, and it's just

3892
06:04:22,300 --> 06:04:27,660
a sound like I've never heard before, it's like, wow, that is freaking cool, you know,

3893
06:04:27,660 --> 06:04:31,540
the next thing, you know, it's gone, man, it's in orbit, they're in orbit, over and

3894
06:04:31,540 --> 06:04:36,340
around the Earth, tremendous amount of power, okay, so the same thing with electronics, same

3895
06:04:36,340 --> 06:04:40,900
thing with electronics, the more power we throw at something, the more work we can do,

3896
06:04:40,900 --> 06:04:45,420
so you know, basically, you know, if you're attending a concert, you know, the Pink Floyd

3897
06:04:45,420 --> 06:04:52,100
Orchestra is performing in an auditorium, they are going to have to throw a lot of voltage

3898
06:04:52,100 --> 06:04:57,700
and current at the problem to create a lot of acoustic energy to satisfy the masses, because

3899
06:04:57,700 --> 06:05:06,340
that's what we've all grown accustomed to, is loud music, right, okay, what is the basic

3900
06:05:06,340 --> 06:05:15,060
unit of power? That is not a question, it's a statement, what, what is the basic unit

3901
06:05:15,060 --> 06:05:25,460
of power? It is literally equal to the voltage across a circuit multiplied by the current

3902
06:05:25,460 --> 06:05:38,900
through the circuit, it represents the rate at which work is being done, and what is the

3903
06:05:38,900 --> 06:05:46,300
guy that came up with it, and what he said, I think he gave this presentation down at

3904
06:05:46,300 --> 06:05:55,580
the King Dome back in the day, 45,000 people, Ohm gave his spiel, right, remember that,

3905
06:05:55,580 --> 06:06:02,660
V, V, V is equal to I, I, I times R, R, R, R, right, that was Ohm's deal, Watt got up

3906
06:06:02,660 --> 06:06:10,260
there not to be outdone, and he said P, P, P is equal to I, I, I times V, V, V, and that's

3907
06:06:10,260 --> 06:06:33,660
what he said, that's what he said, so again, P, I, V, triangle with a T in the center,

3908
06:06:33,660 --> 06:06:37,940
power is equal to voltage times current, if I ask you how much voltage is there, and you

3909
06:06:37,940 --> 06:06:42,660
know how much power there is, right, in current, then you can calculate out the voltage, if

3910
06:06:42,660 --> 06:06:46,580
I ask you how much current is there, if you know the power and the voltage, you can calculate

3911
06:06:46,580 --> 06:06:52,340
out the current, and of course power, current times voltage, that's all your variables,

3912
06:06:52,340 --> 06:06:59,220
simple math, and this is called Watt's law, Watt's law, so so far, for those of you at

3913
06:06:59,220 --> 06:07:04,180
home keeping track of what's going down, we've gone over Ohm's law, we've talked about Kirchoff's

3914
06:07:04,180 --> 06:07:08,780
law and this is Watt's law, these are laws of physics, they allow us to calculate what's

3915
06:07:08,780 --> 06:07:14,180
going to take place with 100% accuracy, very, very useful tools, we're not teaching you

3916
06:07:14,180 --> 06:07:17,580
this stuff because I got nothing better to do with my time, we're teaching you this stuff

3917
06:07:17,580 --> 06:07:23,420
because this becomes very valuable for an electronics technician, paints a picture, tells

3918
06:07:23,420 --> 06:07:31,140
you what's going on, literally tells you what's going on, okay, a little known fact about

3919
06:07:31,140 --> 06:07:38,220
yours truly, I used to work in radio, okay, I worked on the air, I was on the air personality

3920
06:07:38,220 --> 06:07:42,820
for an AM radio station in Connecticut, and it was one of the things that got me interested

3921
06:07:42,820 --> 06:07:48,220
in electronics, because I worked kind of hard and I didn't have a whole lot of job security,

3922
06:07:48,220 --> 06:07:55,460
there was a guy at the station, the chief engineer, this guy, every year he'd buy a formula

3923
06:07:55,460 --> 06:08:00,180
firebird, trade in the old one, get a new formula firebird, and he always kind of had

3924
06:08:00,180 --> 06:08:04,900
a girlfriend with him that was kind of had it going on, if you know what I mean, okay,

3925
06:08:04,900 --> 06:08:10,420
and he did very little, he came every week to the station and he'd get all of the readings

3926
06:08:10,420 --> 06:08:14,420
that all the on the air people took from the transmitter, we were able to take the readings

3927
06:08:14,420 --> 06:08:20,420
from the transmitter remotely, but we had to log in these voltages and these currents,

3928
06:08:20,420 --> 06:08:25,940
and then he would come, he'd come with a calculator much like this, okay, and he'd sit there and

3929
06:08:25,940 --> 06:08:31,260
he'd perform these calculations all the way down, and then he'd sign the logs, take them,

3930
06:08:31,260 --> 06:08:35,580
stick them in a folder, and then they'd be held by the station.

3931
06:08:35,580 --> 06:08:42,780
What he was doing is that the station, commercial station, was licensed by the Federal Communications

3932
06:08:42,780 --> 06:08:48,340
Commission to only broadcast so much power, and the proof of how much power was being

3933
06:08:48,340 --> 06:08:55,540
transmitted was the voltage of the final transmitter tube, the current flowing to that transmitter

3934
06:08:55,540 --> 06:08:59,700
tube, if you knew those two you could calculate out the power, and then there was approved

3935
06:08:59,700 --> 06:09:05,620
engineering design criteria for the antenna system, that the antenna system had certain

3936
06:09:05,620 --> 06:09:11,540
number of losses, so you could prove to the FCC, you see, we were not broadcasting more

3937
06:09:11,540 --> 06:09:17,380
power than we were allotted, we were not interfering with that station in Pennsylvania, okay, we

3938
06:09:17,380 --> 06:09:21,460
couldn't have been, because we're only broadcasting out what you've allowed us to broadcast out,

3939
06:09:21,460 --> 06:09:27,260
so it was a technician calculating this out through the current and voltage readings that

3940
06:09:27,260 --> 06:09:32,460
I think it was every four hours we had to take, every four hours on the air personnel,

3941
06:09:32,460 --> 06:09:35,940
and it was right there in the studio, it was an equipment rack and you could go and just

3942
06:09:35,940 --> 06:09:41,180
sequence through, you know, and take the voltage readings, the current readings, and log those

3943
06:09:41,180 --> 06:09:51,060
in and that became part of the permanent record, so it was kind of funny, it really was inspirational

3944
06:09:51,060 --> 06:09:55,700
for me seeing this guy as the chief engineer, he was a chief engineer and he was assigned

3945
06:09:55,700 --> 06:10:01,300
several radio stations in Connecticut on contract, the guy made really good money, you know,

3946
06:10:01,300 --> 06:10:06,860
and I'm like how do I get his job, well you need an FCC license, you know, basically the

3947
06:10:06,860 --> 06:10:11,460
general radio operators license to be able to maintain a commercial radio station like

3948
06:10:11,460 --> 06:10:17,580
that, so anyway, I'm an examiner now for the FCC and I give that exam and I've never in

3949
06:10:17,580 --> 06:10:22,940
my life owned a Formula Firebird, so I have had some girlfriends that kind of had it going

3950
06:10:22,940 --> 06:10:30,740
on if you know what I mean, until it hits the fan, until the station gets hit by lightning,

3951
06:10:30,740 --> 06:10:35,740
okay, and then it's like oh, and then you got the general manager, right, the program

3952
06:10:35,740 --> 06:10:41,100
director, and all of that advertising dollars that were spent, right, you're losing that

3953
06:10:41,100 --> 06:10:45,860
money because the station is off the air and that's how stations pay the bills is all the

3954
06:10:45,900 --> 06:10:49,980
advertising, so when you're off the air, you're in a pickle, people will tune to another station

3955
06:10:49,980 --> 06:10:55,660
or whatever, so it's kind of a big deal, ironically though, kind of behind the scene story like

3956
06:10:55,660 --> 06:11:03,340
here, we had a woman in our program that completed this program and I got her an internship, she

3957
06:11:03,340 --> 06:11:12,020
interned for a period of time at KISW and the engineer at the time over there, Brian, he hadn't

3958
06:11:12,060 --> 06:11:16,820
had a vacation for three years because again, as a chief engineer, you just don't go on vacation,

3959
06:11:16,820 --> 06:11:22,580
yeah, I'm taking my vacation next week, you know, you can't do that because if the station goes

3960
06:11:22,580 --> 06:11:27,300
off the air, who's gonna, you know, so for the, there was nobody, nobody that he could hand the

3961
06:11:27,300 --> 06:11:33,820
station over to, once she got in there and she built up some credibility, he actually went

3962
06:11:33,820 --> 06:11:39,180
on vacation and gave her the keys and it's kind of like hey, you've got it, so you've got the

3963
06:11:39,180 --> 06:11:43,580
station, she was a student here at Lake Washington Technical College, she was the acting chief

3964
06:11:43,580 --> 06:11:51,420
engineer for KISW, also, also because all these engineers and all the radio stations, they're

3965
06:11:51,420 --> 06:11:55,940
all in cahoots with each other, okay, so if the station goes off the air, you know, call Tony

3966
06:11:55,940 --> 06:12:00,340
over at Cairo, he'll come over and help you out, you know, you've got all these engineers that will

3967
06:12:00,340 --> 06:12:04,740
lend a hand, even though you're the competition on paper, if I need something, you'll help me out,

3968
06:12:04,740 --> 06:12:08,780
if you need something, I'll help you out and it kind of goes, it's a, you know, unwritten law,

3969
06:12:08,780 --> 06:12:15,540
if you will, and radio to help everybody else out, so kind of exciting. So anyway, this power

3970
06:12:15,540 --> 06:12:20,900
reading is very, very critical, so that you could tell the performance of your equipment and it's

3971
06:12:20,900 --> 06:12:24,940
something that, if any of you go into commercial broadcasting, you're gonna be doing the exact

3972
06:12:24,940 --> 06:12:28,700
same thing, taking those power readings, how much energy are we, are we getting off the antenna,

3973
06:12:28,700 --> 06:12:32,300
the only way to tell them is how much voltage you got, how much current you got, you got going,

3974
06:12:32,300 --> 06:12:36,860
same thing, you come from an audio car, car audio background, same thing, you got a thousand watt

3975
06:12:36,860 --> 06:12:44,260
amplifier, it's a math problem, okay, 1000 watts, you know what this is, okay, 12.6 volts DC, you

3976
06:12:44,260 --> 06:12:48,540
know what this is, well, this is gonna tell you how much current it is, it's a math problem, you

3977
06:12:48,540 --> 06:12:53,420
know, now it's a thousand watt amplifier, that's peak performance, and how often you're gonna be

3978
06:12:53,420 --> 06:12:58,340
cranking out that peak performance, but you've got to design everything backwards to make sure that

3979
06:12:58,340 --> 06:13:03,860
if you crank it up all the way, you're not gonna cause an electrical fire, it's a good meltdown,

3980
06:13:03,860 --> 06:13:09,380
so you've got to design, and it all integrates, really it's a beautiful thing. Now the electric

3981
06:13:09,380 --> 06:13:18,420
company, the electric company, the voltage company, they charge you, they charge you for kilowatt

3982
06:13:18,420 --> 06:13:28,820
hours, kilowatt hours, that's a thousand watts, a kilowatt, right, per hour, so that you consuming

3983
06:13:28,820 --> 06:13:34,660
a thousand watts over an hour, okay, I don't know if any of you go to the gymnasium periodically,

3984
06:13:34,660 --> 06:13:41,060
the gym workout, some of the life cycles, stair steppers, these things, some of them have integrated

3985
06:13:41,060 --> 06:13:47,300
in calories that you're consuming, some of them have a screen that you can go to for watts, okay,

3986
06:13:47,700 --> 06:13:52,660
so I often thought I hate working out, I really do, it just, I'm not afraid of hard work, okay,

3987
06:13:52,660 --> 06:13:56,980
if I got to dig a ditch in the backyard, I love doing it, you know, I'm all about hard work, but

3988
06:13:56,980 --> 06:14:04,340
going to the gym and like, you know, for an hour just doesn't make sense, at least put the thing

3989
06:14:04,340 --> 06:14:09,540
up to a generator, let me charge my cell phone or something, and you know, let me save a nickel or

3990
06:14:09,540 --> 06:14:14,020
something, if you know, that makes more sense to me, but anyway, somebody's screens have watts,

3991
06:14:14,020 --> 06:14:20,820
and if any of you have ever done that, how hard you have to work to generate a watt, I mean,

3992
06:14:20,820 --> 06:14:27,700
it's amazing, so the electric company, the voltage company is selling us a thousand watts

3993
06:14:27,700 --> 06:14:33,380
per hour, that's the unit of measure that they charge us, okay, so anybody know off the top of

3994
06:14:33,380 --> 06:14:37,780
their head about what we're being charged here in the greater Seattle area, a kilowatt hour,

3995
06:14:37,780 --> 06:14:44,340
zzz, wait, you're being ripped off, man, that's, that's chronic power and light,

3996
06:14:46,420 --> 06:14:51,460
about eight cents, about eight cents, some of you, depending on your, on your, your scale,

3997
06:14:51,460 --> 06:14:57,300
six and a half cents, seven cents per kilowatt hour, which is the thing that I kind of struggle with,

3998
06:14:58,340 --> 06:15:07,140
I go, this year alone, since January, I got invited to attend a green energy conference,

3999
06:15:07,140 --> 06:15:12,820
good jobs, green jobs in Washington DC, and then I was invited to be a guest speaker in Milwaukee

4000
06:15:12,820 --> 06:15:18,980
at the green summit, so I, I'm some world-class speakers I get to be in the presence of, so I

4001
06:15:18,980 --> 06:15:22,980
go to this like green summit in Milwaukee, and I get seriously jazzed, you know, like, yeah, I'm

4002
06:15:22,980 --> 06:15:27,940
going to go home and I'm going to do an energy audit, I'm going to see, I'm going to get home,

4003
06:15:29,220 --> 06:15:34,820
lost them six and a half cents per kilowatt hour, you know, how much effort do I have to put into

4004
06:15:34,820 --> 06:15:39,220
really saving, and how much am I going to save, it really doesn't make sense, I mean, it really

4005
06:15:39,220 --> 06:15:44,980
doesn't, there needs to be consumer incentive for you to, to really hunker down and save,

4006
06:15:44,980 --> 06:15:49,700
because electricity here in the Northwest is very, very inexpensive, and that's a good thing,

4007
06:15:49,700 --> 06:15:55,540
I'm not complaining about it, you know, and there are some things that you could do to save,

4008
06:15:55,540 --> 06:15:59,380
save energy, but there's only so much that you could do, and we're really not paying that much

4009
06:15:59,380 --> 06:16:06,260
for it, even like with electric cars, I know my colleague did some of the math with purely

4010
06:16:07,220 --> 06:16:13,220
electric cars that we're coming out with, and really it equates for the price of gas at four

4011
06:16:13,220 --> 06:16:20,340
bucks a gallon, it comes out to being that it's about 99 miles per gallon that you would get,

4012
06:16:20,340 --> 06:16:27,220
equivalent to travel, travel 99 miles, then it would cost you to do that for that fill up,

4013
06:16:27,300 --> 06:16:31,060
and that's what about what it equates to when you're paying six and a half seven cents per

4014
06:16:31,060 --> 06:16:35,300
kilowatt hour, which is bad, you know, I wouldn't mind having a car that got 99 miles per gallon,

4015
06:16:35,300 --> 06:16:42,420
100 miles per gallon, but is it worth the investment of me scrapping my, you know, my V8,

4016
06:16:43,140 --> 06:16:48,100
I mean, because I don't, unless I'm having, unless I'm driving a Tesla, which is out of my range,

4017
06:16:48,100 --> 06:16:53,540
you know, I don't think, I like that V8, you know, V8 Taurus, pour some fuel into the situation,

4018
06:16:53,540 --> 06:16:59,220
a little bit of air, get out of the freeway, set the pace, I keep up with the flow of traffic,

4019
06:16:59,220 --> 06:17:04,340
set the pace, and I have documentation, watching the state control of a little Tesla at math, okay.

4020
06:17:11,060 --> 06:17:16,100
So, good analysis to determine the power dissipated by a component of voltage,

4021
06:17:16,100 --> 06:17:22,500
drop, and time, so I'm talking about for a component now, okay, this works for loads,

4022
06:17:22,580 --> 06:17:26,820
this works for like an amplifier, if you've got an electric load, an amplifier, a transmitter,

4023
06:17:26,820 --> 06:17:32,980
you could do this, but this also works for individual components, so if you know how much

4024
06:17:32,980 --> 06:17:35,940
current's going through the component, and you know the voltage across the component,

4025
06:17:35,940 --> 06:17:43,300
then you could figure out exactly how much energy that component is dissipating. Now, remember resistors,

4026
06:17:45,620 --> 06:17:50,500
remember resistors, resistors are devices designed to possess the property of resistance,

4027
06:17:50,500 --> 06:17:56,820
resistance is that force which opposes the flow of electrons, the byproduct of resistance,

4028
06:17:56,820 --> 06:18:03,220
when current encounters resistance, it generates heat, that's how we determine the power of that

4029
06:18:03,220 --> 06:18:08,020
resistor, because all resistors are not created equal, there's ath watt resistors,

4030
06:18:08,020 --> 06:18:12,260
quarter watt resistors, half watt resistors, one watt resistors, five watt resistors,

4031
06:18:12,260 --> 06:18:17,540
how much energy could they dissipate, and literally, literally it's the voltage across the component,

4032
06:18:17,540 --> 06:18:21,940
times the current going through the component, that's going to give you that power that's being

4033
06:18:21,940 --> 06:18:29,140
consumed by it. If a resistor, if you ask too much of a resistor, it will fry, it will fail,

4034
06:18:30,020 --> 06:18:36,340
if you exceed its rated capability, so all electronic components are really like that,

4035
06:18:36,340 --> 06:18:40,660
you know the voltage, you know the current, we're going to talk about some exceptions in the future,

4036
06:18:41,380 --> 06:18:45,620
they're not resistive components, they're called reactive components, that'll come later this

4037
06:18:45,700 --> 06:18:50,580
quarter, we'll talk about that, and that they don't, these are components that don't consume

4038
06:18:50,580 --> 06:18:56,980
energy in the form of heat, that's why they're called reactive, but something we'll talk about

4039
06:18:56,980 --> 06:19:03,540
in the future. Hey, the neat thing with power, power dissipated in series or parallel is equal to

4040
06:19:03,540 --> 06:19:09,140
the sum of the power dissipated by the individual components, power is always additive, it doesn't

4041
06:19:09,140 --> 06:19:15,780
matter if it's series or parallel or whatever, power is always additive, I've got a 400 horsepower

4042
06:19:15,780 --> 06:19:23,220
engine on my airplane, and I remove it and get another 400 horsepower engine amount, each engine

4043
06:19:23,220 --> 06:19:29,540
on each wing, now 400 times two is up to 800 horsepower worth of power, as were before in a

4044
06:19:29,540 --> 06:19:36,820
single engine aircraft, that was only up to 400 horsepower, okay, it's kind of funny, I know a

4045
06:19:36,820 --> 06:19:41,300
little bit about airplanes, but the odd thing about airplanes is when you do that, instead of the

4046
06:19:41,300 --> 06:19:47,140
airplane costing twice as much, it ends up usually costing you about three times as much,

4047
06:19:47,140 --> 06:19:50,980
so for a twin-engine airplane you're going to pay through the nose, you know, much higher performance,

4048
06:19:50,980 --> 06:19:58,340
a lot more going on with it, a lot more structural that they have to do, but power is always additive,

4049
06:19:59,060 --> 06:20:02,020
that's why the space shuttle, right, solid rocket boosters on the space shuttle,

4050
06:20:02,740 --> 06:20:08,260
all right, they have two, you know how much power that is, twice as much as one, okay,

4051
06:20:08,260 --> 06:20:12,740
that's why they put two of them up, and actually from what I understand, I think the space shuttle

4052
06:20:12,740 --> 06:20:17,380
can, I don't know if it could get a shallow orbit, if it's just on one solid rocket booster

4053
06:20:18,020 --> 06:20:21,300
or not, but those things are literally like Roman candles, once they light up they're going for a

4054
06:20:21,300 --> 06:20:27,140
ride, there's no shutting them down, uh-oh, we changed our mind, let's back it back to the pad now,

4055
06:20:27,140 --> 06:20:33,380
you're going for a ride, power, so power is always additive, always additive,

4056
06:20:33,380 --> 06:20:39,380
this is the thing like with your home, forget about what is energy conservation, a bunch of

4057
06:20:40,340 --> 06:20:46,660
your home, every device that is on in your home right now that has a voltage across it

4058
06:20:46,660 --> 06:20:52,900
and current flowing through it is consuming power, okay, there's a lot of phantom loads in your home,

4059
06:20:52,900 --> 06:20:59,380
stuff that's plugged in but it ain't turned on, but it's still consuming power, why? You got voltage

4060
06:20:59,380 --> 06:21:05,060
across it, it's got a current flowing through it, you're plugged in, how many have a nice flat

4061
06:21:05,060 --> 06:21:10,340
screen TV at home, right, how many have it, is it turned on right now, do you leave it on 24-7

4062
06:21:10,340 --> 06:21:16,340
or is it turned off, still consuming power, still consuming power, so that way when you go home and

4063
06:21:16,340 --> 06:21:20,980
hit that remote, pow, that screen comes right up, if not there'd have to be a period of time with

4064
06:21:20,980 --> 06:21:26,820
some electronics for it to warm up, come up, everybody wants instant gratification with systems,

4065
06:21:26,820 --> 06:21:30,980
especially somebody old tube systems, right, those really consume a lot, you had to wait for the tubes

4066
06:21:30,980 --> 06:21:36,740
to heat up and everything, but most electronics are really in a standby mode, your battery charger

4067
06:21:36,740 --> 06:21:40,100
right now, your cell phone charger at home, if it's plugged in the wall and it's not plugged

4068
06:21:40,100 --> 06:21:44,020
into your cell phone, it's still consuming some energy because it's got current flowing through

4069
06:21:44,020 --> 06:21:52,260
a coil there, when you plug in your phone, it consumes more current, right, so a lot of these

4070
06:21:52,260 --> 06:21:57,700
again are phantom loads that exist at your home, you're consuming energy, real small amount, real

4071
06:21:57,700 --> 06:22:05,940
small amount, it all adds up, it all adds up, you know, as you want to things that give you a sales pitch

4072
06:22:05,940 --> 06:22:11,220
for tomorrow's meeting, right, you can watch a documentary called Power Search, that was just on

4073
06:22:11,220 --> 06:22:17,540
on public television, there's a talk a lot about that, you know, it all adds up, it's all about

4074
06:22:17,540 --> 06:22:31,060
power, you know, I didn't hear about her, did she save money early, huh, I'm not gonna do that,

4075
06:22:32,180 --> 06:22:36,420
all my plugs are like behind the couch and crown, I'm gonna climb back there, it's all the power

4076
06:22:36,420 --> 06:22:42,340
stripper that on off, you know, that's it, in all honesty, that actually I thought about that,

4077
06:22:42,340 --> 06:22:47,700
you know, my wife and I travel a lot and we, you know, we go away and really would make sense,

4078
06:22:47,700 --> 06:22:53,380
just shut off that main breaker of the house, you know, leave for a month, come back and then,

4079
06:22:53,380 --> 06:22:57,140
you know, you go get your electric bill, they still charge you the same, you know, they're just

4080
06:22:57,140 --> 06:23:02,980
messing with you, gotta have your thucks in a row, man, you gotta pay attention to that meter, so

4081
06:23:03,700 --> 06:23:09,860
now electronics, the power dissipated in a circuit is often less than one watt,

4082
06:23:11,140 --> 06:23:15,700
electronics, microelectronics like you're studying here, typically the value is going

4083
06:23:15,700 --> 06:23:22,020
to be less than a watt, typical values will be the milli watt, this is times 10 to the negative third

4084
06:23:22,020 --> 06:23:24,740
or one-thousandth of a watt

4085
06:23:27,380 --> 06:23:32,340
and the micro watt, one million micro watts equals one watt,

4086
06:23:34,020 --> 06:23:38,580
so we're talking a millionth of a watt, that's typically what's consumed in

4087
06:23:43,860 --> 06:23:47,700
some of you are working around with amateur radio, you want to get your amateur radio license and

4088
06:23:47,700 --> 06:23:50,980
play around with some of that stuff, some of them are here for power transmitters,

4089
06:23:51,060 --> 06:23:53,780
you need to make sure you have the available current and voltage

4090
06:23:53,780 --> 06:23:58,020
signal on, you're not going to be able to do that, because again, you want to hear behind

4091
06:23:58,660 --> 06:24:04,180
why power is equal to current and voltage, so if you're on a low voltage system,

4092
06:24:06,100 --> 06:24:13,140
like a car, like a car or a boat or an airplane, and you want to start jacking this value up,

4093
06:24:13,140 --> 06:24:17,620
that means you're going to have to start using a bigger cable, a physically bigger cable,

4094
06:24:17,860 --> 06:24:23,860
you have more electrons that you're going to have to transport from the source to the load,

4095
06:24:23,860 --> 06:24:27,060
and that's what you're measuring, okay, so the math doesn't lie,

4096
06:24:28,980 --> 06:24:33,060
total power dissipated in a series or parallel circuit is equal to some of the power dissipated

4097
06:24:33,060 --> 06:24:40,500
by the individual components, meaning power is additive, power is additive, there's no such thing

4098
06:24:40,500 --> 06:24:49,300
as negative power, but this is putting power back in, you know, perpetual motion machine,

4099
06:24:49,300 --> 06:24:53,700
you get something like that going, give me a call, okay, give me a call, I have my attorney

4100
06:24:53,700 --> 06:25:00,180
contact, your attorney, and I'll personally fly you to Bimini, and you could watch the sunset

4101
06:25:00,180 --> 06:25:04,580
drinking out of a coconut with one of those screwy straws, an umbrella on the top of your drink,

4102
06:25:05,540 --> 06:25:11,940
okay, now all we do is consume voltage, we consume power, nothing puts things back in,

4103
06:25:11,940 --> 06:25:15,460
so it's not, I guess it'd be like me getting an airplane engine, you know, mounting one,

4104
06:25:15,460 --> 06:25:17,700
like going this way, and then the other end, you go this way,

4105
06:25:23,460 --> 06:25:30,020
one, yeah, one, that one, you lift off, you know, so UFO, no, it's a doofus,

4106
06:25:30,180 --> 06:25:36,820
it's a doofus, what's that guy doing? Does that make sense? All right, summary,

4107
06:25:37,700 --> 06:25:44,980
power is the rate at which energy is delivered to a circuit, power is also the rate at which

4108
06:25:44,980 --> 06:25:52,420
energy or heat is dissipated by the resistance in a circuit, this isn't, that second bullet

4109
06:25:52,420 --> 06:25:55,620
statement there isn't something we dig, it's something we got to deal with, we don't want

4110
06:25:55,620 --> 06:26:01,220
our electronic equipment to get hot, it's one of my, one of my, I got a lot of electronics in

4111
06:26:01,220 --> 06:26:07,380
my family room, got my audio, I got surround sound, I got my plasma screen, TV, I've got,

4112
06:26:07,380 --> 06:26:11,860
got all this equipment, I've got, I got several computers, I got a computer that monitors the

4113
06:26:11,860 --> 06:26:16,820
weather at my house, why, because I'm just into that kind of stuff, I got my other main computer,

4114
06:26:16,820 --> 06:26:24,100
I've got all my network gear from, for router, I got a switch that powers the other internet

4115
06:26:24,100 --> 06:26:28,660
connections in the house, got all that stuff, in the summer, that room really gets freaking warm,

4116
06:26:29,220 --> 06:26:33,860
okay, in the winter it's kind of cool, warm I mean, you know what I mean, you come in there and I got

4117
06:26:33,860 --> 06:26:37,940
all this electronic stuff that's keeping that warm, really heavy and temperate, but you know,

4118
06:26:37,940 --> 06:26:41,940
was it last year, two years ago, we had the heat wave, it was like, holy cow man, I had to start

4119
06:26:41,940 --> 06:26:45,940
shutting stuff down, I'm like, you know how important it is to start shutting stuff down,

4120
06:26:45,940 --> 06:26:50,100
so I don't have a Wi-Fi system in the house, not that that generates that much heat, but

4121
06:26:50,100 --> 06:26:55,780
everything else in there does generate the heat, we don't want that, we don't want that,

4122
06:26:55,780 --> 06:27:01,220
it's something we have to live with, so a lot of times when equipment is densely packed,

4123
06:27:01,220 --> 06:27:07,540
that thermal profile tells us what's going on, former member of our advisory committee here

4124
06:27:07,540 --> 06:27:12,820
at Lake Washington Technical College was the chief engineer for Channel 9 out of Seattle,

4125
06:27:13,540 --> 06:27:17,780
and we went down there for a tour one day, their transmitter is located up on Capitol Hill,

4126
06:27:18,740 --> 06:27:25,860
and he was showing me the air inlet temperature and then the exhaust temperature, right, the air

4127
06:27:25,860 --> 06:27:30,180
that they're sucking in to run through the transmitter to Kula, and by looking at that,

4128
06:27:30,180 --> 06:27:35,380
you know, this is the inlet air temperature, this is the exhaust, by looking at that difference,

4129
06:27:35,380 --> 06:27:39,860
obviously if it's a warmer day, they go up like this, right, I mean it is what it is,

4130
06:27:40,580 --> 06:27:45,620
by him looking at that, okay, if this stay stationary and then this one goes up,

4131
06:27:45,620 --> 06:27:52,580
it immediately tells him what, the transmitter is consuming more power, that means there's a problem,

4132
06:27:52,580 --> 06:27:56,500
because when it was brand spanking new, this is what it was, this is the inlet,

4133
06:27:56,500 --> 06:27:59,860
that the difference between the two is a critical number, temperature,

4134
06:28:00,660 --> 06:28:03,780
you raise the temperature, shows you something's not operating efficiently,

4135
06:28:04,980 --> 06:28:09,140
plain and simple, one of the tricks, because I paid attention, I'm not that smart of a guy,

4136
06:28:09,140 --> 06:28:13,300
but I did pay attention when I was in school, formal schooling like this, one of the things

4137
06:28:13,300 --> 06:28:23,460
that I used to do is when I was in the Navy, we had very, very complex circuits, and there was

4138
06:28:23,460 --> 06:28:30,900
this one board that had memory chips on it, and it used to fail, and running the diagnostics to

4139
06:28:30,900 --> 06:28:37,460
determine which chip it was was just very, very laborious, and I've always kind of been a lazy

4140
06:28:37,460 --> 06:28:43,460
guy, and I'm like, you know, there's got to be an easier way of doing this, you know, so what I did

4141
06:28:43,460 --> 06:28:48,660
one day is just for giggles, and then we had to figure out what it was, I put it back in,

4142
06:28:48,660 --> 06:28:52,820
it fired the whole system up, right, and then immediately shut the thing down, pulled the

4143
06:28:52,820 --> 06:29:00,420
circuit card out, right, and I started going across the chips, got to the hot chip, and guess

4144
06:29:00,420 --> 06:29:06,740
which chip was the hot chip, the fail component, so anyway, it was kind of funny, my colleagues

4145
06:29:06,740 --> 06:29:11,140
thought like I was like into, you know, black magic, and like voodoo, and you know, because

4146
06:29:11,140 --> 06:29:15,620
there'd be a problem with the chip, and then I'm like, okay, you know, I'll figure out which one

4147
06:29:15,620 --> 06:29:19,620
it is, but you're all gonna have to leave, okay, and I actually started doing, I hit a little mojo

4148
06:29:19,620 --> 06:29:24,180
bag with some bones in it, and a crow's foot, and I played the whole thing up, you know, and we'd

4149
06:29:24,180 --> 06:29:29,540
shut the thing down, I'd come out, U44, I was like, how the heck did you do that? I was looking at

4150
06:29:29,540 --> 06:29:34,020
which chip was getting hot, the one that gets hot is the one that failed, and it's generating more

4151
06:29:34,020 --> 06:29:38,260
heat, and that's what the problem is, so you could really determine, use this trouble shooting tool

4152
06:29:38,260 --> 06:29:42,900
later on, if something's getting hot, and if you know what the norm is, beyond that, now they've

4153
06:29:42,900 --> 06:29:51,700
got stuff on the market, they've got thermal imaging, power company, actually uses thermal imaging,

4154
06:29:51,700 --> 06:29:55,620
they'll go ahead with the thermal imaging gun and look at their power runs, and where two wires

4155
06:29:55,620 --> 06:29:59,620
are joined together, if it starts to generate a lot of heat, they know there's a problem up there,

4156
06:29:59,620 --> 06:30:04,420
okay, because if it's generating heat, that shows that that connection has too much

4157
06:30:05,700 --> 06:30:11,780
resistance, because resistance generates heat, so you could analyze, you know, with thermal

4158
06:30:11,780 --> 06:30:16,660
imaging, really see a picture of physically what's working, what's not working, so that's an advance

4159
06:30:16,660 --> 06:30:22,580
that's taking place really, within the past decade, thermal imaging now is pretty much mainstream,

4160
06:30:22,580 --> 06:30:28,340
you know, it's not that, heck, you could get a non-contact infrared, you could get one

4161
06:30:29,940 --> 06:30:36,420
Harbor Freight tools, you know, from 1995 to later, and that would have shown you what, you know what

4162
06:30:36,420 --> 06:30:41,460
I mean, I had used to burn my fingertips finding the hot chip, okay, now you could just use one of

4163
06:30:41,460 --> 06:30:46,100
those and say, oh yeah, this chip is hotter than all the others that are doing the exact same job,

4164
06:30:46,900 --> 06:30:52,660
where the failure is, power is measured in watts, watts is what power is measured in, it's not a

4165
06:30:52,660 --> 06:30:59,540
question, it's a statement, power is literally the product of current and voltage, current times

4166
06:30:59,540 --> 06:31:08,660
voltage, any questions on power, you were saying that to determine the total voltage drop, any

4167
06:31:08,660 --> 06:31:14,420
component is a different formula than what it would be to calculate power, but in the book it says

4168
06:31:15,380 --> 06:31:17,460
no, no, I'm just saying

4169
06:31:18,900 --> 06:31:25,220
how much power is being consumed across a component, you need to use that voltage drop

4170
06:31:25,220 --> 06:31:28,660
across the component, not total voltage value

4171
06:31:32,100 --> 06:31:39,700
go ahead and take a 13 minute break and we're going to start off again at 635, 635

4172
06:31:39,700 --> 06:31:51,140
chapter 8 dc the circuits, dc circuits, one of the things that you need to understand about

4173
06:31:51,140 --> 06:31:59,700
this chapter is it's the concepts that we're going after, we want you to understand the basic

4174
06:31:59,700 --> 06:32:04,820
concepts, you're not going to make a lot of money necessarily going out and working on circuits like

4175
06:32:04,820 --> 06:32:10,740
this in industry, circuits that are made up of a power source and a bunch of resistors, but what

4176
06:32:10,740 --> 06:32:20,020
this is designed to do is to show you an approach on circuit analysis, we are going to use circuits

4177
06:32:20,020 --> 06:32:27,380
that contain a bunch of resistors in industry and those resistors are going to be used to establish

4178
06:32:27,380 --> 06:32:36,260
voltage operating points around transistors or other semiconductor devices, so although you're

4179
06:32:36,260 --> 06:32:41,940
never going to go out necessarily work on circuits exactly like this you have to absolutely,

4180
06:32:41,940 --> 06:32:50,580
positively understand the steps and the competencies of circuit analysis as it pertains to dc circuits,

4181
06:32:50,580 --> 06:32:55,460
okay that goes without saying and quite frankly we've already talked about these concepts,

4182
06:32:55,460 --> 06:33:01,220
this is just the chapter where we pull it all together, after completing this chapter you're

4183
06:33:01,220 --> 06:33:08,100
going to be able to solve for all, now let me emphasize the words all, unknown values, that

4184
06:33:08,100 --> 06:33:16,020
means voltage, current, resistance, and power, all we solve for everything because if you know

4185
06:33:16,020 --> 06:33:20,740
everything I could never ask you anything that you don't know because you know everything,

4186
06:33:21,140 --> 06:33:30,660
in series circuits parallel and series parallel circuits, understand the importance of voltage

4187
06:33:30,660 --> 06:33:37,460
dividers and design and solve for all unknown values in a voltage divider circuit,

4188
06:33:39,860 --> 06:33:44,100
we are going to spend time on voltage dividers, some of the stuff I'm going to blast through,

4189
06:33:44,100 --> 06:33:48,340
but voltage dividers are something that I'm going to spend some time on the board here to make sure

4190
06:33:48,420 --> 06:33:53,860
you got a handle, it's quite frankly the book is okay but the author really drops the ball

4191
06:33:53,860 --> 06:33:57,700
with voltage dividers, he pulls a couple numbers out of the air that I still don't have a clue

4192
06:33:57,700 --> 06:34:03,620
where it comes from so I'm going to show you how to approach that, as you know a series circuit

4193
06:34:03,620 --> 06:34:09,700
is a circuit that provides only one path for current flow, the simplest example of a series

4194
06:34:09,700 --> 06:34:13,380
circuit, you ever have those holiday lights, the Christmas lights that a bulb burns out and the

4195
06:34:13,380 --> 06:34:19,700
whole string goes out, it's a series circuit, because the filament of one bulb interrupts

4196
06:34:19,700 --> 06:34:27,940
the flow of current to all the other bulbs, series circuit, if you've got a string that one bulb

4197
06:34:27,940 --> 06:34:32,740
burns out and maybe 10 other bulbs go out, what does it tell you about those 10 other bulbs,

4198
06:34:32,740 --> 06:34:39,780
they're all in series, the whole string may be a combination circuit but that individual section

4199
06:34:39,780 --> 06:34:48,100
that went out is in series, so there's a lot of lessons behind looking at festival lighting

4200
06:34:48,100 --> 06:34:54,260
and when it goes out what exactly is taking place there, factors governing the operation are the

4201
06:34:54,260 --> 06:34:59,940
same current flows through each component, literally the same current, the same electrons,

4202
06:34:59,940 --> 06:35:04,500
they only have one path to go, that's from negative to positive so they have to travel the entire route,

4203
06:35:05,300 --> 06:35:10,340
total resistance in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistances,

4204
06:35:11,460 --> 06:35:19,940
right, this is what chapter 3, 4 review, right, you got resistance, you add it up in series,

4205
06:35:20,820 --> 06:35:28,100
always additive and that includes the resistance of a bad solder joint, the resistance of a bad

4206
06:35:28,100 --> 06:35:32,820
splice, remember how I said the power company, the voltage company will actually use thermography

4207
06:35:32,820 --> 06:35:36,900
and look and say wow we've got a splice up there and it's generating a lot of heat, we've got to

4208
06:35:36,900 --> 06:35:41,700
shut that section down and replace that because it shouldn't be generating any heat if it's a good splice.

4209
06:35:46,180 --> 06:35:50,340
The total voltage across a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage

4210
06:35:50,340 --> 06:35:55,860
drops, meaning total voltage is equal to voltage across component 1 plus the voltage across component

4211
06:35:55,860 --> 06:36:00,180
2 plus the voltage across component 3, this is a review, this is the same thing I quote,

4212
06:36:00,180 --> 06:36:08,260
you could quote me, right, I love it when you quote me, right, voltage rise equals voltage drop,

4213
06:36:09,060 --> 06:36:20,420
okay, so here voltage rise ET or VT if you prefer equals voltage drops, ER1, ER2, ER3,

4214
06:36:20,420 --> 06:36:25,780
those three voltages better equal what I put into the circuit, if not you got a problem,

4215
06:36:26,500 --> 06:36:29,540
if you find where the missing voltage is you probably found the problem,

4216
06:36:30,740 --> 06:36:36,180
where was the missing voltage, where was it, oh it was on a bad splice, oh okay, you fix that

4217
06:36:36,180 --> 06:36:44,020
problem, boom you're up and running. The voltage drop across a resistor in a series circuit is

4218
06:36:44,020 --> 06:36:50,020
proportional to the size of the resistor, meaning the bigger the resistor, I'm talking about in ohms,

4219
06:36:50,020 --> 06:36:56,660
I'm not talking about physical size, the more ohms the less current, the more ohms the higher

4220
06:36:56,660 --> 06:37:02,980
the resistance the bigger the voltage drop across that resistor, I always think of a resistor, remember

4221
06:37:02,980 --> 06:37:09,780
how I used Seattle traffic flow as an analogy, right, a big resistor is like a big accident,

4222
06:37:09,780 --> 06:37:12,740
if you just got a fender bender is that going to slow the traffic down, yeah,

4223
06:37:13,540 --> 06:37:17,460
fender bender they pull over the side, people start, you know, slow down or whatever,

4224
06:37:17,460 --> 06:37:24,260
now you got a three five three five car pile up, it's a big accident, that's a big resistance,

4225
06:37:24,260 --> 06:37:29,860
a big resistance is going to create, I gave it away already, a big backup, a big backup is a

4226
06:37:29,860 --> 06:37:34,660
big difference in potential, a bunch of people here that want to get to work at a bunch of people

4227
06:37:34,660 --> 06:37:40,980
here on the other side of the freeway that, an empty freeway basically, that's a big difference

4228
06:37:40,980 --> 06:37:50,500
in potential, okay, I love flying in my airplane over traffic jams, as a matter of fact being a

4229
06:37:50,500 --> 06:37:57,140
pilot owning an airplane, being stuck in a traffic jam drives me freaking nuts, like why am I stuck

4230
06:37:57,140 --> 06:38:02,020
in this traffic jam, but from the air it's so obvious, where there's an accident or a problem,

4231
06:38:02,020 --> 06:38:07,220
because all the traffic's backed up and then just a few cars are making it through, difference in

4232
06:38:07,220 --> 06:38:19,220
potential, big resistance, make sense, it's a mistake, that's for parallel, you sure that's

4233
06:38:19,220 --> 06:38:34,020
not parallel you're looking at, typo, typo, yeah, total power in a series circuit or parallel circuit

4234
06:38:34,020 --> 06:38:39,940
or complex circuit, power's additive, pt is equal to pr1, pr2, pr3, pr4, just add up all the power

4235
06:38:39,940 --> 06:38:46,100
and that's going to give you your total power, the bottom line, you want the bottom line or you

4236
06:38:46,100 --> 06:38:53,060
want the bs, bottom line, in a series circuit the most important thing to remember about a

4237
06:38:53,060 --> 06:39:00,900
series circuit is current is constant in a series circuit, period, the second most important thing

4238
06:39:00,900 --> 06:39:10,420
to remember about a series circuit, series circuit is also synonymous with voltage divider, when I

4239
06:39:10,420 --> 06:39:14,660
say series circuit I want you to think current's constant, I want you to think voltage divider,

4240
06:39:14,660 --> 06:39:18,340
that's just how I want you to look at them, and if you're not looking at them that way, you ain't

4241
06:39:18,340 --> 06:39:24,260
looking at them right, Houston we're going to have a problem, okay, those are the most important

4242
06:39:24,260 --> 06:39:29,940
things, I'm going to have you repeat that back to me in the future, do not deceive me, okay, remember

4243
06:39:29,940 --> 06:39:39,460
that stuff, the most important thing in a series circuit is current is constant, why is it constant,

4244
06:39:39,460 --> 06:39:45,460
it's only got one path to flow so it better be constant, the second most important thing about

4245
06:39:45,460 --> 06:39:52,980
a series circuit is a series circuit is also known as, right, aka, like in police lingo, aka also

4246
06:39:52,980 --> 06:40:03,140
known as a voltage divider, voltage divider, in this particular circuit, I mean I look at it,

4247
06:40:03,140 --> 06:40:08,660
and yeah I've been doing this since puberty, but I look at this and what do I see, I see a voltage

4248
06:40:08,660 --> 06:40:14,340
source and three voltage drops, voltage rise and three voltage drops, three loads, I don't know what

4249
06:40:14,340 --> 06:40:21,060
they are, but I know these loads are connected in series, and I know that all the current that

4250
06:40:21,060 --> 06:40:25,620
flows out of the negative terminal of my voltage source has to travel this complete path,

4251
06:40:27,140 --> 06:40:32,580
no place else for it to go, so the current's going to leave the negative terminal of the battery,

4252
06:40:33,780 --> 06:40:36,660
it's going to make this corner, 90 degree corner at the speed of light,

4253
06:40:38,340 --> 06:40:44,660
this is cool stuff ain't it, the speed of light, come on down through here the back stretch, hit

4254
06:40:44,660 --> 06:40:52,980
resistor 3 and create a voltage drop, a difference in potential, current's going to finally make it

4255
06:40:52,980 --> 06:40:59,700
through that obstruction, another 90 degree corner at speed of light, come up here to R2,

4256
06:41:00,900 --> 06:41:04,900
it's going to create another voltage drop, because there's another obstruction, there's

4257
06:41:04,900 --> 06:41:09,940
more resistance here, current's going to continue on, another 90 degree corner through R1, another

4258
06:41:09,940 --> 06:41:14,420
voltage drop, this voltage drop, this voltage drop, this voltage drop have to equal this voltage

4259
06:41:14,420 --> 06:41:19,700
rise, if anything's missing you got a problem, find where it's missing and you found your problem,

4260
06:41:24,500 --> 06:41:34,980
power additive, resistance additive, what else is there, so anytime you've got, the other way I

4261
06:41:34,980 --> 06:41:38,980
want you to look at it is anytime you've got one way into a circuit and one way out, what does that

4262
06:41:38,980 --> 06:41:47,780
tell you, it's a series circuit, it's a series circuit, because I cannot, I cannot show you

4263
06:41:47,780 --> 06:41:53,220
every possible series circuit ever invented, if you've got one way in and one way out it's a series

4264
06:41:53,220 --> 06:41:59,700
circuit, even if it's one component, one component, could that be series, yeah, one way in, one way

4265
06:41:59,780 --> 06:42:08,740
out, it's series, right, right, to solve for values in a circuit in order, the first thing I recommend

4266
06:42:08,740 --> 06:42:15,620
you do is try to solve for that total resistance, once you determine RT total resistance in the

4267
06:42:15,620 --> 06:42:27,620
circuit, then try to solve for total current in the circuit, IT, once you know IT, then you could

4268
06:42:27,620 --> 06:42:33,620
determine what your individual voltage drops are, right, so solve for your total resistance,

4269
06:42:35,940 --> 06:42:40,020
total resistance with your total voltage will show you how much current you're allowing into this

4270
06:42:40,020 --> 06:42:45,860
circuit, current flowing through the circuit, encountering the resistance, v is equal to i

4271
06:42:46,740 --> 06:42:52,340
times r, the total current, the same current that travels the entire path, times the amount of

4272
06:42:52,340 --> 06:42:58,580
resistance there is in a circuit, so this is going to drop a portion of that voltage,

4273
06:42:58,580 --> 06:43:04,020
this is going to drop a portion of that voltage, this is going to drop a portion of that voltage,

4274
06:43:04,020 --> 06:43:09,140
these three portions better equal the voltage that's put into the circuit.

4275
06:43:09,860 --> 06:43:18,980
In regards to the slide previous to this, uh-huh, this one, yeah, it doesn't say

4276
06:43:20,100 --> 06:43:27,780
on the slide series or parallel, so these will, will they primarily cross out between the two

4277
06:43:27,780 --> 06:43:34,100
applications? Yeah, but I gotta warn you, this here is just like generic, this is like generic,

4278
06:43:34,820 --> 06:43:43,700
and the thing of it is, is when you get out into industry or in lab, I may give you this,

4279
06:43:43,700 --> 06:43:52,500
I may give you this, I may give you this, but this is encased in epoxy, you can't even get to it,

4280
06:43:52,500 --> 06:43:55,700
you can't even get a part number off of it, you can't even take a reading of it,

4281
06:43:56,660 --> 06:44:02,100
so you're gonna have to use these laws and say, well, see, I remember Joe said that this is equal

4282
06:44:02,100 --> 06:44:06,820
to this plus this plus this, I know what this is, I know what this is, I know what this is,

4283
06:44:06,820 --> 06:44:11,860
but I don't know what this is, so then you could say this minus this minus this, the remainder

4284
06:44:11,860 --> 06:44:17,380
is equal to this, and it's a safe assumption because you're using a law, Kirchoff's voltage law,

4285
06:44:17,380 --> 06:44:21,300
basically to determine what the unknown is, and if you're using a law in industry

4286
06:44:22,980 --> 06:44:27,940
to figure out what part you need to buy, whose money you need to spend, it's a pretty safe

4287
06:44:27,940 --> 06:44:33,700
assumption, I mean it really is, so that's why we're teaching you this, so don't necessarily use

4288
06:44:33,700 --> 06:44:37,860
this as a checklist and like, oh yeah, I took copious notes, I listened to what Joe Grinnekat

4289
06:44:37,860 --> 06:44:44,500
said in lecture, I went home this weekend to try to do my homework and it didn't work because I

4290
06:44:44,500 --> 06:44:49,060
couldn't determine total circuit current because I didn't know what this value was because Joe

4291
06:44:49,060 --> 06:44:53,460
didn't say sometimes we might not know what this value is or we need to find it on the internet

4292
06:44:54,420 --> 06:45:00,740
off of a data sheet from a manufacturer, so the bottom line I want all of you to realize with

4293
06:45:00,740 --> 06:45:05,140
these circuits and analyzing the circuits, you always need to find at least two bits of information,

4294
06:45:05,140 --> 06:45:08,580
if I only give you one piece of information you're not going to be able to get very far,

4295
06:45:08,580 --> 06:45:13,940
but if you could extract two bits of information then you could reminipulate these three to suit

4296
06:45:13,940 --> 06:45:22,260
your needs as long as you get the right answers, make sense? Okay, parallel circuits, I might as

4297
06:45:22,260 --> 06:45:25,940
well get the cat out of the bag right from the get go, parallel circuit's the most important thing

4298
06:45:25,940 --> 06:45:31,940
you need to remember about a parallel circuit, is voltage is constant across a parallel network,

4299
06:45:32,580 --> 06:45:36,580
voltage is electrical pressure by being constant across a parallel network, what am I talking

4300
06:45:36,580 --> 06:45:40,820
about? I'm saying that that voltage can be constant across all components that are connected in

4301
06:45:40,820 --> 06:45:46,100
parallel, your house is wired in parallel, the freaking voltage coming out of the outlets better

4302
06:45:46,100 --> 06:45:54,180
all be the same, if not you got a problem, you got a problem, voltage is constant across a

4303
06:45:54,180 --> 06:45:59,220
parallel network, most important thing you need to remember, so when I say that what's most important

4304
06:45:59,220 --> 06:46:03,380
thing about a parallel circuit like church you all repeat after me, voltage is constant across a

4305
06:46:03,380 --> 06:46:10,820
parallel network, okay? The second most important thing about a parallel circuit is that a parallel

4306
06:46:10,820 --> 06:46:20,420
circuit is also known as police lingo aka also known as what? If a series circuits a voltage

4307
06:46:20,420 --> 06:46:26,020
divider what's a parallel circuit? It's a current divider, divides up current, some of the current

4308
06:46:26,020 --> 06:46:29,860
goes one path, some of the current goes the other path, remember the Seattle traffic pattern last

4309
06:46:29,860 --> 06:46:35,780
week? Was I here with talking to you folks about that or was it somebody else? Was it a dream I had?

4310
06:46:35,780 --> 06:46:42,660
I had a dream, it was about current and that's what it is, so some of the current's going to take

4311
06:46:42,660 --> 06:46:46,660
the 90, some of it's going to take the 520, some of it's going to take the north end of the lake,

4312
06:46:46,660 --> 06:46:54,420
some of it's going to take the south end of the lake, make sense? I've been a commuter for 20 years,

4313
06:46:54,420 --> 06:47:00,660
I know Seattle traffic, I've gotten out of here and gotten out of 990 and driven eastbound

4314
06:47:00,660 --> 06:47:08,500
to get the Tacoma, the highway 18, just so I could avoid traffic, so I know a little bit about

4315
06:47:08,500 --> 06:47:15,300
traffic, look at these circuits like that. Factors governing the operation of a parallel circuit,

4316
06:47:15,300 --> 06:47:23,140
the same voltage, the same voltage, not an equivalent voltage, the same voltage exists across each

4317
06:47:23,140 --> 06:47:30,900
branch of the parallel circuit and is equal to that of the voltage source, so literally this is

4318
06:47:30,900 --> 06:47:34,180
what we're literally, this is what we're up against, total voltage is equal to voltage

4319
06:47:34,180 --> 06:47:38,340
across component one, it's equal to voltage cross component two, it's equal to voltage cross

4320
06:47:38,340 --> 06:47:46,420
component three, it's not only mathematically equal to, it's the same pressure, I'll show you

4321
06:47:46,420 --> 06:47:54,900
in the schematic, same pressure. In that, in and of itself, will help you solve problems.

4322
06:47:55,940 --> 06:48:00,820
If you know something's in parallel, you could assume, if it's connected in parallel, I should

4323
06:48:00,820 --> 06:48:05,700
have the same voltage across that. Well, gee, the thing's still not working or it's working kind of

4324
06:48:05,700 --> 06:48:11,540
goofy, it's hard to get to, well sometimes you have to remove that access plate, access panel,

4325
06:48:11,540 --> 06:48:16,100
go in there and take the reading, holy cow, everything else in parallel is at 12 volts,

4326
06:48:16,100 --> 06:48:21,620
this is only at 9 volts, I'm missing 3 volts, you find I'm missing 3 volts, you found the

4327
06:48:22,420 --> 06:48:29,620
problem, it's that simple. One of the most powerful tools, how many of you here like tools?

4328
06:48:29,620 --> 06:48:34,340
I got tools, I got like every tool known to man in my garage, just ask my wife, she'll tell you,

4329
06:48:35,060 --> 06:48:39,620
okay, I like tools. One of the most powerful tools in your box is this stuff right here,

4330
06:48:40,580 --> 06:48:44,980
the second most powerful tool you're going to have is the digital multimeter, because the digital

4331
06:48:44,980 --> 06:48:49,780
multimeter is going to allow you to get out there and find the missing 3 volts, find the

4332
06:48:49,780 --> 06:48:54,340
missing 3 volts, found the problem, found the problem, you save the day, you save the day,

4333
06:48:54,340 --> 06:48:59,940
hit your boss up for a raise, he gives you a pink slip, cut you loose, just kidding,

4334
06:49:00,820 --> 06:49:07,860
you get a promotion, life is good, make so much money, get married, start a family,

4335
06:49:07,860 --> 06:49:12,980
get a girlfriend on the side, it's all good, and I don't mean that.

4336
06:49:17,060 --> 06:49:23,060
The current through each branch of a parallel circuit is inversely proportional to the amount

4337
06:49:23,060 --> 06:49:32,340
of resistance of the branch, I is equal to E over R, I is equal to E over R, so that means

4338
06:49:32,900 --> 06:49:39,860
because R here, that means E over R, right, E over R, we use the slash here, but that means

4339
06:49:39,860 --> 06:49:45,540
that this is on the bottom of the slash, so whatever we do to R is going to have an opposite

4340
06:49:45,540 --> 06:49:53,220
effect on I, we call that an inverse proportional relationship, an inverse proportional relationship,

4341
06:49:54,660 --> 06:49:59,300
so for resistance increases, current decreases, bigger accident, less flow of traffic,

4342
06:50:00,100 --> 06:50:06,500
smaller accident, traffic flow increases, plain and simple, so keep that in mind,

4343
06:50:07,540 --> 06:50:12,820
the value of least resistance in a parallel circuit will have the highest current flow through it.

4344
06:50:14,820 --> 06:50:19,860
The total current in a parallel circuit is the sum, literally the sum of the individual branch

4345
06:50:19,860 --> 06:50:28,260
currents, that's why we call parallel circuits current dividers, thank you current dividers.

4346
06:50:30,180 --> 06:50:34,180
The reciprocal of the total resistance in a parallel circuit is equal to sum of the

4347
06:50:34,180 --> 06:50:39,700
reciprocals of the individual resistances, this is a fancy way of saying when we put

4348
06:50:39,700 --> 06:50:46,500
resistors in parallel with each other, we actually add up the, the reciprocals, we add up the

4349
06:50:46,500 --> 06:50:52,660
conductance of those, of those pads, not the resistance of those pads, and the conductance

4350
06:50:52,660 --> 06:51:00,180
of those pads literally is the reciprocal of the resistance, and as Simon came up with, right,

4351
06:51:00,820 --> 06:51:09,780
that was his whole trip. The other formula that I want you to be aware of, and I know some of

4352
06:51:09,780 --> 06:51:14,740
you are resistant, reluctant to use it, it's a product over some formula, if you've got two

4353
06:51:14,740 --> 06:51:22,100
resistors or two resistances of parallel, use the product over some formula, product means

4354
06:51:22,180 --> 06:51:29,700
R1 times R2 divided by the sum, R1 plus R2, and it's a real easy way, I mean it's what's the,

4355
06:51:29,700 --> 06:51:34,980
you know, you got a half inch nut that you need to get loose, you know, you could either use,

4356
06:51:34,980 --> 06:51:41,460
you know, the box end wrench, or you could use your teeth, use the easiest tool, the easiest tool

4357
06:51:41,460 --> 06:51:45,540
is the product over some formula, well that's another formula we got to memorize, don't memorize

4358
06:51:45,540 --> 06:51:51,460
these formulas, use them and learn them, you understand the difference, memorizing stuff

4359
06:51:51,460 --> 06:51:56,500
never worked for me, I mean that's always my fear that I'm gonna get pulled, that's why I don't drink

4360
06:51:56,500 --> 06:52:00,500
and drive, because like I get pulled over, even if I haven't been, or you know, if I'm not totally

4361
06:52:00,500 --> 06:52:03,940
under the influence, they're gonna ask me to do the ABCs, and I'm probably gonna screw that up,

4362
06:52:04,660 --> 06:52:08,820
they're gonna throw me in the husk out because I don't know my ABCs, because I never really

4363
06:52:08,820 --> 06:52:14,420
memorized them, I kind of like learned them, saying backwards, I mean have you do that crap,

4364
06:52:14,420 --> 06:52:19,780
can't freaking do that, what the heck are you doing, while hopping on one foot, you know,

4365
06:52:19,780 --> 06:52:25,220
recite the alphabet backwards, no man officer, with all due respect, let's see you do that,

4366
06:52:25,940 --> 06:52:33,060
huh, geez, you're killing me, total power consumed in a parallel circuit is equal to

4367
06:52:33,060 --> 06:52:37,060
some of the power consumed by the individual resistors, no mystery here, we just talked about it

4368
06:52:37,060 --> 06:52:49,220
last chapter, power is always, that's beautiful, correct, if you only have two components in

4369
06:52:49,220 --> 06:52:54,900
parallel, two or more, you got to use your favorite formula, the reciprocal of the total

4370
06:52:54,900 --> 06:52:58,180
resistance of parallel is equal to some of the reciprocals of the individual resistances,

4371
06:52:59,620 --> 06:53:02,980
a lot of people like that one more than mine, mine is only good for two,

4372
06:53:04,500 --> 06:53:10,580
also with that don't forget your thumb rules, remember your thumb rules, right, if it's equal

4373
06:53:10,580 --> 06:53:15,860
resistance, you simply count up the number of resistors, that value of resistance and divide

4374
06:53:15,860 --> 06:53:20,100
it by that number, if I have four 100 ohm resistors in parallel with each other, what's the total

4375
06:53:20,100 --> 06:53:31,780
resistance, four 100 ohm resistors in parallel with each other, 100 divided by equals 25 ohms

4376
06:53:31,780 --> 06:53:40,260
of resistance, the other thing for resistors in parallel, the total resistance will always be

4377
06:53:40,260 --> 06:53:47,860
less than the value of least resistance, it'll always be less than the value of

4378
06:53:47,860 --> 06:53:52,500
least resistance, thumb rules, okay, you pay attention to those thumb rules, your GPA is

4379
06:53:52,500 --> 06:53:57,060
going to increase drastically, because you're going to have something to check yourself against,

4380
06:53:57,060 --> 06:54:00,180
I don't know if I use the right formula, but I remembered you always said the value of least

4381
06:54:00,180 --> 06:54:03,300
resistance will be less than the value of least resistance, my answer meets that,

4382
06:54:03,620 --> 06:54:10,340
I'm comfortable with that answer and stick with that answer, power is additive, it's a parallel

4383
06:54:10,340 --> 06:54:14,260
circuit, remember I always said voltages constant across parallel network, that's because this

4384
06:54:14,260 --> 06:54:19,300
electrical pressure being exerted by this source is distributed equally across these three loads,

4385
06:54:19,300 --> 06:54:24,500
period, it's the same, it better be the same, if it's not we got a problem,

4386
06:54:26,420 --> 06:54:32,900
if it's not we got a problem, where's the missing voltage, this is how your house is wired,

4387
06:54:32,900 --> 06:54:38,740
in parallel, the outlet in your bathroom better have the same voltage across as the outlet in

4388
06:54:38,740 --> 06:54:43,300
your family room as the outlet in your garage, if not it's not wired properly, something's up,

4389
06:54:48,340 --> 06:54:53,220
I got a big circuit like this at home, because I do everything big, that's how I roll,

4390
06:54:54,260 --> 06:54:59,300
I made some significant improvements to my backyard about 10 years ago, my backyard used to come out

4391
06:54:59,300 --> 06:55:06,020
and used to drop off a hill and it was just an unusable backyard, I wanted to like do stuff back

4392
06:55:06,020 --> 06:55:14,020
there, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, so I was looking at, I had to build a

4393
06:55:14,020 --> 06:55:20,660
retaining wall, pocket big bucks to put in a nice retaining wall, so I was looking at different options

4394
06:55:21,380 --> 06:55:27,460
and I like to utilize the resources that are available to me, so I have a good friend of mine

4395
06:55:27,460 --> 06:55:34,100
that worked for the railroad, Burlington Northern, and I said hey, you know you guys use those railroad

4396
06:55:34,100 --> 06:55:39,220
ties, what are the chances of getting some of those railroad ties, what are you talking about,

4397
06:55:39,220 --> 06:55:43,380
all like a truckload, those are hard to come by Joe, I ain't what it used to be,

4398
06:55:45,060 --> 06:55:48,500
so for like three years I kept hitting them up for railroad ties and wasn't getting anywhere,

4399
06:55:49,060 --> 06:55:54,020
and we had a great relationship, finally he said something, he was kind of hitting around about

4400
06:55:54,100 --> 06:55:59,540
going for an airplane ride, you know, it's hitting me up for an airplane ride, and finally, and I'm not

4401
06:55:59,540 --> 06:56:04,980
the quickest study, the smartest guy out there, sharpest tool in the shed, I finally like oh,

4402
06:56:04,980 --> 06:56:09,300
I get it, so I gave him a call like hey Larry, what are you doing Monday night, you know,

4403
06:56:09,300 --> 06:56:13,940
want to go for an airplane ride, pick them up in Arlington and we went out over the cascades,

4404
06:56:13,940 --> 06:56:19,700
beautiful sunset, whatever landed, right, that Wednesday my cell phone's ringing, hey Joe,

4405
06:56:20,020 --> 06:56:23,860
still want those railroad ties, yeah, I got clearance not only to give you the railroad

4406
06:56:23,860 --> 06:56:28,740
ties, but I got clearance to use a Burlington Northern crane to load them on a truck for you,

4407
06:56:28,740 --> 06:56:33,380
okay, you just got to get the flatbed, so I went out and rented a flatbed, I drove literally,

4408
06:56:33,380 --> 06:56:37,460
it was funny it's a Burlington Northern, but it was a yard up in Burlington, so I had to drive

4409
06:56:37,460 --> 06:56:43,700
all the way up there, he loaded them on 148 ties, long story short, I built a beautiful retaining

4410
06:56:43,700 --> 06:56:49,300
wall, I actually had a former student of mine that was an engineer, he designed a wall for me,

4411
06:56:50,340 --> 06:56:56,340
you know, did the prints and everything, built this wall and landscaped it, beautiful, so now I

4412
06:56:56,340 --> 06:57:00,900
have a backyard, my neighbors, they weren't digging it, because now they're looking at like, you know,

4413
06:57:00,900 --> 06:57:06,020
he's got a perfect yard, we still, you know, there's like a wall, you know, railroad ties,

4414
06:57:07,540 --> 06:57:11,540
funny part of that story too, that entire, I built that by hand, 148 ties, I don't know if you've

4415
06:57:11,540 --> 06:57:17,460
ever picked up a railroad tie, they are heavy, I built that by hand, back filled it by hand with

4416
06:57:17,460 --> 06:57:23,460
a wheelbarrow, gravel, drainage by hand, you know how much weight I lost that summer, zero,

4417
06:57:24,180 --> 06:57:28,980
probably had something to do with the pizzas and beer I was consuming while I did it, but anyway,

4418
06:57:29,540 --> 06:57:34,020
what I wanted to do is I wanted, when it was all landscaped and everything, in the process,

4419
06:57:34,020 --> 06:57:39,700
before landscaping, I wanted to put in low voltage lighting, low voltage lighting around the perimeter,

4420
06:57:39,700 --> 06:57:44,740
so you know like these, the goofy lights you stick in and you know, but I wanted to put in conduit,

4421
06:57:44,740 --> 06:57:51,860
I wanted to do this right, and as a pilot, I kind of want that almost to look like a runway,

4422
06:57:51,860 --> 06:57:56,180
and you know, in airport, you know, the lights around the periphery, so I use these low voltage

4423
06:57:56,180 --> 06:58:01,220
lights, I had a big power supply in my garage and equipment rack, dug conduit all the way back,

4424
06:58:01,940 --> 06:58:06,580
did my calculations, and the other thing about calculations, determining what size wire you

4425
06:58:06,580 --> 06:58:11,460
should use, the kind of wire that I use is the kind that falls off the back of a truck, you know,

4426
06:58:11,460 --> 06:58:15,940
and the kind that contacts provide me with, so I went with this gauge of wire, it was a little bit

4427
06:58:15,940 --> 06:58:19,940
substandard, but you know, I was like, ah, the math kind of works out and it's kind of good,

4428
06:58:19,940 --> 06:58:25,860
so I've got all these low voltage lights, and ironically, ironically, I came out nice, came

4429
06:58:25,860 --> 06:58:32,820
out really, really nice, nice backyard, but I could tell, if I brought you back there, you

4430
06:58:32,820 --> 06:58:38,500
probably wouldn't, you probably wouldn't even notice it, but I could tell which light is the

4431
06:58:38,500 --> 06:58:46,340
furthest from the power supply, just looking at it, and it kind of bothers me, it doesn't bother me

4432
06:58:46,340 --> 06:58:52,740
enough to rip up the conduit and pull new cable, okay, but I know, I know by looking at it, and

4433
06:58:52,740 --> 06:59:01,220
what does that tell me? That tells me that the load furthest down the line is not getting the

4434
06:59:01,220 --> 06:59:08,660
same voltage as the load closest to the source, and gradually as you get further away from it,

4435
06:59:08,660 --> 06:59:10,740
you just notice a little difference in illumination.

4436
06:59:15,300 --> 06:59:18,020
Yes, that's my whole point. Why, it doesn't it?

4437
06:59:18,900 --> 06:59:33,300
I needed, I needed to use basically a heavier gauge of wire in doing that, if I had done that,

4438
06:59:33,300 --> 06:59:37,380
then I could, yeah, there's ways of faking, soldering, what are you doing out there? I'm

4439
06:59:37,380 --> 06:59:42,740
soldering in resistors to these other laps, why'd I get it? My wife would probably finally really

4440
06:59:42,740 --> 06:59:47,700
give me the boot, but it bothers me, it bothers me because I'm, I'm, I like doing things right,

4441
06:59:47,700 --> 06:59:52,660
and I guess I did do it right, because you know how much that wire that I used cost me,

4442
06:59:52,660 --> 06:59:58,740
you know, literally fell off the back of a truck, so you know, don't, don't judge me. I have a friend

4443
06:59:58,740 --> 07:00:01,940
that's a police officer, I asked him, I said, you know, what's the whole deal like if I got

4444
07:00:01,940 --> 07:00:05,860
something that fell off the back of the truck? He like sat up, and he's like, you know, I'd like,

4445
07:00:05,860 --> 07:00:10,340
I'd love to drive the, cite the driver for driving an unsecured load, you know, so.

4446
07:00:10,340 --> 07:00:16,420
Anyway, so this is a parallel circuit. Now, yes.

4447
07:00:21,780 --> 07:00:25,540
You know, that's one of the other things I was kicking around, can I stick an inert gas in there,

4448
07:00:25,540 --> 07:00:30,980
and, and you know, increase the, the dielectric properties, and you know, she'd throw me out,

4449
07:00:30,980 --> 07:00:37,060
man, she'd throw me out. And you know what, I know you find it's hard to believe, maybe you won't,

4450
07:00:37,060 --> 07:00:43,060
but I actually have a nitrogen bottle at home, doesn't everybody? And I don't necessarily use

4451
07:00:43,060 --> 07:00:51,140
it for welding. Series parallel circuits, this is the easiest part of this entire chapter.

4452
07:00:52,100 --> 07:00:56,340
Circuit thick, it's just about series and parallel circuits. To solve most series parallel circuits,

4453
07:00:56,340 --> 07:01:01,300
simply apply the laws of rules of each type. There's no mystery, there's no silver bullet,

4454
07:01:01,300 --> 07:01:06,500
there's no easy way for me to describe it to you. Use series formulas for the series parts of the

4455
07:01:06,500 --> 07:01:12,740
circuit, use the parallel for the parallel parts, period. That's all it is, that's all the series

4456
07:01:12,740 --> 07:01:17,780
parallel circuit is, that's what it looks like. R2 and R3 are in parallel with each other.

4457
07:01:18,820 --> 07:01:25,540
You got to solve for that before you could solve the total resistance, because R2 and R3, one of

4458
07:01:25,540 --> 07:01:31,860
things that I like to do is identify these points right here, these are called nodes. I'm going to

4459
07:01:31,860 --> 07:01:38,020
call this node A and node B. The resistance between node A and node B is equal to the parallel

4460
07:01:38,020 --> 07:01:46,980
resistance of R2 in parallel with R3. I'd use the product over some formula to determine what RAB

4461
07:01:46,980 --> 07:01:54,340
is. Follow what I'm saying, RAB, the resistance between node A and node B. The total resistance

4462
07:01:54,340 --> 07:02:02,660
in the circuit is equal to R1 plus RAB, that's what equals total current, excuse me, total

4463
07:02:02,660 --> 07:02:08,980
resistance. Total current can be determined by that. Once I know what total current in the circuit is,

4464
07:02:08,980 --> 07:02:12,100
total current is going to create a voltage drop across this resistor.

4465
07:02:14,420 --> 07:02:19,540
Total current is going to create a voltage drop across this resistance.

4466
07:02:19,540 --> 07:02:29,300
The resistance I'm talking about is the resistance of AB, which is the combination of two in parallel

4467
07:02:29,300 --> 07:02:35,140
with three, make sense? So once you do that, it's just easy to slice and dice. The worst thing is,

4468
07:02:35,140 --> 07:02:38,580
is when you see, I mean, you know, obviously we gave you some problems with the assignments of the

4469
07:02:38,580 --> 07:02:45,460
book that are, you know, take time for you to solve. But the first thing you got to do is, is break

4470
07:02:45,540 --> 07:02:51,380
it down. The other thing too, is if I had a resistor in series with another resistor here,

4471
07:02:51,380 --> 07:02:57,940
I'd need to solve for these two first, because they're in series with each other, but in parallel

4472
07:02:57,940 --> 07:03:04,500
with this. So then I need to solve for this section of the circuit, which is in series with this

4473
07:03:04,500 --> 07:03:11,860
section of the circuit. So, you know, a lot of students get frustrated

4474
07:03:14,340 --> 07:03:19,780
and think there's a checklist they could follow or a protocol. No, you just got to pay attention to

4475
07:03:19,780 --> 07:03:25,860
the individual laws and rules that we established, but there are no two circuits alike. One of the

4476
07:03:25,860 --> 07:03:30,980
things that I've heard over the years of teaching here, I got a lot of new students that come and,

4477
07:03:30,980 --> 07:03:35,300
or quite frankly, a lot of people, they're working in industry already, and they want to come in,

4478
07:03:35,300 --> 07:03:42,180
and they want to learn how to read schematics. Joe, if I come to your program, can I learn how

4479
07:03:42,180 --> 07:03:48,980
to read schematics? Well, yeah, but we don't have a schematic reading class. There's no schematic

4480
07:03:48,980 --> 07:03:55,460
reading class. And quite frankly, I wouldn't want to have a schematic reading class, even if I could

4481
07:03:55,460 --> 07:03:59,460
fill the schematic reading class, because you wouldn't learn anything. What are you doing here by

4482
07:03:59,460 --> 07:04:06,660
studying this? You're learning how to read a schematic. You're learning to differentiate between

4483
07:04:06,660 --> 07:04:11,220
those sections of the circuit that are in parallel with each other and those sections that are series

4484
07:04:11,220 --> 07:04:17,700
components. Later on, when we talk about transistors right now, those of you in the full-time program

4485
07:04:17,700 --> 07:04:23,060
did a component ID test today to be able to recognize different types of components. You're

4486
07:04:23,060 --> 07:04:29,140
going to see what happens when we put a transistor, a diode, a capacitor, different components in

4487
07:04:29,140 --> 07:04:38,340
different configurations. If I put a capacitor in series, all as it is, is a capacitor in series.

4488
07:04:38,340 --> 07:04:43,140
It's still a series circuit, and everything that we've talked about this week still applies.

4489
07:04:44,340 --> 07:04:47,220
There's going to be some things that are going to be a little bit different with a capacitor in a

4490
07:04:47,220 --> 07:04:52,740
circuit. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but it's still a capacitor connected in series.

4491
07:04:53,860 --> 07:04:58,180
And there's really only three types of circuits that you're ever going to deal with in your entire

4492
07:04:58,180 --> 07:05:06,580
career, and that is series, parallel, and complex. So if any of you this week have been grunting,

4493
07:05:07,700 --> 07:05:18,420
groaning, outside, weeping, gnashing your teeth, you know what? It's all right, because once you

4494
07:05:18,420 --> 07:05:24,980
master series, parallel, complex, there's nothing else I'm going to throw at you. There's nothing

4495
07:05:24,980 --> 07:05:32,020
else that Peter's going to throw at you. Now that being said, we're going to have you look

4496
07:05:32,020 --> 07:05:37,300
at some complex circuits in the future, and you know what? You will deceive me. As much as you

4497
07:05:37,300 --> 07:05:42,500
could pass this test on series, parallel, complex circuits, you're going to forget about it in the

4498
07:05:42,500 --> 07:05:46,900
future, because we're going to give you some schematic to read that's got some different

4499
07:05:46,900 --> 07:05:51,620
components on it, or it's got some components drawn at weird angles or something, and you're

4500
07:05:51,620 --> 07:05:58,340
going to get your freak on, and you're going to say, boy, they never taught me that. I don't know

4501
07:05:58,340 --> 07:06:03,620
what to do. You know what you do? You fall back to the basics. The only circuit you're going to

4502
07:06:03,620 --> 07:06:08,820
encounter in industry are series, parallel, and complex. And if it's complex, what laws do you

4503
07:06:08,820 --> 07:06:12,740
use? Those are series and parallel. You just got to figure out which components are in series,

4504
07:06:12,740 --> 07:06:17,140
which one are in parallel. I can't say it any stronger. If it's in series, there's one way in,

4505
07:06:17,140 --> 07:06:23,060
there's one way out. If it's in parallel, that means there's interconnection of all the components.

4506
07:06:24,500 --> 07:06:24,980
Make sense?

4507
07:06:28,500 --> 07:06:34,340
Voltage dividers used to set a bias or operating point of various active electronic components.

4508
07:06:34,900 --> 07:06:41,060
We use voltage dividers to create the voltages that turn on transistors and integrated circuits.

4509
07:06:41,380 --> 07:06:47,860
They're used to divide a higher voltage to a lower voltage, and this process is often called

4510
07:06:47,860 --> 07:06:56,340
scaling, because what are we doing? Voltage rise equals voltage drop, or voltage drops.

4511
07:06:57,540 --> 07:07:03,940
So voltage drops will always be a fraction or scaling of the total voltage that we apply to the

4512
07:07:04,500 --> 07:07:06,500
circuit. Does that make sense?

4513
07:07:09,860 --> 07:07:13,220
We're going to use Ohm's Law to solve that. That's the current through his circuit. I'm not done

4514
07:07:13,220 --> 07:07:18,020
with voltage dividers. Trust me, I'm not done. I'm done when the screen goes black. Now, no,

4515
07:07:18,020 --> 07:07:21,860
I'm not done when the screen goes black. Then I'm going to show you some stuff on the board,

4516
07:07:21,860 --> 07:07:26,820
so sit tight. That's not my spiel on voltage dividers. Ohm's Law to current through a circuit is

4517
07:07:26,820 --> 07:07:31,700
directly proportional to voltage across the circuit, inversely proportional to resistance.

4518
07:07:31,780 --> 07:07:39,060
Ohm's Law, i is equal to e over r. Current division, current is directly proportional to voltage

4519
07:07:39,060 --> 07:07:43,220
across the circuit. If a voltage increases, current increases. If a voltage decreases,

4520
07:07:43,220 --> 07:07:51,140
current decreases. The voltage drop is equal to the percentage of the dropping resistor to the

4521
07:07:51,140 --> 07:07:55,700
sum of the dropping network. You know what? I'm giving you this formula. If you dig math,

4522
07:07:56,100 --> 07:08:03,620
great. If this confuses you, just tune me out. Because everything could be solved with Ohm's

4523
07:08:03,620 --> 07:08:09,380
Law and Watts Law. If you dig math, this is another tool in your box. Let me show you how this

4524
07:08:09,380 --> 07:08:16,340
thing works. If I want to calculate out my voltage drop across a load, across a resistor,

4525
07:08:17,300 --> 07:08:27,380
this voltage is going to be equal to my voltage source multiplied by the voltage drop

4526
07:08:27,380 --> 07:08:35,300
divided by the voltage total. Let's keep this really, really simple so we can understand how

4527
07:08:35,300 --> 07:08:44,180
this formula works. If I've got two 100 Ohm resistors, if I have two 100 Ohm resistors

4528
07:08:44,180 --> 07:08:49,380
in series with each other. I want to know what voltage I'm dropping across one of those.

4529
07:08:50,580 --> 07:08:54,260
I'm going to draw that. You know what I'm talking about? I should be able to use words because the

4530
07:08:54,260 --> 07:08:58,740
test I give you, the quiz, is going to be words. That's why I try not to draw too much on the board.

4531
07:08:58,740 --> 07:09:02,660
I'll draw some stuff on the board, but I want to draw too much because I, Joe, all week you've been

4532
07:09:02,660 --> 07:09:06,740
drawing stuff on the board and then you ask me a bunch of words. You've got to pass the quizzes

4533
07:09:06,740 --> 07:09:25,220
and their words, word problems. But if I've got this, if I've got this and I've got 100 volts,

4534
07:09:25,220 --> 07:09:32,980
let's keep this real simple. What this formula is showing me is what is our drop here?

4535
07:09:36,980 --> 07:09:53,620
V drop is equal to voltage total times our drop over our total.

4536
07:09:55,860 --> 07:09:59,060
Okay, so let's take a look at that. Voltage total is going to be

4537
07:09:59,700 --> 07:10:07,940
100 volts times our drop, which is one of these voltage drops, whichever one you're trying to

4538
07:10:07,940 --> 07:10:15,140
calculate for. Let's say it's this one. It's going to be 100 divided by, what's my total

4539
07:10:15,140 --> 07:10:27,860
resistance in a circuit? 200. Okay, what's 100 divided by 200? What is it? 0.5. 0.5. What does 0.5

4540
07:10:27,860 --> 07:10:42,820
mean? What percentage? Half. It means 50%. So 100 times 50% equals what? 100 divided by 0.5. What

4541
07:10:42,820 --> 07:10:47,220
does it equal? 50 volts. We could do this one in our head. That's why I want you to do this in your

4542
07:10:47,220 --> 07:10:52,420
head so you understand the formula. You understand how the formula works? So if you know what this

4543
07:10:52,420 --> 07:10:57,620
value of total is and you want to calculate out, let's say that I went ahead and I changed this

4544
07:10:57,620 --> 07:11:09,380
now, that this is 500 ohms and this is 100 ohms and I'm asking you what voltage is going to be

4545
07:11:09,380 --> 07:11:17,140
across this voltage drop here. 100 divided by 5, basically 1.5. 1.5. What percentage is 1.5?

4546
07:11:20,260 --> 07:11:25,860
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20%. So that means 20% of my voltage is going to be dropped across this.

4547
07:11:26,740 --> 07:11:35,220
If 20% is being dropped here, actually no, right? Because this is 100 over 600. So what percentage

4548
07:11:35,220 --> 07:11:40,740
is that? I was off on my math. I'm sorry. You guys were buying it, man. I want to be your banker.

4549
07:11:44,980 --> 07:11:53,620
What's 100 divided by 600? Because total resistance is 600. 17. So basically 17%

4550
07:11:54,340 --> 07:11:59,700
is going to be dropped right here. 117 volts is going to be here. The remainder is going to be...

4551
07:12:02,340 --> 07:12:06,340
Where's the remainder voltage going to be dropped? This is an easy question. Right here. It's got to

4552
07:12:06,340 --> 07:12:13,700
be because this plus this has to equal this. Does that make sense? So this is just another formula

4553
07:12:13,700 --> 07:12:19,540
for those of you with mathematics. One other tool. I like tools. Just ask my wife. I've got every

4554
07:12:20,260 --> 07:12:24,500
tool. There's another tool for you. So if I'm giving you... I could sit here all day long and tell

4555
07:12:24,500 --> 07:12:28,260
you how much voltage is dropped here, how much is here. It's a lot easier to use this formula.

4556
07:12:28,260 --> 07:12:31,620
Although you could calculate the same thing using Stray Ohm's law. It's just going to take you a

4557
07:12:31,620 --> 07:12:40,420
little bit longer to get to the answer. Make sense? All right. In summary, a series circuit provides

4558
07:12:40,420 --> 07:12:45,860
only one path for current flow. Series circuit formulas include IT is equal to IR1, equal to IR2,

4559
07:12:45,860 --> 07:12:53,460
equal to IR3, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RT is equal to R1 plus R2 plus R3, et cetera,

4560
07:12:53,460 --> 07:12:59,940
et cetera, et cetera. Voltage. A series circuit is also known as a voltage divider. So therefore,

4561
07:12:59,940 --> 07:13:04,820
the sum of the individual voltages must equal source voltage. I is equal to E over R. Well,

4562
07:13:04,820 --> 07:13:09,540
that's Ohm's law. Power is additive in a series circuit. Power is additive in a parallel circuit.

4563
07:13:09,780 --> 07:13:17,700
A parallel circuit provides more than one path for current flow. Parallel circuit formulas

4564
07:13:17,700 --> 07:13:25,300
include IT is equal to IR1 plus IR2 plus IR3, the reciprocal formula for resistance. Voltage

4565
07:13:25,300 --> 07:13:30,100
is constant across a parallel network. Again, I is equal to E over R. If you want to calculate

4566
07:13:30,100 --> 07:13:35,380
how much current is flowing through an individual path, and power total is equal to PR1 plus PR2

4567
07:13:35,380 --> 07:13:40,100
plus PR3, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Series parallel circuits are solved by using

4568
07:13:40,100 --> 07:13:43,300
series formulas for the series parts of the circuit. Parallel formulas for the parallel

4569
07:13:43,300 --> 07:13:48,980
parts of the circuit. We talked about voltage dividers, more to come. And we talked about

4570
07:13:48,980 --> 07:13:54,260
current division, process of, excuse me, process of current division in a parallel circuit.

4571
07:13:54,260 --> 07:13:59,380
Any questions on this? Okay, let's talk about voltage dividers.

4572
07:13:59,940 --> 07:14:08,020
Kind of get emotional when I talk about voltage dividers. It's kind of like your first real

4573
07:14:08,020 --> 07:14:12,260
circuit that really does something. Trust me, it'll be good.

4574
07:14:16,980 --> 07:14:20,420
But I need some help, though, because we've got some electronic experts in here.

4575
07:14:20,420 --> 07:14:26,980
I'm going to need some help. What kind of a circuit would I use to divide voltage?

4576
07:14:28,980 --> 07:14:32,580
Series. You've got three to choose from. Multiple choice answer.

4577
07:14:32,580 --> 07:14:36,340
Series circuits, parallel circuits are complex circuits. The correct answer is ding, ding,

4578
07:14:36,340 --> 07:14:42,340
ding, ding, ding, series. Okay? So a series circuit is also known as a voltage divider,

4579
07:14:42,340 --> 07:14:45,860
right? Y'all believe me? Okay, so let's go ahead and draw that.

4580
07:14:51,300 --> 07:15:03,380
This is a voltage divider. Any questions?

4581
07:15:08,580 --> 07:15:13,300
Unfortunately, this is a voltage divider, but unfortunately, this isn't going to do much for

4582
07:15:13,300 --> 07:15:18,740
us. This will do a lot for us, but if we effectively want to use it, it really can't be

4583
07:15:18,740 --> 07:15:24,500
represented like this. It can't be represented like this. First of all, we got to ask ourselves,

4584
07:15:24,500 --> 07:15:30,580
why would we want to divide up voltage? We want to divide up voltage, like I said in here, to power

4585
07:15:30,580 --> 07:15:36,980
transistors, to power integrated circuits, to power different types of loads, to power different

4586
07:15:36,980 --> 07:15:50,820
types of devices. Make sense? Okay, so let's say as an example that I have a 48 volt power supply.

4587
07:15:51,540 --> 07:15:59,620
This is a big rack mounted power supply that sits there and drones. It puts out 48 volts DC,

4588
07:16:00,100 --> 07:16:08,500
but I've got some different appliances that I want to power from it. Okay? One of the devices that I

4589
07:16:08,500 --> 07:16:23,940
want to power from it is a 12 volt radio, a simple 12 volt radio. Okay? And that 12 volt radio is a

4590
07:16:24,020 --> 07:16:32,820
citizen band radio, CB radio. So what I need to do is I want to connect that radio

4591
07:16:35,540 --> 07:16:44,740
to this resistor right here and have this resistor produce 12 volts across it. So when I go out

4592
07:16:44,740 --> 07:16:51,620
here and connect my radio, which I'm going to represent, anybody know a symbol that I could

4593
07:16:51,620 --> 07:17:04,660
use to represent a radio? What's that? R. Yeah, yeah. There's no special schematic. What I'm

4594
07:17:04,660 --> 07:17:10,660
going to do here is I'm going to draw a resistor and that represents the load

4595
07:17:12,580 --> 07:17:17,380
that a CB radio has. And I'm going to connect it in parallel.

4596
07:17:17,700 --> 07:17:25,060
Do you agree that that's in parallel? So whatever voltage is here is going to be right here. Okay?

4597
07:17:25,060 --> 07:17:31,060
When I did this, I just changed the dynamics of the circuit. I just changed the dynamics of the

4598
07:17:31,060 --> 07:17:36,740
circuit. What I just did is I just loaded the voltage divider. So we're going to call this a

4599
07:17:36,740 --> 07:17:41,780
loaded voltage divider now. And quite frankly, a voltage divider in and of itself without any

4600
07:17:41,780 --> 07:17:47,300
the loads connected to it's kind of stupid. So you guys, guys, if you had read ahead and you

4601
07:17:47,300 --> 07:17:50,580
really had mastery of it when I'm showing you the voltage divider, you could have said,

4602
07:17:50,580 --> 07:17:54,260
Joe, that's stupid. What are you going to do is put three resistors, divide the voltage. What

4603
07:17:54,260 --> 07:18:00,020
good is that? Okay? What you got to do to make it viable is connect the load to a loaded voltage

4604
07:18:00,020 --> 07:18:03,060
divider. This is a real circuit. We're really going to do something here. We're really going to

4605
07:18:03,060 --> 07:18:11,700
power a CB radio. Okay? So to figure out, we know that this is 12 volts because the manufacturer

4606
07:18:11,700 --> 07:18:15,620
just said this is a 12 volt CB radio. You plug it in your cigarette lighter, you could wire it

4607
07:18:15,620 --> 07:18:22,900
into your car, and you too could be breaker breaker 1-9. Makes sense? So we know the voltage

4608
07:18:22,900 --> 07:18:32,580
is going to be 12 volts. The other piece of information that is critical for us is we have to

4609
07:18:32,580 --> 07:18:43,860
know how much current is required by the CB radio to operate properly. So what we're going to do

4610
07:18:43,860 --> 07:19:03,540
over here, okay? P-I-V. Okay? I know that the CB radio, a typical CB radio, is about five watts.

4611
07:19:05,780 --> 07:19:11,060
And I know that that CB radio, because I got the box, and the salesperson at Radio Shack,

4612
07:19:11,060 --> 07:19:15,540
we know how smart they are, said I could wire it up into my car. It's a 12 volt system. Okay?

4613
07:19:15,540 --> 07:19:22,500
So this is going to be 12 volts. So how much current is going to be required to power that radio

4614
07:19:22,500 --> 07:19:28,660
when I key the microphone and I broadcast out five watts? By the way, that's the maximum you'll

4615
07:19:28,660 --> 07:19:33,220
ever consume in a CB radio. If it's a five watt radio, the maximum you're ever going to consume

4616
07:19:33,220 --> 07:19:37,300
is when you're transmitting. If you're just receiving, that doesn't consume much energy at all.

4617
07:19:37,300 --> 07:19:44,260
It's when you key that mic and transmit that you're going to start consuming the most power.

4618
07:19:44,260 --> 07:19:50,020
So I'm thinking worst case scenario here. Okay? So all we need to do here, right, with your calculator,

4619
07:19:51,380 --> 07:20:05,460
go five divided by 12. What do I come up with? 0.42, rounding off, right? 0.411, 0.416666.

4620
07:20:07,380 --> 07:20:10,740
All right? That's what I got. Everybody get that? Everybody saw I came with that? Okay?

4621
07:20:14,660 --> 07:20:21,700
That's assuming the radio is 100% efficient. You know what I mean? Like every ounce of current

4622
07:20:21,700 --> 07:20:25,540
is going into generating that, which there's going to be losses. How do I know there's going to be

4623
07:20:25,540 --> 07:20:32,340
losses? When I use the radio, it's going to get hot. All that energy is not going to get out the

4624
07:20:32,340 --> 07:20:36,900
antenna. If you get that working, you get all the energy, getting out the antenna,

4625
07:20:36,900 --> 07:20:41,940
give me a call. All right? I have my attorney contact. I personally fly at a bimini. I'll

4626
07:20:41,940 --> 07:20:47,140
set you up. Pour you your first cocktail. Okay? I'll set the tab up for you.

4627
07:20:50,580 --> 07:20:55,140
So what I'm going to do with this, just for the case of example, is I'm going to round this.

4628
07:20:55,140 --> 07:21:02,500
Generally speaking, a CB radio is going to take a minimum of half an amp at 12 volts,

4629
07:21:02,740 --> 07:21:08,420
a minimum half an amp. Probably it's going to be even more than that. But in order for it to

4630
07:21:08,420 --> 07:21:13,380
transmit out 5 watts, you see the math. Does everybody see the math? Okay. So I am going to

4631
07:21:13,380 --> 07:21:26,020
assume that this here is 0.5 amps. So we know everything about the CB radio now. It's a 12 volt,

4632
07:21:26,020 --> 07:21:32,260
5 amps, 5 watt radio. I feel pretty good about it. We can calculate out the internal resistance

4633
07:21:32,260 --> 07:21:36,660
of it if we want it to. I don't see the benefit of doing that now. We don't need to do that right

4634
07:21:36,660 --> 07:21:48,260
now. Make sense? Okay. Voltage divider. Voltage divider. I've got another device. I've got another

4635
07:21:48,260 --> 07:21:54,260
device. And this other device that I have is, by the way, we're not going to put this in your car

4636
07:21:54,260 --> 07:22:00,180
anymore. We're going to put this CB radio on my boat. Why I want a CB radio on a boat? I do not know.

4637
07:22:00,180 --> 07:22:05,300
It's a power thing, man. I want to talk with truckers because I'm going underneath the bridge. Ha-ha.

4638
07:22:05,300 --> 07:22:11,540
You start the traffic. I'm going underneath it. Ha-ha. I'm on my boat. Okay. I'm going to install a,

4639
07:22:12,980 --> 07:22:18,340
I'm going to install a radar system. And the radar system

4640
07:22:22,580 --> 07:22:24,900
that I could represent with a resistor

4641
07:22:25,620 --> 07:22:34,500
is going to be connected across these two resistors.

4642
07:22:37,620 --> 07:22:44,420
The voltage of my commercial radar system is 24 volts DC.

4643
07:22:48,100 --> 07:22:50,820
And it puts out 200 watts.

4644
07:22:55,860 --> 07:23:03,620
How much current is going to be needed to go through this device in order to transmit out 200 watts?

4645
07:23:03,620 --> 07:23:13,220
Again, if you get confused, draw the triangle, P, I, V, 200 watts divided by 24. What do you come up with?

4646
07:23:13,540 --> 07:23:21,220
How much?

4647
07:23:22,580 --> 07:23:24,100
0.12? 0.12?

4648
07:23:28,260 --> 07:23:36,340
How much? We got a big disparity here. That makes sense, right? If a half an amp can power a CB radio,

4649
07:23:37,940 --> 07:23:42,180
it's going to have to be more than a half an amp to power 200 watt transmitter, right?

4650
07:23:43,380 --> 07:23:49,300
Even at, even at double the voltage. So all's I got to do here is power is 200

4651
07:23:50,980 --> 07:23:55,540
divided by how much? What's our voltage? 24.

4652
07:24:05,140 --> 07:24:07,380
8.33? And that assumes what?

4653
07:24:07,380 --> 07:24:13,780
That assumes 100% efficiency. Do we get 100% efficiency out of this stuff?

4654
07:24:13,780 --> 07:24:17,620
To be honest with you, if we're lucky if some of this stuff operates at 80% efficiency,

4655
07:24:18,260 --> 07:24:24,900
20% of the energy gets consumed as heat. So just for the case of example,

4656
07:24:26,020 --> 07:24:32,660
I'm going to say that this thing really in order for it to work properly is going to need 10 amps.

4657
07:24:33,460 --> 07:24:40,660
And this might be what the placard data on the back of the radar says or the manual says,

4658
07:24:41,300 --> 07:24:48,340
okay? But you understand that which one of these are real? If you do the math, this number could

4659
07:24:48,340 --> 07:24:52,100
be good, this number could be good. And if that's the case, then we know that the answer is going to

4660
07:24:52,100 --> 07:25:00,100
be 8.33 amps. But in reality, because of the losses, because of the property of resistance,

4661
07:25:00,180 --> 07:25:08,180
we're probably going to be consuming really about 10 amps. Make sense? Okay. So now what I have

4662
07:25:08,180 --> 07:25:13,620
is a circuit, a viable circuit. And by the way, if I want 24 volts here,

4663
07:25:16,180 --> 07:25:21,700
and I am getting this voltage across these two resistors,

4664
07:25:23,860 --> 07:25:27,540
what voltage must I be dropping across this resistor right here?

4665
07:25:30,740 --> 07:25:33,300
How much? Why 12?

4666
07:25:36,980 --> 07:25:44,180
Yeah. And I am connecting this radar unit in parallel. I love it when you talk that way.

4667
07:25:44,980 --> 07:25:51,700
Parallel with these two resistors that are in a voltage divider network. Okay. So what we did

4668
07:25:51,700 --> 07:25:57,380
is we just built a voltage divider, a loaded voltage divider. But we've got to analyze it now.

4669
07:25:58,340 --> 07:26:03,380
We've got to analyze it. And this is where the author like pulled numbers out of his backside,

4670
07:26:03,380 --> 07:26:06,420
and he really didn't justify it. And I don't even know where that's coming from. That's why

4671
07:26:06,420 --> 07:26:23,460
we're having this lesson. Question? This, remember, this here, I bought this military surplus. This

4672
07:26:23,460 --> 07:26:29,540
is a 48 volt power supply. Okay. So it converts my ship's power to 48 volts DC.

4673
07:26:32,740 --> 07:26:39,860
Yeah. So if this is 48, and this is 12, and this is 12, what's this got to be? 24. Why?

4674
07:26:44,820 --> 07:26:47,540
Come on, guys. Quote me what I've been quoting you.

4675
07:26:47,940 --> 07:26:53,860
Rise has to, your drop has to equal the rise. Absolutely. Because the drops have to equal

4676
07:26:53,860 --> 07:26:59,620
the rise. I'm putting 48 volt rise in. I'm getting 48 volts a drop. 12 here, 12 here, 24 here.

4677
07:27:00,420 --> 07:27:05,620
All voltage drops present in the count of 4. Makes sense? Okay. So this is cool. It's really

4678
07:27:05,620 --> 07:27:10,340
going to work like this. But we don't know the math. We don't know what values of resistance

4679
07:27:10,340 --> 07:27:14,820
to use here. This is where it gets tricky. This is where there's another thumb rule.

4680
07:27:14,820 --> 07:27:19,380
It's why you come to lecture. Okay. If the book was that good, the book was that good,

4681
07:27:19,380 --> 07:27:23,060
you could be home in your underwear studying right now. And I could be home in my underwear

4682
07:27:23,060 --> 07:27:27,140
correcting your work. Instead here, I'm dressed up wearing lab coats, you're wearing lab coats,

4683
07:27:27,140 --> 07:27:36,420
and we're having this interactive lesson. The thumb rule is, you ready for this? The bleeder,

4684
07:27:37,380 --> 07:27:46,020
the bleeder current needs to be one-tenth of the total load current.

4685
07:27:48,740 --> 07:27:55,140
The bleeder current needs to be one-tenth of the total load current.

4686
07:27:59,860 --> 07:28:05,700
How many of you buy that? You better buy it. I just sold it to you. Now the question is,

4687
07:28:05,700 --> 07:28:10,980
what the heck is he talking about, bleeder current? The bleeder current is the current

4688
07:28:10,980 --> 07:28:19,460
flowing through the first resistor that starts the voltage division process. So by me saying that,

4689
07:28:19,460 --> 07:28:24,900
first of all, we've got to determine what is our total load current? What's our total load

4690
07:28:24,900 --> 07:28:33,220
current in this circuit? 28? 48? Total load current. Current is measured in

4691
07:28:34,180 --> 07:28:40,820
amps. What is my total load current in this circuit? 10.5. What? Pounds ounces, kilograms,

4692
07:28:40,820 --> 07:28:46,260
amps. I love it when you talk that way. Total load current is 10.5 amps. Everybody see how we did

4693
07:28:46,260 --> 07:28:51,620
that? The only loads in this circuit, this is a voltage divider. These are my loads. The only

4694
07:28:51,620 --> 07:28:56,180
loads in the circuit here are, what the heck was this, a CB radio? Breaker, breaker, 1.9, CB.

4695
07:28:57,380 --> 07:29:04,980
And then this was a radar system. Radar system consumes 10 amps. This consumes half an amp.

4696
07:29:04,980 --> 07:29:13,380
So my total load current is 10.5 amps. Do you all agree with that? Okay. So I said

4697
07:29:14,580 --> 07:29:19,460
the foam rule is that the bleeder current is one-tenth of the total load current. What's one-tenth

4698
07:29:19,460 --> 07:29:39,140
of 10.5? Okay. So 10.5 divided by 10, 10.5 amps. Do you all agree with that?

4699
07:29:41,140 --> 07:29:48,100
Get some puzzle to look. One-tenth of my total load. One-tenth of 10.5 is 1.05. Agree with that?

4700
07:29:48,900 --> 07:29:54,580
So that's how much current, I'm going to do something here to change the color to make it stand

4701
07:29:54,580 --> 07:30:01,780
out. Okay. It's going to be passing through this first resistor. Very good. Okay. And this is going

4702
07:30:01,780 --> 07:30:13,460
to be 1.05 amps. And again, that's where, where's that coming from?

4703
07:30:19,220 --> 07:30:25,220
So at least remember my, my deal. So right there, we just unlock the entire circuit.

4704
07:30:26,180 --> 07:30:32,660
We just unlock the entire circuit because what we've got here is 1.05 amps coming up out of this

4705
07:30:32,660 --> 07:30:39,140
node. How much current do we have coming up through here? Where'd that number come from?

4706
07:30:41,780 --> 07:30:47,460
Thank you. The paperwork. Okay. Or your calculation based on, if the paperwork left out the current

4707
07:30:47,460 --> 07:30:51,060
demand, you know it's a five watt radio. And again, as long as you can prove it,

4708
07:30:51,700 --> 07:30:57,220
got to be able to prove it to somebody. Okay. So we called that 0.5. So we've got 0.5 amps

4709
07:30:59,300 --> 07:31:00,260
coming up through here.

4710
07:31:02,900 --> 07:31:08,260
All the current that comes up through the radio is going to come here into this node right here.

4711
07:31:08,260 --> 07:31:15,300
So I got 0.5 amps coming in from this angle. I got 1.05 coming in from this angle. Can any

4712
07:31:15,300 --> 07:31:24,900
tell me about how much current's going to be going through this? How'd you come up with that?

4713
07:31:31,220 --> 07:31:34,740
And how'd you come up with that? Is that just, is that, is that a notion?

4714
07:31:35,940 --> 07:31:42,420
It's a current divider. It is a current divider. Okay. But again, what's going to bring tears to

4715
07:31:42,420 --> 07:31:49,140
my eyes is if you quote me laws. Are there any laws that govern what's happening here in this node?

4716
07:31:49,140 --> 07:31:55,620
What is it? Absolutely. Kirchoff's law. I got 1.05 coming up here. I got 0.5 here. We got

4717
07:31:55,620 --> 07:31:59,220
a traffic cop standing in the middle of that intersection. How much current's driving away

4718
07:31:59,220 --> 07:32:09,380
from them? 1.55 amps. It's got to. It's got to. If this thing's functioning, it's got to work like

4719
07:32:09,380 --> 07:32:17,140
this. So I've got 1.55 amps coming up through here. Okay. How much current is coming up through

4720
07:32:17,140 --> 07:32:30,260
this load? How do we know that? Plackered data, technical documentation, calculation utilizing

4721
07:32:30,260 --> 07:32:37,780
Watt's law. I don't know. Because Joe said so. Actually, I didn't. All I gave you is that 24 volts

4722
07:32:37,780 --> 07:32:45,300
in the 200 watts. You folks really calculated that out. The only curveball that I shot you in any of

4723
07:32:45,300 --> 07:32:51,380
this was the efficiency bit. I'm talking about efficiency. The book doesn't even talk about that.

4724
07:32:51,380 --> 07:32:56,980
But you just, you don't get 100% of anything. You don't. There's nothing that's 100% efficient.

4725
07:32:58,500 --> 07:33:04,020
So I got 10 amps coming up through my radar system. That means that 10 amps makes a 90 degree corner at

4726
07:33:04,020 --> 07:33:22,340
the speed of light. Okay. 10 amps. 11.55 amps. How'd you get an extra amp with Watt?

4727
07:33:28,020 --> 07:33:32,260
What was the rule here? What was the whole thing on unlocking this entire circuit?

4728
07:33:32,340 --> 07:33:34,260
What did I call this resistor? The

4729
07:33:36,260 --> 07:33:41,060
bleeder resistor. And that's what's starting the whole process. We have to have some current going

4730
07:33:41,060 --> 07:33:46,580
through that to create. And the reason that we use 1.10, so is that these loads come on and offline?

4731
07:33:46,580 --> 07:33:50,660
The circuit's going to have stability because that CB is not always going to be on. And when we

4732
07:33:50,660 --> 07:33:55,940
turn the CB off, we don't want the whole circuit to go cattywampus. We want it to be somewhat

4733
07:33:55,940 --> 07:34:01,060
balanced. Same thing with the radar system. So it's a thumb rule. It's not an absolute. It's a

4734
07:34:01,060 --> 07:34:07,380
thumb rule that should give us consistency of operation for this circuit. Makes sense?

4735
07:34:08,100 --> 07:34:11,380
So we know that we have 11.55 amps coming up through here.

4736
07:34:12,340 --> 07:34:17,380
Boom. If I've got 11.55 amps flowing into my power supply, how many amps must I have flowing

4737
07:34:17,380 --> 07:34:27,780
out of my power supply? The same. Okay. So that means I've got 11.55 amps flowing into this node.

4738
07:34:27,780 --> 07:34:34,100
If I've got 11.55 amps flowing into this node and 1.05 amps flowing out of this node,

4739
07:34:34,100 --> 07:34:39,940
how much current do I have flowing in this direction? How much?

4740
07:34:43,140 --> 07:34:50,580
10.5 amps. Do you agree with that? If I've got 10.5 amps flowing

4741
07:34:50,580 --> 07:34:55,700
into this node and I got 0.5 flowing in this node, how much current am I going to have flowing

4742
07:34:55,700 --> 07:35:04,020
in this direction? Isn't that the same number we started off with?

4743
07:35:04,020 --> 07:35:09,700
So I just prove that this works. I just traced all the current through this circuit in doing this.

4744
07:35:09,700 --> 07:35:14,580
Now, the easy part of the analysis,

4745
07:35:20,340 --> 07:35:28,180
VIR, let's calculate out resistance, voltage over current. Voltage over current, right?

4746
07:35:28,820 --> 07:35:37,700
Voltage 12 over 1.05. 12 over 1.05 is going to give me this value of resistance. R is going to be equal to

4747
07:35:39,700 --> 07:36:07,220
11.428 ohms. That's what I came up with. Are we going to find a 11.428 ohm resistor?

4748
07:36:10,020 --> 07:36:17,460
Can we find something close? Maybe we could find one with tolerance as a 10 ohm resistor that's

4749
07:36:17,460 --> 07:36:22,420
on the high side, 20 percent tolerance. We could find one that's within that, right?

4750
07:36:22,420 --> 07:36:27,620
Because a 10 ohm resistor could be anywhere from 12 ohms to 8 ohms. So yeah, we might be able to

4751
07:36:27,620 --> 07:36:36,100
find something close to that. It's not going to be that critical. You're going to get less

4752
07:36:36,100 --> 07:36:42,100
of a voltage drop there because that is kind of critical. The bigger the resistor,

4753
07:36:42,100 --> 07:36:47,540
the bigger the voltage drop. The smaller the resistor, the smaller. So we could do the same

4754
07:36:47,540 --> 07:37:02,820
thing up here, right? 12 volts divided by 1.55 amps, 7.7 ohms, and then finally here up at the top,

4755
07:37:02,820 --> 07:37:17,300
24 divided by 11.55, 2.08 ohms.

4756
07:37:26,180 --> 07:37:29,140
And this is how you analyze a loaded voltage divider.

4757
07:37:33,060 --> 07:37:42,180
It's really nothing unique. All we did is apply Ohm's law, Watt's law, Kerchoff's law.

4758
07:37:44,180 --> 07:37:46,820
You know, one of the other things that's kind of fun that I could do with this circuit,

4759
07:37:46,820 --> 07:37:51,300
I think it's fun. You'll probably think I'm horrible for doing that kind of stuff.

4760
07:38:02,820 --> 07:38:31,300
What is it?

4761
07:38:33,300 --> 07:38:38,580
It's the exact same circuit. And to be honest with you, this is how this thing would really be

4762
07:38:38,580 --> 07:38:44,740
connected. This is how it'd be really connected. Your 48 volt power supply would be connected to

4763
07:38:45,860 --> 07:38:51,700
what kind of ground? Electrical ground. Not necessarily earth ground, electrical ground,

4764
07:38:51,700 --> 07:38:56,580
which is typically a chassis ground or a frame of a vehicle or a boat, the hull of a ship,

4765
07:38:57,540 --> 07:39:04,020
the frame of a train car. This is how it's going to be done because we're going to use the frame

4766
07:39:04,020 --> 07:39:08,980
as a conductor. Circuits are going to operate exactly the same. We're going to get the

4767
07:39:11,940 --> 07:39:16,660
bottom of the circuit here, the bleeder resistor, connect that also to ground, chassis ground.

4768
07:39:17,860 --> 07:39:23,460
We're going to connect the negative lead of our radio directly to chassis ground. We're going to

4769
07:39:23,460 --> 07:39:29,060
connect the negative lead of our radar. The radar's kind of out of an unusual position, you know?

4770
07:39:29,060 --> 07:39:32,580
I got that, you know, the pulpit up there, I drive the boat, I want the low radar there.

4771
07:39:32,580 --> 07:39:36,100
So I'm going to have to run quite a bit of cable, but I'm still going to connect it to

4772
07:39:37,140 --> 07:39:43,620
chassis ground. And this is the exact same circuit that you just analyzed. I just made it more

4773
07:39:43,620 --> 07:39:49,140
complex, complicated looking by putting these grounds in. Basically, when you see this in a

4774
07:39:49,140 --> 07:39:57,140
circuit, you know that electrically all of these are interconnected. Don't let me screw you up with

4775
07:39:57,140 --> 07:40:04,740
this kind of stuff. And it's assumed that you know how to interpret this type of stuff. Questions?

4776
07:40:19,620 --> 07:40:22,980
10.5 divided by 10.

4777
07:40:25,620 --> 07:40:32,580
One tenth is 10, right? One tenth is 10. Make sense? 10.5?

4778
07:40:36,660 --> 07:40:40,820
1.05. You can multiply it by 0.1, you get the same answer.

4779
07:40:41,140 --> 07:40:49,380
Another question? No? Questions?

4780
07:40:52,580 --> 07:40:56,660
So you could sit here, and again, that's a thumb rule, but you could use it for analysis.

4781
07:40:56,660 --> 07:40:59,940
And then if somebody asks you, how the heck did you come up with that? How did you, what,

4782
07:41:00,740 --> 07:41:04,660
you want me to buy these parts? Well, how'd you come up with that? Well, I used it as a thumb rule

4783
07:41:04,660 --> 07:41:08,900
that I want my bleeder current, okay, as opposed to the author, who just, again, I don't know where

4784
07:41:08,900 --> 07:41:12,580
those numbers came from. I don't know, I don't want to know, it is what it is.

4785
07:41:15,220 --> 07:41:19,780
So in the future, use that one tenth. I use that one tenth, you're not even going to get the,

4786
07:41:19,780 --> 07:41:23,300
I mean, you'll get the, you won't get the answer that the author gets in the book.

4787
07:41:23,940 --> 07:41:27,700
I don't know what, you got to do it wrong to get the number that the author gets in the book.

4788
07:41:28,340 --> 07:41:32,900
So there's, in the future, when you see loaded voltage dividers, use that one tenth rule,

4789
07:41:33,700 --> 07:41:38,500
unless you're told otherwise. You know, there might be an engineer that knows a lot more

4790
07:41:38,500 --> 07:41:44,500
math than we know. They say, no, we want you to assume 15%, or 20%, or whatever.

4791
07:41:45,700 --> 07:41:51,700
But you need some guidance. We're not engineers. Guys, remember that? You know that? We're not

4792
07:41:51,700 --> 07:41:57,700
engineers. Anybody here want to be an engineer? Honestly? No offense, honestly? Okay, if you

4793
07:41:57,700 --> 07:42:01,940
want to be an engineer, that's, you know, that's good. You're going to immerse yourself more in

4794
07:42:01,940 --> 07:42:05,940
the world of theory. We immerse ourselves more in the world of reality.

4795
07:42:06,580 --> 07:42:11,940
So we're going to do what we're told to do. Actually, I had a meeting today with an engineer,

4796
07:42:11,940 --> 07:42:16,180
we're looking at some engineering, starting some engineering classes here at Lake Washington,

4797
07:42:16,180 --> 07:42:20,260
a parallel program to pursue your engineering degree. And the way he was talking about it,

4798
07:42:20,260 --> 07:42:24,260
too, like a pyramid. It's like a pyramid. You get to research science, a handful of

4799
07:42:24,260 --> 07:42:28,500
research people up here at the top of a pyramid. Then you've got engineers designing this stuff.

4800
07:42:28,500 --> 07:42:33,380
And then you got technicians making the stuff work. So there's a lot more technician jobs out

4801
07:42:33,380 --> 07:42:39,780
there to support engineering. And the engineering supports R&D. You know, Boeing only has a handful

4802
07:42:39,780 --> 07:42:46,100
of people that sit around and think about weird crap all day long. Thank God, right? Because then

4803
07:42:46,100 --> 07:42:50,500
what they do is they farm it out to the engineers and say, hey, make this work. Make this work.

4804
07:42:51,220 --> 07:42:54,020
And then the engineers figure it out and the calculations and everything. And then they

4805
07:42:54,020 --> 07:42:59,380
give the technicians and they say, make this work. And then we are the last line of defense.

4806
07:42:59,380 --> 07:43:06,180
And the only thing that we have to fall back on are the laws of physics and the theory of operation.

4807
07:43:06,180 --> 07:43:09,620
That's all we have to fall back on. And if you're going to apply that, then you're going to be ahead

4808
07:43:09,620 --> 07:43:19,940
of the game. So no question about it. No question about it. This actually worked out pretty well

4809
07:43:19,940 --> 07:43:28,420
for us with last week doing seven and eight and then saving chapter nine for this week.

4810
07:43:29,780 --> 07:43:33,220
Because that's the only thing that we're going to do tonight is going to be chapter nine,

4811
07:43:33,780 --> 07:43:40,340
magnetism. And this is a huge chapter. I don't think there's any other property that has

4812
07:43:41,140 --> 07:43:47,860
had such a profound impact on society as magnetism, as you're soon going to see.

4813
07:43:48,500 --> 07:43:55,300
I mean, if it weren't for the property of magnetism, electronics and electricity would not be

4814
07:43:55,300 --> 07:44:03,060
what it is today. It's really that simple. So with that introduction, let's forge ahead with

4815
07:44:03,060 --> 07:44:07,700
chapter nine, magnetism. After completing this chapter, you're going to be able to identify

4816
07:44:07,700 --> 07:44:15,460
three types of magnets, describe the basic shapes of magnets, describe the difference between

4817
07:44:15,460 --> 07:44:20,900
permanent magnets and temporary magnets, describe how the earth functions as a magnet,

4818
07:44:21,540 --> 07:44:28,980
state the laws of magnetism, explain magnetism based on the theory of atoms and electron spin,

4819
07:44:29,700 --> 07:44:36,020
explain magnetism based on the domain theory, identify flux lines of their significance,

4820
07:44:36,660 --> 07:44:42,340
define permeability, describe the magnetic effects of current flowing through a conductor,

4821
07:44:42,980 --> 07:44:48,180
describe the principle of an electromagnet, describe how to determine the polarity of an

4822
07:44:48,180 --> 07:44:56,420
electromagnet using the left hand rule, define magnetic induction, define retentivity and residual

4823
07:44:56,420 --> 07:45:02,100
magnetism, define a magnetic shield, describe how magnetism is used to generate electricity,

4824
07:45:02,660 --> 07:45:07,460
state the basic laws of magnetism, describe how the left hand rule for generators can be

4825
07:45:07,460 --> 07:45:12,820
used to determine the polarity of induced voltage, describe how AC and DC generators

4826
07:45:12,820 --> 07:45:18,260
convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, describe how a relay operates as an

4827
07:45:18,260 --> 07:45:23,700
electromechanical switch, discuss the similarities between a doorbell in a relay, discuss the

4828
07:45:23,700 --> 07:45:29,780
similarities between a solenoid in a relay, describe how a magnetic phonograph cartridge

4829
07:45:29,780 --> 07:45:36,260
works, describe how a loudspeaker works, describe how information can be stored and retrieved using

4830
07:45:36,260 --> 07:45:43,860
magnetic recording and describe how a DC motor operates. I don't think we've had any chapter

4831
07:45:43,860 --> 07:45:50,020
up to this point that has had so many objectives and this just shows us the far-reaching hand

4832
07:45:50,020 --> 07:45:57,060
of the property of magnetism. It's everywhere. All the magic that's done in today's society is

4833
07:45:57,060 --> 07:46:08,020
brought to us really by magnetism. I'm not bragging about it. It's really what takes place.

4834
07:46:09,540 --> 07:46:17,860
Magnets. There's really several different types, three types. Natural magnet is derived from

4835
07:46:17,860 --> 07:46:25,540
magnetite and it just so happens that I've got a couple pieces of magnetite in my pocket.

4836
07:46:25,540 --> 07:46:31,140
These are natural magnets. It's like found in the earth's crust. Here it is. We'll pass this

4837
07:46:31,140 --> 07:46:38,660
around and we'll let you play with polished magnetite. That's kind of cool stuff.

4838
07:46:39,620 --> 07:46:43,140
So that's found in the earth's crust and it's just a natural magnet.

4839
07:46:43,140 --> 07:46:49,540
Artificial magnet could be created by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a piece of magnetite.

4840
07:46:49,540 --> 07:46:56,100
So if you've got a piece of soft iron and I see underneath what the heck are you doing under there,

4841
07:46:56,660 --> 07:47:03,140
I'm creating an artificial magnet by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a piece of magnetite.

4842
07:47:03,140 --> 07:47:06,980
And what it's going to do is it's going to pull that magnetic property off of the magnetite and

4843
07:47:06,980 --> 07:47:13,540
transfer it to your piece of soft metal. Actually, that's a trick with a lot of mechanics. If you

4844
07:47:14,340 --> 07:47:19,540
magnetize the tip of a screwdriver, it comes in handy for picking up things that you drop

4845
07:47:20,180 --> 07:47:27,220
into odd places. Finally, the third type of a magnet is an electromagnetic magnet.

4846
07:47:27,220 --> 07:47:33,220
This is created by current flowing through a coil of wire. Basically, when we pass current

4847
07:47:33,220 --> 07:47:39,380
through a coil of wire, we're going to develop a magnetic field. And in concentrating that,

4848
07:47:39,380 --> 07:47:44,180
that's how we have an electromagnet. So electromagnets range in size from very,

4849
07:47:44,180 --> 07:47:49,380
very small to, if you've ever seen like at a junkyard, a scrapyard, on a crane,

4850
07:47:49,380 --> 07:47:54,180
they've got an electromagnet. You turn it on, it like, you know, picks up a car or whatever.

4851
07:47:54,180 --> 07:47:59,940
Actually, my favorite application, I'm a big James Bond fan. Remember that Jaws dude? It was like,

4852
07:47:59,940 --> 07:48:04,260
you know, like biting things, like train cars and stuff. And you know, they turned on the big

4853
07:48:04,260 --> 07:48:09,940
electromagnet, boom, pal. You get pulled right up to the ceiling on that. So that was a giant

4854
07:48:09,940 --> 07:48:17,940
electromagnet. I'd hate to have your credit cards anywhere near that as your credit cards have

4855
07:48:17,940 --> 07:48:25,140
magnetic strips on it and a strong electromagnet will probably desensitize those cards. Here's

4856
07:48:25,140 --> 07:48:31,700
some examples of some magnets coming variety. It's my personal collection. Just kidding. This is

4857
07:48:31,700 --> 07:48:38,820
torrid core, meaning it's a donut shaped. It's circular. This is a standard bar magnet. This

4858
07:48:38,820 --> 07:48:43,140
would be like a horseshoe magnet because it kind of looks like a horseshoe. The thing to remember

4859
07:48:43,140 --> 07:48:48,260
is that all these magnets are going to have a north pole and a south pole, even that magnetite

4860
07:48:48,260 --> 07:48:54,660
that we're passing around there. If you try holding it unusual, it won't even attach each other.

4861
07:48:54,660 --> 07:49:00,660
Basically, the reason that those four pieces of magnetite are attracted to each other is because

4862
07:49:00,660 --> 07:49:05,540
the north pole is attracted to the south pole of the other magnet, which is attracted to the north

4863
07:49:05,540 --> 07:49:11,220
pole, the south pole of the other magnet. North and north ain't going to work. Permanent magnets

4864
07:49:11,220 --> 07:49:18,340
retain their magnetic properties. That's why they're called permanent magnets. Temporary magnets

4865
07:49:18,340 --> 07:49:23,940
are only going to retain a small portion of their magnetic properties. That's why they're called

4866
07:49:24,020 --> 07:49:31,380
temporary. Over time, that magnetic field may deteriorate or be altered. Permanent magnet

4867
07:49:31,380 --> 07:49:37,700
will retain the magnetic properties. Now, this is kind of cool, and I'm sure it's no surprise to

4868
07:49:37,700 --> 07:49:46,340
any of you. The earth is a giant freaking magnet. It has to do with the core of the earth and then

4869
07:49:46,340 --> 07:49:56,020
the crust. We basically have a giant north pole and we have a giant south pole. The problem about

4870
07:49:56,020 --> 07:50:01,060
the north pole and the south pole, I got to give you a geography lesson here. If I wanted to go

4871
07:50:01,060 --> 07:50:11,220
find Santa Claus, where would I look and how would I get there? How could I navigate my way to this

4872
07:50:11,220 --> 07:50:19,540
place? With a compass, and where am I trying to get to? Okay, so you want me to use a compass

4873
07:50:19,540 --> 07:50:26,100
to try to get to the north pole to try to find Santa Claus? To get to the magnetic north pole.

4874
07:50:26,980 --> 07:50:32,420
If I get to the magnetic north pole, am I going to find Santa Claus? No, nowhere to be found.

4875
07:50:32,980 --> 07:50:37,060
In order for me to find Santa Claus, what am I going to have to do? I'm going to have to go to the

4876
07:50:37,540 --> 07:50:48,820
north pole, or the north geographic pole, which is literally the top of the earth.

4877
07:50:50,660 --> 07:50:53,940
Anybody want to take a wild guess what the best way of getting up there might be?

4878
07:50:56,500 --> 07:50:56,980
What's that?

4879
07:50:59,460 --> 07:51:01,540
Well, I'm talking about means of transportation.

4880
07:51:01,940 --> 07:51:18,420
Submarine. Yeah, you could be in a short sleeve shirt and go up there, surface at the north pole,

4881
07:51:18,420 --> 07:51:22,340
because it's underneath the Arctic Ocean. So you could surface at the north pole.

4882
07:51:22,340 --> 07:51:28,020
So I just happened to flaunt that. I actually have never been to the north pole. My submarine has

4883
07:51:28,020 --> 07:51:35,460
been to the north pole. At home, I've got water from the north pole in a vial from my submarine

4884
07:51:35,460 --> 07:51:39,060
that went to the north pole. My submarine actually delivered, believe it or not,

4885
07:51:39,060 --> 07:51:45,220
Al Gore to the north pole. It was after I was off the sub, but they did a mission

4886
07:51:45,220 --> 07:51:52,020
and went to the north geographic pole. Typically on the ice, they've put a lot of research camps

4887
07:51:52,980 --> 07:51:59,140
to conduct research, magnetic research. I mean, that's the place to do it.

4888
07:51:59,860 --> 07:52:06,100
So the north magnetic pole is, this is this illustration. It's an artist depiction. It's

4889
07:52:06,100 --> 07:52:13,700
not very accurate. The north geographic pole is going to be somewhere up here up north of Labrador,

4890
07:52:14,740 --> 07:52:20,980
and it moves about two kilometers per year, and it's actually moving in a northwestern lead

4891
07:52:21,060 --> 07:52:27,940
direction. And the variance, the magnetic variance. Anybody know the magnetic variance?

4892
07:52:27,940 --> 07:52:32,260
The difference here between the north pole geographic pole and where the north magnetic

4893
07:52:32,260 --> 07:52:38,260
pole is? I know because I'm a pilot, and it's kind of important, okay? Because if I start flying

4894
07:52:38,260 --> 07:52:43,620
northbound or whatever, which am I going geographic north or am I going magnetic north?

4895
07:52:43,620 --> 07:52:49,460
And the difference here in the Seattle area is between 19 and 20 degrees difference.

4896
07:52:50,020 --> 07:52:57,300
It's pretty significant. So this hallway right out here in this wing is aligned pretty much with

4897
07:52:57,300 --> 07:53:01,860
the north geographic pole. If you could walk straight, which none of us could do, we've got

4898
07:53:01,860 --> 07:53:06,580
a dominant leg, and you walked out this hall and just kept walking north. Eventually you're going

4899
07:53:06,580 --> 07:53:11,620
to get to the north pole flying Santa Claus. It's all going to be good. If you had a compass and you

4900
07:53:11,620 --> 07:53:18,100
stepped outside the door here and you looked, that north magnetic pole is going to be literally

4901
07:53:18,820 --> 07:53:23,540
over in this direction here. So it's very important because again in the aircraft,

4902
07:53:23,540 --> 07:53:31,860
you've got a compass, you set your gyro compass for that magnetic heading. And I bet you folks never

4903
07:53:31,860 --> 07:53:37,060
realized magnetic properties had such a profound impact on all these different things. If any of

4904
07:53:37,060 --> 07:53:48,020
you are familiar with airports, airport runways are designated based on their magnetic heading.

4905
07:53:48,900 --> 07:53:54,580
So C-TAC airport, C-TAC airport's got three runways, but they're all parallel with each other.

4906
07:53:54,580 --> 07:54:02,500
So they all have the same numbers. If you're headed southbound, typically when we have crappy

4907
07:54:02,500 --> 07:54:06,500
weather here in Seattle, if you look up and you see an airplane going on the C-TAC, what he's

4908
07:54:06,500 --> 07:54:12,580
going to do is he's going to fly out over like Magnolia, then turn inbound, and then what he's

4909
07:54:12,580 --> 07:54:20,500
going to do is land on runway 16. Because if you rounded that, it's on a compass heading of 160.

4910
07:54:21,380 --> 07:54:24,820
So how do you make sure you're, you know, since there's three runways down there, because we

4911
07:54:24,820 --> 07:54:28,340
all remember those of us that have lived in the area a while, that third runway when they put

4912
07:54:28,340 --> 07:54:36,740
it in, it was very controversial. It's 16 left, 16 center, and 16 right. That's how they designate

4913
07:54:36,740 --> 07:54:43,140
which runway you're cleared to land on. Add 180 degrees to that, and you end up with what?

4914
07:54:44,420 --> 07:54:55,700
Runway, no, 16 plus 180 degrees, runway 34. So if you're landing northbound at C-TAC airport,

4915
07:54:55,700 --> 07:55:03,620
you're cleared to land on runway 34 center, 34 left, or 34 right. Okay. Ironically, and the

4916
07:55:03,620 --> 07:55:09,300
reason that they select runways is they do wind studies to determine where the prevailing winds

4917
07:55:09,300 --> 07:55:14,260
are. You want to take off into the wind, and you want to land into the wind. So primarily here in

4918
07:55:14,260 --> 07:55:21,060
central Puget Sound, that's pretty much how all the runways are. Auburn airport, 1634,

4919
07:55:21,060 --> 07:55:30,900
Renton airport, 1634. C-TAC, 1634. Boeing field is a little bit different. It's runway 31 northbound,

4920
07:55:30,900 --> 07:55:37,300
so there's going to be a slight variance in runway 13 in the opposite direction. That's just how the

4921
07:55:37,300 --> 07:55:44,500
winds are kind of funneled there by the location of Boeing field. But Renton airport used to

4922
07:55:46,740 --> 07:55:53,860
be runway 33, but because of that magnetic procession, what they've had to do is they've

4923
07:55:53,860 --> 07:55:57,060
had to renumber. Do you think, oh, it's no big deal. You send a guy out there with a can of paint,

4924
07:55:57,060 --> 07:56:01,060
and you paint the new number on the runway. It's not that easy. All of the procedures,

4925
07:56:01,060 --> 07:56:05,620
all of the approach procedures, all of the publications, all of the databases all have

4926
07:56:05,620 --> 07:56:10,740
to be updated. It's really a big thing. So eventually, all runways are going to have to

4927
07:56:10,740 --> 07:56:15,700
change their number as that north magnetic pole continues to fluctuate. Why am I telling you

4928
07:56:15,700 --> 07:56:21,220
this in an electronics class? A lot of you are going to go to work in industries that are associated

4929
07:56:21,220 --> 07:56:26,020
with electronic navigation. And you got to know this. I mean, you don't have to memorize it. I'm

4930
07:56:26,020 --> 07:56:31,460
not going to quiz you on this magnetic procession in the 1920 degrees variance here in Seattle.

4931
07:56:31,460 --> 07:56:35,140
But a lot of you are going to go to work in electronic navigation systems, and you need

4932
07:56:35,140 --> 07:56:43,140
to understand the difference between the two. Makes sense? The laws of magnetism. I think most

4933
07:56:43,140 --> 07:56:49,060
of you probably remember this from elementary school. Unlike magnetic poles attract each other,

4934
07:56:49,060 --> 07:56:53,460
right? Unlike a track. So north is going to be attracted to a south. The south is going to be

4935
07:56:53,460 --> 07:56:59,460
attracted to a north. Like magnetic poles repel each other. North and a north, they're going to

4936
07:56:59,460 --> 07:57:04,660
push each other away. South and a south, push each other away. This is actually kind of interesting

4937
07:57:04,660 --> 07:57:12,180
too, because it has some applications now, like magnetic levitation. Some of these rail systems

4938
07:57:12,180 --> 07:57:16,740
that they're actually, the whole train, levitates magnetically. That's how they're doing it. That's

4939
07:57:16,740 --> 07:57:21,860
how you get a whole train to levitate. Because north pole and the north pole, they'll basically push

4940
07:57:21,940 --> 07:57:28,020
each other away. And then once you've got something floating like that, it doesn't take a whole lot

4941
07:57:28,020 --> 07:57:33,060
of energy to move a train. I mean, think about that. That's, I don't know if you've ever even

4942
07:57:33,060 --> 07:57:40,420
thought about why do we use trains. I mean trains, that wheel on a rail, very little friction.

4943
07:57:40,420 --> 07:57:47,220
So it takes very little energy to move a bunch of stuff, right? If you could kick it up even a

4944
07:57:47,220 --> 07:57:53,220
notch further. I mean, we still have to overcome the friction of the bearings and the axle and

4945
07:57:53,220 --> 07:57:58,420
the wheels on the track. Now, if you could levitate the entire train magnetically,

4946
07:57:58,420 --> 07:58:02,820
then just give it a little push and that thing's going to be able to move with hardly any energy.

4947
07:58:02,820 --> 07:58:08,580
So these are a lot of the advancements that we probably want to stay tuned for, because in the

4948
07:58:08,580 --> 07:58:15,540
name of efficiency, we're trying to play with a lot of this stuff. Color code for magnets. Color

4949
07:58:15,540 --> 07:58:22,260
code for magnets. Red is the color code that we use for north pole. Blue is the color code that

4950
07:58:22,260 --> 07:58:30,980
we use for the south pole. So if we were going in search of Santa Claus and we got to the north

4951
07:58:30,980 --> 07:58:36,260
geographic pole, what, how would we know we got there? What would we see?

4952
07:58:36,580 --> 07:58:44,900
There'd probably be reindeer, but what color pole would there be?

4953
07:58:45,780 --> 07:58:49,700
Red and white, very good. Red and white pole. We know that. Candy cane, right?

4954
07:58:49,700 --> 07:58:52,100
If you were at the south pole, what color would the pole be?

4955
07:58:54,580 --> 07:58:58,980
Blue and white. Striped pole, right? I mean, if you got to follow that same tradition.

4956
07:59:00,020 --> 07:59:03,860
If you're outside a place that has a pole that's red, white, and blue, where are you?

4957
07:59:04,820 --> 07:59:08,340
Bingo. Excellent. Very good. I got students that just...

4958
07:59:10,500 --> 07:59:13,220
Same students that don't know what a barbershop is.

4959
07:59:15,220 --> 07:59:18,580
I like the barbershop. That's how I roll. That's my thing.

4960
07:59:19,540 --> 07:59:24,820
So yeah, that's the color code for magnets. Magnetism, the property of magnetism,

4961
07:59:24,820 --> 07:59:32,820
can be traced to the atom. As electrons orbit the nucleus, they also spin on their axis.

4962
07:59:33,940 --> 07:59:41,940
This electrostatic charge produces a magnetic field. So even these electrons are going to

4963
07:59:41,940 --> 07:59:51,300
have magnetic properties. The direction of the magnetic field is the same as the electrons'

4964
07:59:51,300 --> 08:00:01,620
direction of spin. So even at a subatomic level, we're going to have properties of magnetism.

4965
08:00:04,100 --> 08:00:10,100
Ferromagnetic materials, ferro, meaning materials that contain ferrite,

4966
08:00:10,100 --> 08:00:16,660
this is the stuff that will rust. If the metal will rust, it contains a high amount of ferrite.

4967
08:00:16,660 --> 08:00:24,420
So any ferromagnetic materials are materials that respond to magnetic fields. Any of you have

4968
08:00:25,140 --> 08:00:32,100
magnets at home stuck to your refrigerator? Your refrigerator is made out of a ferromagnetic

4969
08:00:32,100 --> 08:00:38,740
material. If it were not painted, it would rust, plain and simple. If not, the magnets wouldn't stick

4970
08:00:38,740 --> 08:00:43,700
to it. It's actually the old trick too, if you're going and buying a used car or whatever and you're

4971
08:00:43,700 --> 08:00:49,700
looking for Bondo, right? Put a magnet over it and obviously if it sticks, you know that that's

4972
08:00:49,700 --> 08:00:54,980
all original with no Bondo. You know, you all of a sudden get to an area and that magnet doesn't

4973
08:00:54,980 --> 08:01:00,580
want to stick. Don't try this with a Corvette. Of course, Corvette is a fiberglass. And actually,

4974
08:01:00,580 --> 08:01:06,580
with all the cars now, with all the plastic on them, magnets aren't going to stick well to plastic.

4975
08:01:08,020 --> 08:01:15,460
Atoms combine into domains or groups. When un-magnetized, the domains are random.

4976
08:01:15,460 --> 08:01:19,940
This is what we're looking at here in this illustration. This is random domains, okay?

4977
08:01:19,940 --> 08:01:26,180
This is an un-magnetized piece of ferromagnetic material.

4978
08:01:26,340 --> 08:01:36,340
As soon as we magnetize it, watch, this is kind of cool, boom. When magnetized, the domains align in a

4979
08:01:36,340 --> 08:01:44,340
common direction and the material becomes a magnet. So if you've got my magnetite that we're passing

4980
08:01:44,340 --> 08:01:51,620
around and you rub a screwdriver up against that, this is ultimately what's going to happen.

4981
08:01:51,620 --> 08:01:55,380
You're going to align those domains and it's going to become magnetic.

4982
08:01:58,980 --> 08:02:01,540
What would it do between a ferro and non-ferro metal again?

4983
08:02:03,380 --> 08:02:09,860
Ferro contains ferrite and that's the iron content that makes stuff rust, basically.

4984
08:02:15,300 --> 08:02:20,580
Now a magnetic field. A magnetic field. This is kind of where you got to hit the I believe

4985
08:02:20,580 --> 08:02:29,860
button, right? It's invisible lines of force that surround a magnet. These invisible lines are called

4986
08:02:29,860 --> 08:02:36,420
flux lines. We got to be careful because those of you in ELEC 115 are learning about flux, right?

4987
08:02:36,420 --> 08:02:42,420
It's a different kind of flux. There's two types of flux in electronics. There's magnetic flux that

4988
08:02:42,420 --> 08:02:48,980
we're talking about tonight and there's also flux that we use as a cleaning agent for soldering,

4989
08:02:49,860 --> 08:02:54,660
okay? You're not going to use a magnetic field for cleaning and soldering to the best of my

4990
08:02:54,660 --> 08:03:00,340
knowledge and magnetic field has never been used as a cleaning agent. Flux, however, is used as a

4991
08:03:00,340 --> 08:03:06,260
cleaning agent, different type of flux. So this word has two meanings in electronics and don't forget

4992
08:03:06,260 --> 08:03:10,180
one of the reasons that you're here is to learn the language of electronics. I wish I had had

4993
08:03:10,180 --> 08:03:14,660
me as an instructor because I was kind of like flux and I was like, why are we going to use magnetic

4994
08:03:14,660 --> 08:03:21,780
lines of force to clean something and make it more soluble? Nobody ever explained that to me

4995
08:03:21,780 --> 08:03:27,620
and I wasn't the smartest student. These flux lines have polarity and that polarity is north

4996
08:03:27,620 --> 08:03:37,540
to south, north to south and it always forms a complete loop. They do not cross each other

4997
08:03:37,540 --> 08:03:50,260
and they tend to form the smallest possible loop. Some of you may have done this like in

4998
08:03:50,260 --> 08:03:56,820
third grade. You've got a magnet, bar magnet, you've got a piece of paper and on top of that piece

4999
08:03:56,820 --> 08:04:03,780
of paper you sprinkle iron filings. The iron filings will actually form a pattern and that

5000
08:04:03,780 --> 08:04:12,020
pattern that you see is the invisible lines of force. It is the flux lines. That's exactly what

5001
08:04:12,020 --> 08:04:20,340
you're doing by spreading those iron filings on that is seeing the lines of flux as a visual aid,

5002
08:04:20,340 --> 08:04:29,540
if you will. Permiability, there's a new word for you, permeability is the ability of a material

5003
08:04:29,620 --> 08:04:36,980
to accept magnetic lines of force. An example of something that has a high level of permeability

5004
08:04:36,980 --> 08:04:43,300
would be your refrigerator at home if you've got magnets stuck to it.

5005
08:04:45,700 --> 08:04:51,300
My last refrigerator that I bought and you never, how many of you here like buy a refrigerator because

5006
08:04:51,300 --> 08:04:56,100
like you got nothing better to do and how many of you like buy a refrigerator because your food

5007
08:04:56,100 --> 08:05:01,540
is all spoiled and your old one died. I mean that's normally how you go about it. My last

5008
08:05:01,540 --> 08:05:11,620
refrigerator I was like in a panic and I found one and they never fit right. They've actually

5009
08:05:11,620 --> 08:05:16,980
made them bigger so if you want one to fit into the small hole you got to get a custom refrigerator.

5010
08:05:17,860 --> 08:05:24,980
A smaller custom refrigerator costs more than the big one that doesn't fit right. So I just got the

5011
08:05:24,980 --> 08:05:29,620
big one it doesn't fit right. It's bigger whatever but I get home and I paid a lot of money for this

5012
08:05:29,620 --> 08:05:34,420
thing and then I get my magnets and I got you know the magnets to put juniors work up on and

5013
08:05:34,420 --> 08:05:38,660
everything else and my favorite pizza place. Magnets won't even stick to this thing because

5014
08:05:38,660 --> 08:05:43,620
it's like this designer facade so you could, what the heck is this? I mean you know so you got to

5015
08:05:43,620 --> 08:05:48,100
put the magnets on the side. You got to put them on the side because the front is so that you could

5016
08:05:48,100 --> 08:05:53,940
make it you know I don't know. I just want something to keep my stuff cold. That's all I want.

5017
08:05:55,540 --> 08:06:00,900
So permeability is a material that readily accepts these lines of force.

5018
08:06:00,900 --> 08:06:05,620
If a magnet will stick to it it has a high level of permeability.

5019
08:06:07,620 --> 08:06:12,900
Now there's a direct correlation between electricity and magnetism probably why we're

5020
08:06:12,900 --> 08:06:19,060
talking about it tonight right in electronics program. A magnetic field is generated when

5021
08:06:19,060 --> 08:06:29,140
current flows through a wire period. Period. Let me say that again a magnetic field is generated

5022
08:06:29,140 --> 08:06:36,340
when current flows through a wire period. So when you plug something into an extension cord

5023
08:06:36,340 --> 08:06:45,700
is it generating a magnetic field? You bet you. When you have, when you connect a speaker up to

5024
08:06:45,700 --> 08:06:50,260
an amplifier and you've got current flowing through that wire to the speaker are you generating

5025
08:06:50,260 --> 08:06:58,660
a magnetic field? Yeah okay. Anytime current flows through a conductor you generate a magnetic field.

5026
08:06:59,700 --> 08:07:04,340
So if you could see magnetic fields and you had an energized piece of equipment you would see all

5027
08:07:04,340 --> 08:07:08,740
of these lines of flux that are being formed by simply turning a piece of electronics on.

5028
08:07:09,700 --> 08:07:16,340
By simply turning a piece of electronics on or an electrical circuit on you're generating lines of

5029
08:07:16,340 --> 08:07:21,300
flux. Sometimes it's something that we need to be aware of other times it's something we need to

5030
08:07:21,300 --> 08:07:26,660
discount. An example would be in your home okay. Typically how your house is wired up the magnetic

5031
08:07:26,660 --> 08:07:32,820
fields that are generated by your home are not sufficient enough to cause you any worries.

5032
08:07:32,820 --> 08:07:38,260
They're not going to demagnetize your credit cards. They're not going to you know screw up your

5033
08:07:38,260 --> 08:07:45,700
brain. You know it's but still they are generating magnetic fields. There's no way around it.

5034
08:07:52,500 --> 08:07:57,860
Yeah and again with some computer screens there's some higher frequencies that are used and I mean

5035
08:07:57,860 --> 08:08:04,100
it's the same thing. You know is it harmful or harmless? I don't know. There's also some laws

5036
08:08:04,100 --> 08:08:10,740
on the books about building schools underneath power lines. You know so if there was nothing there

5037
08:08:10,740 --> 08:08:15,940
why are there laws on the book about that? You know I've never had an interest of well my only

5038
08:08:15,940 --> 08:08:21,620
interest of living underneath a power line would be able to perhaps tap into that magnetic field

5039
08:08:21,620 --> 08:08:26,580
and lower my power bill which of course would be illegal and not above board and I would never do

5040
08:08:26,580 --> 08:08:31,060
that but I never really had a whole lot of interest of like living underneath power lines.

5041
08:08:31,700 --> 08:08:37,380
You know because it's just an unknown. You just you just don't know because those high voltage

5042
08:08:37,380 --> 08:08:43,700
wires they move a lot of current through it. I mean you create huge magnetic fields. I don't know

5043
08:08:43,700 --> 08:08:48,660
if you you realize this but there if you get a fluorescent tube and you go underneath a lot of

5044
08:08:48,660 --> 08:08:52,580
these high voltage wire you could you could excite the gases inside the fluorescent tube and light

5045
08:08:52,980 --> 08:08:59,700
look mom it's lighting up with no strings attached so if it could ionize gas inside a fluorescent

5046
08:08:59,700 --> 08:09:04,260
tube you know what's it doing to your you know I don't know about you you know but I've had a

5047
08:09:04,260 --> 08:09:08,500
pretty good life I got a lot of good memories I do not want to scramble those memories so I'm

5048
08:09:08,500 --> 08:09:13,460
going to keep my brain away from magnetic fields and anything else that will alter some of these

5049
08:09:13,460 --> 08:09:31,300
fond memories that I have from my youth so this is exactly what it would look like here

5050
08:09:31,300 --> 08:09:37,300
we have current flowing through a conductor and we're going to generate this magnetic field around

5051
08:09:37,300 --> 08:09:53,540
the outside um if the magnetic field is strong enough stuff would stick to it normally the

5052
08:09:53,540 --> 08:10:00,900
magnetic field is is not that strong so stuff won't necessarily stick to it like iron filings are

5053
08:10:00,900 --> 08:10:06,820
not necessarily going to be attracted you know to a low energy circuit that's energized but

5054
08:10:07,620 --> 08:10:11,700
that being said there's still a magnetic field there it's just not strong enough to

5055
08:10:11,700 --> 08:10:18,980
you know attract an iron filing you know to to stick to the circuit thank goodness you know or

5056
08:10:18,980 --> 08:10:26,420
whenever we turned anything on it would be you know now yeah it would it would have to be a

5057
08:10:26,420 --> 08:10:31,940
significant enough field to attract you know current to do that the current going through it

5058
08:10:31,940 --> 08:10:36,740
would have to be sufficient enough to create a big enough magnetic field to attract an iron filing

5059
08:10:38,180 --> 08:10:44,900
electromagnets composed of many turns of wire close together because as I as I just said one

5060
08:10:44,900 --> 08:10:50,420
piece of wire may not be strong enough what happens if you get that and then you wrap it around again

5061
08:10:50,420 --> 08:10:56,020
now you just doubled it you do it a third time you tripled it fourth time quadrupled it the

5062
08:10:56,020 --> 08:11:01,780
math is simple the math is is that simple so every time with a winding you add a winding you're

5063
08:11:01,780 --> 08:11:07,460
increasing it that magnetic field that you're generating by it so the principle of an electromagnet

5064
08:11:07,460 --> 08:11:16,660
when wire is twisted into a loop the flux lines are brought together the flux lines are then

5065
08:11:16,660 --> 08:11:25,300
concentrated at the center of the loop and we establish a north and south pole anytime you

5066
08:11:25,380 --> 08:11:30,020
create a magnetic field you're creating both a north pole and a south pole

5067
08:11:33,220 --> 08:11:40,100
the strength of the magnetic field can be increased three ways the more turns of wire the more

5068
08:11:40,100 --> 08:11:44,980
flux lines are going to be added together and concentrated the greater the current

5069
08:11:46,420 --> 08:11:51,620
the greater the number of flux lines that are going to be generated okay this only carries you

5070
08:11:51,620 --> 08:11:56,340
so far though because what happens you're passing current through what

5071
08:11:58,900 --> 08:12:02,500
a piece of wire what property does wire have associated with it

5072
08:12:03,220 --> 08:12:10,100
resistance so you just can't keep increasing the current because if you keep increasing the

5073
08:12:10,100 --> 08:12:16,260
current eventually what's going to happen it's going to become a fuse I mean even if the wire is

5074
08:12:16,260 --> 08:12:20,420
this thick you have enough current go through wire that's this thick eventually you're going to

5075
08:12:20,820 --> 08:12:28,500
part that wire okay and it's going to begin to get hot and so it could cause an electrical fire

5076
08:12:28,500 --> 08:12:33,940
so you just can't keep saying it let me take another step back you know what kind of wire

5077
08:12:33,940 --> 08:12:39,300
we're going to use to make these coils we're going to use what's called magnetic wire and

5078
08:12:39,300 --> 08:12:46,260
magnetic wire is not wire that's inherently magnetic magnetic wire is wire that's used to make

5079
08:12:46,260 --> 08:12:53,460
windings and what it is is thin copper wire but it has a a lacquer coating on the outside

5080
08:12:53,460 --> 08:13:00,420
there's an example right there outstanding that's magnetic wire okay and it looks like copper wire

5081
08:13:00,420 --> 08:13:06,340
and it is copper wire but on the outside is a thin lacquer coating that lacquer coating

5082
08:13:06,340 --> 08:13:12,820
acts as an insulator an electrical insulator to prevent the wire from shorting because if I wound

5083
08:13:13,380 --> 08:13:18,740
wire over itself why would current want to go all the way keep going through the wire it would

5084
08:13:18,740 --> 08:13:25,860
just short right out okay so we have to keep it insulated by by using that lacquer on it so

5085
08:13:25,860 --> 08:13:29,780
let's get back to this bullet statement here the greater the current the greater the number of

5086
08:13:29,780 --> 08:13:34,740
flux line generated I'm going to get to a point that I cramped so much current through that coil

5087
08:13:34,740 --> 08:13:39,540
it's going to begin to get hot if any of you have ever done paint removal you know that that

5088
08:13:39,620 --> 08:13:44,020
paint removal when you're using a heat gun works really really good for removing paint

5089
08:13:44,020 --> 08:13:50,500
it works good on removing lacquer too so once you ask have too much current go through that coil

5090
08:13:50,500 --> 08:13:55,300
you're going to compromise that lacquer coating and that's the end of your coil by the way if

5091
08:13:55,300 --> 08:14:02,020
any of you have ever smelt a coil that's the end of the coil by the time you smell it it's over

5092
08:14:02,020 --> 08:14:08,180
with you've already compromised the integrity of it it'll never work right again transformers

5093
08:14:08,180 --> 08:14:14,020
motors coils any of that stuff any of that stuff if you smell it if it gets that hot forget it

5094
08:14:15,860 --> 08:14:24,020
another way that we could increase the magnetic field is we could insert a ferromagnetic

5095
08:14:24,020 --> 08:14:29,860
core into the center of the coil usually iron iron has a high level of permeability

5096
08:14:29,860 --> 08:14:34,740
by putting it into the center of the coil and unwrapping the coil around it it's going to

5097
08:14:34,740 --> 08:14:41,060
enhance the magnetic characteristics so by putting in a ferromagnetic core it's going to enhance

5098
08:14:41,700 --> 08:14:52,820
the characteristics now magnetic induction is the effect a magnet has on an object without physical

5099
08:14:52,820 --> 08:15:01,700
contact the effect the magnet has on an object without physical contact this is the cool thing

5100
08:15:01,700 --> 08:15:06,980
and i think some of you were playing around even with these uh with these magnets here right

5101
08:15:06,980 --> 08:15:10,100
and how they're not even touching

5102
08:15:13,780 --> 08:15:14,340
but yeah

5103
08:15:17,220 --> 08:15:21,140
it's having an effect on the other magnet that's magnetic induction

5104
08:15:21,300 --> 08:15:32,420
on residual magnetism is the magnetic field that remains when an object is separated from a magnet

5105
08:15:38,180 --> 08:15:41,620
we used to have literally a big problem with residual magnetism

5106
08:15:43,300 --> 08:15:47,140
this is something that i might i don't know if any of you want to make a wild guess at this here

5107
08:15:47,140 --> 08:15:53,700
i'm thinking of a very very large object that developed magnetic properties

5108
08:15:56,100 --> 08:16:00,420
and those magnetic properties needed to be removed or it could compromise the position

5109
08:16:00,980 --> 08:16:06,900
of this large steel cylindrical object

5110
08:16:09,220 --> 08:16:16,020
submarine submarine big big big problem in submarineing

5111
08:16:16,980 --> 08:16:23,300
because the submarine being made out of a ferromagnetic material would pick up the earth's

5112
08:16:23,300 --> 08:16:30,260
magnetic field and gradually it would become magnetized and the problem was

5113
08:16:32,260 --> 08:16:37,940
there was equipment that would detect the magnetic anomaly so there's no way of seeing

5114
08:16:37,940 --> 08:16:41,940
a submarine and some of our submarines are so quiet you would never even hear the submarine

5115
08:16:42,660 --> 08:16:48,660
but if you're flying in an anti-submarine warfare aircraft and you pick up a magnetic

5116
08:16:48,660 --> 08:16:57,380
anomaly a large submerged contact that's creating a magnetic variation chances are

5117
08:16:57,380 --> 08:17:05,060
you found a submarine so this is exactly what if any of you ever go up around would be island and

5118
08:17:05,060 --> 08:17:13,780
you see those uh the big four engine turboprop aircraft p-3s no not those those are awaks those

5119
08:17:13,780 --> 08:17:20,020
are like airborne command posts the p-3 orion is a submarine hunter and off the back of it

5120
08:17:20,020 --> 08:17:24,980
you'll see like this little thing that looks like a stinger and that's what that is is called mad

5121
08:17:24,980 --> 08:17:31,060
gear magnetic anomaly detection so when you're flying around typically what they they just wouldn't

5122
08:17:31,060 --> 08:17:37,140
be looking for a magnetic anomaly what they would typically do is have a circular scan radar on

5123
08:17:37,140 --> 08:17:43,380
radar so when they stick up a periscope all of a sudden they get a blip blip if it's a good radar

5124
08:17:43,380 --> 08:17:49,620
operator that's all it takes are two two blips and then he'll shut the radar down so what they'll

5125
08:17:49,620 --> 08:17:55,620
do is they'll continue to fly and then he'll go to a sector scan okay so from a circular scan blip

5126
08:17:56,260 --> 08:18:00,660
blip then he'll shut it off then he'll get he'll he knows where he's looking for because he saw it

5127
08:18:00,660 --> 08:18:06,660
on the radar screen he'll go to a sector scan right sector scan is back and forth like this so

5128
08:18:06,660 --> 08:18:12,660
then off it's gonna be and then he'll shut the radar off and then he'll drive his cursor over to

5129
08:18:12,660 --> 08:18:18,260
where he had that contact and hit enter autopilot will bring the airplane to that point in the ocean

5130
08:18:18,260 --> 08:18:23,780
and then the operator is looking at the mad gear and then all of a sudden they start to get a magnetic

5131
08:18:23,780 --> 08:18:30,420
anomaly at that point they pop a flare out over the target if you're at war at that point the

5132
08:18:30,420 --> 08:18:35,700
aircraft is going to go into a bank start to open the bomb bay doors fly right over that point put

5133
08:18:35,700 --> 08:18:40,740
a torpedo in the water it's a smart torpedo it's going to find the target and blow it up that's how

5134
08:18:40,740 --> 08:18:48,020
you die in a submarine in a combat situation okay the only thing that we would know my job was to

5135
08:18:48,020 --> 08:18:54,260
detect that so i was good at picking up the blip blip but again the good guys the good operators

5136
08:18:54,260 --> 08:19:00,260
two sweeps two sweeps and they'd pick you up the british came out with a radar that basically 400

5137
08:19:00,260 --> 08:19:05,700
miles away could spot a beer can floating in the water so it's kind of like when i saw that technology

5138
08:19:05,700 --> 08:19:09,700
can't come out i'm like you know i think it's time for me to move on to a different career

5139
08:19:09,700 --> 08:19:14,660
because if this turns into a shooting war we're dead really quick you know really really quick

5140
08:19:15,300 --> 08:19:21,620
so to get rid of this residual magnetism um if any of you aren't the boating or fishing and you

5141
08:19:21,620 --> 08:19:26,500
ever have the opportunity to get on hood canal don't get too close to the submarine base because

5142
08:19:26,500 --> 08:19:31,060
they have gun boats and stuff and it's all restricted area but over at the sub submarine base

5143
08:19:31,060 --> 08:19:36,820
in banger they've got a giant pier it's a degausing pier and what they'll do is pull an entire trident

5144
08:19:36,820 --> 08:19:43,700
submarine into it and pull off that magnetic field and get it back to just an un-magnetized

5145
08:19:44,420 --> 08:19:50,260
piece of of steel but over time that magnetic field will build up again and it needs to be

5146
08:19:50,260 --> 08:19:54,980
stripped off periodically or you're going to have a real profound magnetic signature

5147
08:19:59,700 --> 08:20:04,420
correct yeah i told you i'd have to kill you

5148
08:20:07,940 --> 08:20:11,860
a lot of it depends where you operate to and what the magnetic you know i mean if you're doing a

5149
08:20:11,860 --> 08:20:15,620
lot of stuff up north and there's some stronger magnetic variants you're going to pick that up

5150
08:20:15,620 --> 08:20:25,540
a lot quicker yeah because then if you keep track of what boats go in and it begins to paint an image

5151
08:20:30,500 --> 08:20:31,540
earth's magnetic field

5152
08:20:31,700 --> 08:20:37,540
earth's magnetic giant magnetic field

5153
08:20:47,860 --> 08:20:52,660
and then again we see this manifest itself like with the aurora borealis if any of you

5154
08:20:52,660 --> 08:20:58,980
ever seen the aurora borealis i had the opportunity in february i went up to fairbanks

5155
08:20:59,540 --> 08:21:06,900
and they say that if you're up there between october and april for three nights basically you

5156
08:21:06,900 --> 08:21:13,060
stand a 90 chance of seeing the aurora borealis so we were up there for the flight up there we saw

5157
08:21:13,060 --> 08:21:17,300
him from the airplane the first two nights i mean it was it was phenomenal i mean we couldn't have

5158
08:21:17,300 --> 08:21:21,860
planned it any better because there was a huge solar flare and that's exactly that earth's magnetic

5159
08:21:21,860 --> 08:21:28,420
field is attracting the charged particles so as soon as they get the upper regions of the atmosphere

5160
08:21:28,420 --> 08:21:34,900
they ionize so literally it's like a neon light except that's in the sky so i should bring in

5161
08:21:34,900 --> 08:21:38,820
some pictures and show you i mean just it was breathtaking just phenomenal you're just standing

5162
08:21:38,820 --> 08:21:46,100
there minus 23 degrees um it warmed up the the week prior it was like minus 47 or whatever and

5163
08:21:46,740 --> 08:21:51,140
i seriously even though i had gloves on and everything i had to take off my gloves to manipulate

5164
08:21:51,140 --> 08:21:56,500
the camera i ended up burning the tips of my fingers and it took about a week for me to get the

5165
08:21:56,500 --> 08:22:03,620
feeling back and it's very very dangerous but way cool you know way cool to see this and you

5166
08:22:03,620 --> 08:22:08,740
know people spend thousands and thousands of dollars to go up there and and and see that

5167
08:22:10,020 --> 08:22:16,340
but it's the magnetic field it's actually attracting that near the poles retentivity

5168
08:22:16,340 --> 08:22:22,500
is the ability of a material to retain its magnetic field after the magnetizing force

5169
08:22:22,500 --> 08:22:29,540
is removed so unfortunately a submarine hull has a high level of retentivity and um that magnetic

5170
08:22:29,540 --> 08:22:36,020
signature you want to strip that off because it's not desirable to have a submarine magnetized

5171
08:22:37,060 --> 08:22:43,060
now magnetic shields are made of low reluctance materials they're used to protect electronic

5172
08:22:43,060 --> 08:22:52,260
equipment from magnetic flux lines okay sometimes we need to protect the equipment from these

5173
08:22:52,260 --> 08:23:03,140
lines of of flux um because they could cause interference or even worse um let me kind of

5174
08:23:03,140 --> 08:23:08,420
back up for a second and then see if you could connect the dots on this we all understand that

5175
08:23:08,420 --> 08:23:18,180
when we apply current to a conductor we create a magnetic field right so bear with me if we have a

5176
08:23:18,180 --> 08:23:23,380
magnetic field that happens to pass through a conductor what do you think we're going to do

5177
08:23:28,020 --> 08:23:35,220
i'm going to create current yeah so basically if current creates a magnetic field an electromagnetic

5178
08:23:35,220 --> 08:23:40,900
field can create current um this is one of the things that they kind of figured out the hard

5179
08:23:40,900 --> 08:23:47,780
way when we started lighting off nuclear weapons one of the side effects of a nuclear weapon

5180
08:23:48,260 --> 08:23:56,740
was an emp an electromagnetic pulse and this electromagnetic pulse was a giant magnetic pulse

5181
08:23:56,740 --> 08:24:03,860
that would go through the atmosphere and when it contacted came in contact with a conductor

5182
08:24:03,860 --> 08:24:12,740
it induced a current where current didn't belong fry radios back in the day when they first light

5183
08:24:12,740 --> 08:24:19,540
started lighting off nukes um basically we all use tubes and tubes are high voltage devices and

5184
08:24:19,540 --> 08:24:25,300
it would cause some interference and some wacky symptoms and that was about it with us going to

5185
08:24:25,300 --> 08:24:31,380
micro chips now and integrated circuits that amount of current is going to fry that's our

5186
08:24:31,380 --> 08:24:36,980
technical term for the night fry these circuits okay because we're dealing with minute amounts of

5187
08:24:36,980 --> 08:24:42,740
current to get the job done so all of a sudden you have an emp you're gonna fry stuff and um

5188
08:24:44,260 --> 08:24:50,180
quite frankly it really concerns me i know enough about this where you know basically if you had

5189
08:24:50,180 --> 08:24:54,580
you know everybody's afraid of a dirty bomb and everything and yeah that's that's really bad news

5190
08:24:54,580 --> 08:25:02,900
but i tell you what one strategically placed high altitude nuke going off over the central us

5191
08:25:02,900 --> 08:25:08,340
it's going to totally wipe us out and set us back into the stone age okay and it's the high altitude

5192
08:25:08,340 --> 08:25:13,540
ones that really screw things up because they're far reaching because of the line of sight and um

5193
08:25:13,540 --> 08:25:19,140
yeah i mean can you imagine a world you know in a world that your atm doesn't work in a world that

5194
08:25:19,140 --> 08:25:26,340
your grocery store which uses a computer to order new food and supplies from the distribution center

5195
08:25:26,340 --> 08:25:32,580
doesn't work your cell phones don't work your internet doesn't work your computers don't work

5196
08:25:32,580 --> 08:25:37,460
your car computers don't work the only people that are going to be driving around the old people

5197
08:25:37,460 --> 08:25:42,660
kick an old school diesel where you know compression and fuel and you've got the diesel engine running

5198
08:25:42,660 --> 08:25:50,900
okay science fiction no pure science this is how it works so um these magnetic shields are actually

5199
08:25:50,900 --> 08:25:57,700
used in some military applications for hardening the the sites because we know that this emp is

5200
08:25:57,700 --> 08:26:02,500
going to cause problems none of the consumer stuff that we use is hardened air force one

5201
08:26:03,300 --> 08:26:08,820
what the president flies around in is hardened okay they brought that down to kirtland air force

5202
08:26:08,820 --> 08:26:14,980
base outside albuquerque new mexico and that's where they do the cmp testing and basically prove

5203
08:26:14,980 --> 08:26:20,020
what it's able to withstand and again that's all really highly classified information um the same

5204
08:26:20,020 --> 08:26:24,980
thing with the autopilots the uh you know now it's all fly by wire technology

5205
08:26:25,860 --> 08:26:31,380
so this electromagnetic interference could cause big problems i don't know if any of you um

5206
08:26:32,260 --> 08:26:36,900
remember years ago there was a problem with the airbus well there's always been a problem with

5207
08:26:36,900 --> 08:26:43,380
airbus um just different problems as time progresses but this was the problem with airbus was

5208
08:26:43,380 --> 08:26:50,820
was with the a320 aircraft and the a320 was the first commercial aircraft to use what was called

5209
08:26:50,820 --> 08:26:57,300
fly by wire technology and it's actually funny i like messing with people um that are flying on a

5210
08:26:57,300 --> 08:27:02,980
lot of people don't realize that up in the cockpit there's no control yoke like this on an a320

5211
08:27:02,980 --> 08:27:07,300
they're flying with a joystick and you know the pilot's seat and he's got the instrument panel

5212
08:27:07,300 --> 08:27:12,020
in front and right off to his left here is a joystick and that's how the pilot captain

5213
08:27:12,020 --> 08:27:19,220
it's got his on the left the copilot's got his on the right so there was a um an air show that

5214
08:27:19,940 --> 08:27:25,460
they were doing a fly by and what happened is the the airplane came died to the you know the

5215
08:27:25,460 --> 08:27:30,580
symbolic low pass and then kept going and going and going right into the trees at the end of the

5216
08:27:30,580 --> 08:27:34,420
runway and there was a huge fireball and explosion a bunch of people got killed but there were a

5217
08:27:34,420 --> 08:27:39,940
bunch of people including the pilot that survived and he was like man he's i don't know what happened

5218
08:27:39,940 --> 08:27:45,380
you know i was pulling up the whole time the aircraft was not responding so in the in the

5219
08:27:45,380 --> 08:27:50,500
basically the investigation they determined at this big air show in europe there were military

5220
08:27:50,500 --> 08:27:57,540
aircraft that were present they had their high energy weapons fire control radars turned on

5221
08:27:57,540 --> 08:28:02,100
and they think that high energy got into the computers and basically put current where current

5222
08:28:02,100 --> 08:28:07,780
and it got confused so he's pulling up on the stick you know to pull up and you know dip the wing

5223
08:28:07,780 --> 08:28:11,300
and you know you know the maneuver at least i know the maneuver it's classic maneuver

5224
08:28:11,380 --> 08:28:16,180
instead he's pulling up and just right into the freaking trees you look that up on youtube

5225
08:28:16,180 --> 08:28:22,980
a 320 crash and you know they they they very well documented crash um they added a lot more

5226
08:28:22,980 --> 08:28:29,140
magnetic shielding to it um bowings first air planted dabble with fly by wire was the triple

5227
08:28:29,140 --> 08:28:32,980
seven and it was kind of a gamble military aircraft have used it for years but military

5228
08:28:32,980 --> 08:28:36,180
aircraft are kind of a different animal you know if you got a problem in the military

5229
08:28:36,180 --> 08:28:40,580
aircraft you know eject eject eject pow you punch out and you know you live to fight another day

5230
08:28:40,580 --> 08:28:44,980
in a commercial airliner you got hundreds of people behind you there's no eject eject eject

5231
08:28:44,980 --> 08:28:49,620
it's like you got to ride it out and you fix the problem so bowings first airplane with fly by

5232
08:28:49,620 --> 08:28:54,900
wire technology was the triple seven was the triple seven and believe it or not was kind of funny

5233
08:28:54,900 --> 08:29:00,980
because bowing opted for standard controls not the joystick they could have done the joystick

5234
08:29:00,980 --> 08:29:04,980
because basically the standard controls are controlling the equivalent of a joystick but it

5235
08:29:04,980 --> 08:29:09,540
makes a pilot feel like they're kicking at old school and uh they're not kicking at old school

5236
08:29:09,540 --> 08:29:15,140
it's they're still putting in inputs that create small currents to feed a computer and then the

5237
08:29:15,140 --> 08:29:22,020
computer controls the control surfaces of the aircraft so in a lot of cases like that suffice

5238
08:29:22,020 --> 08:29:27,380
to say you reckon bowings got some really good magnetic shielding on their flight control systems

5239
08:29:27,380 --> 08:29:35,940
fly by wire absolutely it's to prevent current from being where current doesn't belong in any time

5240
08:29:35,940 --> 08:29:41,060
there is a magnetic field you run the risk of putting current where current doesn't block

5241
08:29:43,620 --> 08:29:50,260
absolutely absolutely and that was actually one of the other problems too that bowing had you

5242
08:29:50,260 --> 08:29:55,220
know every commercial airliner statistically gets struck by lightning once a year so next

5243
08:29:55,220 --> 08:29:58,900
time you go on your dream vacation or whatever you got on that airplane suffice to say that

5244
08:29:58,900 --> 08:30:04,420
airplane was probably struck by lightning in the past year as bowing went to and for most

5245
08:30:04,420 --> 08:30:08,820
aircraft it's not that big of a deal because what happens is when an aircraft is struck by

5246
08:30:08,820 --> 08:30:13,060
lightning it follows what's called skin effect and that current passes over the skin of the

5247
08:30:13,060 --> 08:30:17,380
aircraft i mean it could scare the dickens out of you if you're on board it's going to be a big

5248
08:30:17,380 --> 08:30:21,620
you know and in some cases fireball coming through the cabin and you know it's going to scare the

5249
08:30:21,620 --> 08:30:26,100
dickens out of you but it's not going to bring the airplane down one of the manufacturing trends

5250
08:30:26,100 --> 08:30:32,100
now with aircraft though is not to build airplanes out of aluminum it's to build it out of composites

5251
08:30:32,100 --> 08:30:40,260
okay if you're using carbon they're not always using carbon they're just using various composites

5252
08:30:40,260 --> 08:30:44,500
so one of the things that they're doing on aircraft now especially control surfaces

5253
08:30:45,380 --> 08:30:51,220
flaps ailerons that control the role of the aircraft and such these would typically be made

5254
08:30:51,220 --> 08:30:55,700
out of composites so you get struck by lightning it's quite simple the lightning gets in there

5255
08:30:55,700 --> 08:31:01,140
has nowhere to go it blows the the the control surface apart not good if you're in the airplane

5256
08:31:01,140 --> 08:31:04,340
okay because now you're going to lose control because you don't have the ability to control the

5257
08:31:04,340 --> 08:31:10,260
aircraft anymore so Boeing actually started doing is that by put basically putting in a conductive

5258
08:31:11,140 --> 08:31:18,340
layer into the composites so that will allow current from a lightning strike a place to dissipate

5259
08:31:19,060 --> 08:31:26,340
so kind of get rid of the aluminum only to put a conductor back into the composite so it's still

5260
08:31:26,340 --> 08:31:31,460
highly efficient and lighter and stronger and everything else i guess lighter and stronger

5261
08:31:32,100 --> 08:31:36,340
i don't know when they fail they fail big but i guess aluminum when aluminum fails it fails

5262
08:31:36,340 --> 08:31:43,220
big too so i don't know i like kicking her old school electromagnetic induction is the principle

5263
08:31:43,220 --> 08:31:47,460
behind the generation of electricity and i think all of you know where i'm going with this because

5264
08:31:47,460 --> 08:31:52,500
we just talked about emp magnetic field passing through a conductor is going to induce current

5265
08:31:53,220 --> 08:31:57,860
current is produced when a conductor passes or is passed by a magnetic field

5266
08:31:58,740 --> 08:32:04,660
as the conductor passes through the magnetic field a deficiency of electrons is going to be

5267
08:32:04,660 --> 08:32:10,580
created this results in a difference of potential between the ends of the conductor

5268
08:32:11,300 --> 08:32:16,900
so again if you've got a long piece of wire you pass a magnetic field through it you're going to

5269
08:32:16,900 --> 08:32:23,860
induce current many years ago i think the space shuttle um conducted an experiment like that

5270
08:32:23,860 --> 08:32:28,740
and literally what they did is they trailed a long wire loop and what their goal was to try to

5271
08:32:28,740 --> 08:32:34,260
track it through the earth's magnetic field and see if they could you know generate current from

5272
08:32:34,260 --> 08:32:40,260
that um basically they vaporize the wire that's how much current they generated from the earth's

5273
08:32:40,260 --> 08:32:45,620
magnetic field so if there was a way of harnessing the earth's magnetic field as a generator you

5274
08:32:45,620 --> 08:32:53,220
know our energy woes would be over but i don't think there's a you know adequate way of of harnessing

5275
08:32:53,220 --> 08:33:01,380
it at this point basically trail the wire and pull it through the earth's magnetic field and vaporize

5276
08:33:01,380 --> 08:33:08,180
the wire so when the conductors remove from the magnetic field the free electrons return

5277
08:33:08,180 --> 08:33:12,340
to their parent atom so what we're doing is we're getting electrons to move in a conductor

5278
08:33:12,340 --> 08:33:19,300
by getting electronic electrons to move in a conductor we call that current call that current

5279
08:33:19,300 --> 08:33:28,820
so we're creating current faraday's law the induced voltage in a conductor is directly

5280
08:33:28,820 --> 08:33:34,980
proportional to the rate at which the conductor cuts the magnetic lines of force okay gonna make

5281
08:33:34,980 --> 08:33:41,460
this real simple if you'd understand faraday's law here okay envision up here that i have a big

5282
08:33:41,460 --> 08:33:47,620
north pole big magnet sitting here boom big giant and here i have a big south pole you all agree

5283
08:33:47,620 --> 08:33:52,100
that i've got lines of flux that are going from the north pole to the south pole and all that stuff

5284
08:33:52,100 --> 08:33:56,900
that i talked about earlier the straightest line the shortest distance right so in between here i'm

5285
08:33:56,900 --> 08:34:01,060
gonna have a strong magnetic field if i had a giant magnet right here do you agree with that

5286
08:34:01,060 --> 08:34:09,140
okay faraday's law says that if i my conductor if i got a conductor this is a conductor when i say

5287
08:34:09,140 --> 08:34:13,860
conductor i'm not talking just a piece of wire i'm talking about a piece of wire that has a loop

5288
08:34:13,860 --> 08:34:19,620
in it so the current's got to have somewhere to go it has to have a load right if i get this and i

5289
08:34:19,620 --> 08:34:27,380
move it perpendicular to the lines of flux i'm going to generate my maximum amount of current

5290
08:34:27,380 --> 08:34:33,140
because i'm doing what i'm cutting the lines of flux if i get the conductor and i move it

5291
08:34:33,140 --> 08:34:38,820
parallel to the lines of flux nothing's going to happen i mean nothing is going to happen

5292
08:34:38,820 --> 08:34:43,700
because the lines of flux are going north pole to south pole so me with the conductor moving

5293
08:34:43,700 --> 08:34:48,420
it like this all day long nothing's going to happen all of a sudden i move it like this i'm

5294
08:34:48,420 --> 08:34:54,260
moving it right through those lines of flux perpendicular so i'm going to get maximum

5295
08:34:54,260 --> 08:34:58,980
effect of cutting those lines of flux so that's in essence faraday's law

5296
08:35:03,940 --> 08:35:08,260
it's it's me cutting those lines of flux so i'm still going to have a strong effect by

5297
08:35:08,260 --> 08:35:13,700
simply cutting it now if i'm doing it at a 45 degree angle what am i going to be doing

5298
08:35:15,140 --> 08:35:22,260
i'm really half effective it's not this and it's not this it's going to be half at 45 degrees

5299
08:35:24,180 --> 08:35:32,580
faraday's law but i'm cutting it at a 45 degree angle so i'm not cutting the maximum

5300
08:35:33,540 --> 08:35:37,700
lines of flux by by cutting it at 90 i'm getting the maximum out of it

5301
08:35:39,860 --> 08:35:44,980
so that's faraday's law this here don't try this in your car on the way home somebody will think

5302
08:35:44,980 --> 08:35:51,620
you're like doing gang signs or something you know yo yo i'm an electronic student yo

5303
08:35:53,300 --> 08:35:59,300
this is called the left hand rule and the way that this thing works is that your your finger

5304
08:35:59,380 --> 08:36:02,820
points in the direction of flux which way does flux go

5305
08:36:06,900 --> 08:36:11,620
which way does flux go from where to where positive to negative east to west

5306
08:36:15,380 --> 08:36:21,060
north to south i said that earlier right flux goes north to south north pole south pole

5307
08:36:21,060 --> 08:36:26,180
so this means north to south that's the direction that the flux is is pointing in makes sense

5308
08:36:30,260 --> 08:36:35,540
my thumb is going to point in the direction of motion so as an example let's go back to me with

5309
08:36:35,540 --> 08:36:41,460
this wielding the yardstick here is this the yard this is the yardstick 36 inches

5310
08:36:42,740 --> 08:36:46,740
that's one of the reasons that i'm real happy that we're not on the metric system or we weren't

5311
08:36:46,740 --> 08:36:53,060
when i grew up because having attended a catholic church for school for a period of time the nuns

5312
08:36:53,060 --> 08:36:59,380
if the nuns had been equipped with meter sticks as opposed to yard sticks there's a good chance i

5313
08:36:59,380 --> 08:37:04,420
wouldn't be here with you today okay because that additional three inches would have been just enough

5314
08:37:04,420 --> 08:37:13,380
probably for them to connect and uh yes i was beaten by the nuns anyway so i've got a north pole here

5315
08:37:13,940 --> 08:37:19,780
a south pole here remember that north here south here okay so that means the lines of

5316
08:37:19,860 --> 08:37:25,140
flux are which going which way north to south so i got to do what

5317
08:37:31,380 --> 08:37:37,620
makes sense i'm going in this direction okay so the left hand rule now my thumb is going to

5318
08:37:37,620 --> 08:37:45,620
point in the direction of motion so this means the conductor is moving down through this scenario

5319
08:37:46,180 --> 08:37:48,500
and if that's the case

5320
08:37:53,460 --> 08:37:58,020
if that's the case my middle finger is pointing towards me which way does current flow

5321
08:38:00,100 --> 08:38:08,100
this is not a trick question folks negative to positive so that means i am positive with respect

5322
08:38:08,100 --> 08:38:14,420
to my finger negative the positive current to blow towards me okay to make it easier let's

5323
08:38:14,420 --> 08:38:20,580
make this the north pole let's make this the south pole and let's move our conductor let's move our

5324
08:38:20,580 --> 08:38:30,340
conductor down by moving the conductor down current now is going to be flowing away from me negative

5325
08:38:30,340 --> 08:38:39,700
to positive make sense so again will you ever use this in industry i doubt it but this is a way of

5326
08:38:39,700 --> 08:38:48,420
determining which direction we're going to induce current in a generator based on relative motion

5327
08:38:51,940 --> 08:38:59,140
now magnetic and electromagnetic applications probably the biggest and most important is the

5328
08:38:59,140 --> 08:39:06,740
ac generator ac generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy by utilizing the

5329
08:39:06,740 --> 08:39:13,140
principle of electromagnetic induction and this is the most popular way of producing electricity

5330
08:39:14,740 --> 08:39:22,020
now whether we turn this ac generator we're going to turn it by the shaft right whether we turn

5331
08:39:22,020 --> 08:39:32,420
that shaft from steam and a turbine that's generated from coal oil nuclear hydroelectric

5332
08:39:32,420 --> 08:39:38,260
it's irrelevant the key is that we're turning the shaft and turning the shaft we turn the generator

5333
08:39:38,260 --> 08:39:43,620
that's what produces the electricity now if we take that another step are there are there

5334
08:39:43,620 --> 08:39:49,620
means that are more efficient than others are there means that are more ecologically minded

5335
08:39:49,620 --> 08:39:55,140
than others are there you know what we watched last week in our program meeting on wednesday

5336
08:39:56,020 --> 08:40:01,060
i mean even that dude you know who was uh you know pretty much a tree hugging kind of guy saying hey

5337
08:40:01,060 --> 08:40:07,940
i've rethought nuclear you know and although nuclear is is dangerous and it's something we need to be

5338
08:40:07,940 --> 08:40:16,100
aware of you know polluting the environment with coal is worse so um things for us to think about

5339
08:40:16,100 --> 08:40:21,540
but the key here is by turning that shaft we generate ac electricity with an ac generator

5340
08:40:22,100 --> 08:40:27,140
this is how it works this is how an ac generator works and the thing that i want to point out to

5341
08:40:27,140 --> 08:40:34,340
you here is that these are the magnets and these magnets could be permanent or they could be

5342
08:40:36,100 --> 08:40:41,380
electromagnets they could be permanent or they could be electromagnets as a matter of fact this

5343
08:40:41,380 --> 08:40:49,300
is exactly what is taking place in your alternator in your car okay and your alternator in your car

5344
08:40:49,300 --> 08:40:56,740
are these those permanent magnets or are they electromagnets does anybody know alternator in

5345
08:40:56,740 --> 08:41:06,100
your car which produces produces voltage for us the generator are they permanent magnets or are

5346
08:41:06,100 --> 08:41:13,300
they electromagnets are they electromagnets that's my question to you what's that

5347
08:41:15,220 --> 08:41:23,060
no no because there's a power going to it and what do you call what do you call that if some

5348
08:41:23,060 --> 08:41:26,660
of you've ever played around with an alternator you might remember as soon as i say you're going

5349
08:41:26,660 --> 08:41:33,300
to know if you've played around with it before called your field windings your field windings

5350
08:41:33,300 --> 08:41:40,980
your field windings produce an electromagnetic field this is why if you're you know how you

5351
08:41:40,980 --> 08:41:47,300
can push start a car you can push start a car if it's dead you can push start a car if it's

5352
08:41:47,300 --> 08:41:53,220
if your battery is totally dead you're not going to push start a car somebody older vw's are different

5353
08:41:53,220 --> 08:41:58,900
different magnetos different system okay different on my aircraft my aircraft doesn't have a system

5354
08:41:58,900 --> 08:42:05,780
like that it has a a magneto so if i get that prop rotating i'm creating a spark that will

5355
08:42:05,780 --> 08:42:12,260
support the combustion combustion process okay kickstart motorcycle

5356
08:42:14,980 --> 08:42:21,460
so your car if your battery is totally dead if you if you remove your battery and try to jump

5357
08:42:21,780 --> 08:42:28,340
start push start your car pop start it it ain't going to work okay if your battery is kind of dead

5358
08:42:28,900 --> 08:42:33,940
not enough to crank the starter but enough to go click click click click click that's probably

5359
08:42:33,940 --> 08:42:40,900
enough to create enough of a magnetic field so when you push the car pop the clutch start the

5360
08:42:40,900 --> 08:42:45,380
combustion process get the engine turning immediately you're going to start to put

5361
08:42:45,380 --> 08:42:50,980
you know increase the voltage to these windings so these windings could be very i don't really

5362
08:42:50,980 --> 08:42:56,580
know of any applications they use permanent magnets here most all use windings the same

5363
08:42:56,580 --> 08:43:02,260
thing for a power generating plant like at grand coulee dam they got to start off with a little

5364
08:43:02,260 --> 08:43:08,420
bit of voltage to create the magnetic field and then get the generation process going they're not

5365
08:43:08,420 --> 08:43:17,700
permanent magnets okay so this here this loop of wire this is an artist depiction this loop of wire

5366
08:43:18,660 --> 08:43:24,100
has a light side and a dark side this is just so you could see it for the purposes of illustration

5367
08:43:24,980 --> 08:43:27,300
but this here is actually a loop of wire

5368
08:43:29,940 --> 08:43:37,620
the loop the armature here is connected to these slip rings these slip rings allow the

5369
08:43:37,620 --> 08:43:48,740
armature to stay connected 360 degrees of the rotation so if we look at this right now

5370
08:43:49,460 --> 08:43:56,820
north pole south pole north pole south pole the armature right here with the winding here at

5371
08:43:56,820 --> 08:44:02,900
the top and the winding at the bottom is the winding right now parallel to the lines of flux

5372
08:44:02,900 --> 08:44:11,860
or perpendicular lines of flux parallel it's right at the top you see how it's right at the apex

5373
08:44:11,860 --> 08:44:18,260
here the top so right at this moment in time it's parallel to the lines of flux how much current

5374
08:44:18,260 --> 08:44:25,780
do we generate when we're parallel to the lines of flux faraday's law how much zero and look what

5375
08:44:25,780 --> 08:44:34,100
we're generating right here zero when we rotate that armature now we're going to rotate it we're

5376
08:44:34,100 --> 08:44:38,820
going to connect the shaft to this and we're going to blow on it and make the shaft turn through a

5377
08:44:38,820 --> 08:44:44,100
wind turbine or we're going to steam and rotate you know the shaft through a steam turbine or

5378
08:44:44,100 --> 08:44:49,460
whatever but when we rotate the shaft now how many degrees have i rotated it from my peak

5379
08:44:49,540 --> 08:44:57,940
90 so right now is the armature parallel or perpendicular perpendicular what does faraday's

5380
08:44:57,940 --> 08:45:07,220
law say when i'm perpendicular to the lines of flux i generate my maximum amount of current well

5381
08:45:07,220 --> 08:45:13,700
look what we did when we rotated it 90 degrees now i'm at my maximum peak value

5382
08:45:14,340 --> 08:45:20,900
when i rotate my armature another 90 degrees see how i started out here at the top then i rotated

5383
08:45:20,900 --> 08:45:27,620
it 90 now i rotate it another 90 so i'm actually 180 degrees from where i started off am i parallel

5384
08:45:27,620 --> 08:45:36,900
or perpendicular to the lines of flux parallel what does faraday's law say zero what am i generating

5385
08:45:37,220 --> 08:45:42,900
what am i generating zero i rotate it another 90 degrees now i'm coming up on the backside 270

5386
08:45:44,180 --> 08:45:52,500
parallel or perpendicular perpendicular what am i going to do generating faraday's law maximum

5387
08:45:52,500 --> 08:45:59,140
cutting my maximum field i'm right here i complete that cycle i've just created 360 degrees of a

5388
08:45:59,140 --> 08:46:07,860
sinusoidal waveform this is an ac generator half of this is positive half of this is negative if

5389
08:46:07,860 --> 08:46:14,340
you're actually an electron if you're actually an electron caught in this whole thing basically

5390
08:46:14,340 --> 08:46:19,940
what happens is you get moved x amount in this direction then you go back to zero and then you

5391
08:46:19,940 --> 08:46:27,860
get moved x amount in this direction and then you go back to zero you never really go anywhere

5392
08:46:27,860 --> 08:46:33,060
but you do get shaken back and forth back and forth back and forth make sense

5393
08:46:34,820 --> 08:46:40,980
it's an ac generator a dc generator it actually by the way does anybody know who the father of

5394
08:46:40,980 --> 08:46:47,700
the ac generator was who do we give credit to ac generation tesla very good nicola tesla

5395
08:46:48,820 --> 08:46:56,980
he said ac was the way to go there was another guy big in history who said dc is the way to go

5396
08:46:56,980 --> 08:47:02,100
anybody know who that dude was edison actually more of a household name everybody knows thomas

5397
08:47:02,100 --> 08:47:08,660
edison actually when i first entered this industry i nobody even knew tesla tesla recently has gained

5398
08:47:08,660 --> 08:47:16,580
some acclaim or a cult following depending on how you want to look at it but thomas edison

5399
08:47:16,580 --> 08:47:22,260
he wanted to wire up everything in dc if you go back to new york city which is actually the power

5400
08:47:22,260 --> 08:47:29,060
company back there is consolidated edison con edison um really started off by edison edison

5401
08:47:29,060 --> 08:47:35,060
got the first contract to wire up the um new york city and he wired up a lot of the buildings for

5402
08:47:35,060 --> 08:47:40,900
dc and again i we're not going to get into it here in class you could look at youtube edison

5403
08:47:40,900 --> 08:47:46,900
experiments electrocuting animals you know um tesla experiments and they were they'd get like

5404
08:47:46,900 --> 08:47:51,540
an elephant and like you know electrocute it and like you know kill it dead and say you see this is

5405
08:47:51,540 --> 08:47:56,100
why you don't want to use dc this is why you want to use ac ac is much safer you know and

5406
08:47:56,100 --> 08:48:00,980
sort of like killing animals and stuff on you know so you can look that up on your own youtube we're

5407
08:48:00,980 --> 08:48:05,780
not going to do it here but i mean it was these dudes were at each other because that meant world

5408
08:48:05,780 --> 08:48:14,020
domination you know who's going to get the contracts and um again uh tesla was right

5409
08:48:14,020 --> 08:48:21,060
ac is much more efficient to transmit we'll talk about that later on so dc never really caught on

5410
08:48:21,060 --> 08:48:27,620
but a dc generator this is how uh what a dc generator looks like again you've got an armature

5411
08:48:28,500 --> 08:48:36,660
but what note here as we rotate this we're coming in contact here with this is called a commutator

5412
08:48:37,620 --> 08:48:42,580
and the commutator only makes contact for 180 degrees

5413
08:48:42,660 --> 08:48:51,060
so what happens is as we rotate the armature through we're going to generate a positive pulse

5414
08:48:51,860 --> 08:48:55,780
then what's going to happen is we're going to break that electrical connection because the

5415
08:48:55,780 --> 08:49:01,460
commutator only makes contact for 180 degrees and then what we're going to do is harness another

5416
08:49:01,460 --> 08:49:06,100
positive pulse so it's positive pulse positive pulse positive pulse

5417
08:49:06,260 --> 08:49:09,780
it's a definition of dc

5418
08:49:12,100 --> 08:49:19,780
definition of dc ac is half positive half negative alternation this is positive

5419
08:49:19,780 --> 08:49:26,340
positive positive this is almost like a battery not quite this is a pulsating dc

5420
08:49:26,340 --> 08:49:32,580
as where a battery would be constant dc created chemically so the big thing you need to remember

5421
08:49:32,580 --> 08:49:40,180
is that an ac generator has slip rings and it maintains contact for 360 degrees of the

5422
08:49:40,180 --> 08:49:46,660
rotation of the armature a dc generator has a commutator and it maintains contact for

5423
08:49:48,500 --> 08:49:56,020
180 degrees but the same principle is applied we're either cutting the lines of flux or we're not

5424
08:49:56,020 --> 08:50:08,100
now a relay a relay anybody here have any experience working on any relays okay relays are

5425
08:50:10,260 --> 08:50:18,100
are popular then they still are popular because for handling high amounts of current

5426
08:50:19,060 --> 08:50:26,420
still a very viable way of control a relay is an electromagnetic switch

5427
08:50:27,460 --> 08:50:36,660
that opens and closes with an electromagnetic coil so real simple with a relay i create an

5428
08:50:36,660 --> 08:50:45,620
electromagnetic field with a coil what i have is an armature above that coil and that armature has

5429
08:50:45,620 --> 08:50:54,740
a contact on it and it has a spring that basically when the electromagnetic field is energized it pulls

5430
08:50:54,740 --> 08:51:02,020
the armature down making an electrical contact when i de-energize it it has a spring that opens a backup

5431
08:51:04,100 --> 08:51:10,900
energize makes electrical contact de-energize opens up the circuit or i could do it the opposite

5432
08:51:10,900 --> 08:51:15,780
way i could be making electrical contact and when i energize the electrical circuit it's going to

5433
08:51:17,460 --> 08:51:25,780
open the circuit relays also could have multiple ganged contacts so when i energize it i'm opening

5434
08:51:25,780 --> 08:51:34,340
and closing a bunch of contacts but a relay is an electromechanical switch it's using

5435
08:51:34,340 --> 08:51:41,220
electromagnetism to move that armature up and down the good news is it's an electromechanical

5436
08:51:41,220 --> 08:51:45,620
switch it's going to fail often and you're going to need highly qualified competent technicians

5437
08:51:45,620 --> 08:51:52,820
to go in and troubleshoot it it's called job security they replace that with something that's

5438
08:51:52,820 --> 08:51:59,060
solid state it's not going to need to be replaced so as long as there are relays there's stuff for

5439
08:51:59,060 --> 08:52:07,620
us to fix we use relays when it's desirable to have one circuit control another circuit

5440
08:52:07,620 --> 08:52:12,660
typically one low power circuit controlling another high power circuit

5441
08:52:15,940 --> 08:52:20,100
these lights would be an example although i don't know if we've got a relay integrated and i know

5442
08:52:20,100 --> 08:52:24,820
that there's a relay that's integrated with the motion sensor so when the switch is energized

5443
08:52:24,820 --> 08:52:28,980
that motion sensor you'll actually hear if you walk in here and the lights are off especially over

5444
08:52:28,980 --> 08:52:34,100
here you hear the click when that obnoxious somebody's looking for a project rewire this thing to

5445
08:52:34,100 --> 08:52:38,420
keep that thing from ever shutting off when you're in the lab becomes pretty obnoxious

5446
08:52:43,780 --> 08:52:49,860
it's also used to control several circuits some distance away so an example of like a relay would

5447
08:52:49,940 --> 08:52:55,860
be anybody here play with model trains at all model trains are nothing more than a small example

5448
08:52:55,860 --> 08:53:02,420
of the real thing if you look at a freight yard on how they switch and build trains they basically

5449
08:53:02,420 --> 08:53:09,860
have switches that move an entire it's a motor that will move an entire railroad track so that

5450
08:53:09,860 --> 08:53:15,220
trains you know could be built on different sightings and such well how do you control that

5451
08:53:15,220 --> 08:53:20,660
you know the switch alone would be like a Frankenstein you know switch you can't do that

5452
08:53:20,660 --> 08:53:26,980
typically in a switching yard you'll have a up in a control tower a small switch that they throw

5453
08:53:26,980 --> 08:53:33,460
that sends a small signal out to a big relay that could chunk makes connection and allows

5454
08:53:33,460 --> 08:53:39,780
all that current to flow and turn the motor which boom switches the track it wouldn't be practical

5455
08:53:39,780 --> 08:53:46,180
to have you know wire this thick going to a control tower knocking you know that it would

5456
08:53:46,180 --> 08:53:56,340
pull the control tower down wouldn't make sense so it's used to electrically isolate the two circuits

5457
08:53:58,100 --> 08:54:03,780
make sense okay example of this would be a doorbell

5458
08:54:03,780 --> 08:54:12,500
small signal voltage bringing about a large change large changes you get and woke up out

5459
08:54:12,500 --> 08:54:19,860
of sound sleep because the delivery man's outside delivering a package here are some examples of relays

5460
08:54:25,140 --> 08:54:31,540
some of these relays are actually encapsulated so they could be put in a explosive environment

5461
08:54:32,340 --> 08:54:37,060
because when you open and close that contact what are you doing there could be a spark

5462
08:54:39,060 --> 08:54:43,380
there could be a spark so if you're working at an oil refinery you probably don't want that

5463
08:54:43,380 --> 08:54:47,060
spark you want that spark to be contained so it's going to be in a sealed relay

5464
08:54:48,660 --> 08:54:53,380
this one right here you could probably see the contacts there's two contacts here

5465
08:54:53,380 --> 08:54:56,580
and that thing is going to open close big sparks

5466
08:55:02,500 --> 08:55:08,900
now a solenoid is a coil when energized pulls a plunger that does some mechanical work

5467
08:55:09,780 --> 08:55:16,020
an example of this might be door chimes i'm talking about the old school ding dong ding

5468
08:55:16,020 --> 08:55:23,620
dong right those are physically little hammers hitting chimes now most of the stuff even like

5469
08:55:23,620 --> 08:55:28,260
clocks if you buy a clock that has chimes it's not chimes it's a recording of chimes

5470
08:55:29,060 --> 08:55:35,140
synthesized okay there's very few examples of real chimes being struck by solenoids

5471
08:55:36,340 --> 08:55:40,820
another example is your automotive starter when you turn the key typically you turn the key

5472
08:55:41,460 --> 08:55:49,860
that energizes a starter relay the starter relay energizes the starter solenoid the starter solenoid

5473
08:55:49,860 --> 08:55:54,820
on your car is probably about the thickness of this laser pointer and on the top is going to be a big

5474
08:55:54,820 --> 08:56:00,180
piece of metal that when you energize it it's going to pull that metal down and make a big

5475
08:56:00,180 --> 08:56:04,900
electrical connection that big electrical connection basically takes all of the energy

5476
08:56:04,900 --> 08:56:11,780
from your battery and dumps it into your starter there has to be physically a lot of metal present

5477
08:56:11,780 --> 08:56:22,820
to make that electrical connection so a relay has a moving armature a solenoid has a moving

5478
08:56:22,900 --> 08:56:28,740
plunger a moving core if you will if any of you have ever played a pinball machine the flippers

5479
08:56:28,740 --> 08:56:34,900
solenoids when you hit the button the flipper it's energizing a solenoid that solenoid

5480
08:56:35,540 --> 08:56:40,100
is attached physically to the flipper that's going to move back and forth back and forth

5481
08:56:40,100 --> 08:56:48,180
energize the energize energize the energize energize energize the energize pinball anybody

5482
08:56:48,180 --> 08:56:52,180
you're like pinball it's the bomb it's pure it's it's the pure game

5483
08:56:57,380 --> 08:57:02,180
look for a project there you go restore a pinball machine you could restore a pinball machine

5484
08:57:02,180 --> 08:57:08,500
contemporary pinball machine it's got everything electrical mechanical you've restored one

5485
08:57:09,860 --> 08:57:16,580
early there you go there's projects there's projects right there what what era

5486
08:57:18,820 --> 08:57:24,580
really uh i've got one i've got a 14 top cat

5487
08:57:26,820 --> 08:57:31,780
the real deal man if you remember that one i had the big gumballs on the top red white blue

5488
08:57:32,340 --> 08:57:35,940
when you get it into the advanced levels those things light up it's actually considered the most

5489
08:57:35,940 --> 08:57:40,420
obnoxious pinball machine ever created because if you're in a bar you know those freaking lights

5490
08:57:40,420 --> 08:57:44,420
you know looks like a police car park there whatever when you get into the you know multi-ball

5491
08:57:45,220 --> 08:57:49,940
it's pretty slick what's that Williams yeah

5492
08:57:52,340 --> 08:57:56,500
good stuff um 87

5493
08:58:04,020 --> 08:58:07,780
one of my other favorites i've been keeping my eyes open if i find one if i find one bring

5494
08:58:07,780 --> 08:58:11,380
home my wife will kill me because that one pinball machine she's freaking

5495
08:58:12,260 --> 08:58:15,700
why aren't you gonna get rid of that thing never i mean it's so freaking cool man

5496
08:58:16,340 --> 08:58:21,780
and i keep it operational you know um but the other one i'm always looking for a cyclone

5497
08:58:21,780 --> 08:58:28,340
and if you remember cyclone and it was a big uh big you know during the cold war ronald reagan

5498
08:58:28,340 --> 08:58:33,460
and actually there's a cyclone roller coaster and then the front car is ronald and nancy reagan

5499
08:58:33,540 --> 08:58:42,820
holding on for dear life great pin great pin anyway pinball brought to you by the amazing

5500
08:58:42,820 --> 08:58:52,740
solenoid and relays i love the applications for these things actually one of the things too with

5501
08:58:52,740 --> 08:59:00,260
um with relays it's kind of fun is um some airports have what's called pilot control lighting

5502
08:59:00,900 --> 08:59:05,540
and one of the local airports here is uh bremerton bremerton national and i don't you know

5503
08:59:05,540 --> 08:59:09,860
probably a lot of you don't even know bremerton national you land a 737 over there okay it's

5504
08:59:09,860 --> 08:59:14,020
big airport you know they don't have any commercial traffic in and out they've actually

5505
08:59:14,020 --> 08:59:17,780
tried in the past but it's just bremerton's not that big of a market but it's a big runway

5506
08:59:18,340 --> 08:59:23,700
pilot control lighting so one of the things that i've been known to do in the past if i'm

5507
08:59:23,700 --> 08:59:29,220
bringing somebody that's not accustomed to aviation is what i'll do is i'll start the approach and i'm

5508
08:59:29,220 --> 08:59:35,300
flying the instrument approach so i'm following an invisible glide path down to the runway so when

5509
08:59:35,300 --> 08:59:40,100
the lights are turned off at the airport it's just a black hole you're just descending into this black

5510
08:59:40,100 --> 08:59:46,180
void and then usually about a half a mile out what i'll do is i'll dial in the frequency and then

5511
08:59:46,180 --> 08:59:50,340
i'll hit the code and basically it's a matter of me just turning my transmitter on and off on and

5512
08:59:50,340 --> 08:59:54,420
off on and off five times turns it to high intensity so all of a sudden you're descending

5513
08:59:54,420 --> 09:00:00,020
into this black hole and then before you this runway appears with the chaser lights and everything

5514
09:00:00,020 --> 09:00:05,060
and it's kind of a power trip you know i think it's kind of cool you know by me simply you know

5515
09:00:05,060 --> 09:00:10,900
clicking my radio i just turned on you know this huge airport you know five thousand feet of runway

5516
09:00:10,900 --> 09:00:17,220
lights um that's all brought to you by well there's the pilot control lighting aspect of the radio

5517
09:00:17,220 --> 09:00:23,860
but what really makes it happen is relays it was really you know really relays it was actually

5518
09:00:23,860 --> 09:00:30,420
fun with relays too also called and could be called an industrial contactor industrial contactor

5519
09:00:31,540 --> 09:00:35,620
i used to be really in the i guess i've gotten old and i'm out of a swing of things with holiday

5520
09:00:35,620 --> 09:00:40,020
lighting i used to cover every right angle of my house i mean it looked like you know christmas

5521
09:00:40,020 --> 09:00:47,380
vacation material um and uh it was kind of funny because my next star neighbor he worked for bowing

5522
09:00:47,380 --> 09:00:51,620
his electrical engineer for bowing the guy across the street was electrical engineer for the federal

5523
09:00:51,620 --> 09:00:56,660
aviation administration so these guys you know i'm out there kind of messing with them and stuff

5524
09:00:56,660 --> 09:01:00,660
and you know you see them i'm plugging in an extension cord and the bush lights up and you

5525
09:01:00,660 --> 09:01:05,780
know you plug in another extension cord another you know the the roof line lights up and with me

5526
09:01:05,780 --> 09:01:11,220
i wanted to control everything at simultaneously so i got this big industrial contactor that fell

5527
09:01:11,220 --> 09:01:17,300
off the back of a truck and what i have are four separate circuits each circuit is up to 20 amps each

5528
09:01:17,300 --> 09:01:22,260
so what i did is i put in i basically rewired my home and i have separate circuits for the

5529
09:01:22,260 --> 09:01:26,580
outside lights and then i have a have it on a timer i mean i could connect it to the freaking

5530
09:01:26,580 --> 09:01:32,980
you know clap clapper if i want the two right so simply when that turns on boom everything is on

5531
09:01:32,980 --> 09:01:37,700
at once it's like how did you do that this here's an industrial contactor you know it's kind of a

5532
09:01:37,700 --> 09:01:52,500
cool system yeah yep absolutely yep yep and actually what one of the things that brings that

5533
09:01:52,500 --> 09:01:58,340
about and it's it was kind of where i was segwaying into is um normally for a first quarter student

5534
09:01:58,340 --> 09:02:06,180
you'd be taking the plc class el ec 116 plc basically is an industrial computer that controls

5535
09:02:06,260 --> 09:02:12,580
opening closes basically relays for industrial control so after taking that el ec 116 class

5536
09:02:12,580 --> 09:02:19,860
if you wanted you could buy a plc and basically set up a christmas display on par with with you

5537
09:02:19,860 --> 09:02:24,420
know what that what we've seen on video is that with the light synchronized to music and everything

5538
09:02:24,420 --> 09:02:33,140
really easy to do with plcs really easy to do well not easy but doable with plcs

5539
09:02:36,580 --> 09:02:40,020
phonograph pickups sure some of the younger students are sitting in here and saying what

5540
09:02:40,020 --> 09:02:44,900
is a phonograph right you know what what's this with the scratching right that's what

5541
09:02:44,900 --> 09:02:50,340
they're scratching on a phonograph right uses an electromagnetic principle believe it or not

5542
09:02:50,340 --> 09:02:59,780
a magnetic field is produced by a permanent magnet attached to a stylus the stylus tracks

5543
09:02:59,780 --> 09:03:07,620
through the groove of a record in response to the audio signal recorded basically um

5544
09:03:08,660 --> 09:03:12,420
back in the day some of you are probably familiar with this like a a musical group

5545
09:03:12,420 --> 09:03:19,700
were cutting an album and literally what they were doing was cutting a groove into a blank

5546
09:03:20,340 --> 09:03:25,380
and they're cutting an album they're recording an album okay this is how it was done back in the day

5547
09:03:25,940 --> 09:03:30,340
then what that would be is a negative then with the positive you could start stamping out albums

5548
09:03:30,340 --> 09:03:35,380
all day long and you know getting them to radio stations play your music and start selling it

5549
09:03:35,380 --> 09:03:41,380
and that's how you'd make the big time well with the mp3 that's all changed uh we won't we won't

5550
09:03:41,380 --> 09:03:46,660
comment on that but the stylus literally tracks through that groove in the record in response

5551
09:03:46,660 --> 09:03:55,220
to the audio signal the movement creates a small voltage that varies at the audio signal response

5552
09:03:56,180 --> 09:04:03,460
to replicate the wave pattern that originally created it the induced voltage is then amplified

5553
09:04:03,460 --> 09:04:09,540
and used to drive a loudspeaker producing the audio effect similarly of the audio signal that

5554
09:04:09,540 --> 09:04:16,340
produced it and um you know if anybody here own any albums do you have the ability okay anybody

5555
09:04:16,340 --> 09:04:22,260
here have a means of playing any of those albums actually bought a phonograph a couple years ago

5556
09:04:22,260 --> 09:04:27,940
because i had some older records and um you know all the stuff's available as mp3 now but you know

5557
09:04:28,740 --> 09:04:35,860
they don't they don't you know and only for that full experience you need a phonograph player to

5558
09:04:35,860 --> 09:04:40,100
play it so kind of a classic old-school retro way of going but

5559
09:04:44,820 --> 09:04:47,300
no it's almost too clear

5560
09:04:47,300 --> 09:04:54,020
i tell you some of the stuff i have a hard time because again growing up growing up in kinetica

5561
09:04:54,020 --> 09:04:57,860
you know i had my little late transistor radio we'd go down to the beach in kinetica shore

5562
09:04:57,860 --> 09:05:02,180
road island mesquamica beach we'd go down there and whatever and you're listening to the new

5563
09:05:02,180 --> 09:05:08,900
york radio station you're listening to the hits the top 40 hits you know and um i you know now i

5564
09:05:08,900 --> 09:05:13,060
listened to some of the high quality recordings it's kind of like is this a remake or it doesn't

5565
09:05:13,060 --> 09:05:16,820
sound like the original you know the original because the original was listening to out of a

5566
09:05:16,820 --> 09:05:22,260
little speaker like this you know he transistors mono you know now the stereo version of it it's

5567
09:05:22,260 --> 09:05:26,900
a little bit different and of course i was on a limited budget so i wasn't always going out and

5568
09:05:26,900 --> 09:05:32,340
buying the albums or certain albums that you had and that was high fidelity back in the day so how

5569
09:05:32,340 --> 09:05:39,140
a record player would work magnetic magnetic that little stylus tracking in there magnetic cartridge

5570
09:05:39,140 --> 09:05:47,700
loud speaker basically the opposite constructed of a moving coil around a permanent magnet so

5571
09:05:47,700 --> 09:05:52,660
basically if any of you've ever bought speakers before one of the attributes you're looking basically

5572
09:05:52,660 --> 09:06:00,020
he or she who has the the the heaviest magnet the biggest magnet wins because that's the permanent

5573
09:06:00,020 --> 09:06:07,060
magnet and what that means is that you could throw more energy in there to create either an

5574
09:06:07,060 --> 09:06:15,940
attraction or a repulsion and move the cone of the speaker back and forth rapidly replicating

5575
09:06:15,940 --> 09:06:22,500
the original sound that created it so that's how a loud speaker works so the key components the size

5576
09:06:22,500 --> 09:06:31,380
of the magnet the coil how much energy how much energy measured in watts acoustic energy but again

5577
09:06:31,380 --> 09:06:45,380
it's a magnetic device that's how it works magnetic recording uses the electromagnetic

5578
09:06:45,380 --> 09:06:52,260
principle to store information a signal is stored on tape or disc with a record head

5579
09:06:52,820 --> 09:06:59,460
to be read back later with a playback head some can be combined in one package that means record

5580
09:06:59,460 --> 09:07:08,260
head and playback head on on the same head the way that this works and it's kind of important

5581
09:07:08,260 --> 09:07:14,580
that you understand this basically it's like getting a piece of tape and sprinkling a bunch

5582
09:07:14,580 --> 09:07:23,380
of iron filings on that piece of tape by passing that tape over record head when I when I speak

5583
09:07:23,380 --> 09:07:31,940
into a microphone I'm creating a signal in the wire because the microphone which also is a magnetic

5584
09:07:31,940 --> 09:07:39,060
device the vibration the air molecules moving back and forth create that vibration the microphone

5585
09:07:39,060 --> 09:07:44,340
picks it up and transforms that in the small electrical signal that goes in gets amplified and

5586
09:07:44,340 --> 09:07:50,740
gets connected to the record head the record head is going to fluctuate its magnetic field

5587
09:07:51,220 --> 09:07:57,780
putting those iron filings on the tape into a unique pattern into a unique pattern

5588
09:07:59,620 --> 09:08:05,060
that pattern will be stored on that tape not indefinitely because if it's stored here on

5589
09:08:05,060 --> 09:08:11,620
planet earth what's one of the things that it could be under the influence of the earth's magnetic field

5590
09:08:13,220 --> 09:08:18,100
if you put it in close proximity to any other electromagnetic device it could alter that

5591
09:08:18,100 --> 09:08:25,540
so magnetic recordings will not last forever as a matter of fact a magnetic recording every time

5592
09:08:25,540 --> 09:08:32,260
you play it back and you try to read that that that fluctuation in the particles that was put

5593
09:08:32,260 --> 09:08:40,100
on there it loses a little bit of what it was originally remember how the video stores and

5594
09:08:40,100 --> 09:08:44,660
get younger students know what's a video store well back in the day we used to have to go to

5595
09:08:44,740 --> 09:08:52,020
places and rent vhs tapes okay um why would you have to rent tapes when it's just get it on demand

5596
09:08:52,020 --> 09:08:59,460
well that didn't exist back then you have to rent it on tapes right be kind of rewind absolutely

5597
09:08:59,460 --> 09:09:07,860
okay those were the good old days they really were um i think um those tapes they used to sell

5598
09:09:07,860 --> 09:09:12,020
they'd only get so many uses out of them and then they would sell them as previously viewed

5599
09:09:12,580 --> 09:09:16,580
you know and i used to capitalize and add to my library if there's a movie i really liked

5600
09:09:16,580 --> 09:09:23,460
buy it previously viewed but you know what the quality was always on its way out because

5601
09:09:23,460 --> 09:09:29,220
every time you use that play that tape you'll lose a little bit of it so like for high end

5602
09:09:29,220 --> 09:09:35,860
production and video what they would do is um uh let's say you're making a documentary for the

5603
09:09:35,860 --> 09:09:40,420
discovery channel and you're shooting it on video now there's some different ways of doing

5604
09:09:40,500 --> 09:09:44,580
if you're shooting it on videotape what they would do is they'd go out and they'd shoot

5605
09:09:45,380 --> 09:09:49,860
you know the helicopter and these beautiful shots or whatever they'd get the original tape

5606
09:09:49,860 --> 09:09:56,660
they'd make one copy for the purposes of editing editing then they'd put the originals in a vault

5607
09:09:56,660 --> 09:10:01,060
and they wouldn't touch the originals then they would figure out what we want to edit this scene

5608
09:10:01,060 --> 09:10:05,380
we want to edit that scene we want to do this once they figured out where all the edits were then

5609
09:10:05,380 --> 09:10:10,500
they'd go back to the master tapes and they would make a recording of the segments that they want

5610
09:10:10,500 --> 09:10:17,460
and produce a video production knowing that every time they run that tape through the machine

5611
09:10:17,460 --> 09:10:24,340
they're lessening the video quality of what was on that tape so videotape any magnetic recording

5612
09:10:24,340 --> 09:10:29,860
media will over time lose its integrity there's no way around it

5613
09:10:35,220 --> 09:10:41,860
yep if you're burning them you're it with basically um uh traditionally it it it's not

5614
09:10:41,860 --> 09:10:48,820
magnetic per se but over time it will deteriorate the best method is what's um known as actual ram

5615
09:10:48,820 --> 09:10:54,660
like dvd ram and that's for archival purposes you want to you know do dvd ram so that's one

5616
09:10:54,660 --> 09:10:59,300
of the problems that i actually as soon as they had a dvd burner that was on the market that was

5617
09:10:59,300 --> 09:11:04,580
reasonable like vhs to dvd because when my kids growing up i shot a lot of home movies and stuff

5618
09:11:04,580 --> 09:11:08,660
and over time i knew those tapes were going to diminish every time i watched them those tapes

5619
09:11:08,660 --> 09:11:13,860
are going to diminish so i got them and then transferred them but to be honest with you i

5620
09:11:13,860 --> 09:11:20,580
should have transferred them to um dvd ram ram and it's kind of a niche niche thing but that's

5621
09:11:20,580 --> 09:11:25,300
going to last the best and it won't experience degradation all these other forms of media even

5622
09:11:25,300 --> 09:11:29,380
if you're burning your own dvds um they will degrade over time

5623
09:11:33,540 --> 09:11:39,060
so the way that magnetic tape works that tiny gap between the ends of the core is a magnetic field

5624
09:11:39,140 --> 09:11:43,940
a piece of material covered with iron oxide basically iron filings is pulled across the

5625
09:11:43,940 --> 09:11:52,340
record head magnetizing it information is written in a magnetized pattern to play back or read the

5626
09:11:52,340 --> 09:11:58,900
information the material is moved past the gap in a playback head the magnetic field induces a small

5627
09:11:58,900 --> 09:12:07,220
voltage into the coil winding when amplified the information is reproduced and this really

5628
09:12:07,220 --> 09:12:13,460
revolutionized the recording industry being able to i mean i remember back in the day i'm dating

5629
09:12:13,460 --> 09:12:19,620
myself but wow could actually own a cassette recorder and i could speak in real microphone

5630
09:12:19,620 --> 09:12:24,660
and record my voice on magnetic tape and then you could put it in and at a later date and hear

5631
09:12:24,660 --> 09:12:32,340
yourself wow that was really the big deal now we have cell phones that we talk into and digitally

5632
09:12:32,420 --> 09:12:40,340
record that examples that used this technology on tape would be cassette recorders video

5633
09:12:40,340 --> 09:12:44,980
recorders reel-to-reel recorders that were used in a lot of production studios and such

5634
09:12:46,260 --> 09:12:52,980
floppy disk drives floppy disk drive is nothing more than a a disk with particle on it with the

5635
09:12:52,980 --> 09:12:58,660
iron iron iron particles on it and believe it or not hard disk drives if you've got a hard drive

5636
09:12:58,660 --> 09:13:05,460
in your computer using the same technology a little bit better no a lot bit better okay because

5637
09:13:05,460 --> 09:13:11,940
now you're you could go out and buy a terabyte drive for forty nine dollars and the reliability

5638
09:13:11,940 --> 09:13:17,940
of that data is extremely high and if it's properly maintained you're really not going to lose

5639
09:13:17,940 --> 09:13:23,620
integrity of that data and that's really as far as i'm concerned this is really that's the best

5640
09:13:23,620 --> 09:13:29,620
method of storage my wife and i really enjoy amateur digital photography and when we go out

5641
09:13:29,620 --> 09:13:36,260
and shoot something when it's on the card we're at risk as soon as we plug that card in and we

5642
09:13:36,260 --> 09:13:44,580
copy it to one drive i primary drive okay then what i do is i mirror that on a secondary drive

5643
09:13:44,580 --> 09:13:51,380
and i mirror that on a tertiary drive and i also pay for a service to go back to that primary drive

5644
09:13:51,380 --> 09:13:58,900
and back it up offsite okay let me tell you in the middle of february in the middle of february

5645
09:13:59,460 --> 09:14:05,380
all right i fly to to fairbanks alaska minus 23 degrees to see see the aurora borealis to get

5646
09:14:05,380 --> 09:14:10,340
some pictures i don't want to lose those pictures because my hard drive fails so i want to make sure

5647
09:14:10,340 --> 09:14:17,220
i have backups to backups to backups so as long as you do that you're good with me just transferring

5648
09:14:17,220 --> 09:14:25,860
a home movie to a dvd i could lose integrity of that over time if it's backed up digitally on a

5649
09:14:25,860 --> 09:14:34,580
hard drive and you could again mirror that then then you're good dc motor operation depends on a

5650
09:14:34,580 --> 09:14:40,980
principle that a current carrying conductor placed in and at right angles to a magnetic field tends

5651
09:14:40,980 --> 09:14:44,500
to move at right angles in the direction of the field basically what we're saying is if we could

5652
09:14:44,500 --> 09:14:54,020
rotate a shaft and create dc why can't we apply a voltage to a winding and create motion

5653
09:14:57,220 --> 09:15:02,580
so the difference between a dc motor and a dc generator

5654
09:15:05,940 --> 09:15:13,220
is perception most cases they could be used either way it's actually one of the things that

5655
09:15:13,220 --> 09:15:18,980
they use for power management over at the grand coulee dam i don't know if any of you have any

5656
09:15:18,980 --> 09:15:23,780
of you go recreating over in central washington you ever go camping or anything out there it's

5657
09:15:23,780 --> 09:15:27,460
really amazing if you have a chance to go out there this is stuff again they were thinking

5658
09:15:27,460 --> 09:15:36,180
about in the early 1900s okay you got the columbia river they built a dam on it not just any dam the

5659
09:15:36,180 --> 09:15:41,380
grand coulee dam okay and what they did behind the dam is they created lake roosevelt

5660
09:15:43,620 --> 09:15:52,340
for the purposes of irrigation and to store energy to store energy during low demand times

5661
09:15:53,220 --> 09:15:58,580
what they did is they have the generator's turn you can't stop the columbia river it's a river you're

5662
09:15:58,580 --> 09:16:02,420
going to kill all the fish so you can't just shut the river off you got to keep the water flowing

5663
09:16:02,420 --> 09:16:10,180
but if it's low demand time get that harness the electricity then with the electricity drive pumps

5664
09:16:11,140 --> 09:16:17,540
drive pumps and they pump the water from lake roosevelt up to banks lake

5665
09:16:19,220 --> 09:16:25,140
banks lake very popular for water skiing and recreating banks lake goes to feed agriculture

5666
09:16:25,860 --> 09:16:33,220
and then during peak demand times what they could do is turn it backwards and catch the energy flowing

5667
09:16:33,220 --> 09:16:39,940
back to lake roosevelt producing energy and then catch it falling back into the columbia river

5668
09:16:39,940 --> 09:16:45,940
and harnessing it twice so basically you're using the water to store the energy by simply pumping

5669
09:16:45,940 --> 09:16:55,300
it to a higher elevation during that low demand time brilliant brilliant you know and again they

5670
09:16:55,300 --> 09:17:02,260
figured this stuff all out in the early 1900s so that's what they've got between lake roosevelt

5671
09:17:02,260 --> 09:17:09,460
and banks lake basically our motor generators that you can turn either way and you know either

5672
09:17:09,460 --> 09:17:14,900
turn it backwards pump the water up or catch the water falling and generate electricity

5673
09:17:25,140 --> 09:17:31,460
and this is simply the process of creating a magnetic field that attracts and opposes and

5674
09:17:32,580 --> 09:17:36,980
creating motion instead of motion being used to create a magnetic field

5675
09:17:37,220 --> 09:17:41,700
now we're harnessing the magnetic field to create motion with a dc motor

5676
09:17:42,580 --> 09:17:48,100
another area that uses electromagnetic fields tv radar computer terminals what we're talking

5677
09:17:48,100 --> 09:17:53,540
about is the old school monitor like that old school monitor like that basically in the back

5678
09:17:53,540 --> 09:17:59,300
of a monitor like that there's an electron gun so you get to get to go home tonight what did

5679
09:17:59,300 --> 09:18:03,220
you learn about in school my instructor was talking about them they're electron guns

5680
09:18:04,020 --> 09:18:08,980
it's gonna zap us now an electron gun basically sits in the back of a cathode ray tube and shoots

5681
09:18:08,980 --> 09:18:16,740
an electron beam out towards the screen that electron beam is going to be controlled through

5682
09:18:16,740 --> 09:18:23,540
deflection windings the deflection windings are horizontal and vertical and that's what's

5683
09:18:23,540 --> 09:18:30,100
going to be used to basically paint the image on the screen it's your x-axis and your y-axis

5684
09:18:30,660 --> 09:18:37,860
so that's how we'd use that to paint an image now with flat screen monitors we're doing things a

5685
09:18:37,860 --> 09:18:43,300
little bit different but it's kind of an evolutionary process based on what we were doing with that

5686
09:18:43,300 --> 09:18:50,980
magnetic field in summary we talked about magnets natural magnets

5687
09:18:53,300 --> 09:18:59,060
unnatural magnets artificial magnets and electromagnets come in many shapes and sizes

5688
09:18:59,060 --> 09:19:04,900
big thing to remember unlike poles a track like poles repel two theories of magnetism

5689
09:19:04,900 --> 09:19:11,700
electron spin and domains flux lines are those invisible forces that we can't see

5690
09:19:14,500 --> 09:19:19,780
you know this lecture wouldn't be complete if we didn't talk about you know anomalies

5691
09:19:19,780 --> 09:19:26,580
you've all heard of the bermuda triangle right well science or science fiction

5692
09:19:26,580 --> 09:19:32,980
i mean they've got some really good hard evidence of magnetic anomalies that occur there so

5693
09:19:32,980 --> 09:19:41,460
if you're navigating solely by compass and you encounter unusual magnetic fields

5694
09:19:41,460 --> 09:19:45,380
or you're flying an airplane that's again has a gyro compass in it

5695
09:19:48,020 --> 09:19:53,460
it could cause problems big problems for you magnetic disturbances there's actually on aeronautical

5696
09:19:53,460 --> 09:19:58,980
charts they put down areas that have big magnetic disturbance areas that they're that they're used

5697
09:19:58,980 --> 09:20:03,460
to the bermuda triangles one of them it's actually one of the things it's kind of interesting too

5698
09:20:03,460 --> 09:20:10,500
that i see a lot of these like ghost hunters using um is equipment to basically sense magnetic fields

5699
09:20:11,380 --> 09:20:16,100
and there you know there's there's um you know a school out there that basically says that

5700
09:20:16,100 --> 09:20:22,020
you know spirits possess this energy and this energy manifests itself as a magnetic field so if

5701
09:20:22,020 --> 09:20:26,260
you have sensitive enough equipment and you know i've i don't know anybody watching those shows on

5702
09:20:26,260 --> 09:20:30,900
tv you know i've watched enough that something's going on something's going on and actually quite

5703
09:20:30,900 --> 09:20:37,620
frankly i think we're very we're very naive if if you know we only believe what we could see

5704
09:20:37,620 --> 09:20:45,140
with our five senses you know so um you know i think there's probably some truth in some of this

5705
09:20:45,140 --> 09:20:51,460
stuff we talked about the magnetic field determining direction of flux lines we talked about

5706
09:20:51,460 --> 09:20:58,900
electromagnets strength polarity retentivity electromagnetic induction we talked about Faraday's

5707
09:20:58,900 --> 09:21:06,660
law right parallel perpendicular we not only talked about the left hand rule for generators but i

5708
09:21:06,660 --> 09:21:13,060
gave you a specific warning and not doing that in your car in your drive home as someone might think

5709
09:21:13,060 --> 09:21:19,140
you're giving a gang signs we talked about ac and dc generators big thing to remember about an ac

5710
09:21:19,140 --> 09:21:28,100
generator right slip rings dc generator commutator ac generator makes a wave that's half positive half

5711
09:21:28,100 --> 09:21:35,460
negative dc generator makes pulsating positive waves relays basically electromechanical switches

5712
09:21:37,380 --> 09:21:43,140
a moving armature or a series of ganged armatures contacts on armature

5713
09:21:43,940 --> 09:21:48,980
we talked about how we could use this for doorbell solenoids phonograph pickups loud

5714
09:21:48,980 --> 09:21:55,620
speakers magnetic recordings and then finally we talked about dc motors and yes meters that dr is

5715
09:21:55,620 --> 09:22:00,980
involved meter movement is nothing more than a permanent magnets and a coil when you pass

5716
09:22:00,980 --> 09:22:04,660
current through that coil you either attract or oppose causing the needle move

5717
09:22:05,540 --> 09:22:13,620
and then finally we talked about the electron beams created by electron guns

5718
09:22:14,580 --> 09:22:22,980
to the back of a crt that's how we used to create television signals radar displays oscilloscopes

5719
09:22:22,980 --> 09:22:28,740
and computer terminals and we have any questions on anything that we covered in this chapter there's

5720
09:22:28,740 --> 09:22:35,220
a lot of new terms to familiarize yourself with this less math more remembering new terms

5721
09:22:36,420 --> 09:22:50,980
question i have the flux capacitor in back to the future i have no idea what that is

5722
09:22:51,540 --> 09:22:57,620
and i probably wouldn't recognize it you know if i if i saw it so um yeah

5723
09:22:58,740 --> 09:23:03,060
there's no reference to the flux capacitor it's just a completely made up thing that they came

5724
09:23:03,060 --> 09:23:08,340
up with pretty much i don't know if there's any wikipedia references to it you know it could

5725
09:23:08,340 --> 09:23:28,020
be a fun project to try to build one i reckon well you guys are stomping me tonight

5726
09:23:29,300 --> 09:23:33,140
uh i don't know that's what they've always caused it yeah it should be like an electron beam

5727
09:23:33,140 --> 09:23:42,420
tube cathode ray tube cathode sends out an electron ray and it's a vacuum tube cathode ray tube

5728
09:23:44,100 --> 09:23:48,100
electron beam i don't know got me good question

5729
09:23:50,420 --> 09:23:53,540
yeah let me tell you if i was the pope of electronics all of this stuff would have been

5730
09:23:53,540 --> 09:23:58,980
called something easier simpler you know some of the stuff you just got to hit the i believe button

5731
09:23:58,980 --> 09:24:04,900
but suffice to say like say magnetism it is really really critical um that's actually one of things

5732
09:24:04,900 --> 09:24:09,780
too that i don't know if you um i can't confirm or deny but the the movie hunt for right october

5733
09:24:10,740 --> 09:24:23,220
you know um that was basically a hydrodynamic drive that was based on magnetic field and um

5734
09:24:24,260 --> 09:24:28,580
you know you could look at that and say science fiction science or science fiction i of course

5735
09:24:28,580 --> 09:24:34,500
cannot comment on it um but if you research that type of technology the japanese and the japanese

5736
09:24:34,500 --> 09:24:39,860
of course is an island nation they're very dependent and always have been dependent on trade

5737
09:24:39,860 --> 09:24:44,820
they've played around with that technology on barges to see if they could you know move a barge

5738
09:24:44,820 --> 09:24:50,500
using this you know hydrodynamic drive system and um you know again it's not mainstream but

5739
09:24:50,500 --> 09:25:06,500
they've played around enough with it so

5740
09:25:11,300 --> 09:25:19,380
yeah and to be honest with you um you know and i haven't i haven't wrote a nuclear submarine

5741
09:25:19,380 --> 09:25:25,620
in over 20 years um i know that we had submarines out there that were so quiet you wouldn't hear

5742
09:25:25,620 --> 09:25:31,620
the submarine what you would hear is the submarine blocking biological noise behind it

5743
09:25:31,620 --> 09:25:37,460
so it's like if you had something big going past your your ear you know something is there

5744
09:25:37,460 --> 09:25:43,300
because it's blocking the sound so i mean that was 20 plus years ago so we've never had a problem

5745
09:25:43,300 --> 09:25:49,620
keeping quiet and keeping keeping things real quiet um but performance is another issue see if

5746
09:25:49,620 --> 09:25:53,860
you want to go fast underwater you're going to make some noise and that that will give a location

5747
09:25:53,860 --> 09:26:02,980
you know give your your your tell basically so any questions any other questions comments concerns

5748
09:26:03,060 --> 09:26:16,180
all right the long anticipated lecture chapter 10 inductance

5749
09:26:20,180 --> 09:26:27,220
this is uh this is going to be an unusual property for us to discuss compared to what

5750
09:26:27,220 --> 09:26:32,420
we've talked about up to this point what we've talked about up to this point really is

5751
09:26:33,620 --> 09:26:41,220
conductance resistance period in discussing inductance you're going to see that things with

5752
09:26:41,220 --> 09:26:50,580
inductance change over time okay the property actually changes the influence it has in a circuit

5753
09:26:50,580 --> 09:26:58,420
changes over time so you're going to see that this is uh very dynamic literally dynamic component

5754
09:26:58,420 --> 09:27:04,980
and property chapter 10 inductance after completing this chapter you're going to be able to explain

5755
09:27:04,980 --> 09:27:11,300
the principles of inductance identify the basic units of inductance identify different types of

5756
09:27:11,300 --> 09:27:21,060
inductors determine the total inductance in series parallel circuits explain l r time constants and

5757
09:27:21,060 --> 09:27:30,740
how they relate to inductance now the property of inductance is that characteristic of an

5758
09:27:30,740 --> 09:27:39,540
electrical conductor that opposes a change in current flow opposes a change in current flow

5759
09:27:42,020 --> 09:27:48,420
the symbol that we use is the capital letter l so in a circuit if you see on a schematic

5760
09:27:48,420 --> 09:27:57,220
diagram l equals that means inductance is equal to whatever specific amount is identified

5761
09:27:59,060 --> 09:28:06,180
now an inductor is a specific device designed to possess this property of inductance

5762
09:28:06,500 --> 09:28:17,300
an inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field and it's important for us to

5763
09:28:17,300 --> 09:28:21,700
understand this property because we're going to counter this next chapter when we talk about

5764
09:28:21,700 --> 09:28:28,340
capacitance right i'll let the cat out of the bag capacitance is an electrostatic field

5765
09:28:29,140 --> 09:28:36,100
inductance is an electromagnetic field that's what's the magic behind an inductor

5766
09:28:38,660 --> 09:28:43,300
now once current is moving through a conductor inductance helps to keep it moving

5767
09:28:45,860 --> 09:28:52,580
as the magnetic flux lines build up they create an opposition to the flow of current

5768
09:28:53,140 --> 09:28:57,540
an opposition to the flow of current

5769
09:29:00,180 --> 09:29:10,260
lens's law talks about that lens's law states an induced emf in any circuit

5770
09:29:11,300 --> 09:29:17,940
is always in a direction to oppose the effect that produced it the amount of counter emf is

5771
09:29:17,940 --> 09:29:22,820
proportional to the rate of change the faster the rate of change the greater the counter emf

5772
09:29:23,460 --> 09:29:29,460
so what this means let's go back last chapter that we talked about remember magnetism

5773
09:29:30,660 --> 09:29:35,540
remember when we pass current through a conductor we create a magnetic field

5774
09:29:35,540 --> 09:29:48,820
lens's law says if the current was going data way it's going to create an electromagnetic

5775
09:29:48,820 --> 09:29:59,220
field like this make sense if we shut the circuit off that electromagnetic field is going to

5776
09:30:00,180 --> 09:30:08,180
collapse and it's going to produce a counter electromotive force that goes

5777
09:30:09,540 --> 09:30:16,660
that way the opposite way of what created it so if the emf goes that way and it creates some

5778
09:30:16,660 --> 09:30:21,140
magnetic field like this magnetic field collapses it creates a counter emf that goes in the opposite

5779
09:30:21,140 --> 09:30:26,660
direction so the second part there talks about the rate of change

5780
09:30:29,220 --> 09:30:35,140
the faster we turn that on and off on and off on and off expand collapse expand collapse

5781
09:30:35,140 --> 09:30:38,980
the more the faster we do it the more pronounced that effect is going to be

5782
09:30:40,740 --> 09:30:47,060
if you connect one of these one of them there inductors to a dc circuit it's going to happen

5783
09:30:47,060 --> 09:30:53,940
once when you close the circuit and energize it and when you de-energize it that field's

5784
09:30:53,940 --> 09:30:57,620
going to collapse and create that counter current so it's only going to happen once it's going to

5785
09:30:57,620 --> 09:31:04,820
expand once and it's going to collapse once now i'm going to let out a little secret because

5786
09:31:04,820 --> 09:31:15,140
you guys have all read ahead ac what's one thing that's constant about ac it's constantly

5787
09:31:16,100 --> 09:31:23,060
changing very good constantly changing so the higher the ac frequency is that we apply to one

5788
09:31:23,060 --> 09:31:26,980
of these devices the more pronounced this effect is going to be does that make sense

5789
09:31:28,260 --> 09:31:34,180
it goes back to lenses law and again anytime that in class i i say anything about a law

5790
09:31:35,300 --> 09:31:38,580
we should like ring a bell dim the lights hit some chimes

5791
09:31:39,460 --> 09:31:48,500
and hit a gong because laws you could take to the bank

5792
09:31:50,900 --> 09:31:57,380
you answer a question on your quiz using a law on an exam using a law you approach a project

5793
09:31:58,020 --> 09:32:01,940
or a lab assignment using a law you're going to get good results

5794
09:32:02,420 --> 09:32:09,780
now inductance is measured by the henry and this was invented by a guy whose name was

5795
09:32:10,980 --> 09:32:11,460
george

5796
09:32:14,260 --> 09:32:17,700
guy by the name of joe henry my main man

5797
09:32:19,940 --> 09:32:22,900
henry ironically is abbreviated with the letter h

5798
09:32:23,860 --> 09:32:33,780
and one henry is the amount of inductance required to induce an emf of one volt

5799
09:32:34,900 --> 09:32:41,060
when the current in the conductor changes at a rate of one amp per second

5800
09:32:42,660 --> 09:32:50,100
so one henry is equal to one volt of emf at one amp per second one is equal to one over one

5801
09:32:50,180 --> 09:32:54,100
one over one second

5802
09:32:57,380 --> 09:33:01,860
now in electronics the typical values that we're going to see

5803
09:33:04,260 --> 09:33:10,580
will be the mille henry times ten to the negative third the micro henry times ten to the negative

5804
09:33:10,580 --> 09:33:16,020
sixth in some high power applications you may see henry's

5805
09:33:20,100 --> 09:33:24,660
but generally speaking most of the stuff that we're working with in micro electronics mille

5806
09:33:24,660 --> 09:33:33,780
henry's micro henry's now inductors are those specific devices designed to possess the property of

5807
09:33:34,340 --> 09:33:41,460
inductance so they're designed to have a specific inductance that's why come they be invented

5808
09:33:42,020 --> 09:33:53,620
they consist of a conductor coiled around a core remember if we got like x amount of magnetism

5809
09:33:53,620 --> 09:34:00,740
by creating one turn how much would we get if we make two turns twice as much it's that simple

5810
09:34:00,740 --> 09:34:07,940
it's easy math consists of a conductor coiled around a core and it's classified by the type of

5811
09:34:07,940 --> 09:34:13,860
core material whether it's magnetic or non magnetic if we use a magnetic core material

5812
09:34:13,860 --> 09:34:17,940
we're going to get a higher amount of inductance out of it if we use non magnetic we're going to

5813
09:34:17,940 --> 09:34:25,060
get a little bit lower out of it so sometimes they'll use that core material to get it just

5814
09:34:25,060 --> 09:34:35,860
not too much not too little but just right this is the schematic diagram for a fixed inductor

5815
09:34:38,180 --> 09:34:41,940
and for those of you out there that want to go home and roll your own you could do that

5816
09:34:42,820 --> 09:34:52,580
you just need magnetic wire magnetic wire is basically thin copper wire solid core that has

5817
09:34:52,580 --> 09:34:57,700
a lacquer coating on it if you've ever looked into a transformer or motor and you see the windings

5818
09:34:58,820 --> 09:35:04,500
that's magnetic wire it's all you need some cases you don't even need magnetic wire

5819
09:35:04,500 --> 09:35:09,540
because you could you could roll a coil and as long as the wires aren't touching each other

5820
09:35:09,540 --> 09:35:16,660
you're using air as an insulation you could roll your own i've been known to roll my own on a few

5821
09:35:16,660 --> 09:35:26,340
times with mixed results i have no idea what i'm talking about actually i know exactly what i'm

5822
09:35:26,340 --> 09:35:36,020
talking about this is a variable inductor created with an adjustable core material now the way they

5823
09:35:36,020 --> 09:35:41,300
they come up with this is pretty fascinating what they'll do is they'll get a a ferromagnetic

5824
09:35:42,260 --> 09:35:52,100
core material typically like powdered iron and then they they basically form it into a material

5825
09:35:52,100 --> 09:35:57,700
precedent material and then they thread it and then they thread the center of the core

5826
09:35:57,700 --> 09:36:05,700
and what you could actually do with it right is righty tighty lefty lucy screw it in and as you

5827
09:36:05,700 --> 09:36:12,100
screw it in what are you doing you're you're increasing the magnetic influence of the iron core

5828
09:36:14,420 --> 09:36:19,780
so by simply adjusting that this is used for fine tuning in a lot of circuits that contain these

5829
09:36:19,780 --> 09:36:26,420
very fine subtle tuning another thing that you could do and i used to see this old school not as

5830
09:36:26,420 --> 09:36:36,660
much now they would use a brass insert and when you screw brass in what are you doing brass has a

5831
09:36:36,660 --> 09:36:43,060
high level of reluctance so it's going to oppose that magnetic field so by screwing it in you're

5832
09:36:43,060 --> 09:36:49,620
lowering the amount of inductance if it was iron core and you screwed it in you'd be increasing

5833
09:36:50,100 --> 09:36:59,060
so it's counter-intuitive and it gets worse because what would happen is typically the

5834
09:36:59,060 --> 09:37:04,660
questions that i used to be asked in a lot of my military navy equipment schools what we would

5835
09:37:04,660 --> 09:37:09,860
have were circuit card extenders so you would do is take the circuit card out put it in the

5836
09:37:09,860 --> 09:37:14,660
extender and then now the circuit card was was mounted above the rest so that you could get in

5837
09:37:14,660 --> 09:37:20,340
there and adjust make adjustments a lot of times you'd have to make the adjustments from the back

5838
09:37:20,340 --> 09:37:26,020
side they'd have a little hole physically in the in the board that you could put your adjustment

5839
09:37:26,020 --> 09:37:33,540
alignment tool in so then they'd ask if approaching it from the back side which direction needs you

5840
09:37:33,540 --> 09:37:42,020
turn the inductor to see a decrease in inductance so it's one of those things that you know you kind

5841
09:37:42,100 --> 09:37:49,300
of let's see if i'm turning it clockwise from the top that's going to be counterclockwise from the

5842
09:37:49,300 --> 09:37:58,820
backside but it's it's brass core so as i'm turning it counterclockwise i'm really moving i mean it's

5843
09:37:58,820 --> 09:38:04,340
just these questions that like you thought your head was going to explode but you know what you

5844
09:38:04,340 --> 09:38:10,340
kind of had a well i don't see how that really ever helped me in life knowing that stuff because

5845
09:38:10,340 --> 09:38:14,900
basically when you got out to the fleet you put a circuit you set up your test fixture and basically

5846
09:38:14,900 --> 09:38:20,180
as soon as you start turning it the wrong way you see needles go the wrong way and you turn it back

5847
09:38:20,180 --> 09:38:24,180
and you get it to where it needs to be and you're done with it you don't sit there and well let's

5848
09:38:24,180 --> 09:38:30,500
see if i approach and if i'm using a mirror i'm actually seeing the inverse i mean just crazy

5849
09:38:30,500 --> 09:38:35,700
stuff but think about that because these still and some of you may work on some legacy equipment

5850
09:38:35,700 --> 09:38:41,700
it's fun to repair legacy equipment to retrofit to do things like that

5851
09:38:43,060 --> 09:38:49,380
so you may end up finding some of this stuff this is my personal collection of inductors

5852
09:38:52,180 --> 09:38:53,540
guys actually believe me

5853
09:38:56,420 --> 09:39:02,900
this is an air core inductor this is a fixed value inductor and that's all it is this wire

5854
09:39:02,900 --> 09:39:11,780
wound around a magnetic core it's all it is all of these can type here are adjustable and actually

5855
09:39:11,780 --> 09:39:18,980
if you could look here this almost looks like this takes a hex head right like an allen an allen head

5856
09:39:22,740 --> 09:39:30,500
whatever you do don't use an allen wrench to try to adjust this because typically the allen wrench

5857
09:39:30,500 --> 09:39:40,100
in your toolkit is made out of iron steel ferromagnetic material so as soon as you get it in close

5858
09:39:40,100 --> 09:39:46,500
proximity and you adjust it and get it just so you're going to remove part of the magnetic

5859
09:39:46,500 --> 09:39:54,340
influence and your numbers are going to go caddywampus so all of these need to be adjusted with

5860
09:39:54,340 --> 09:40:02,340
non-magnetic alignment tools i've got a i've got a roll a tool roll at home from back in the day

5861
09:40:02,340 --> 09:40:07,460
i should bring it in as an example it's this big tool roll it's like every alignment tool known to

5862
09:40:07,460 --> 09:40:15,220
humankind and they're basically all plastic heads the other thing too is uh you know you stick your

5863
09:40:16,020 --> 09:40:21,780
a hex head in there you stand a chance of damaging that and even if you break off a little bit of

5864
09:40:21,780 --> 09:40:27,940
material that amount of material was designed engineered to be there to create x amount of

5865
09:40:27,940 --> 09:40:35,540
magnetic field so you kind of got to you kind of got to get it right so don't start if you don't

5866
09:40:35,540 --> 09:40:41,380
have the right tool don't touch this stuff so it's typically called an alignment tool or actually a

5867
09:40:41,380 --> 09:40:49,940
tweaker in the classical sense of the word a tweaker and you could always tell who the technicians

5868
09:40:49,940 --> 09:40:56,100
were you know because they'd always have the tweaker in their pockets and you knew it's kind

5869
09:40:56,100 --> 09:41:00,980
of funny back in uniform submarine base in connecticut i'd be walking around i'd see you with

5870
09:41:00,980 --> 09:41:06,180
tweaker in your pocket you know at the at the at the deli or whatever and i knew exactly what you

5871
09:41:06,180 --> 09:41:10,500
did for a living the only guys running around only goofballs running around with tweakers in

5872
09:41:10,500 --> 09:41:14,660
their freaking pocket were electronics techs that were regularly aligning equipment

5873
09:41:19,060 --> 09:41:28,580
air core this is an inductor well not without core material because it has air in the core that's

5874
09:41:28,580 --> 09:41:37,300
why it's called air core it's used for values up to five millihenries of inductance wrapped on

5875
09:41:37,300 --> 09:41:42,740
ceramic or phenolic core in this case it was probably wrapped around a dowel or something

5876
09:41:42,740 --> 09:41:48,260
and then removed and it has form in and of itself this is actually a really good photograph because

5877
09:41:48,260 --> 09:41:52,900
you could see the magnetic wire here and you could see where the insulation has been stripped

5878
09:41:52,900 --> 09:41:58,500
this is bare wire and then this is insulated a lot of times people see this and they think that

5879
09:41:58,500 --> 09:42:05,940
it's bare wire it's not bare wire it's insulated one of the best ways of getting this insulation

5880
09:42:05,940 --> 09:42:12,740
off if you're going to do a lot of this is with a chemical stripper chemical stripper

5881
09:42:14,660 --> 09:42:17,940
and basically it's it's like a thinning agent you dip it in

5882
09:42:19,940 --> 09:42:26,100
paint thinner paint a remover and it removes that right down to the the metal and it makes

5883
09:42:26,100 --> 09:42:30,420
it solderable you have to put a neutralizing agent on it but that's the best way of doing it

5884
09:42:30,420 --> 09:42:34,740
other than that you know you're going to get your wire strippers and your wire strippers are just

5885
09:42:34,740 --> 09:42:42,340
basically going to scratch the stuff off it's not going to really because this is a lacker coating on it

5886
09:42:45,860 --> 09:42:50,340
but that's this is an inductor believe it or not just a piece of wire making those five turns

5887
09:42:50,900 --> 09:42:54,820
it's going to give you x amount of inductance might be enough for you to get the job done

5888
09:42:54,820 --> 09:42:59,700
question on the last air core picture that you had there was a piece of metal going through it

5889
09:43:04,740 --> 09:43:12,820
this piece right here i think somehow this is mounted this this serves as a a form somehow to

5890
09:43:12,820 --> 09:43:20,340
keep that the shape of it i really don't know usually they're hollow though yeah oh yeah yeah

5891
09:43:20,340 --> 09:43:25,940
this is not here to influence the magnetic or all it's either there for aesthetics or to help the

5892
09:43:25,940 --> 09:43:31,700
way that's mounted or what have you it's a good observation some of these things are actually

5893
09:43:31,700 --> 09:43:35,940
pretty cool looking again anyway when you get into some of that older equipment they made it with a

5894
09:43:35,940 --> 09:43:42,660
certain level of elegance you know and um this would be an example of that if you opened up an old

5895
09:43:42,660 --> 09:43:49,860
in a 1930s radio you'd probably find that inductor that looks like that in there it's 1970s radio no

5896
09:43:49,860 --> 09:44:00,980
you're not going to find that in there iron core iron core could be either ferrite or powdered iron

5897
09:44:01,780 --> 09:44:07,860
it's a typo not ion ion core captain the ion core is melting down

5898
09:44:11,540 --> 09:44:18,740
damn damn you scotty that's why i'm not into drama right not a very dramatic kind of guy

5899
09:44:20,420 --> 09:44:28,260
it's iron core used for values of 200 millihenrys of inductance typically up to 200 millihenrys of

5900
09:44:28,260 --> 09:44:34,100
inductance schematic symbol shows these two parallel lines next to the coil that shows that

5901
09:44:34,100 --> 09:44:46,340
there's an iron core next to the coil torrid core these are donut shape but do not try to eat them

5902
09:44:49,780 --> 09:44:56,100
they offer a high inductance for a small size these are very prolific in a lot of contemporary

5903
09:44:56,100 --> 09:45:02,260
electronic applications because the magnetic field is contained in the core offers a very

5904
09:45:02,260 --> 09:45:09,540
high inductance for very small size if you opened up a computer power supply you'd find

5905
09:45:09,540 --> 09:45:15,620
a bunch of these inside a lot of inductance for a relatively small package

5906
09:45:18,100 --> 09:45:23,300
i've had graduates have gone to work for companies and they had to do this part of their job roll

5907
09:45:23,300 --> 09:45:29,220
their own they're giving the blank core spool of wire and you sit there and you

5908
09:45:29,220 --> 09:45:34,420
thread it through and tighten it up thread it through tighten it up clean the leads

5909
09:45:34,420 --> 09:45:38,420
solder it in the boards actually pretty good job most of the people that are playing around with

5910
09:45:38,420 --> 09:45:44,500
this stuff are for rf applications radio frequency high energy radio frequency mr. ground what's

5911
09:45:44,500 --> 09:45:47,860
going on man i had a question you just backed their waving man take

5912
09:45:52,820 --> 09:45:53,300
what's up

5913
09:45:53,300 --> 09:46:04,100
up

5914
09:46:07,220 --> 09:46:13,620
yeah yep so it's not wasting that field going outside it's containing it basically

5915
09:46:14,900 --> 09:46:16,100
increases the efficiency

5916
09:46:18,100 --> 09:46:19,300
which makes it more better

5917
09:46:23,940 --> 09:46:30,580
this is a shielded core shield of core have a shield of magnetic material to protect them from

5918
09:46:30,580 --> 09:46:36,020
the influence of other magnetic fields because if you've got a couple of these in close proximity

5919
09:46:36,020 --> 09:46:42,420
to each other one field could influence another device now if you just saw this if you didn't

5920
09:46:42,420 --> 09:46:48,580
know any better what would you think this device was now looks like a transformer and the only

5921
09:46:48,580 --> 09:46:54,980
tell that there is on this is there's only two wires if you look on the other side you wouldn't

5922
09:46:54,980 --> 09:47:01,540
find any other wires but it would look exactly like a transformer as a matter of fact you can

5923
09:47:01,540 --> 09:47:08,420
use a transformer as an inductor if you don't connect the secondary leads the primer if you

5924
09:47:08,420 --> 09:47:17,540
only use just the coil you could use a transformer as an inductor for some applications that's why

5925
09:47:17,540 --> 09:47:23,620
i've got a garage full of junk because i won't throw a transformer away because someday i may

5926
09:47:23,620 --> 09:47:34,340
want to use it as an inductor this is laminated core and again if you didn't know any better

5927
09:47:34,340 --> 09:47:40,820
you'd think it was a transformer we know it's an inductor because there's only two wires coming

5928
09:47:40,820 --> 09:47:51,060
out of it and the top is stamped 4.5 henry's 4.5 h and this was going to vary from 0.1 henry's all

5929
09:47:51,060 --> 09:48:04,580
the way up to 100 henry's this is also sometimes referred to as a choke as a choke used as a choke

5930
09:48:04,660 --> 09:48:13,940
in automotive applications noise filters meaning to choke off a change it's going to choke the change

5931
09:48:20,340 --> 09:48:25,460
just like resistors inductors could be connected in series parallel or series parallel

5932
09:48:25,940 --> 09:48:34,180
when you're dealing with inductors measured in henry's in series you treat them exactly like

5933
09:48:34,180 --> 09:48:43,460
resistors plain and simple if i've got two henry's and i put it in series with four henry's two plus

5934
09:48:43,940 --> 09:48:53,220
four equals six i now i now get six henry's worth of inductance in parallel you treat them like

5935
09:48:55,140 --> 09:49:01,060
resistors in parallel so the total inductance will always be less than the value of least

5936
09:49:03,620 --> 09:49:07,860
as long as you're dealing with the property measured in henry's

5937
09:49:07,860 --> 09:49:15,140
now this is where things get interesting everything else i've been talking up to this

5938
09:49:15,140 --> 09:49:23,940
point it's just been kind of hey it's trying to get to know you this the real deal this

5939
09:49:25,460 --> 09:49:28,100
dis is what it's all about

5940
09:49:28,420 --> 09:49:37,620
it's a series circuit it's a series circuit i've got a switch that has two positions one is called

5941
09:49:37,620 --> 09:49:42,820
the growth mode and the other is the decay mode okay so this switch i could toggle from either

5942
09:49:42,820 --> 09:49:51,460
growth to decay when it's in the growth mode i have a simple series circuit do i not and the

5943
09:49:51,460 --> 09:49:58,660
circuit contains an inductor actually what an iron core inductor because i see the parallel

5944
09:49:58,660 --> 09:50:08,420
lines the inductor in series with a resistor makes sense when i close the switch

5945
09:50:10,580 --> 09:50:16,820
as soon as i close the switch it's going to allow current to flow through this circuit do you agree

5946
09:50:16,820 --> 09:50:24,020
with me what's going to happen is that current is going to come racing through the circuit

5947
09:50:24,020 --> 09:50:29,700
negative the positive all of a sudden it's going to hit this curly piece of wire and that curly

5948
09:50:29,700 --> 09:50:34,900
piece of wire it's hitting is an inductor an inductor is a specific device designed to possess

5949
09:50:34,900 --> 09:50:42,100
the property of inductance inductance is that property which tries to oppose a change in current

5950
09:50:42,740 --> 09:50:49,780
so current was at zero it wants to go to 100 percent and this device is going to say uh-uh

5951
09:50:50,580 --> 09:50:54,740
i want you to stay at zero why because you've been at zero and i like it like that

5952
09:50:58,180 --> 09:51:02,820
but eventually as the current continues to come that magnetic field builds

5953
09:51:02,820 --> 09:51:08,100
and current eventually goes to maximum it goes to 100 percent for this circuit

5954
09:51:09,060 --> 09:51:15,620
but the inductor because of its property of inductance is going to fight the whole time

5955
09:51:16,420 --> 09:51:22,100
to try to prevent that change from occurring but eventually it's going to lose

5956
09:51:25,620 --> 09:51:30,820
so close the switch turn the circuit on the inductor is going to fight fight fight fight

5957
09:51:30,820 --> 09:51:34,740
fight fight and eventually give up and current's going to be at 100 percent flowing through this

5958
09:51:34,740 --> 09:51:40,500
circuit and by the way by the way when current is at 100 percent flowing through this inductor

5959
09:51:41,700 --> 09:51:45,540
electrons are like what's up with that it's a piece of curly wire

5960
09:51:47,780 --> 09:51:52,260
after a period of time the electrons it's like why am i going through a piece of curly wire

5961
09:51:52,900 --> 09:51:55,700
it just has no effect on them whatsoever

5962
09:51:56,660 --> 09:52:05,700
and the circuit runs and runs and runs soon as we get the switch and move the switch from the

5963
09:52:05,700 --> 09:52:13,700
growth mode to the decay mode the magnetic field that was built up around inductor l1

5964
09:52:14,420 --> 09:52:18,340
is going to collapse and it's going to collapse

5965
09:52:18,740 --> 09:52:26,100
into itself when it collapses into itself what is it going to do

5966
09:52:29,540 --> 09:52:35,460
it's going to act like a what happens when a magnetic field passes through a conductor

5967
09:52:40,740 --> 09:52:46,500
we induce we induce current if we move a conductor through a magnetic field we induce current

5968
09:52:46,500 --> 09:52:51,140
if the if the if the conductor is stationary and the magnetic field moves through a conductor

5969
09:52:52,420 --> 09:52:59,220
we're going to generate current right so as soon as i move this to the decay mode this magnetic

5970
09:52:59,220 --> 09:53:06,820
field is going to collapse into itself creating a counter current lenses law remember the opposite

5971
09:53:06,820 --> 09:53:12,740
of the force that created it and then that current is basically going to flow through the circuit

5972
09:53:13,620 --> 09:53:14,740
until it dissipates

5973
09:53:18,740 --> 09:53:22,820
but if this was just a series circuit made up of a resistor a resistor and a switch

5974
09:53:22,820 --> 09:53:30,420
you turn it on boom you go to a hundred percent you turn it off pow you go to zero now with an

5975
09:53:30,420 --> 09:53:37,700
inductor in here you turn it on it's going to come up and eventually get to a hundred percent

5976
09:53:37,700 --> 09:53:42,180
you turn it off the magnetic field's going to collapse and eventually it's going to get down

5977
09:53:42,180 --> 09:53:48,180
to zero percent you follow what i'm talking about you guys know what i'm talking about i'm beating

5978
09:53:48,180 --> 09:53:55,220
around the bush what am i talking about time constants time constants the time required

5979
09:53:55,220 --> 09:54:03,460
for current through a conductor to increase to 63.2 percent so if i apply 100 to it and that first

5980
09:54:03,460 --> 09:54:11,780
time constant it's going to rise 63.2 percent in the next time constant it's going to gain

5981
09:54:11,780 --> 09:54:18,820
63.2 percent of that's what is what's remaining the next time constant 63.2 percent of what's

5982
09:54:18,820 --> 09:54:24,820
remaining the next time constant 63.2 percent of what's remaining the next time constant basically

5983
09:54:24,820 --> 09:54:30,260
after five time constant we say enough is enough it's a hundred percent but is it really at 100

5984
09:54:30,260 --> 09:54:38,100
percent no because it's nonlinear so really it never reaches 100 percent we say after five time

5985
09:54:38,100 --> 09:54:46,540
constant's reached 100%. It's good enough for what we do. To calculate out this

5986
09:54:46,540 --> 09:54:53,020
time constant, it's actually relatively easy. Lr is the symbol used for the

5987
09:54:53,020 --> 09:54:59,340
time constant of an RL circuit, and the formula is t is equal to l divided by r,

5988
09:54:59,340 --> 09:55:04,220
period. It's that simple. Take the amount of inductance divided by the amount of

5989
09:55:04,220 --> 09:55:12,580
resistance that's going to give you the time constant. Measured in seconds. That's

5990
09:55:12,580 --> 09:55:17,900
what we use as our base unit of measurement in electronics, the second.

5991
09:55:18,660 --> 09:55:36,700
t is equal to l over r. Yes. If I gave you four inductors, you'd have to calculate out

5992
09:55:36,700 --> 09:55:42,380
the total inductance and plug that in the circuit right there. So I could give you

5993
09:55:42,380 --> 09:55:47,220
some real nightmare circuits right now. Think about it. It'd be fair game. I could

5994
09:55:47,220 --> 09:55:51,260
give you a circuit that's got, you know, 13 inductors and combination series

5995
09:55:51,260 --> 09:55:56,980
parallel and 22 resistors, combination and series parallel. The bottom line is

5996
09:55:56,980 --> 09:56:03,780
it's equivalent to this circuit here. You've got to figure that out. But you

5997
09:56:03,780 --> 09:56:09,980
should be able to do so without a whole lot of fuss. This is what a time constant

5998
09:56:09,980 --> 09:56:13,580
curve looks like.

5999
09:56:18,180 --> 09:56:25,540
Here's that first time constant. 63.2%. 63.2% of what's remaining. 63.2% of

6000
09:56:25,540 --> 09:56:33,540
what's remaining. 63.2% of what's remaining. What's remaining. And what is it

6001
09:56:33,540 --> 09:56:37,740
that I'm actually looking at here? What is this in blue? Is this voltage? What is

6002
09:56:37,740 --> 09:56:46,220
this? It's a current. Current. Number one, because the slide says so. But number two,

6003
09:56:46,220 --> 09:56:55,340
most importantly, because it's current that's going from zero, the inductors

6004
09:56:55,340 --> 09:56:58,700
trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the

6005
09:56:58,700 --> 09:57:01,660
change, trying to prevent the change, trying to prevent the change, trying to

6006
09:57:01,660 --> 09:57:09,780
prevent the change. Alright. Current wins. Then as soon as you set that circuit off,

6007
09:57:09,780 --> 09:57:14,180
current's going to try to go from 100% to zero, but because that magnetic field

6008
09:57:14,260 --> 09:57:19,620
is collapsing, I don't want to decrease. I want to keep it 100%, but I can't. Oh,

6009
09:57:19,620 --> 09:57:24,820
crap. Oh, all the way down to zero. But because that field is collapsing, it's

6010
09:57:24,820 --> 09:57:30,580
going to try to prevent that change. That's why we use these. That's why we use

6011
09:57:30,580 --> 09:57:39,700
these. Absolutely. If we're affecting current, definitely we'll have an effect

6012
09:57:39,700 --> 09:57:46,740
on voltage. In summary, inductance is the ability to store energy in a magnetic

6013
09:57:46,740 --> 09:57:54,460
field. Just remember the key word for inductance is magnetic. That's how they

6014
09:57:54,460 --> 09:57:59,420
do their magic. The unit for measuring inductance is the Henry, measured by the

6015
09:57:59,420 --> 09:58:07,860
capital letter H. The letter L represents inductance. Inductors have specific

6016
09:58:07,940 --> 09:58:17,820
inductances. That's why they're designed. The symbol for a fixed inductor is down

6017
09:58:17,820 --> 09:58:23,140
here at the bottom. Symbol for a variable inductor has an arrow going through it.

6018
09:58:23,140 --> 09:58:29,380
The arrow means it's adjustable. Types of inductors include iron core, ferrite or

6019
09:58:29,380 --> 09:58:37,380
powdered iron core, torrid core, shielded core, laminated core. Formula for adding

6020
09:58:37,380 --> 09:58:41,380
up in series is like the same formula for adding up resistors in series. The only

6021
09:58:41,380 --> 09:58:47,380
thing you need to be aware of, you're adding up inductance measured in

6022
09:58:47,380 --> 09:58:55,740
Henry's. If it's not in Henry's, can't use this formula. The formula for total

6023
09:58:55,740 --> 09:59:00,100
conductance in inductors in parallel is a reciprocal formula. Use it same as you

6024
09:59:00,120 --> 09:59:11,420
would for resistors in parallel. Time constant formula T is equal to L over R. You

6025
09:59:11,420 --> 09:59:15,740
run this calculation, it shows you what one time constant is worth. I need to

6026
09:59:15,740 --> 09:59:20,460
multiply that by how many to figure out how long it's going to take to get to 100%?

6027
09:59:20,460 --> 09:59:27,780
Five. Five. Because it takes five time constants to reach 100%. So understand

6028
09:59:27,820 --> 09:59:32,940
that when you do this math, you only end up with one time constant. It takes five to

6029
09:59:32,940 --> 09:59:39,940
get the job done. Or as it says here, five time constants required to fully build

6030
09:59:39,940 --> 09:59:46,980
up or collapse the magnetic field of an inductor. Any questions on anything that

6031
09:59:46,980 --> 09:59:48,980
we discussed for the inductors? Yes.

6032
09:59:58,980 --> 10:00:02,860
Yup. And that's it. We have inductors because they create inductance. And

6033
10:00:02,860 --> 10:00:08,460
inductance is that property which tries to oppose the change in current. So we're

6034
10:00:08,460 --> 10:00:16,020
going to have a lot of different components that are going to want to

6035
10:00:16,020 --> 10:00:20,500
bring about a change in current in a circuit. And if we put an inductor in

6036
10:00:20,500 --> 10:00:25,860
there, an inductor could help stabilize that current flow because of that

6037
10:00:25,860 --> 10:00:29,460
electromagnetic property. So it's going to help stabilize current levels in a

6038
10:00:29,460 --> 10:00:36,460
circuit. The majority of applications that we're going to use inductors for is

6039
10:00:36,460 --> 10:00:45,100
really going to be filtration. Because once we're not there yet, some of you may

6040
10:00:45,180 --> 10:00:52,180
have read it far enough ahead, that when we apply an inductor to an AC circuit,

6041
10:00:52,180 --> 10:00:58,180
it starts doing some wacky stuff. And by harnessing that wacky property called

6042
10:00:58,180 --> 10:01:07,180
inductive reactance, we can use that to filter. We could use it in audio

6043
10:01:07,180 --> 10:01:13,700
applications where we want only certain frequencies to go to certain speakers.

6044
10:01:13,780 --> 10:01:18,780
And that's why we're going to be doing that wacky stuff. I knew a guy that was

6045
10:01:18,780 --> 10:01:25,780
getting some interference on one of his cable channels back in the day. And

6046
10:01:25,780 --> 10:01:33,780
because this friend of mine had extensive electronics background, he didn't

6047
10:01:33,780 --> 10:01:38,780
want to call the cable company and have them waste their time and come out and

6048
10:01:38,860 --> 10:01:46,860
call. Exactly. So this friend of mine built a filter circuit to filter out the

6049
10:01:46,860 --> 10:01:52,860
garbage signal that somebody was putting on this pay-per-view channel. And by

6050
10:01:52,860 --> 10:01:57,980
filtering out the garbage that got put on the channel, the reception was

6051
10:01:57,980 --> 10:02:07,980
enhanced and made the station viewable. And the key component in that hole, so

6052
10:02:08,060 --> 10:02:15,060
I'm told, project as an inductor. And ironically, it was an inductor that was

6053
10:02:15,060 --> 10:02:24,060
like three turns of wire. One, two, three turns of wire was adequate enough for

6054
10:02:24,060 --> 10:02:33,060
the reception to be enhanced. Mind-boggling, so I'm told. Question.

6055
10:02:33,060 --> 10:02:43,060
Yeah.

6056
10:02:43,060 --> 10:02:53,060
Oh, really? Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And a little did you realize that?

6057
10:02:53,060 --> 10:03:00,060
Yeah. Nobody knew why, but it worked. Now you know.

6058
10:03:00,060 --> 10:03:06,060
All right, let's go ahead and take a break. And at about 6.20, we'll start up with

6059
10:03:06,060 --> 10:03:14,060
chapter 17. Y'all ready for this?

6060
10:03:14,060 --> 10:03:22,060
Chapter 11. Capacitance. Capacitance. If you believed what I sold you last

6061
10:03:22,060 --> 10:03:30,060
chapter, this should not be a stretch for you. Because it's kind of like the same

6062
10:03:30,060 --> 10:03:34,060
thing is happening, but with a different property.

6063
10:03:34,060 --> 10:03:40,060
It's really what it's all about. Well, capacitance is actually kind of cool.

6064
10:03:40,060 --> 10:03:44,060
We'll talk about it. A lot of uses for capacitance. After completing this

6065
10:03:44,060 --> 10:03:49,060
chapter, the student, you, the student, will be able to explain the principles of

6066
10:03:49,060 --> 10:03:54,060
capacitance, identify the basic units of capacitance, identify different types of

6067
10:03:54,060 --> 10:03:59,060
capacitors, determine total capacitance in series and parallel circuits, explain

6068
10:03:59,060 --> 10:04:06,060
RC time constants, and how they relate to capacitance. Capacitance is the ability

6069
10:04:06,060 --> 10:04:14,060
of a device to store electrical energy. Capacitance is the ability of a device

6070
10:04:14,060 --> 10:04:21,060
to store electrical energy. Let me stop. The ability of a device to store electrical

6071
10:04:21,060 --> 10:04:42,060
energy. What does that sound like the definition of?

6072
10:04:42,060 --> 10:04:50,060
Mr. Carter. That sounds like the definition of a battery, doesn't it? The ability

6073
10:04:50,060 --> 10:04:56,060
to store electrical energy. So there's really not that big of a difference

6074
10:04:56,060 --> 10:05:02,060
between a capacitor and a storage cell. Typically, a storage cell is a small

6075
10:05:02,060 --> 10:05:11,060
amount of current over a long period of time. Unless you're a car battery.

6076
10:05:11,060 --> 10:05:16,060
But a capacitor generally is a large amount of current over a short period of time

6077
10:05:16,060 --> 10:05:21,060
that it's designed to expend, if you will. But the definitions are very, very,

6078
10:05:21,060 --> 10:05:31,060
very similar, very close. The key word on how a capacitor works is that

6079
10:05:31,060 --> 10:05:37,060
electrostatic field, electrostatic field. Remember inductors, they were

6080
10:05:37,060 --> 10:05:45,060
electromagnetic. This is electrostatic. Electrostatic. Talk about that

6081
10:05:45,060 --> 10:05:51,060
properly a little bit more in a bit. The letter C stands for capacitance. So inside

6082
10:05:51,060 --> 10:05:59,060
a schematic diagram, if you see a letter C equals its capacitor. If you see C22,

6083
10:05:59,060 --> 10:06:09,060
it's capacitor number 22 in the circuit. C47, capacitor number 47. A capacitor

6084
10:06:09,060 --> 10:06:15,060
is a device that possesses a specific amount of capacitance. How these things

6085
10:06:15,060 --> 10:06:22,060
are made are two conductors separated by an insulator. Two conductors separated

6086
10:06:22,060 --> 10:06:28,060
by an insulator. What does that sound like the definition for? Close your eyes

6087
10:06:28,060 --> 10:06:31,060
and think about it. Two conductors separated by an insulator. What does that

6088
10:06:31,060 --> 10:06:39,060
sound like? Banner. You made that up, man. What would the definition of an

6089
10:06:39,060 --> 10:06:47,060
extension cord be? Two conductors separated by an insulator. What would

6090
10:06:47,060 --> 10:06:55,060
speaker wire be? Yeah, so you know what? There are going to be a lot of things

6091
10:06:56,060 --> 10:07:03,060
that have capacitive properties because there are two electrical conductors

6092
10:07:03,060 --> 10:07:08,060
separated by an insulator. And a lot of these things that have capacitance is

6093
10:07:08,060 --> 10:07:14,060
stray capacitance and capacitance that we don't necessarily want. Engineers

6094
10:07:14,060 --> 10:07:21,060
don't want, but we have to deal with it because it's two conductors separated

6095
10:07:21,060 --> 10:07:25,060
by an insulator. Anytime you do that, you're going to end up with the property

6096
10:07:25,060 --> 10:07:32,060
of capacitance. Anytime you coil up your welding wire, your welding leads,

6097
10:07:32,060 --> 10:07:37,060
electro leads, you're going to create some inductive properties.

6098
10:07:43,060 --> 10:07:46,060
Yup.

6099
10:07:46,060 --> 10:07:54,060
Yup. And that actually, believe it or not, that style of twin lead antenna cable,

6100
10:07:54,060 --> 10:07:59,060
it was some of the most efficient. When properly installed, it had higher

6101
10:07:59,060 --> 10:08:05,060
efficiency than coaxial cable. The only thing is people would get that nice

6102
10:08:05,060 --> 10:08:10,060
ribbon cable and then back in the day, growing up in Connecticut, we had aluminum

6103
10:08:10,060 --> 10:08:15,060
windows and you'd run it through the window and slam the window down on it.

6104
10:08:15,060 --> 10:08:19,060
There goes any advantage that you had. But when you use the proper standoffs

6105
10:08:19,060 --> 10:08:24,060
and you use the proper bend radius and everything else directly to the back of

6106
10:08:24,060 --> 10:08:29,060
the set that had higher efficiency, it would get more RF energy into the back

6107
10:08:29,060 --> 10:08:36,060
of that television set than using coaxial cable. But it was two conductors

6108
10:08:36,060 --> 10:08:43,060
separated by a thick dielectric, thick insulator material. So that's one of the

6109
10:08:43,060 --> 10:08:46,060
things that really want you to come out of these lectures with is understanding

6110
10:08:46,060 --> 10:08:52,060
that, you know, this is not a lecture about capacitors. It's a discussion about

6111
10:08:52,060 --> 10:08:59,060
capacitance and capacitors. But the biggest thing is when you get into somebody

6112
10:08:59,060 --> 10:09:05,060
advanced classes like Peter Welty and his PCB design class, it's one of the

6113
10:09:05,060 --> 10:09:12,060
biggest challenges is determining stray capacitance inside a circuit.

6114
10:09:12,060 --> 10:09:21,060
When we're physically trying to create capacitance, we're going to call the

6115
10:09:21,060 --> 10:09:28,060
conductors plates. And we're going to call the insulator dielectric. So two plates

6116
10:09:28,060 --> 10:09:35,060
separated by a dielectric. Now that, Mr. Carter, is the definition of a capacitor.

6117
10:09:35,060 --> 10:09:41,060
Schematic diagram up at the top is a fixed capacitor, meaning what you see is

6118
10:09:41,060 --> 10:09:53,060
what you get within tolerances, of course. Down below is a variable capacitor. There's

6119
10:09:53,060 --> 10:09:57,060
actually different ways that they're going to be able to vary the capacitance. One is

6120
10:09:57,060 --> 10:10:00,060
going to be varying the distance between the plates. We'll talk about this more in

6121
10:10:00,060 --> 10:10:04,060
a bit. And the other is meshing the plates where they don't physically touch, but

6122
10:10:04,060 --> 10:10:10,060
they're just closer proximity, more and closer proximity to each other, less and

6123
10:10:10,060 --> 10:10:17,060
less proximity to each other. Make sense?

6124
10:10:17,060 --> 10:10:27,060
Treat all capacitors as though they were charged. Never touch both leads of a

6125
10:10:27,060 --> 10:10:36,060
capacitor with your hands. I've got a capacitor. Where the heck it went? I got to

6126
10:10:36,060 --> 10:10:39,060
get my stash better organized. Stuff disappears on here. I actually had a

6127
10:10:39,060 --> 10:10:44,060
student network for one of the biomedical companies, Medtronic, named the

6128
10:10:44,060 --> 10:10:50,060
Starter. Jumper kits for when you die. It's great. I see them. They got like Costco,

6129
10:10:50,060 --> 10:10:58,060
you know. You just got $680 worth of stuff in your cart at Costco. They revive you on

6130
10:10:58,060 --> 10:11:05,060
the spot. Make sure you pay your bill. Airlines got them now. We're going to charge

6131
10:11:05,060 --> 10:11:10,060
you $25 for that bag to check it. You know, you have a heart attack. They revive you.

6132
10:11:10,060 --> 10:11:16,060
So let me die here. Anyway, had a student network there, evening student of mine,

6133
10:11:16,060 --> 10:11:22,060
and he brought me a capacitor that was a key component in that. And right on the

6134
10:11:22,060 --> 10:11:30,060
capacitor was a label. The energy stored in this device could be lethal. The energy

6135
10:11:30,060 --> 10:11:35,060
stored in this device could be lethal. So if that capacitor is charged up and I

6136
10:11:35,060 --> 10:11:42,060
toss it until you touch it, it'll kill you dead. Because you're building up all of

6137
10:11:42,060 --> 10:11:47,060
that charge and then rapidly discharging it through your body, which is not designed

6138
10:11:47,060 --> 10:11:52,060
to do. Capacitor can hold that charge potential indefinitely if it doesn't have

6139
10:11:52,060 --> 10:11:59,060
a discharge path. A theoretically perfect capacitor will hold the charge forever.

6140
10:11:59,060 --> 10:12:05,060
Because of manufacturing flaws and defects and stuff, eventually that current will

6141
10:12:05,060 --> 10:12:12,060
dissipate. I remember when they were, I've been here for a while. Not when they were

6142
10:12:12,060 --> 10:12:17,060
building this building. Not when they were building that building, the new one. Not

6143
10:12:18,060 --> 10:12:23,060
when they were building this building, but when they were building that building, like

6144
10:12:23,060 --> 10:12:28,060
20 years ago. And there's actually a time capsule buried out there somewhere. And they

6145
10:12:28,060 --> 10:12:33,060
were looking for ideas from, you know, I'm like, let's charge up a capacitor and put it

6146
10:12:33,060 --> 10:12:38,060
in the time capsule. I mean, as an electronics guy, I think that'd be cool. Like, great,

6147
10:12:38,060 --> 10:12:43,060
let's take it out of its protective covering and see if any voltages still present. I

6148
10:12:43,060 --> 10:12:47,060
mean, I would have gotten a kick out of there all looking at me like I'm a goofball, you

6149
10:12:47,060 --> 10:12:50,060
know. I mean, I'll just think that would have been an outstanding freaking idea.

6150
10:12:57,060 --> 10:13:04,060
Because of the chemicals, a chemical cell will eventually dissipate. So it has a

6151
10:13:04,060 --> 10:13:12,060
shelf life. Lithium batteries have the longest shelf life. I mean, those, what are they,

6152
10:13:12,060 --> 10:13:16,060
the Energizer, whatever that you could buy, Lithium, best batteries they could buy, very

6153
10:13:16,060 --> 10:13:20,060
great product, innovative product, if you absolutely positively have to have a part of

6154
10:13:20,060 --> 10:13:26,060
electronic device work operate under extreme temperature conditions, whatever. Great shelf

6155
10:13:26,060 --> 10:13:31,060
life, use those batteries. So I just bought some and I think that it's good to the year

6156
10:13:31,060 --> 10:13:35,060
2025 or something on it. It's like, wow, that's a shelf life.

6157
10:13:36,060 --> 10:13:43,060
The basic unit of capacitance is the ferrad. A ferrad is the amount of capacitance that can

6158
10:13:43,060 --> 10:13:51,060
store one coulomb. Remember the coulomb? 6.24 x 10 to the 18th electrons of charge when a

6159
10:13:51,060 --> 10:13:56,060
capacitor is charged to one volt. So you've got a couple different things going on there.

6160
10:13:56,060 --> 10:14:01,060
You've got these two plates and what you're doing is you're charging it and what it's

6161
10:14:01,060 --> 10:14:09,060
doing is you're physically loading those plates up with a large number of electrons. And then

6162
10:14:09,060 --> 10:14:15,060
you're building up an electrostatic field across those two plates. So when you build up

6163
10:14:15,060 --> 10:14:21,060
one coulomb across the plates, we're able to store one coulomb of charge and bring the

6164
10:14:21,060 --> 10:14:29,060
capacitor up to one volt, we call that a ferrad. Now, typically the most important thing

6165
10:14:30,060 --> 10:14:36,060
that we're going to work with in electronics are going to be centered around the micro

6166
10:14:36,060 --> 10:14:44,060
ferrad. The typical value of measurement of capacitance is the micro ferrad, which is

6167
10:14:44,060 --> 10:14:52,060
times 10 to the negative 6th. And also the pico ferrad, which is times 10 to the negative

6168
10:14:52,060 --> 10:15:04,060
12th. So we go from the 6th to the 12th. What's between 6 and 12? Nano. You know, for the

6169
10:15:04,060 --> 10:15:08,060
longest time I used to put out in lecture, you will never see a nano ferrad capacitor

6170
10:15:08,060 --> 10:15:12,060
because they didn't use to make nano ferrad. Actually, you know what they used to call

6171
10:15:12,060 --> 10:15:23,060
nano ferrad capacitors? Millie micro. Millie micro. Three places past. Millie. No, micro.

6172
10:15:23,060 --> 10:15:29,060
Millie micro. Three places past micro, which would be nano. So we call that, they'd call

6173
10:15:29,060 --> 10:15:36,060
it millie micro ferrad, MMF, millie micro ferrad. Or they would call it tens of thousands

6174
10:15:36,060 --> 10:15:46,060
of pico ferrad. I don't know if it was a small letter N that just like freaked them out. Seriously.

6175
10:15:46,060 --> 10:15:51,060
I mean, sometimes it boils down to that. It was, you know, they'd have this congress that would meet

6176
10:15:51,060 --> 10:15:56,060
and analyze this stuff and they just wouldn't. So I used to put it out in lecture. You will never

6177
10:15:56,060 --> 10:16:00,060
see a nano ferrad capacitor. Whenever I put out absolute, somebody feels compelled to prove

6178
10:16:00,060 --> 10:16:05,060
geogrenic wrong. So the next day I was doing, hey, you know, I found this, my company is

6179
10:16:05,060 --> 10:16:10,060
using these. What's this? You know, it showed it to me. It was like a 20 nano ferrad capacitor.

6180
10:16:10,060 --> 10:16:19,060
Great. You're doing it. It should be a 20,000 pico ferrad capacitor. Or a 20 millie micro

6181
10:16:19,060 --> 10:16:29,060
ferrad capacitor. But, and I'm intentionally talking to you about this because traditionally

6182
10:16:29,060 --> 10:16:35,060
capacitor values have been all over the place. As far as how they label them and how they

6183
10:16:35,060 --> 10:16:45,060
identify them and sometimes determining what size capacitor is, it is, is very, very difficult.

6184
10:16:45,060 --> 10:16:52,060
And what a manufacturer labels it as. I mean, resistors were easy with color code. Sometimes you got to

6185
10:16:52,060 --> 10:16:56,060
trust the packaging on these things. What's up?

6186
10:16:56,060 --> 10:17:01,060
Do you remember what the ferrad rating of the capacitor the guy brought in from the distributor was?

6187
10:17:01,060 --> 10:17:02,060
No.

6188
10:17:02,060 --> 10:17:04,060
Hi.

6189
10:17:04,060 --> 10:17:12,060
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, enough to kill you. But yeah, you could really, don't do the stuff here.

6190
10:17:12,060 --> 10:17:17,060
I mean, that's one of the things. Again, we take safety seriously. But some of those big

6191
10:17:17,060 --> 10:17:22,060
capacities charge up, leave that there or, you know, in the Navy, which was different. We were

6192
10:17:22,060 --> 10:17:27,060
government property, you know, always used to do that crap, you know, charge it up and say,

6193
10:17:27,060 --> 10:17:36,060
hey, check this out, you know, here, catch. You know, stuff freaking hurt, man. It wasn't funny.

6194
10:17:36,060 --> 10:17:40,060
Go up to somebody with a charge capacitor and stick it on their neck.

6195
10:17:40,060 --> 10:17:53,060
Yeah, these people weren't trusted with our nuclear arsenal.

6196
10:17:53,060 --> 10:17:58,060
Basically, that's a high discharge device. You're using capacitors and inductors in there to create a high

6197
10:17:58,060 --> 10:18:07,060
voltage to make someone compliant.

6198
10:18:07,060 --> 10:18:12,060
A capacitor is either fixed or variable. A fixed capacitor has a definite value that cannot be

6199
10:18:12,060 --> 10:18:19,060
changed. It's made a certain way, if you will. A variable capacitor is one whose capacitance can be

6200
10:18:19,060 --> 10:18:24,060
changed by varying the space between the plates or by varying the amount of meshing between two

6201
10:18:24,060 --> 10:18:30,060
sets of plates. Although they say mesh, the plates never touch. They have to be kept electrically

6202
10:18:30,060 --> 10:18:39,060
isolated with an insulator in between, and that insulator could be air.

6203
10:18:39,060 --> 10:18:47,060
Factors affecting capacitance. Now, this is kind of important to understand these. If you understand these,

6204
10:18:47,060 --> 10:18:59,060
the math makes a lot of sense. The area of the plates, right? The bigger the area, well, actually,

6205
10:18:59,060 --> 10:19:08,060
let me put that formula up on the board. C is equal to Q over V. Remember that? Capacitance

6206
10:19:08,060 --> 10:19:14,060
measured in Farads is equal to Coulomb brought to a volt. One Coulomb brought to one volt equals

6207
10:19:14,060 --> 10:19:20,060
one Farad. It makes sense. So, area of the plate. What effect is that going to have? Is that going to

6208
10:19:20,060 --> 10:19:26,060
affect Q or is that going to affect V? Q. The bigger the plate, the more electrons that could

6209
10:19:26,060 --> 10:19:32,060
park on the plate physically, right? Because even though electrons are electrons, they still take up

6210
10:19:32,060 --> 10:19:39,060
space. They still are comprised of matter. So, very good. So, the bigger the plates, what effect

6211
10:19:39,060 --> 10:19:50,060
does that have on capacitance? Bigger plate? More capacitance. Smaller plate? Smaller

6212
10:19:50,060 --> 10:19:58,060
capacitance, right? Because Q and C are directly proportional, right? Because Q is sitting up on

6213
10:19:58,060 --> 10:20:05,060
top of this here. Distance between the plates. Distance between the plates. What's that going to

6214
10:20:05,060 --> 10:20:17,060
affect? So, what's that going to affect? Q or V? Think of the distance between the plates as like

6215
10:20:17,060 --> 10:20:23,060
regapping a spark plug. That's the distance between the electrodes. This is the distance between the

6216
10:20:23,060 --> 10:20:30,060
plates. The further that you move those plates away from each other, the higher the voltage you could

6217
10:20:30,060 --> 10:20:36,060
store on those plates. And that's where engineers have to determine what am I trying to do here? Am I

6218
10:20:36,060 --> 10:20:43,060
trying to store a lot of electrons? Am I trying to, you know, have a high voltage that I'm trying to

6219
10:20:43,060 --> 10:20:51,060
build up across it? What am I trying to do? So, engineers have to take that into account. So, if I

6220
10:20:51,060 --> 10:20:59,060
separate the two plates, that means my voltage that I could store will go up. If my voltage goes up,

6221
10:20:59,060 --> 10:21:06,060
what's my capacitance going to do? It's going to drop. So, engineers are faced with this compromise.

6222
10:21:06,060 --> 10:21:11,060
Higher voltage I could store, but I'm going to get less capacitance out of it. Why is capacitance

6223
10:21:11,060 --> 10:21:16,060
going to go down too? Well, when I separate those plates, that electrostatic field is going to diminish

6224
10:21:16,060 --> 10:21:23,060
because the plates are physically further away from each other. So, you separate the plates, get a

6225
10:21:23,060 --> 10:21:29,060
higher voltage on it, higher voltage, lower the capacitance. The type of dielectric material,

6226
10:21:29,060 --> 10:21:36,060
what effect is that going to have? Or what's that going to affect? There's a type of dielectric

6227
10:21:36,060 --> 10:21:50,060
material. Is that going to affect the Q or the V? Or the C? Well, I think it's going to affect the C.

6228
10:21:50,060 --> 10:22:03,060
Yeah. Why? Because of Q or V. Think about this one. What's it going to affect? Q, B, Z.

6229
10:22:03,060 --> 10:22:18,060
It's going to affect the voltage. Because if I've got two plates separated by air, and then now instead

6230
10:22:18,060 --> 10:22:27,060
of the air, I slip in a piece of mica. Mica has a higher dielectric constant than air, does it not?

6231
10:22:27,060 --> 10:22:32,060
Remember what I, you guys are deceiving me, man. Remember those lectures, early in the quarter?

6232
10:22:32,060 --> 10:22:37,060
We talked about different types of insulators. Mica was at the top of the chart. So, if I slip a piece

6233
10:22:37,060 --> 10:22:41,060
of mica between those two plates now, I could actually have those plates real close to each other

6234
10:22:41,060 --> 10:22:48,060
and slip some mica in there and really get a high voltage across those plates. Get a higher voltage

6235
10:22:48,060 --> 10:22:57,060
for the distance, because I'm using a dielectric material that has better dielectric properties.

6236
10:22:57,060 --> 10:23:04,060
So, that's how that's going to affect V. Effect V, it's going to affect C. And then temperature.

6237
10:23:04,060 --> 10:23:13,060
How is temperature going to affect this?

6238
10:23:13,060 --> 10:23:28,060
What changes with temperature? Yeah, but we're not talking about resistance here, so.

6239
10:23:28,060 --> 10:23:33,060
It's actually simpler than that. Something probably that you all knew even before you walked in here.

6240
10:23:33,060 --> 10:23:41,060
Things expand and contract with temperature. That's why there's expansion joints on bridges.

6241
10:23:41,060 --> 10:23:48,060
Because bridges expand and contract, and if not, they'd break. Oh no, it got over 70 degrees today.

6242
10:23:48,060 --> 10:23:53,060
The bridge broke. No, expansion joints, because things expand and contract.

6243
10:23:53,060 --> 10:24:01,060
Capacitors are going to expand and contract. So, as the plates expand, it can hold or affect Q

6244
10:24:01,060 --> 10:24:09,060
as the distance between the two changes, it's going to affect V. So, the bottom line is the amount of capacitance

6245
10:24:09,060 --> 10:24:17,060
will vary with temperature. For some circuits, like at room temperature, it's not that big of a deal.

6246
10:24:17,060 --> 10:24:24,060
For some stuff, I don't think in your wildest hallucinations, you've ever really thought it through

6247
10:24:24,060 --> 10:24:32,060
where a lot of electronic systems are used. I mean, it's a pretty harsh environment.

6248
10:24:32,060 --> 10:24:41,060
My favorite aircraft of all time, military aircraft, of all time, I just get so jazzed when I see one,

6249
10:24:41,060 --> 10:24:49,060
is the F-15 Fighting Falcon. These things were designed as high-altitude interceptors.

6250
10:24:49,060 --> 10:24:55,060
The closest to us right here are Portland, Oregon, the Oregon Air National Guard.

6251
10:24:55,060 --> 10:25:00,060
So, if you've ever flown commercially in and out of Portland or been down there, you might be on an Alaska Airlines jet

6252
10:25:00,060 --> 10:25:06,060
that has to give way to two F-15s that are taken off in front of you.

6253
10:25:06,060 --> 10:25:15,060
The F-15 still holds the unclassified time-to-climb record, 45,000 feet in one minute.

6254
10:25:15,060 --> 10:25:21,060
That basically means you're sitting at the end of the runway at Portland International Airport.

6255
10:25:21,060 --> 10:25:27,060
They give you the thumbs up, clear for takeoff. You advance the throttle as you kick in the afterburner.

6256
10:25:27,060 --> 10:25:33,060
And next thing, one minute later, 60 seconds later, you're passing through 45,000 feet.

6257
10:25:33,060 --> 10:25:37,060
These things are so good, they used them last summer when President Obama was in town.

6258
10:25:37,060 --> 10:25:41,060
And there was a small plane that penetrated the airspace up here.

6259
10:25:41,060 --> 10:25:45,060
The guy was flying into Kenmore in a float plane.

6260
10:25:45,060 --> 10:25:50,060
And they're watching them on radar, and they got concerned.

6261
10:25:50,060 --> 10:25:53,060
So, they called up the Oregon Air National Guard, and they said,

6262
10:25:53,060 --> 10:25:56,060
we know you've got a couple of fighters there and ready to stand by.

6263
10:25:56,060 --> 10:26:00,060
I think it's time to scramble them. And these guys were like, woo-hoo!

6264
10:26:00,060 --> 10:26:06,060
Because what they did is they not only got to take off, but they got to go supersonic.

6265
10:26:06,060 --> 10:26:10,060
They had to go on an intercept call. So, what they did is they went supersonic.

6266
10:26:10,060 --> 10:26:17,060
I'm sure you all heard about it, with the windows getting knocked out and the sonic booms.

6267
10:26:17,060 --> 10:26:24,060
Where I'm going with this, though, is imagine that airplane sitting on the runway down there in the middle of summer.

6268
10:26:24,060 --> 10:26:29,060
Sitting on the tarmac, 115, 120 degrees.

6269
10:26:29,060 --> 10:26:35,060
And then 60 seconds later, he's at 45,000 feet, where it's negative 45.

6270
10:26:35,060 --> 10:26:41,060
If electronics are not all in heated areas of that aircraft,

6271
10:26:41,060 --> 10:26:47,060
so if you've got a capacitor that is in an area that is prone to temperature change,

6272
10:26:47,060 --> 10:26:49,060
you're going to get different results.

6273
10:26:49,060 --> 10:26:53,060
Hopefully, that's not part of a targeting system on that aircraft,

6274
10:26:53,060 --> 10:26:57,060
where all of a sudden, you know, the military is smarter than that.

6275
10:26:57,060 --> 10:27:04,060
The reason temperature that it always strikes a chord with me, I was not always the best student.

6276
10:27:05,060 --> 10:27:08,060
Especially when I was in a lot of military schools.

6277
10:27:08,060 --> 10:27:12,060
I went to over 4500 hours of military schools, different systems.

6278
10:27:12,060 --> 10:27:15,060
I was in a great position, because as soon as the Russians came up with something,

6279
10:27:15,060 --> 10:27:19,060
we had to come up with something to detect it and counter it, and I was constantly in school.

6280
10:27:19,060 --> 10:27:24,060
I traveled to 46 of the 50 states on official business going to school, a lot of factory schools, a lot of stuff.

6281
10:27:24,060 --> 10:27:28,060
Long schools, and it was not a school day like yours. These are 8-hour days.

6282
10:27:28,060 --> 10:27:31,060
8-hour days, 5 days a week.

6283
10:27:31,060 --> 10:27:36,060
And it was back in the day, old school, so we used to go out for liquid lunches.

6284
10:27:40,060 --> 10:27:45,060
I used to sit in the back, and I was sitting there one day, and I'm like, you know,

6285
10:27:45,060 --> 10:27:48,060
falling asleep and hopefully not snoring too loud.

6286
10:27:48,060 --> 10:27:51,060
And I wake up, and the instructor is showing me this, you know,

6287
10:27:51,060 --> 10:27:57,060
they have the presentation, and they had, not PowerPoint, they had the view foils.

6288
10:27:57,060 --> 10:28:01,060
And they're showing this oven-ready light coming on.

6289
10:28:01,060 --> 10:28:06,060
And I'm like, oven-ready light, oven-ready light.

6290
10:28:06,060 --> 10:28:11,060
I like, I'm in electronic intercept and analysis.

6291
10:28:11,060 --> 10:28:15,060
Why is he talking about an oven-ready light coming on?

6292
10:28:15,060 --> 10:28:19,060
I mean, if this is like, I picked the wrong time to wake up,

6293
10:28:19,060 --> 10:28:22,060
because I don't have a freaking clue what he's talking about.

6294
10:28:22,060 --> 10:28:25,060
An oven-ready light, and I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it.

6295
10:28:25,060 --> 10:28:29,060
And actually what happened is this equipment was so sensitive,

6296
10:28:29,060 --> 10:28:35,060
it was very secret special equipment for measuring these very specific emissions from Soviet equipment,

6297
10:28:35,060 --> 10:28:43,060
that they put key sensitive temperature components in what was called an oven.

6298
10:28:43,060 --> 10:28:49,060
And what it was is a small metal box inside the piece of equipment.

6299
10:28:49,060 --> 10:28:53,060
And it had a heating coil, and it had a thermostat,

6300
10:28:53,060 --> 10:28:57,060
and it would keep that temperature stable,

6301
10:28:57,060 --> 10:29:01,060
so that the readings would be stable.

6302
10:29:01,060 --> 10:29:05,060
And if that oven-ready light was not on,

6303
10:29:05,060 --> 10:29:08,060
that told the technician that the oven wasn't on,

6304
10:29:08,060 --> 10:29:12,060
and the numbers, the results, could not be trusted.

6305
10:29:12,060 --> 10:29:15,060
So that was a big thing before you use that equipment,

6306
10:29:15,060 --> 10:29:17,060
is verifying that oven-ready light was on.

6307
10:29:17,060 --> 10:29:20,060
It was like, it's funny, because even though I slept through the lecture,

6308
10:29:20,060 --> 10:29:23,060
I still remember it like it happened yesterday.

6309
10:29:23,060 --> 10:29:26,060
This is not an endorsement to fall asleep in class.

6310
10:29:26,060 --> 10:29:29,060
But it was a blue light, it was this blue light.

6311
10:29:29,060 --> 10:29:31,060
And I always remember, because I'll tell you what,

6312
10:29:31,060 --> 10:29:34,060
we had, our labs were written tests,

6313
10:29:34,060 --> 10:29:37,060
and then we had practical labs that you had to go in and troubleshoot that equipment.

6314
10:29:37,060 --> 10:29:40,060
And I remember that the day I went into, you know,

6315
10:29:40,060 --> 10:29:42,060
I was basically being evaluated.

6316
10:29:42,060 --> 10:29:44,060
I had two instructors standing in there with clipboards,

6317
10:29:44,060 --> 10:29:48,060
and you know, let's see how Petty Officer Greenock evaluates this problem here.

6318
10:29:48,060 --> 10:29:54,060
So I walked in, and the first thing I noticed is the blue oven-ready light was not on.

6319
10:29:54,060 --> 10:29:57,060
So I knew immediately where the problem was.

6320
10:29:57,060 --> 10:30:01,060
And I, you know, I told them, oven-ready light's not on.

6321
10:30:01,060 --> 10:30:03,060
There's a problem with that circuitry, it got in there,

6322
10:30:03,060 --> 10:30:05,060
and basically it was like a fuse that was blown,

6323
10:30:05,060 --> 10:30:08,060
replace the fuse, boom, fix the problem.

6324
10:30:08,060 --> 10:30:11,060
If you're not a vigilant technician paying attention to that,

6325
10:30:11,060 --> 10:30:17,060
oh yeah, you could run through all the tests, oh everything's working okay.

6326
10:30:17,060 --> 10:30:25,060
So some key components like capacitors that are in real critical roles in circuits

6327
10:30:25,060 --> 10:30:29,060
may be put in a circuit or in a box called an oven

6328
10:30:29,060 --> 10:30:32,060
where they keep that temperature really stable.

6329
10:30:32,060 --> 10:30:35,060
For most stuff like this, you know, inside buildings and, you know,

6330
10:30:35,060 --> 10:30:39,060
whatever industrial controls, it's normally not an issue.

6331
10:30:39,060 --> 10:30:43,060
Normally even an automotive application, I've never heard about anybody, you know.

6332
10:30:43,060 --> 10:30:48,060
And actually cars are pretty freaking robust when you think about it.

6333
10:30:48,060 --> 10:30:53,060
I mean from, you know, I've been down in Arizona in the summer, you know,

6334
10:30:53,060 --> 10:30:59,060
it's like stuff is melting, plastic is melting, you know,

6335
10:30:59,060 --> 10:31:03,060
tires are melting on the cars, just nuts, you know.

6336
10:31:03,060 --> 10:31:06,060
And I went up to Alaska here in February,

6337
10:31:06,060 --> 10:31:11,060
and you know, that was like the week before I was up there, it was negative 47.

6338
10:31:11,060 --> 10:31:15,060
So you go to Fairbanks Airport, you land, you're going to rent a car,

6339
10:31:15,060 --> 10:31:19,060
and it's buried in snow, but you just follow the extension cord from the post

6340
10:31:19,060 --> 10:31:22,060
and it's all on a block heater, you dust it all off.

6341
10:31:22,060 --> 10:31:25,060
It's all powder snow up there because it's so cold and so dry.

6342
10:31:25,060 --> 10:31:27,060
Turn the key, fire it up.

6343
10:31:27,060 --> 10:31:30,060
Every place you go, the hotel's all have a place to plug into though,

6344
10:31:30,060 --> 10:31:34,060
I mean it's just, you know, but still that extreme cold is like, wow,

6345
10:31:34,060 --> 10:31:40,060
the electronics work reasonably well from Arizona to Alaska.

6346
10:31:41,060 --> 10:31:45,060
Keep these four factors in mind, they're critical.

6347
10:31:45,060 --> 10:31:50,060
Dielectric constant, this is the measure of the effectiveness of a material as an insulator.

6348
10:31:50,060 --> 10:31:55,060
Some materials of dielectric constant, paper, has a dielectric constant between two and three.

6349
10:31:55,060 --> 10:31:59,060
Typically what they're talking about here is wax paper.

6350
10:31:59,060 --> 10:32:04,060
Wax paper, wax paper used to be used as the dielectric, as the insulator

6351
10:32:04,060 --> 10:32:08,060
in a lot of capacitors prior to World War II.

6352
10:32:08,060 --> 10:32:12,060
I've actually restored many an antique radio by simply going in,

6353
10:32:12,060 --> 10:32:15,060
removing the paper caps that have deteriorated,

6354
10:32:15,060 --> 10:32:19,060
and putting in mica caps of the same value.

6355
10:32:19,060 --> 10:32:21,060
Right, just that easy, remove it.

6356
10:32:21,060 --> 10:32:25,060
Everybody always gets an old radio, and oh yeah, it must be them, they're tubes.

6357
10:32:25,060 --> 10:32:29,060
Them tubes there need to be replaced.

6358
10:32:29,060 --> 10:32:32,060
Every start a handful of radios haven't replaced one tube.

6359
10:32:32,060 --> 10:32:36,060
Got in there, replaced the capacitors, why paper capacitors?

6360
10:32:36,060 --> 10:32:39,060
What happens to paper over time, deteriorates?

6361
10:32:39,060 --> 10:32:44,060
If deteriorates, loses its dielectric constant, capacitor shorts out, doesn't work.

6362
10:32:44,060 --> 10:32:50,060
Micah, dielectric constant between five and six.

6363
10:32:50,060 --> 10:32:54,060
This should be tantalum, not titanium.

6364
10:32:54,060 --> 10:33:00,060
Titanium, they're using that in golf clubs, in Soviet submarines.

6365
10:33:00,060 --> 10:33:02,060
This is tantalum.

6366
10:33:02,060 --> 10:33:06,060
Tantalum is a material that has a high dielectric property.

6367
10:33:06,060 --> 10:33:11,060
So by putting it in a tantalum capacitor, it gives you a big bang for the buck.

6368
10:33:11,060 --> 10:33:16,060
Some of the best capacitors that money will buy, tantalum.

6369
10:33:16,060 --> 10:33:20,060
Electrolytic capacitors, these are large capacitance for size and weight.

6370
10:33:20,060 --> 10:33:24,060
Consist of two metal foils separated by fine gauze saturated with a chemical paste

6371
10:33:24,060 --> 10:33:27,060
called an electrolyte.

6372
10:33:27,060 --> 10:33:31,060
They're polarized, having a positive and negative lead.

6373
10:33:31,060 --> 10:33:41,060
If you put an electrolytic capacitor into a circuit backwards, it will explode.

6374
10:33:41,060 --> 10:33:44,060
Literally.

6375
10:33:44,060 --> 10:33:48,060
If you put one of these in a circuit backwards, it will explode.

6376
10:33:48,060 --> 10:33:55,060
Some of the smaller caps actually have, where like there's an X etched on the top

6377
10:33:55,060 --> 10:34:00,060
so when it blows, it'll blow outward and not necessarily build.

6378
10:34:00,060 --> 10:34:04,060
I knew a guy that played around with explosives and stuff in the past.

6379
10:34:04,060 --> 10:34:06,060
It's all about keeping it compressed.

6380
10:34:06,060 --> 10:34:10,060
Those gases are compressed and it's going to give you a bigger bang.

6381
10:34:10,060 --> 10:34:13,060
Some of those small caps that don't have a little release mechanism on it,

6382
10:34:13,060 --> 10:34:15,060
you can throw some shrapnel.

6383
10:34:15,060 --> 10:34:18,060
Some of the big caps actually have a release valve on it.

6384
10:34:18,060 --> 10:34:20,060
So if you put it in backwards, pow.

6385
10:34:20,060 --> 10:34:23,060
But I've seen smoke pouring out on like a smoke bomb.

6386
10:34:23,060 --> 10:34:26,060
If you ever want to blow up caps, let Peter and myself know.

6387
10:34:26,060 --> 10:34:29,060
And we want to do it in a controlled, contained environment.

6388
10:34:29,060 --> 10:34:31,060
You just do it for kicks in the lab.

6389
10:34:31,060 --> 10:34:33,060
Somebody could lose an eye. Seriously.

6390
10:34:33,060 --> 10:34:36,060
You know, there's a little metal cans and you put it in backwards.

6391
10:34:36,060 --> 10:34:38,060
These things blow.

6392
10:34:38,060 --> 10:34:41,060
Shrapnel is going to go flying.

6393
10:34:41,060 --> 10:34:43,060
You guys actually have to pull the area?

6394
10:34:43,060 --> 10:34:46,060
I've done it before out in the back.

6395
10:34:46,060 --> 10:34:49,060
You know, we rope off an area and it was actually funny.

6396
10:34:49,060 --> 10:34:51,060
We were doing that one evening, years ago.

6397
10:34:51,060 --> 10:34:53,060
Blown up capacitors, you know.

6398
10:34:53,060 --> 10:34:55,060
And pow, pow, pow.

6399
10:34:55,060 --> 10:34:59,060
Put them in series of parallel and doing all kinds of wacky stuff, you know.

6400
10:34:59,060 --> 10:35:05,060
And literally, I had, we were doing it in the back here.

6401
10:35:05,060 --> 10:35:08,060
And you know the second floor up above the restaurant,

6402
10:35:08,060 --> 10:35:11,060
that patio area between the two buildings?

6403
10:35:11,060 --> 10:35:14,060
I had debris raining down on that.

6404
10:35:14,060 --> 10:35:19,060
So nobody really cared about it until I went to the custodians

6405
10:35:19,060 --> 10:35:24,060
and I asked for like some, you know, brooms and stuff to clean it up.

6406
10:35:24,060 --> 10:35:27,060
And then it was kind of like, well, they all got puzzled and stuff

6407
10:35:27,060 --> 10:35:29,060
because they were like, oh, union here?

6408
10:35:29,060 --> 10:35:32,060
And they were like, if it's a mess, you know, we need to clean it up.

6409
10:35:32,060 --> 10:35:35,060
It's like, well, my students made this freaking huge mess out here

6410
10:35:35,060 --> 10:35:36,060
from blowing up crap.

6411
10:35:36,060 --> 10:35:38,060
No, no, we'll clean it up, you know.

6412
10:35:38,060 --> 10:35:41,060
Oh, I'm sorry, you know, it's file of grievance

6413
10:35:41,060 --> 10:35:44,060
because we're going to clean up the mess we made, you know.

6414
10:35:44,060 --> 10:35:45,060
It was just an odd time.

6415
10:35:45,060 --> 10:35:48,060
I guess it's still an odd time, you know, here.

6416
10:35:48,060 --> 10:35:51,060
But my personal collection of capacitors.

6417
10:35:51,060 --> 10:35:53,060
These are all electrolytic capacitors.

6418
10:35:53,060 --> 10:35:56,060
And on the electrolytic capacitors,

6419
10:35:56,060 --> 10:35:58,060
you've got to look for the markings here

6420
10:35:58,060 --> 10:36:00,060
to find which lead is the negative lead

6421
10:36:00,060 --> 10:36:02,060
and which one's the positive lead.

6422
10:36:02,060 --> 10:36:05,060
And there will be some discerning mark on it.

6423
10:36:05,060 --> 10:36:07,060
Some manufacturers identify the negative lead,

6424
10:36:07,060 --> 10:36:09,060
some identify the positive lead.

6425
10:36:09,060 --> 10:36:11,060
You just got to pay particular attention.

6426
10:36:11,060 --> 10:36:13,060
This here, like with the band on it,

6427
10:36:13,060 --> 10:36:15,060
that would signify the negative lead.

6428
10:36:15,060 --> 10:36:17,060
See that solid band?

6429
10:36:17,060 --> 10:36:20,060
You just got to look and be observant.

6430
10:36:20,060 --> 10:36:22,060
Put it in backwards.

6431
10:36:22,060 --> 10:36:25,060
It will explode.

6432
10:36:25,060 --> 10:36:29,060
Paper and plastic caps, construction by a rolled foil technique.

6433
10:36:29,060 --> 10:36:33,060
Plastic film is often used more often.

6434
10:36:33,060 --> 10:36:37,060
Basically, if you went and got two rolls of aluminum foil

6435
10:36:37,060 --> 10:36:42,060
and a roll of wax paper or a roll of saran wrap, right,

6436
10:36:42,060 --> 10:36:45,060
laid out one roll, put the insulator on top of it,

6437
10:36:45,060 --> 10:36:47,060
laid the other roll out, we rolled it all up,

6438
10:36:47,060 --> 10:36:49,060
dipped it in wax, attached leads to it,

6439
10:36:49,060 --> 10:36:54,060
dipped it in wax, you just made yourself a capacitor.

6440
10:36:54,060 --> 10:36:57,060
So if you want to roll your own, you can roll your own.

6441
10:36:57,060 --> 10:37:00,060
You make it out of paper, same thing.

6442
10:37:00,060 --> 10:37:03,060
And that's exactly what paper caps were.

6443
10:37:03,060 --> 10:37:07,060
Two pieces of foil with wax paper between them,

6444
10:37:07,060 --> 10:37:11,060
the leads attached, dipped in wax.

6445
10:37:11,060 --> 10:37:15,060
And that wax didn't prevent that paper

6446
10:37:15,060 --> 10:37:19,060
from deteriorating over time.

6447
10:37:19,060 --> 10:37:22,060
These are plastic caps here.

6448
10:37:22,060 --> 10:37:25,060
Basically, if you sliced that open with an exacto knife,

6449
10:37:25,060 --> 10:37:29,060
you'd find nothing but rolls of aluminum foil

6450
10:37:29,060 --> 10:37:33,060
wrapped around plastic.

6451
10:37:33,060 --> 10:37:35,060
Ceramic disc capacitors are popular

6452
10:37:35,060 --> 10:37:37,060
because they're inexpensive to produce.

6453
10:37:37,060 --> 10:37:40,060
They're used for values 0.1 microfarad and smaller.

6454
10:37:40,060 --> 10:37:42,060
Ceramic is the dielectric.

6455
10:37:42,060 --> 10:37:46,060
They're reliable general-purpose capacitors.

6456
10:37:46,060 --> 10:37:50,060
This is my personal collection.

6457
10:37:50,060 --> 10:37:55,060
I get all my ceramics from Mexico.

6458
10:37:55,060 --> 10:38:00,060
A lot of them manufactured there.

6459
10:38:00,060 --> 10:38:05,060
It's not electrolytic.

6460
10:38:05,060 --> 10:38:09,060
Ceramic, these don't have a positive or negative lead.

6461
10:38:09,060 --> 10:38:14,060
It's only the electrolytic that does.

6462
10:38:14,060 --> 10:38:15,060
Check out the value of this.

6463
10:38:15,060 --> 10:38:17,060
This is 3KV.

6464
10:38:17,060 --> 10:38:19,060
It'll hand up to 3,000 volts.

6465
10:38:19,060 --> 10:38:22,060
You exceed that, you destroy the capacitor.

6466
10:38:22,060 --> 10:38:27,060
You operate all day long underneath that.

6467
10:38:27,060 --> 10:38:29,060
Variable capacitors are also known as

6468
10:38:29,060 --> 10:38:34,060
patterns, tremors, or tuners.

6469
10:38:34,060 --> 10:38:37,060
This is a tuning capacitor.

6470
10:38:37,060 --> 10:38:46,060
This is something you'd find in a 1960s, 50s, 60s, 70s radio.

6471
10:38:46,060 --> 10:38:49,060
Elegant.

6472
10:38:49,060 --> 10:38:50,060
Elegant in design.

6473
10:38:50,060 --> 10:38:53,060
They don't make stuff like this no more.

6474
10:38:53,060 --> 10:38:57,060
How many of these went to the landfill?

6475
10:38:57,060 --> 10:38:59,060
A lot of these, the shaft right here,

6476
10:38:59,060 --> 10:39:03,060
this would actually be a ball bearing movement right there

6477
10:39:03,060 --> 10:39:04,060
with a heavy grease in there,

6478
10:39:04,060 --> 10:39:06,060
and you turn it ever so slightly.

6479
10:39:06,060 --> 10:39:08,060
And actually what they would do with this,

6480
10:39:08,060 --> 10:39:10,060
they'd put a big pulley on here,

6481
10:39:10,060 --> 10:39:14,060
and then there'd be a string that was attached to your tuning dial.

6482
10:39:14,060 --> 10:39:16,060
So when you move that knob just a little bit,

6483
10:39:16,060 --> 10:39:19,060
it would ever so slightly move that tuning cap.

6484
10:39:19,060 --> 10:39:21,060
And that's how you would adjust,

6485
10:39:21,060 --> 10:39:25,060
by adjusting the capacitance, you would tune your radio.

6486
10:39:25,060 --> 10:39:29,060
Now it's done all electronically.

6487
10:39:29,060 --> 10:39:36,060
So this is something kind of from a bygone era.

6488
10:39:36,060 --> 10:39:40,060
Which is good and bad in some ways, I don't know.

6489
10:39:40,060 --> 10:39:44,060
I don't think these new tuners have the sensitivity

6490
10:39:44,060 --> 10:39:45,060
that those old tuners had.

6491
10:39:45,060 --> 10:39:47,060
And I saw the transition of the military.

6492
10:39:47,060 --> 10:39:50,060
When I first got into electronic intelligence gathering,

6493
10:39:50,060 --> 10:39:52,060
they were manually operated tuners.

6494
10:39:52,060 --> 10:39:56,060
I used to have to sit there and manually tune through,

6495
10:39:56,060 --> 10:40:00,060
find a target of interest, intercept the analyzer.

6496
10:40:00,060 --> 10:40:03,060
I saw the transition to computer operated systems,

6497
10:40:03,060 --> 10:40:05,060
and it boggled my mind.

6498
10:40:05,060 --> 10:40:07,060
I was actually, I rode my submarine out here,

6499
10:40:07,060 --> 10:40:09,060
and my sub was going to get a new system.

6500
10:40:09,060 --> 10:40:12,060
So I rode it here, the work was being done in Bremerton,

6501
10:40:12,060 --> 10:40:14,060
then they flew me back to Connecticut for the summer.

6502
10:40:14,060 --> 10:40:15,060
I actually drove.

6503
10:40:15,060 --> 10:40:18,060
It was kind of funny, I used to tell the Navy I had a fear of flying.

6504
10:40:18,060 --> 10:40:19,060
That's why I'm in the Navy.

6505
10:40:19,060 --> 10:40:22,060
So because I rode to so many schools,

6506
10:40:22,060 --> 10:40:24,060
they would always, they'd pay me to travel.

6507
10:40:24,060 --> 10:40:27,060
So it was like, I don't know, 300 miles a day,

6508
10:40:27,060 --> 10:40:29,060
per diem and hotels and whatever.

6509
10:40:29,060 --> 10:40:34,060
So I used to get like 14 days off the drive to Connecticut.

6510
10:40:34,060 --> 10:40:37,060
So I'd like go to San Diego and goof off for a week and a half.

6511
10:40:37,060 --> 10:40:43,060
And I like marathon across the country or whatever, you know.

6512
10:40:43,060 --> 10:40:46,060
But anyway, I was getting sent to this school

6513
10:40:46,060 --> 10:40:50,060
where there's going to be computer controlled receivers.

6514
10:40:50,060 --> 10:40:53,060
And my computer controlled receivers,

6515
10:40:53,060 --> 10:40:56,060
I mean, it was like, it's like some robotic arm is going to come out

6516
10:40:56,060 --> 10:40:58,060
and like tune the dial.

6517
10:40:58,060 --> 10:41:00,060
I mean, how do you do that?

6518
10:41:00,060 --> 10:41:01,060
I mean, I'm serious.

6519
10:41:01,060 --> 10:41:04,060
I was just, I had no freaking clue what they were talking about.

6520
10:41:04,060 --> 10:41:08,060
And that's not what they were talking about.

6521
10:41:08,060 --> 10:41:12,060
But I just don't think we ever had the sensitivity

6522
10:41:12,060 --> 10:41:15,060
that those old manual tuners had.

6523
10:41:15,060 --> 10:41:18,060
The newer systems, of course, were much more efficient.

6524
10:41:18,060 --> 10:41:20,060
And they, you know, once you integrate computers,

6525
10:41:20,060 --> 10:41:21,060
you can process the data.

6526
10:41:21,060 --> 10:41:24,060
The data is only getting processed as well as it was programmed.

6527
10:41:24,060 --> 10:41:31,060
But yeah, those old tuners, boy, I could listen to some stuff way out,

6528
10:41:31,060 --> 10:41:32,060
way out there.

6529
10:41:32,060 --> 10:41:34,060
We'd be a way to heck out in the middle of nowhere

6530
10:41:34,060 --> 10:41:38,060
and I could tune stuff in with a good antenna and good receiver.

6531
10:41:38,060 --> 10:41:40,060
Series capacitors.

6532
10:41:40,060 --> 10:41:42,060
Yeah, you're not looking at a tight ball.

6533
10:41:42,060 --> 10:41:50,060
When you have capacitors in series, you treat them like resistors in parallel.

6534
10:41:50,060 --> 10:41:53,060
Does anybody know why that is?

6535
10:41:53,060 --> 10:41:58,060
Why do you suppose?

6536
10:41:58,060 --> 10:42:04,060
It's a good try.

6537
10:42:04,060 --> 10:42:09,060
Okay, these three capacitors are in series, are they not?

6538
10:42:09,060 --> 10:42:11,060
What am I really limited to here?

6539
10:42:11,060 --> 10:42:15,060
I'm limited to this plate area here, am I not?

6540
10:42:15,060 --> 10:42:18,060
And this plate area here.

6541
10:42:18,060 --> 10:42:21,060
What am I actually doing?

6542
10:42:21,060 --> 10:42:23,060
I'm increasing the distance between the plates,

6543
10:42:23,060 --> 10:42:25,060
which means that my voltage goes up,

6544
10:42:25,060 --> 10:42:28,060
that means my capacitance has to go down.

6545
10:42:28,060 --> 10:42:29,060
Makes sense?

6546
10:42:29,060 --> 10:42:33,060
That's why that formula works.

6547
10:42:33,060 --> 10:42:39,060
Plus, I got now, I've gotten one, two, three times the insulated material,

6548
10:42:39,060 --> 10:42:41,060
as opposed to one time the insulated material.

6549
10:42:41,060 --> 10:42:42,060
Makes sense?

6550
10:42:42,060 --> 10:42:45,060
So everything always goes back to this formula.

6551
10:42:45,060 --> 10:42:47,060
Everything in electronics always is explained away with the formula.

6552
10:42:47,060 --> 10:42:59,060
In parallel...

6553
10:42:59,060 --> 10:43:02,060
What am I doing here?

6554
10:43:02,060 --> 10:43:05,060
I've got this plate, this plate, and this plate.

6555
10:43:05,060 --> 10:43:09,060
Now here, I triple the size of my plates.

6556
10:43:09,060 --> 10:43:14,060
I triple the size of my electrostatic field that I could build up across the two.

6557
10:43:14,060 --> 10:43:15,060
So what am I doing?

6558
10:43:15,060 --> 10:43:21,060
I'm increasing my Q, which increases my C.

6559
10:43:21,060 --> 10:43:24,060
That's why that formula works.

6560
10:43:24,060 --> 10:43:26,060
So, I don't know if that helps you,

6561
10:43:26,060 --> 10:43:29,060
but it helps me remember formulas if I understand how the formula works.

6562
10:43:29,060 --> 10:43:34,060
If I just give you a formula, C is equal to Q over V.

6563
10:43:34,060 --> 10:43:36,060
Okay, I'll remember that.

6564
10:43:36,060 --> 10:43:38,060
That's not going to do you any good.

6565
10:43:38,060 --> 10:43:40,060
If you remember, C is equal to Q over V.

6566
10:43:40,060 --> 10:43:42,060
Increase the area of the plates.

6567
10:43:42,060 --> 10:43:44,060
I could store more Q.

6568
10:43:44,060 --> 10:43:45,060
Q goes up.

6569
10:43:45,060 --> 10:43:48,060
C goes up.

6570
10:43:48,060 --> 10:43:51,060
Distance between the plates increases.

6571
10:43:51,060 --> 10:43:52,060
V goes up.

6572
10:43:52,060 --> 10:43:53,060
C goes down.

6573
10:43:53,060 --> 10:43:55,060
Inverse proportional relationship.

6574
10:43:55,060 --> 10:43:57,060
Makes sense?

6575
10:43:57,060 --> 10:44:03,060
RC time constant reflects the time required for a capacitor to charge 63.2% of the applied voltage

6576
10:44:03,060 --> 10:44:06,060
or to discharge down 63.2%.

6577
10:44:06,060 --> 10:44:08,060
It's not a tight boat.

6578
10:44:08,060 --> 10:44:10,060
It's the way I worded it intentionally on this slide.

6579
10:44:10,060 --> 10:44:13,060
You're decreasing down 63.2%.

6580
10:44:13,060 --> 10:44:20,060
236.8%.

6581
10:44:20,060 --> 10:44:22,060
This is what the circuit's going to look like.

6582
10:44:22,060 --> 10:44:23,060
This is the formula.

6583
10:44:23,060 --> 10:44:25,060
T is equal to R times C.

6584
10:44:25,060 --> 10:44:27,060
It's going to take five time constants.

6585
10:44:27,060 --> 10:44:30,060
And physically, what's happening with this?

6586
10:44:30,060 --> 10:44:33,060
What kind of circuit is this?

6587
10:44:33,060 --> 10:44:34,060
Series.

6588
10:44:34,060 --> 10:44:37,060
Series RC circuit.

6589
10:44:37,060 --> 10:44:39,060
It's a series RC circuit.

6590
10:44:39,060 --> 10:44:44,060
And when I close this switch, this capacitor here is going to be at zero volts,

6591
10:44:44,060 --> 10:44:48,060
and it's going to start charging up to 100%.

6592
10:44:48,060 --> 10:44:51,060
How long is it going to take to get to 100%?

6593
10:44:51,060 --> 10:44:53,060
Five time constants.

6594
10:44:53,060 --> 10:44:56,060
How do I figure out what one time constant is equal to?

6595
10:44:56,060 --> 10:44:58,060
T is equal to R times C.

6596
10:44:58,060 --> 10:45:07,060
When this capacitor is at 100%, what voltage is going to be across R1?

6597
10:45:08,060 --> 10:45:13,060
When capacitor C1 is at 100% after the passage of five time constants,

6598
10:45:13,060 --> 10:45:16,060
what voltage is going to be present across R1?

6599
10:45:16,060 --> 10:45:17,060
Zero.

6600
10:45:17,060 --> 10:45:19,060
Zero.

6601
10:45:19,060 --> 10:45:28,060
When 63.2% of the voltage is across C1, where's the remaining voltage going to be?

6602
10:45:28,060 --> 10:45:29,060
R1.

6603
10:45:29,060 --> 10:45:30,060
Across R1.

6604
10:45:30,060 --> 10:45:34,060
So basically, as the capacitor is increasing in voltage,

6605
10:45:34,060 --> 10:45:38,060
the resistor is decreasing in voltage.

6606
10:45:38,060 --> 10:45:44,060
Because this is not only a series circuit, it's also a voltage divider.

6607
10:45:44,060 --> 10:45:47,060
It's a voltage divider.

6608
10:45:47,060 --> 10:45:51,060
After five time constants, this voltage will be equal to this voltage.

6609
10:45:51,060 --> 10:45:56,060
Voltage rise, voltage drop.

6610
10:45:56,060 --> 10:46:02,060
After five time constants, this is equal to this, which means there's zero left over.

6611
10:46:02,060 --> 10:46:04,060
Kirchoff's voltage law.

6612
10:46:04,060 --> 10:46:07,060
Everything always goes back to what we talked about.

6613
10:46:07,060 --> 10:46:11,060
I'm really not talking about a whole lot of new stuff here.

6614
10:46:11,060 --> 10:46:14,060
I'm getting paid to talk about the same old stuff.

6615
10:46:14,060 --> 10:46:17,060
Just every week I introduce a new word.

6616
10:46:17,060 --> 10:46:20,060
This week it was inductance.

6617
10:46:20,060 --> 10:46:22,060
Capacitance.

6618
10:46:22,060 --> 10:46:24,060
What is it five times?

6619
10:46:24,060 --> 10:46:25,060
Why?

6620
10:46:25,060 --> 10:46:27,060
Why not B2?

6621
10:46:27,060 --> 10:46:33,060
Because in five times, you basically get close to 100%.

6622
10:46:33,060 --> 10:46:35,060
That's why we call it five times.

6623
10:46:35,060 --> 10:46:37,060
It's really between five and six times.

6624
10:46:37,060 --> 10:46:40,060
Some books say six time constants.

6625
10:46:40,060 --> 10:46:43,060
Some say five.

6626
10:46:43,060 --> 10:46:47,060
But you're so close to 100%.

6627
10:46:47,060 --> 10:46:55,060
Because the six would be 63% of 99.3% for the sixth constant.

6628
10:46:55,060 --> 10:47:03,060
Because on the fifth constant, it would be 99.6%, right?

6629
10:47:03,060 --> 10:47:06,060
After five time constants, we call it even.

6630
10:47:06,060 --> 10:47:11,060
The books that you say do sometimes have a sixth time constant.

6631
10:47:11,060 --> 10:47:16,060
If you're dealing with real high power stuff, that could be a difference.

6632
10:47:16,060 --> 10:47:20,060
If it was high power and a high voltage, it could be the difference of a couple of volts.

6633
10:47:20,060 --> 10:47:22,060
That's a small percentage.

6634
10:47:22,060 --> 10:47:25,060
But generally, it's accepted five time constants.

6635
10:47:25,060 --> 10:47:30,060
Every exam you take here, it would be five time constants.

6636
10:47:30,060 --> 10:47:36,060
In summary, capacitance is that property that stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field.

6637
10:47:36,060 --> 10:47:41,060
A capacitor is a specific device designed to possess the property of capacitance.

6638
10:47:41,060 --> 10:47:43,060
Fixed capacitor symbol.

6639
10:47:43,060 --> 10:47:46,060
On the top, variable capacitor symbol on the bottom.

6640
10:47:46,060 --> 10:47:52,060
Capacitance is measured in farads, developed by a guy by the name of Joe Farad.

6641
10:47:52,060 --> 10:47:57,060
Microfarads, picofarads are typically the most often used values.

6642
10:47:57,060 --> 10:48:03,060
Instead of nano, you may see milli-micro, or you may see tens of thousands of picot.

6643
10:48:03,060 --> 10:48:08,060
The letter C represents capacitance, four factors affect capacitance.

6644
10:48:08,060 --> 10:48:13,060
Area of the plates, distance between the plates, types of materials, and temperature.

6645
10:48:13,060 --> 10:48:18,060
Capacitor types include electrolytic, paper, plastic, ceramic, or variable.

6646
10:48:18,060 --> 10:48:24,060
To add up capacitance in series, you use the parallel formula.

6647
10:48:24,060 --> 10:48:29,060
To add them up in parallel, you use the series formula.

6648
10:48:29,060 --> 10:48:34,060
And to determine capacitive time constants, we use the formula T is equal to R times C.

6649
10:48:34,060 --> 10:48:40,060
Any questions?

6650
10:48:40,060 --> 10:48:46,060
Alright, let's go ahead and take about a ten minute break.

6651
10:48:46,060 --> 10:48:52,060
And when we come back, section two of the book, AC circuits.
