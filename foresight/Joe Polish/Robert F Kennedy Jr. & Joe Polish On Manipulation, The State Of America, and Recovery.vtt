WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
I don't have any control over what happens ultimately, you know, that isn't God's hands.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.800
The only thing I control is this little piece of real estate inside my own shoes.

00:11.800 --> 00:17.280
There's a couple of things that every demagogue can use to manipulate people, and one of those

00:17.280 --> 00:21.440
is fear, because it disables our capacity for critical thinking.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.320
There's a 2013 poll that showed that 85% of Americans under 35% said they were proud of

00:27.320 --> 00:29.560
the United States of America.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.240
The same poll taken last month showed only 18%.

00:33.240 --> 00:39.600
My initial bias about psychedelic drugs is, again, colored by my experience of being in

00:39.600 --> 00:41.280
recovery for 40 years.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.200
I would tell myself at 9 o'clock in the morning, I am never going to do that again, and at

00:45.200 --> 00:49.480
4 o'clock in the afternoon, I'd be telling exactly what I said, and, you know, it was

00:49.480 --> 00:54.480
like somebody else had stepped into my body and was now, you know, a new driver in the

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
truck.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.760
Through a free market, you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and

00:59.760 --> 01:01.600
without enriching your community.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.960
You show me a polluter, or I'll show you a fat cat using political clout to escape the

01:06.960 --> 01:10.920
discipline of the free market and force the public base production costs.

01:10.920 --> 01:17.120
We have to be able to weather those difficulties without being crushed in our soul or without

01:17.120 --> 01:21.560
being ultimately affected by it, and that's kind of the objective where we all want to

01:21.560 --> 01:26.320
be spiritually, where we're indifferent to the personal consequences of everything that

01:26.320 --> 01:31.280
we do, and that we live our lives for all higher purposes.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.480
The vast majority of people in the audience are entrepreneurs, capitalists, love to get

01:36.480 --> 01:40.520
your views on the environment and capitalism, because that's a topic that there's a lot

01:40.520 --> 01:42.360
of debate on.

01:42.360 --> 01:49.640
First of all, thank you so much for having me, and thanks for the reception.

01:49.640 --> 01:56.960
I've been working as an environmental advocate and attorney for 40 years for my entire career,

01:56.960 --> 02:04.280
but I started out as an attorney for commercial fishmen on the Hudson River, and we built

02:04.280 --> 02:06.280
that organization.

02:06.280 --> 02:11.160
They launched a patrol boat, they began, these were people who were capitalists.

02:11.160 --> 02:19.080
They were small business people, and they saw their livelihoods being destroyed by pollution

02:19.080 --> 02:26.600
on the river, and these were people who, the Hudson River commercial fishery is the oldest

02:26.600 --> 02:30.400
in North America, it's 350 years old.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.400
Many of the people I represent came from families that have been fishing the river continuously

02:36.400 --> 02:41.240
since Dutch colonial times, it's a traditional gear of fishery they use.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.240
The same fishing methods that were taught by the Algonquin Indians to the original Dutch

02:45.280 --> 02:51.400
settlers of New Amsterdam and then passed down through the generations, and there was

02:51.400 --> 02:56.880
nothing wrong with their business model, but the general electric company used political

02:56.880 --> 03:05.880
clout in Albany to get permission to illegally dump PCBs into the river, rather than properly

03:05.880 --> 03:11.420
disposing them, and it saved them money, it allowed them to out-compete the other producers

03:11.420 --> 03:20.660
of capacitators and to win in the marketplace, but they had distorted the market signals

03:20.660 --> 03:26.340
by cheating the market, and these fishermen knew that their problem was not their business

03:26.340 --> 03:35.580
model, it was that we didn't have free market capitalism on the river, we had a kind of

03:35.580 --> 03:41.700
corporate crony capitalism that was allowing polluters to use political clout to escape

03:41.700 --> 03:45.180
the discipline of the free market.

03:45.180 --> 03:52.300
One of the things I learned very early on was that we don't have to choose between good

03:52.300 --> 03:58.420
environmental policy and good economic policy, in 100% of the cases, good economic policy

03:58.420 --> 04:02.020
is identical to good environmental policy.

04:02.020 --> 04:06.220
If we want to measure the economy, and this is how we ought to be measuring it, based

04:06.220 --> 04:12.180
upon how it produces jobs and the dignity of jobs over the generations and how it preserves

04:12.180 --> 04:19.260
the value of the assets of our community, if on the other hand we want to do what the

04:19.260 --> 04:24.100
big polluters often want us to do, which is to treat the planet as if it were business

04:24.100 --> 04:30.940
and liquidation, convert our natural resources to cash as quickly as possible, have a few

04:30.940 --> 04:37.100
years of pollution-based prosperity, we can generate an instantaneous cash flow and the

04:37.100 --> 04:42.020
illusion of a prosperous economy, but our children are going to pay for our joyride,

04:42.020 --> 04:47.220
and they're going to pay for it with denuded landscapes, poor health, huge cleanup costs

04:47.220 --> 04:51.700
that are going to amplify over time and they'll never be able to pay, and environmental injury

04:51.700 --> 04:58.180
is deficit spending, it's a way of loading the cost of our generation's prosperity onto

04:58.180 --> 05:02.300
the backs of our children.

05:02.300 --> 05:08.020
My approach has always been colored by my experience, I worked for 40 years for the

05:08.020 --> 05:14.660
commercial fishermen and I really kind of colored my worldview about the environment,

05:14.660 --> 05:20.660
and if you can go back 35 or 40 years ago and look at speeches that I was giving back

05:20.660 --> 05:27.540
then where people would ask me, what's the most important solution, most effective solution

05:27.540 --> 05:32.700
to environmental pollution, and I always said the same thing, it's a free market, true

05:32.700 --> 05:41.220
free market capitalism, because a free market, a true free market, promotes efficiency, and

05:41.220 --> 05:47.620
efficiency means the elimination of waste, and pollution is waste, and a true free market

05:47.620 --> 05:52.820
would require us to properly value our natural resources, and it's the undervaluation of

05:52.820 --> 06:00.380
those resources that cause us to use them wastefully or recklessly, and a true free

06:00.380 --> 06:05.140
market you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich, and without enriching

06:05.140 --> 06:07.060
your community.

06:07.060 --> 06:12.900
What polluters do is they make themselves rich by making everybody else poor, they raise

06:12.900 --> 06:18.460
standards of living for themselves by lowering quality of life for the rest of us, and they

06:18.460 --> 06:22.340
do that by escaping the discipline of the free market.

06:22.340 --> 06:29.660
You show me a polluter, I'll show you a subsidy, I'll show you a fat cat using political clout

06:29.660 --> 06:33.860
to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay its production

06:33.860 --> 06:39.460
costs, and what I did as an environmental advocate, I really always considered myself

06:39.460 --> 06:47.300
a free marketer, and I was going out into the marketplace to catch the cheaters and

06:47.300 --> 06:52.860
to bring them to court and say to them, we're going to force you to internalize your costs

06:52.860 --> 06:58.140
the same way that you internalize your profits, because as long as somebody can externalize

06:58.140 --> 07:04.620
those costs, it distorts the marketplace, and none of us gets the advantages of the

07:04.620 --> 07:10.380
efficiency, the prosperity, and the democracy that true free market capitalism offers our

07:10.380 --> 07:11.380
country.

07:11.380 --> 07:14.700
Okay, great, thank you.

07:14.700 --> 07:19.860
Let me ask my team, make sure we put a timer up here so we know the time if we could, because

07:19.860 --> 07:21.900
it's not on, thank you.

07:21.900 --> 07:27.820
So I asked the audience to submit some questions, and I can't ask all of them, but one of them

07:27.820 --> 07:33.620
was about psychedelics, and let me preface this by saying, you know that I've been in

07:33.620 --> 07:40.740
recovery, you've been in recovery for 40 years, and I'm the first person in the world to have

07:40.740 --> 07:46.940
before and after brain scans doing ibogaine and 5MEO-DMT, which I did in 2015 in Mexico,

07:46.940 --> 07:50.780
and we took a film crew, and we filmed it, and then we did interviews with the doctor

07:50.780 --> 07:55.100
that did the before and after brain scans and whatnot, and I've seen miraculous things

07:55.100 --> 08:01.180
happen, but I'm also worried about the pharmaceutical industries like they're doing with everything,

08:01.180 --> 08:02.260
co-opping it.

08:02.260 --> 08:06.620
So what are your thoughts on psychedelics, because my viewpoint on it is in the field

08:06.620 --> 08:09.300
of recovery, depression, mental illness, things like that.

08:09.300 --> 08:16.860
I mean, my initial bias about psychedelic drugs is, again, colored by my experience

08:16.860 --> 08:22.460
of being in recovery for 40 years and having gone to, I go to like nine meetings a week,

08:22.460 --> 08:24.860
so 12-step meetings.

08:24.860 --> 08:31.180
I've heard a lot of bad stories about people, you know, involvement with drugs and alcohol

08:31.180 --> 08:34.380
and pharmaceutical drugs.

08:34.380 --> 08:45.860
My bias is that I don't think that, in most cases, that we can fix things that are wrong

08:45.860 --> 08:51.940
inside of us with things that are outside of us, with all the things that we reach for

08:51.940 --> 08:58.540
when we feel discomfort, whether it's drugs or alcohol or sex or reckless behavior, where

08:58.540 --> 09:02.780
particularly people who are prone to addiction are always looking for things outside of them

09:02.780 --> 09:08.060
to fix, you know, to fill this empty hole that they have inside of them.

09:08.060 --> 09:19.420
Having said that, I have seven kids and my wife in 2012 took her own life and left me

09:19.420 --> 09:22.740
with six children.

09:22.740 --> 09:29.820
And so all of those kids were at risk at the time and they all ended up doing really wonderful

09:29.820 --> 09:34.660
things with their lives and they're in good relationships and they're, you know, outside

09:34.660 --> 09:39.300
now of that, what I would call a risk level.

09:39.300 --> 09:50.020
One of them was worrying to me because he never processed his mom's death in a way that

09:50.020 --> 09:52.380
I could observe.

09:52.380 --> 09:56.220
He seemed like a happy kid, he was always smiling.

09:56.220 --> 10:04.500
He did get in a lot of fist fights and he was a, he became a boxer and he won a lot

10:04.500 --> 10:09.420
of tournaments and then he became a hockey player and, but everything he did, it was

10:09.420 --> 10:16.060
a little bit of violence though and it made me, it made me worried about him and he went

10:16.060 --> 10:23.580
to a couple, about five years ago, he went, he was very self-contained.

10:23.580 --> 10:33.060
We never talked about what was going on inside of him and he went to Patagonia to run a white,

10:33.060 --> 10:38.460
to kayak a white water river that I kayaked for many, many years every year called the

10:38.460 --> 10:45.820
Fute Le Faux and he went down there to do it with a friend and he had a five day wait

10:45.820 --> 10:54.180
between the time that the, that his kayak trip was going to start and the time that

10:54.180 --> 11:00.780
he arrived there and I had a friend who, oh, I knew a little bit of, just on a quaintance

11:00.780 --> 11:07.740
down there who I, who had some land property down there and I asked this guy to put my son

11:07.740 --> 11:15.180
up for a couple of days while he was waiting for his trip to start and that guy, the night

11:15.260 --> 11:22.060
my son arrived there, he had, that guy said to him, I'm doing an ayahuasca trip tonight

11:22.060 --> 11:28.540
and he said, God sent you boys to me because he was doing it with 20 poinche Indians and

11:28.540 --> 11:36.020
he said, I was praying to God that he would send me a gringo to do this with and my, my,

11:36.020 --> 11:44.220
my kid ended up doing this and he had this experience where after he drank the ayahuasca,

11:44.220 --> 11:47.900
they gave them all a bucket and they gave him a sleeping bag and it was kind of in an

11:47.900 --> 11:55.220
outdoor place with a fire and after he drank it, he felt himself sinking through all the

11:55.220 --> 11:59.940
geological strata of the earth and he could look at all of, he told me he could look at

11:59.940 --> 12:07.420
all the folds of stone and geology and he had a total understanding of all of the processes

12:07.420 --> 12:12.900
that had laid them out for the aeons, he ended up being propelled out of the other side of

12:12.900 --> 12:18.940
the earth and then floating through space for what he experienced as hundreds of years

12:18.940 --> 12:25.740
and he would focus on a distant planet and be transported there and on each planet, he

12:25.740 --> 12:31.620
would have an adventure at the end of the adventure, there would be a lesson, a moral

12:31.620 --> 12:37.900
lesson that he would learn that he was supposed to remember. The last place, the last planet

12:37.900 --> 12:47.100
he visited, he came into, his mother was there and she started passing through him in and

12:47.100 --> 12:53.260
out of him again and again and every time she did that, he felt all these experiences

12:53.260 --> 13:03.340
of forgiveness, of love, of understanding, of comprehension, of empathy and compassion

13:03.340 --> 13:10.060
and when he came back from that trip, he was completely changed, he was very open about

13:10.060 --> 13:17.740
talking about his feelings, he was on a real spiritual class, he was very, very openly

13:17.740 --> 13:23.460
just happy all the time and he, the reason I really know that it changed him is he started

13:23.460 --> 13:32.460
taking out the garbage and doing the dishes and he's done the dishes constantly without

13:32.580 --> 13:41.580
ever being asked since then. He's a 24 year old kid, so you know that's a miracle. So

13:41.580 --> 13:49.180
I had that open my mind to the possibility that there may be something that I didn't

13:49.180 --> 13:54.860
understand or that was outside of my kind of bubble of prejudices and then I have a

13:54.860 --> 14:01.500
friend who's an ABCL who had a severe PTSD and he went to Costa Rica and had the same

14:01.500 --> 14:08.940
kind of experience and I had a couple of other friends who are in the NFL and they also had

14:08.940 --> 14:16.140
severe brain injuries and depression, terrible, terrible depression and the same thing happened

14:16.140 --> 14:23.420
and then I looked at Michael Pollan's documentary which I think is on Netflix and there's one

14:23.420 --> 14:29.740
particularly poignant story, he goes through each of the psychedelics, a show for each one

14:30.700 --> 14:37.740
and I think the third show is on the psilocybin and there's a kid on that show who had severe

14:37.740 --> 14:45.660
OCD, he could not, he literally could not go out of his house. He had to do all of these rituals,

14:45.660 --> 14:50.700
all the, he had to constantly clean his hands, he had to walk through the door 10 times or 20

14:50.700 --> 14:57.180
times or 60 times and he had to do all these very repetitive rituals and it absolutely paralyzed him

14:58.140 --> 15:04.140
and destroyed his life and he did one psilocybin trip and it was completely gone.

15:05.340 --> 15:11.980
So, you know, my mind is open to the idea that, you know, there may be things that I don't know

15:11.980 --> 15:18.140
about and that people ought to have the freedom and the liberty to experiment with these things.

15:18.140 --> 15:25.020
I likely use said at the outset which is, you know, we know the capacity of the pharmaceutical

15:25.020 --> 15:31.980
industry to come and capture this if they see that there's money in it and then to turn it

15:31.980 --> 15:37.500
into something very, very bad and to promote it in ways that it shouldn't be promoted.

15:38.460 --> 15:44.700
So, you know, my inclination and I haven't thought this through that much but my inclination would be

15:44.700 --> 15:52.940
to make this available at least in therapeutic settings and maybe more generally but in ways

15:53.020 --> 15:58.700
that would discourage the corporate control exploitation of it.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.420
Yeah, absolutely. No, absolutely. And I mean,

16:06.860 --> 16:14.940
we could, you know, I believe that addiction is a solution to pain and addiction works if you're

16:15.580 --> 16:19.660
lonely, depressed, anxiety-ridden in the moment but the problem is it has this thing called

16:19.660 --> 16:27.340
consequences that can destroy your life and make your life not work and I think we live in a culture

16:27.340 --> 16:34.220
that we have the largest addiction crisis in human history right now. There's a lot of temptation,

16:34.220 --> 16:40.860
there's a lot of pain, there's a lot of trauma. I think the last three to four years of the pandemic

16:40.860 --> 16:47.340
has created more angst, more pain, more trauma that will last literally generations and I think

16:47.340 --> 16:52.300
millions of lives have been destroyed as a result of it and one of the coping mechanisms

16:52.300 --> 16:58.860
is addiction and I think anything that could help with that and I think psychedelics are one part

16:58.860 --> 17:08.780
of that is beneficial. If you become president, what could you do or will you do to fix this issue?

17:09.500 --> 17:15.820
Yeah, I mean, part of the, you know, addiction, like you say, it's a response to internal pain,

17:15.820 --> 17:22.540
it's also a response to adamantization, to loneliness, a disconnection to disaffection

17:23.900 --> 17:31.020
and, you know, and we're seeing that's now epidemic in this country where so many of us feel

17:31.020 --> 17:36.940
that we're no longer connected to a community. It was a poll recently that showed that,

17:37.740 --> 17:47.980
there's a 2013 poll that showed that when asked, 80, 85 percent of kids of Americans under 35

17:47.980 --> 17:53.500
said they were proud of the United States of America. The same poll taken last month showed

17:53.500 --> 18:01.340
only 18 percent. So they've lost faith in our country, they've lost hope for their own future,

18:01.340 --> 18:07.980
they've lost a connection to community and now, you know, we're seeing the biggest cause of suicide

18:07.980 --> 18:17.180
among Black youth today, I mean, of death among Black youth is suicide. We lost 106,000 kids last

18:17.180 --> 18:24.860
year to fentanyl overdose or to other opioid overdoses. That's double the number of kids that

18:24.860 --> 18:34.860
we lost in the 20 year Vietnam War. We're really in a crisis now. One of my program, my kind of

18:34.860 --> 18:42.780
moonshot program or Peace Corps program to use metaphors from my uncle's administration will be

18:42.780 --> 18:53.900
to start, to launch a string of healing centers around this country, particularly in rural areas

18:54.380 --> 18:59.500
where people will go there and do regenerative farming, regenerative agriculture, grow good food,

19:00.860 --> 19:05.500
healthy food and learn to live in communities again without screens, without cell phones.

19:06.860 --> 19:14.860
And I've looked at these places for 40 years. The rehab industry in this country is,

19:16.140 --> 19:22.060
I would say, somewhat predatory at this point, like many, many other industries, but

19:22.860 --> 19:30.860
I had a relative who was in a lot of trouble and I started looking all over the world for places that

19:30.860 --> 19:37.340
had a different model. And I found this place in Italy in Tuscany called San Padre Nano and it's a

19:37.340 --> 19:45.740
500 acre farm. There's 2,000 kids who live there. It's absolutely free. The only thing they ask you

19:45.740 --> 19:56.220
to commit to is to stay there for 5 years. 5 years? Listen, if it's a choice, a lot of kids today

19:56.220 --> 20:04.220
are honest, they're actually going to die. And 5 years is like college. And if you can save somebody's

20:04.220 --> 20:09.580
life, it takes time because you have to re-parent the person. You have to reorient them to live in a

20:09.580 --> 20:19.020
completely different way. And they're taking people who are criminals, who are not only drug addicts,

20:19.020 --> 20:25.900
but people who are headed for prison, headed for something very bad. They take them and they

20:25.900 --> 20:34.460
transform them into good citizens. At that place, they have, it's completely self-supporting.

20:34.780 --> 20:43.580
In Italy, you can do a check-off on your taxes to send $1, by approximately $1 on your taxes.

20:43.580 --> 20:49.820
There's a little check-off to San Padre Nano. Most of their money comes from their industries,

20:49.820 --> 20:55.180
so they have one of the best bakeries in Europe and they teach kids traditional baking skills.

20:55.180 --> 21:07.820
They have an apparel center where they do weaving and they make accessories, fashion accessories,

21:07.820 --> 21:13.420
so they make purses for De La Valle, for Prada, for Gucci, for these other big brands.

21:14.540 --> 21:19.980
They have a vineyard, 500 acre vineyard, and they make some of the finest wine in Europe.

21:19.980 --> 21:30.300
They have kennels and they have a wallpaper factory that makes this hand-painted wallpaper,

21:30.300 --> 21:35.260
very, very traditional with traditional artisans. There's no cell phones allowed,

21:35.260 --> 21:40.540
there's no screens, and the people live together in very, very tight kind of barracks. There's

21:40.540 --> 21:49.420
six girls and my relative was a girl and she was put in with six girls who watched her every

21:49.420 --> 21:54.940
move and if she did something selfish, if she did something dishonest, she was called on it,

21:54.940 --> 21:59.180
and it taught her a new way of living in a community and when she came out,

22:00.460 --> 22:07.740
she became very, very successful and not only in her business life but also her social life.

22:07.740 --> 22:18.940
She was utterly transformed. Two days ago, I went to a place in Salt Lake City called the other side

22:18.940 --> 22:26.220
that is modeled on San Pajagnano and they have now three city blocks full of buildings.

22:26.220 --> 22:34.060
They have 300 convicts. They take people out of prison or they take people who are facing long

22:34.060 --> 22:40.540
sentences and they interview them to see if they're suitable for the program. They bring them into

22:40.540 --> 22:45.820
that program and they rehabilitate them and they have to make a two-year commitment.

22:46.780 --> 22:54.140
It's absolutely free. Anybody can walk in the street and take advantage of it. They have the

22:54.140 --> 23:00.860
biggest moving company in Salt Lake. They have the biggest storage company in Salt Lake.

23:02.060 --> 23:09.820
They have a thrift store that is the size of two Walmart's. They have a construction firm

23:09.820 --> 23:16.540
that is very, very successful and they teach the inmates how to be electricians, how to be

23:16.540 --> 23:23.660
plumbers, all of these skills that they can use in the world. The guy who started it

23:25.660 --> 23:31.420
was facing his fifth term in prison. He was facing a 29-year prison sentence

23:32.700 --> 23:38.460
and he persuaded the judge to allow him to go to Delancey Street, which is a

23:38.460 --> 23:44.060
therapeutic community in San Francisco. He ended up working there for eight years and then

23:44.060 --> 23:50.780
coming out and starting this place. It was so inspiring going to this place and to the other

23:50.780 --> 23:55.020
side and seeing what they'd done because it's a model that can be reproduced elsewhere.

23:57.740 --> 24:05.100
I was in prison for the summer of 2001. I won a lawsuit against the Navy

24:05.820 --> 24:08.780
in Puerto Rico for bombing the island of Viegas.

24:12.220 --> 24:17.020
I did it. The judge, there was a corrupt judge who would not enforce my injunction.

24:18.300 --> 24:22.540
The group, I was representing 10,000 people on the island and they asked me to do a civil

24:22.540 --> 24:29.020
disobedience to go onto the live fire zone while the Navy was bombing and I was arrested.

24:29.020 --> 24:33.820
They told me, I said, how long am I going to be in jail? They said, well, just probably a day,

24:33.820 --> 24:41.180
but I ended up being the whole summer in maximum security prison. I had my son,

24:41.180 --> 24:45.820
my youngest son, was born while I was in prison. The first time I saw him was on visitor's day.

24:47.420 --> 24:51.420
In that prison, which is a federal prison, a much better than state prison,

24:52.700 --> 24:57.740
there was no, I couldn't even go to an AA meeting. There was no opportunities for any of the people

24:57.740 --> 25:02.860
who were living there to make their lives better and we need to do that better. We need to make

25:02.860 --> 25:08.460
sure when people come out of prison, they're actually productive. The guy who was running

25:08.460 --> 25:16.780
had to made that when he first started trying to place the convicts and businesses in Salt Lake

25:17.660 --> 25:24.620
that nobody wanted them because they're ex-cons. Now they have such a good work record and such a

25:24.620 --> 25:31.980
good reputation that he is a list of hundreds and hundreds of businesses on the wall who,

25:31.980 --> 25:37.740
and they employ 100% of the people who leave and everybody in Salt Lake wants people from this

25:37.740 --> 25:44.380
program because they're such responsible workers. Oh, it was inspiring to me to see that, you know,

25:44.380 --> 25:48.700
the transfer of what I saw and said, Patrick, I don't know what happened in this country.

25:49.820 --> 25:59.020
In A, the biggest industry in rural areas in our country are prisons. I want to change that and make

25:59.660 --> 26:06.540
rehab and restoration of the feeling of community in this country, the skills of living in a community

26:06.540 --> 26:12.220
to re-parent all of these kids who are lost today, an entire generation of kids who are lost,

26:13.260 --> 26:20.540
give them the opportunity to go to places where they can learn to be productive members of society

26:20.540 --> 26:25.180
and where they can get inspired again about their lives and regain hope in their lives.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.620
I love that. I love that. It's great.

26:31.100 --> 26:35.820
So you probably met him backstage. I don't know if he's out here, but we have Andre Norman who's

26:35.820 --> 26:41.260
here who spent 14 years in maximum security prison and he became the number three gang leader.

26:41.260 --> 26:45.660
He spent two years in solitary confinement and now this guy's like an absolute angel and just

26:45.660 --> 26:52.060
helped so many people and he's in charge of a program which currently has 600,000 tablets in

26:52.140 --> 26:57.340
prisons in the United States soon to be a million and we have genius network content. We have genius

26:57.340 --> 27:03.820
recovery content from my foundation on those tablets. 25% of the world's prisoners are in the

27:03.820 --> 27:08.700
United States who are the highest incarcerating country in the world. I believe it's between 80 to

27:08.700 --> 27:14.140
90% of everyone that's arrested or thrown in jail or prison. Drugs and alcohol were involved.

27:14.780 --> 27:20.140
40% of people that are incarcerated committed a violent crime, so that's a separate issue,

27:20.140 --> 27:27.420
but 60% had not. So we are incarcerating a lot of addicts and when someone goes through recovery,

27:27.420 --> 27:34.060
as you know, you can take people that were really lying, cheating, stealing, doing bad things and

27:34.060 --> 27:38.380
they become these incredible, compassionate, caring humans and so I think there's something

27:38.380 --> 27:44.220
to the whole process of healing and creating that environment. So yeah, I mean, we'll talk more

27:44.220 --> 27:50.700
about that. So let me, I have some questions about tyranny and all that, but before we get to it,

27:51.660 --> 27:55.820
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, what are your thoughts on digital currency?

27:55.820 --> 28:02.700
Yeah, I mean, I became a converter. I really didn't know anything about cryptocurrency. My kids all

28:04.380 --> 28:10.940
know are entrepreneurial and are interested in business and they're all in that space. So they

28:11.020 --> 28:15.980
were, you know, they had bought and sold cryptocurrencies and talked a lot about it,

28:15.980 --> 28:22.540
but I was really just on the sideline listening to them. And then I saw what happened during the

28:22.540 --> 28:29.180
pandemic, what happened in Toronto or in Ottawa to the strikers. Oh, Children's Health Defense,

28:29.180 --> 28:38.220
which was the organization that I ran, started and ran, had embedded in the trucker's convoy

28:38.540 --> 28:44.220
in Canada. We had a reporter embedded and we were helping them and we were, you know,

28:45.020 --> 28:48.860
sending money and publicizing what they were doing and the truckers in Canada

28:50.300 --> 28:55.740
were angry at the mandates and the truckers in Canada are very, very diverse group. A lot of them

28:55.740 --> 29:02.060
are from African descent, a lot of them for Asian, Indian, Bangladesh, and then just white

29:03.020 --> 29:07.740
people from all over Canada, but it's a very, very diverse group and they had started out

29:07.740 --> 29:13.420
in BC and Alberta and they had then done a collective and made a bigger and bigger convoy

29:13.420 --> 29:20.060
coming across the country. They wanted to meet with Justin Trudeau and talk to him about the

29:20.060 --> 29:27.660
impact of the mandates on their businesses and on their lives. And Prime Minister Trudeau would

29:27.660 --> 29:36.860
not meet with them and instead the, and it was, if you look at the videos of this protest in Ottawa,

29:36.860 --> 29:42.540
it looks like wood stock. You know, they had cleanup crews that were picking up garbage,

29:42.540 --> 29:48.940
they had crews that were passing out bottled water to people that were feeding the homeless

29:48.940 --> 29:54.140
people and hungry people in Ottawa and there was a field, there was music and there was a lot of

29:54.140 --> 30:01.900
joy. There was nothing nasty or me and spirited about it and it was portrayed that way by the,

30:01.900 --> 30:07.340
by officials, government officials and to a large extent by the mainstream media.

30:08.620 --> 30:15.420
But what they did in Canada is they used AI, they used facial recognition systems and they,

30:16.060 --> 30:21.180
and they got the identities of the people who are participating in the protest

30:22.620 --> 30:28.940
and they froze their bank accounts and this was shocking to me because none of them were

30:28.940 --> 30:34.380
charged with the crime. They also took $15 million that we had helped raise for them on PayPal

30:35.580 --> 30:39.420
and they persuaded PayPal to shut off their money so they couldn't access it.

30:40.460 --> 30:48.860
And it occurred to me then that, you know, I talked to one of the strikers, the truckers,

30:49.980 --> 30:57.340
now they couldn't buy diesel for their trucks, they couldn't buy food for their kids,

30:57.340 --> 31:04.460
they couldn't pay their mortgages. I talked to one striker who said he was facing jail time

31:04.460 --> 31:09.420
because he had mandatory alimony payments to his ex-wife and he could not pay them.

31:10.620 --> 31:16.380
And it occurred to me then that, you know, that transactional freedom is as important as freedom

31:16.380 --> 31:22.620
of expression. If you have freedom of expression under the First Amendment, you can say anything

31:22.620 --> 31:28.140
you want about your government without consequence, but if the government then can shut off your

31:28.140 --> 31:34.380
capacity to pay your rent, to buy food, you know, put you essentially on the sidewalk and paralyze

31:34.380 --> 31:39.740
you, what does it matter if you have so-called freedom of expression and they don't have to

31:39.740 --> 31:45.180
charge you with any crime? And I had actually, I had seen this happening, what's happening in China

31:46.140 --> 31:52.620
where they have what they call programmable currencies, which is, you know, in China now

31:52.620 --> 31:59.900
they use, your face is your credit card, so their facial recognition is so ubiquitous and so refined

31:59.900 --> 32:06.780
and sophisticated that when you go to a store to pay, you don't use cash, you know, in many places,

32:06.780 --> 32:11.580
you don't use any credit card, you just use your face to pay and there's, you know, you have a digital

32:11.660 --> 32:17.500
account and on your digital account is other information, including your medical information,

32:17.500 --> 32:25.740
including your social credit score. Oh, if you drop below a certain credit score, your capacity

32:25.740 --> 32:33.660
to use your accounts now ends and they, for example, they have one system where if, and I'll give

32:33.660 --> 32:39.740
you an example, if there is a, if the government declared a mask day and you're walking around

32:39.740 --> 32:45.340
with your mask below your nostrils and you're seeing on facial recognition system, which knows

32:45.340 --> 32:51.340
everybody, you're going to now lose social credit points or if you're too close to your girlfriend

32:51.340 --> 32:58.700
on a, you know, on a social distance, you're not even told about it. You're going to lose social

32:58.700 --> 33:04.620
credit and if you drop below a certain point, at some point, your, your credit, your facial credit

33:04.620 --> 33:11.820
card stops working except in grocery stores that are within a certain radius of your home.

33:11.820 --> 33:15.820
So you can't travel, you can't buy gas for your car, you can't buy an airplane ticket,

33:15.820 --> 33:21.500
you can't go to a hotel, you're essentially under house arrest. If the government has the capacity

33:21.500 --> 33:29.900
to do that to people, then it has the capacity, I mean, a government that can silence its, its

33:29.980 --> 33:36.380
critics as a license for any kind of atrocity. And it is the top of a very, very slippery slope

33:37.900 --> 33:45.100
or totalitarian rule. So, you know, I was, again, I was, I was struck at that point by

33:45.820 --> 33:52.460
how important it was that we have transactional freedom. And during that period, you may remember

33:52.460 --> 33:57.100
this, there were a lot of people in the federal government who were saying, we got to get rid

33:57.180 --> 34:04.140
of paper currency. And in fact, in many nations like in Africa and Australia, etc., they were

34:04.140 --> 34:11.580
taking away ATM machines. They were doing that on the pretense that paper currency passes germs.

34:11.580 --> 34:19.420
So we have to get rid of it. Well, if we go to total digital currency, every transaction that you

34:19.420 --> 34:26.380
have is not, is, is visible to the government, the corporations, it's taxable, it's, you know,

34:26.380 --> 34:34.220
it's my, it, it, it, it can be monetized for profit by somebody. And you can't, you have no secrets

34:34.220 --> 34:39.020
in your life. If you, you know, if you wanted to buy cigarettes or pornography or liquor or

34:39.020 --> 34:44.380
whatever you want to do, stuff that you don't want to share with the world, you know, somebody's

34:44.380 --> 34:51.420
going to know about that. And that's a very, very dangerous thing in a democracy. And, and so, you

34:51.420 --> 34:58.460
know, I think it's really important that we keep paper currency number one at people of access to

34:58.460 --> 35:07.980
Bitcoin and other currencies and that, and that we look very, very warily at central bank digital

35:07.980 --> 35:13.340
currencies, which are, you know, which they're putting in place right now. And that is how they

35:13.340 --> 35:18.140
did it in China. They started with the central bank digital currency and then they expanded its

35:18.140 --> 35:24.300
reach to become any instrument for social control. And to me, that's very dangerous.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.900
Well, well, thank you.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.820
Tell me something that nobody in the world understands about you.

35:36.780 --> 35:47.020
I don't know about that. I, you know, as you know, one of the things they say in recovery is that

35:48.220 --> 35:57.340
you're as sick as your secrets. And, you know, I understood when I was, when I was getting sober,

35:58.620 --> 36:03.180
that I could not afford to have any secrets. That doesn't mean that you tell the world everything

36:03.260 --> 36:10.300
about yourself. But you have to tell somebody, there has to be somebody out there who knows

36:10.300 --> 36:15.420
everything. And so I think, you know, I have that I have a number of people in my life

36:17.020 --> 36:24.300
who, who, you know, who literally know everything about me, you know, and, and so, you know, and I

36:24.300 --> 36:31.020
think that that's important for all of us. To speak to that, I'd like to get your viewpoint on, because

36:31.020 --> 36:36.140
here you are running for president of the United States. You are openly talking about addiction

36:36.140 --> 36:42.540
recovery, which I think is awesome. You're more focused on health than anyone else I know that is,

36:42.540 --> 36:49.420
you know, running. So you're a great role model in that arena. And you are sick as your secrets.

36:49.420 --> 36:55.420
I think that is a, it's true. It's actually at one of these genius network annual events in 2015,

36:55.420 --> 36:59.580
where I openly just decided I'm just going to share everything. I talked about drug addiction,

36:59.580 --> 37:04.700
sex addiction, work addiction, you name it. And it was one of the most freeing things that I did,

37:04.700 --> 37:11.980
but I also had been going to 12 steps for many years. And what's the difference between how you

37:13.340 --> 37:19.820
basically what you share and what you don't. There's secrecy and then there's privacy.

37:20.540 --> 37:26.700
And there are trusted people. I always caution people not to make like a Facebook confessional,

37:26.780 --> 37:30.780
where you just go and share it needs to be done and we're ready to do it. So

37:32.140 --> 37:39.260
you can't be like an idiot. Right. Right. Right. Well, and some people do, it hurts.

37:39.260 --> 37:44.300
Yeah. You have to make prudent judgments. And, you know, we're not, you know,

37:46.540 --> 37:53.100
Jesus said you have to be gentle as lamb, but clever as snakes. And you know, you need to be,

37:53.100 --> 38:00.700
you know, people, God gave us a brain to use it, to make good judgments with,

38:00.700 --> 38:05.260
to make prudent judgments. And there's people that you tell everything to. And there's people

38:05.260 --> 38:11.420
that you tell, you know, but you don't lie. Right. Well, you have a lot at risk for disclosure.

38:11.420 --> 38:16.220
So when did you first start disclosing this to others? Because I think, you know, those

38:16.220 --> 38:20.940
from the 12 step world always will mention that it's in the fourth step that you find

38:20.940 --> 38:26.140
the cravings in the, in the, you know, we'll start to relieve when you share it with someone.

38:26.140 --> 38:35.580
Yeah. I mean, I knew, you know, what kept me, I knew that I was an addict from when I was 15

38:35.580 --> 38:41.020
years old. When I started, I started the year after my dad had killed, I started taking drugs.

38:42.140 --> 38:49.820
And I progressed very, very quickly to heroin. And I was addicted for 14 years on and off. But

38:49.820 --> 38:57.820
I always wanted to quit. Oh, I tried to earn this. I was basically, you know, I was, I was

38:57.820 --> 39:02.940
living against conscious at that time. I knew that I did not want to be an addict. But, and I had

39:02.940 --> 39:09.260
iron willpower in other parts of my life. I gave up candy for Lent when I was 13. And I didn't need

39:09.260 --> 39:15.420
candy again till I was in college. And I gave up desserts the following year for Lent. And I never

39:15.420 --> 39:21.100
had a dessert till I was in my freshman year of college when I was doing, you know, playing sports.

39:22.380 --> 39:29.100
And, and I wanted to bulk up. And, but I felt like I could do anything with willpower. But

39:29.100 --> 39:36.780
somehow this compulsion was utterly impervious to my willpower. And I would, you know, the most,

39:38.140 --> 39:45.100
to me, the most demoralizing feature of addiction was my incapacity to keep contracts with myself.

39:45.980 --> 39:50.540
I tell myself at nine o'clock in the morning, I am never going to do that again. And at four o'clock

39:50.540 --> 39:55.820
in the afternoon, I'd be doing exactly what I said. And, you know, it was like somebody else had

39:55.820 --> 40:01.740
stepped into my body and was now, you know, a new driver in the truck was now nothing to do with me.

40:02.700 --> 40:09.260
And it was, it was baffling to me, just bewildering, why can't I control myself?

40:10.220 --> 40:16.220
But I tried earnestly, sincerely, honestly for 14 years to stop and couldn't do it.

40:16.220 --> 40:20.380
One of the things I'd never tried was 12 separate programs because of exactly what you said.

40:21.420 --> 40:26.860
There was no way, given my background and my vulnerabilities, that I would step into a room

40:26.860 --> 40:33.260
of strangers and start talking about what was happening in my life. And then, you know, I came

40:33.340 --> 40:41.020
in in September of 1983. I was arrested. I was in the papers. So at that point, there was no

40:41.020 --> 40:45.740
secret left. And I, you know, it was the best thing that happened to me because I was able, at that

40:45.740 --> 40:52.300
point, to come in and, you know, take advantage of this program. But I knew from the beginning,

40:52.300 --> 40:57.820
that, you know, if you're an addict, you are dishonest. You're going, you have to lie. You

40:57.820 --> 41:04.700
can't, you know, you can't, you cannot, I don't think, I think it's impossible to be a drug addict

41:04.700 --> 41:16.380
and not lie. And so, and I knew that dishonesty was associated with my addiction and that if I

41:16.380 --> 41:24.380
did not become rigorously honest in every aspect of my life, that I was, I was going to fall back

41:24.380 --> 41:30.140
in the addiction. And so, you know, I, I put a lot of effort into that. And it was, you know,

41:30.140 --> 41:38.940
it was difficult. I remember one time I was in court. And, you know what, it's strange when

41:38.940 --> 41:45.340
you're, when you, when you get, I wouldn't say I was a pathological liar, but I was habitual,

41:45.340 --> 41:51.740
you know. And if you ask me, where did I get this shirt? I would not, the first,

41:52.700 --> 41:57.260
the first thought in my head would not be, where did I get this shirt? It would be,

41:58.620 --> 42:05.180
what can I say to put myself at some advantage in this relationship? I wasn't thinking, you know,

42:05.180 --> 42:11.820
of the truth. And I had to break myself of those habits by when I caught myself saying something

42:11.820 --> 42:18.540
dishonest to tell people right then, what I said to you just now is not per truth. And the pain

42:18.540 --> 42:25.340
of doing that a couple of times was what, you know, allowed me to move. I remember reading very,

42:25.340 --> 42:36.140
very early on about an obituary at C. S. Lewis, who was a great theologian who wrote the Narnia books

42:36.140 --> 42:41.900
and, you know, and a brilliant novelist. But he wrote this obituary about a friend of his

42:42.860 --> 42:49.820
where he described his friend as honest as the daylight. And I read that phrase and I was like,

42:49.820 --> 42:58.940
wow, I wish, I wish that someday somebody would say that about me. And around that time, I was in

42:58.940 --> 43:07.100
court, I was arguing in front of a federal judge in white planes. And he asked me a question,

43:07.180 --> 43:13.740
I said something that was not true. And then I sat down and my opponent got up and it was something

43:13.740 --> 43:18.780
that I could have never gotten exposed on or caught. It was only slightly an exaggeration.

43:20.220 --> 43:26.620
But I sat down and it would have no consequence to me, could never have any consequence to me other

43:26.620 --> 43:34.060
than just my conscience eating at me. And I sat down and I was like, you know, wow, that was not

43:34.060 --> 43:40.940
true. The next time I got up, I said to the judge, I just want to say something what I said to you,

43:40.940 --> 43:46.460
you know, was not true. And there was like this unsilenced in the courtroom, because nobody'd

43:46.460 --> 43:54.620
ever heard a lawyer do that before. And then it just went on. And like, and but the pain of doing

43:54.620 --> 44:00.780
that a couple of times, you will get on as you get struck on it as quickly because it's so agonizing

44:00.780 --> 44:09.180
to give yourself up. That got me kind of a better habit of, you know, of being on it. And right now

44:09.180 --> 44:17.260
it's critical, you know, from my I understand it's critical for my survival. So I'm married to

44:17.260 --> 44:22.060
somebody who I don't think is ever told a lot in her life, you know, and she's an example.

44:23.020 --> 44:27.980
She's a role model for me, but she has no impulse to it. It's like she has

44:30.140 --> 44:36.620
she just I've never heard her say anything even slightly self promoting or dishonest or

44:36.620 --> 44:45.740
distorted or even exaggeration. And she still manages to be very funny and very interesting.

44:46.300 --> 44:52.860
Wow, that's awesome. Thank you. So let me my friend Alex Mandozian, who's here,

44:52.860 --> 44:59.340
he sent this over to me via text, I don't know, maybe a month ago. And it's when it's a quote from

44:59.340 --> 45:04.940
Thomas Jefferson. When the people fear their government, there's tyranny. When a government

45:04.940 --> 45:11.500
fears its people, there's liberty. What are your thoughts on that? I think, you know, there are a

45:11.500 --> 45:18.780
couple of what I would call alchemies of demagoguery. There are there are buttons that we all have

45:20.460 --> 45:27.100
that are that were installed in us during the 20,000 generations that human beings

45:28.300 --> 45:35.100
were wandering the African savanna and little groups and warlike groups fighting with other

45:35.100 --> 45:40.700
groups defending themselves against, you know, lions and predators and trying to feed themselves.

45:41.820 --> 45:49.500
And and a lot of our our hard wiring was installed during that key evolutionary period.

45:50.460 --> 45:55.420
And, you know, we were following a small a powerful male leader and

45:56.460 --> 46:01.420
doing what we were told and you had to have a unit cohesion and you had to behave like everybody

46:01.500 --> 46:05.740
else because otherwise you wouldn't we're arguing with the leader all the time.

46:06.780 --> 46:13.660
You had to do things and we're all have that programming internally. And so there's a couple

46:13.660 --> 46:19.500
of things that every demagogue can use to manipulate people. And one of those is fear.

46:20.780 --> 46:28.540
And because it disables our capacity for critical thinking. And during the, you know,

46:29.100 --> 46:34.700
actually during the Great Depression, even before the war in 1932, Franklin Roosevelt

46:35.820 --> 46:40.220
gave a speech where he said to the American public, the only thing we have to fear is fear

46:40.220 --> 46:47.180
itself is after Wall Street crash. And what he was saying then was that he saw what was happening

46:47.180 --> 46:53.500
in Europe, which was suffering from the same depression. And in Eastern Europe, in Russia,

46:53.820 --> 47:01.260
and the Soviet Union, oh, democracy was collapsing everywhere because of the economic pressure.

47:01.260 --> 47:06.700
And you were seeing the rise of tyrants on the right and tyrants on the left. And each one was

47:06.700 --> 47:13.660
using fear. And the other alchemy of demagoguery, which is racism, point to minority groups and

47:13.660 --> 47:18.700
saying they, you know, they did it to you, they're dangerous to you. So these are all things that

47:18.700 --> 47:25.580
were installed on us, you know, during that multimillion-year period. And people can come and

47:25.580 --> 47:33.820
exploit them today and disable our capacity for critical thinking. Oh, what Roosevelt was saying

47:33.820 --> 47:43.340
is the fear is actually our enemy. If we have confidence, we can restore American capitalism.

47:43.340 --> 47:49.500
At that point, 30% of the people in this country believe that capitalism had failed and that the

47:49.500 --> 47:55.260
answer was communism. And 30% believe that capitalism had failed and that the answer was fascism.

47:56.380 --> 48:01.660
And there was a small minority who still believed, you know, in democracy and free market capitalism.

48:02.780 --> 48:07.180
And Roosevelt, through his strength of character, through his persuasion, through his

48:07.180 --> 48:15.500
absolute indomitable calmness, was able to tell people, don't be scared, the fear is your enemy

48:15.500 --> 48:20.940
because fear is going to be used by demagoguers like Father Coughlin at that time or Huey Long

48:22.060 --> 48:28.220
or these other demagoguers who were trying to, you know, drum up anger and fear. And he said,

48:28.220 --> 48:35.580
you know, that is the enemy. If we stay calm, we'll come out of this. And he was able to restore

48:35.580 --> 48:40.940
American capitalism because of that. And it's an important lesson, you know, during COVID,

48:40.940 --> 48:47.900
you had both Republican and Democratic governments that were using fear to manipulate people,

48:47.900 --> 48:54.140
to tell us, do this, do that, and not, you know, they were telling us to do things that they knew

48:54.140 --> 49:00.460
and we knew were wrong, to allow censorship of critics, to allow doctors to be silenced,

49:01.260 --> 49:05.740
allow people who said they were injured to be silenced, to ask people who were standing up

49:05.740 --> 49:10.300
for the children and saying, wait a minute, how can you keep kids out of school? They have no

49:10.300 --> 49:18.540
vulnerability to COVID. Shut them up. And to silence everybody, silence, you know, where I was,

49:18.540 --> 49:25.420
they were giving $1,000 tickets to surfers who were out on the ocean and telling them to go home

49:26.140 --> 49:31.900
or disease. And even then, we knew, did not spread outdoors, but it spread at home when you're

49:31.900 --> 49:37.900
locked up. And it was crazy what we were being told to do, but everybody was complying because

49:37.900 --> 49:44.300
they were using fear. And to me, you know, my party, the Democratic Party, I said this, you know,

49:44.300 --> 49:51.420
time and again, I said, you know, Roosevelt told us, don't use fear. And yet, the entire government

49:51.420 --> 49:55.740
strategy at that time was just to scare the hell out of everybody. You remember, they had the COVID

49:55.740 --> 50:01.580
death count every day on CNN, ticking like a time bomb that it was going to come and get you. And

50:01.580 --> 50:08.140
everybody was put in this state of, you know, your neighbor is a biohazard. Don't go near them.

50:08.140 --> 50:12.860
And, you know, and we were telling our kids, putting masks on our kids and telling them not to

50:12.860 --> 50:19.900
go to, not to smile at their friends, not to hug their friends. And it was atomizing society

50:19.900 --> 50:26.860
and fragmenting it and making it, you know, and that kind of society is very easy to manipulate.

50:28.700 --> 50:38.460
You know, I'll tell you, can I do one other? There's a, there was a, another one of those

50:38.460 --> 50:45.580
alchemies, one of those buttons, is our, our tendency from all those years we spent on the

50:45.580 --> 50:52.620
Africans of Anna to follow a strong leader, a person of authority, particularly a male leader,

50:53.420 --> 50:59.020
who will tell us what to do. So there's an experiment called that, you know, the CIA

50:59.900 --> 51:08.140
financed a lot of studies during the 1950s and 1960s. And it's here to, to remind control studies,

51:08.140 --> 51:12.780
to figure out how do you manipulate individuals to become a Manchurian candidate? How do you

51:12.780 --> 51:19.260
manipulate whole societies in order to impose foreign control or totalitarian control?

51:20.620 --> 51:25.020
The names of the program, the first ones were Operation Bluebird, Operation Hearty Choke.

51:26.380 --> 51:35.020
And then the later ones were called MK, Naomi, MK Dietrich, MK Ultra. The MK stands for Mind Control.

51:35.980 --> 51:42.940
And they were financing hundreds of studies in universities around the country by usually

51:42.940 --> 51:49.100
sociologists or psychiatrists or social scientists to do different experiments with

51:49.900 --> 51:57.580
psychedelic drugs, with torture, with sensory deprivation, with, with, you know, sound deprivation

51:57.580 --> 52:09.420
for various forms of other psychiatric drugs, etc. One of those studies was a, was a guy called

52:09.420 --> 52:19.500
Stanley Milgram, who was an associate professor at Yale. And he did a study where he recruited

52:19.500 --> 52:25.660
about 60 people from all walks of life, students, professors, blacks, whites, business people.

52:26.620 --> 52:33.660
Um, every kind of American. And he would bring them in and put them in a room where they had a dial

52:33.660 --> 52:39.500
in front of them. And they were told if they turned that dial, it would give an electric pulse

52:40.620 --> 52:46.060
to a person who was tied to a chair in the adjoining room. They couldn't see that person. And that

52:46.060 --> 52:53.260
person was in fact an actor who was a confederate of Dr. Milgram's. But when they turned it up,

52:54.060 --> 53:01.340
he would scream and struggle and plead and beg and cry. So, and Dr. Milgram would say,

53:01.340 --> 53:06.460
turn it up, turn it down, turn it up, turn it down, turn it higher, turn it down, turn it higher.

53:07.420 --> 53:12.380
And people who were part of that experiment, who were this, you know, the people who were there,

53:12.380 --> 53:18.620
recruits the subject, a lot of them were weeping because they did not want to do it. And yet

53:18.700 --> 53:23.820
Dr. Milgram was there in a lab coat with, you know, all of these badges on him and stuff. So,

53:23.820 --> 53:29.980
he was this visible figure of authority. Sixty, you can look this up on Wikipedia, which you

53:29.980 --> 53:38.780
should not believe for other, but I guess they're actually telling the truth. But if you, but 67%

53:39.500 --> 53:46.700
of the people in that experiment turned it up to 250 folks where it was marked

53:47.260 --> 53:56.380
potentially lethal. The good news is that 33% of the people got up and walked out.

53:57.580 --> 54:03.420
So, there's a, there's a cadre of people who maintain their capacity for critical thinking,

54:03.420 --> 54:11.980
even when all of these sort of atavistic stimuli are, are applied against them to disable that.

54:12.940 --> 54:18.860
And, you know, that I think is our aim in a democracy is to try to be part of that group of

54:18.860 --> 54:27.420
33% who can't be manipulated by fear and can't be manipulated by racism or anti-Semitism or,

54:27.420 --> 54:33.420
you know, all of these other alchemies of demagoguery or authority figures. You know,

54:33.420 --> 54:39.180
and my father told me a couple of weeks before he died, I had a conversation with him where he

54:39.180 --> 54:45.980
said to me, people in authority lie. And, you know, that is something that is critical in a

54:45.980 --> 54:51.820
democracy for the public to know our job, part of our job in democracy is to question everything.

54:52.860 --> 55:01.420
You know, this phrase, trust the experts, it's not a thing. It's a, it certainly is not a feature

55:01.420 --> 55:08.300
of democracy. It's not a feature of science. In science, you don't trust the experts. Never.

55:09.420 --> 55:15.740
You know, I've sued five, I've had, what, over 500 cases. And in each one of them,

55:15.740 --> 55:19.900
there was scientific controversy. There was experts on both sides when I sued Monsanto.

55:20.780 --> 55:29.020
Monsanto came in with experts from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. My wife, who's an actor,

55:30.220 --> 55:36.700
came to court that day on the last day in their testimony. She watched these people and then

55:36.700 --> 55:42.940
afterwards, and they were so convincing. She walked out and she said, why are you even troubling

55:42.940 --> 55:51.180
this poor company to me? I would like wait till tomorrow. The next day, we had our experts from

55:51.180 --> 55:57.820
Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, and the jury gave us $2.2 billion. They had heard both of them,

55:57.820 --> 56:02.380
and they had to decide which expert is lying. And experts have their own prejudice,

56:02.380 --> 56:08.700
they have their own biases, and their own ambitions, et cetera. And so it's not, you know,

56:08.700 --> 56:14.700
trusting the experts is not a feature of science. It's not a feature of democracy. It's a feature

56:14.700 --> 56:24.780
of religion and totalitarianism, but it's not something you do. Well, you know, we were all

56:24.860 --> 56:31.740
told to do it, right? Again and again, trust the experts. And it's not, it's something that

56:31.740 --> 56:40.140
should settle arms off. Yeah, so I want to ask you about the way that I view what has happened

56:40.700 --> 56:50.220
during the pandemic was the biggest manipulation mindfuck that's ever I've ever seen in my life.

56:50.220 --> 56:57.580
And the 66%, that's scary when you can be manipulated like that, which means there's a

56:57.580 --> 57:03.180
lot of vulnerability out there. And so one of the things that led me into addiction was I was

57:03.180 --> 57:09.820
raped and molested as a kid. And so I view what pharma and what a lot of these agencies did was

57:09.820 --> 57:15.260
they, they raped the population. They raped the globe because rape is non consensual. It's

57:15.260 --> 57:20.780
penetration without consent. And they did it with syringes. They did it with drugs. They did

57:20.780 --> 57:26.460
it with massive manipulation and lots of money behind it. And it was just atrocious. And I feel

57:26.460 --> 57:32.060
so sad for people that aren't in the position that myself and many people here that lost their jobs

57:32.060 --> 57:38.300
that don't have a lot of financial resources and the people that ultimately whose lives were heard

57:38.300 --> 57:43.900
and destroyed the most were people that were poor. And, and then everyone else, you know,

57:43.900 --> 57:48.380
psychologically, there's so many things that happen. So if someone wants to get to get a vaccine,

57:48.940 --> 57:52.460
okay, if you want to get a vaccine, but when it's forced upon you, when you're manipulated

57:52.460 --> 57:56.140
into it, that's a whole nother level. And so I think there should be a hashtag that's something

57:56.140 --> 58:00.460
like pharma rapes or something like that. Maybe that I don't know. But there's a part of me that's

58:00.460 --> 58:05.660
like, you know, I really don't want to take the get angry and, you know, I mean, I love your

58:05.660 --> 58:11.660
approach. You're very, you're very conscientious about not wanting to, you know, continue the

58:11.660 --> 58:15.180
battles and the fighting between each other and trying to bring people together. And that's a,

58:15.740 --> 58:20.140
that's a tough rope to, to walk. I mean, do you internally, are you just

58:21.580 --> 58:26.140
pissed about this? Or you just like, you know, I just, I'm going to do what I can do. I mean,

58:26.140 --> 58:31.580
how do you, what is your emotional state as you take on battles stronger than anyone that I've

58:31.580 --> 58:36.620
seen at least in that department? I mean, this book, the real Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Big

58:36.620 --> 58:41.900
Pharma and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health, which sold over a million copies

58:41.900 --> 58:47.660
with zero features in mainstream media. You've got thousands of reviews, almost all five stars.

58:47.660 --> 58:52.060
It's all cited. It's all documented. And when I hear people say, well, he's a kook. He doesn't

58:52.060 --> 58:56.780
know what he's talking about. I mean, you put more data here, not just you, but all the top

58:56.780 --> 59:02.940
doctors that have been, you know, just treated so horribly. I mean, their careers ruined. And

59:02.940 --> 59:09.980
what do they get for it? They're just trying to help people. And so, you know, I guess my question

59:09.980 --> 59:17.020
for you is with, this is still happening. And is that, I mean, out of all the reasons that you're,

59:17.020 --> 59:21.660
you're running for president, I mean, what are the main ones? What would, what do you really hope to,

59:23.020 --> 59:31.100
to do? I mean, you know, one of the reasons that this happened, you know, one of the reasons that,

59:31.180 --> 59:37.660
that inspired me to run was I say this chronic disease epidemic in our country. And we have,

59:37.660 --> 59:48.060
when my uncle was president, 6% of Americans had chronic disease. And, and today, and then by 1986,

59:49.900 --> 01:00:00.300
11.8 had chronic disease. I 2006, 54% of kids had chronic disease. And we don't know what it is today

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:08.220
because at that point, NIH stopped publishing the data. They do not want us to see this happening.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:14.380
And to me, it's the biggest thing that's happening right now. The cost of healthcare in this country,

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:20.460
the cost of the military, you know, which was supposed to go down to 200 billion a year after

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:26.380
the wall came down 1992, we were promised a piece of it. And it's now 1.3 trillion a year.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:33.340
But the cost of healthcare is 4.3 trillion. And 93% of that is chronic disease.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:43.660
These are new diseases, mostly. So what my chronic disease, there's basically four categories. There's

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:55.580
obesity when my uncle was president. 6% of American kids were obese today, 42%. And 75% are overweight.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:03.500
They didn't, American kids did not suddenly become lazy. They're being poisoned, mass poisoned,

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:11.100
and by something. And we're all being lied to about it. And then neurological diseases,

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:19.180
all these diseases had suddenly appeared in the early 90s. ADD, ADHD, speech-related, language-related,

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:25.580
ticks, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism. None of us ever heard of these diseases when I was

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:33.580
a kid. I worked at the dead center of the battle for rights for people with intellectual disabilities.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.180
My aunt, you know, Schreiber, started Special Olympics. I was working at it as a hugger and as

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.180
a coach. When I was eight years old, I worked for 200 hours. And I was saying, go home from the

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.860
Ritz-Arden when I was in high school, because this was part of our family DNA. And I never saw a kid

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:58.860
with autism, full-blown autism. The CDC's data say that in my generation today, today, right now,

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:08.940
autism in 69-year-old men, one in 10,000. And in our children, my children's generation, one in 34.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:18.060
So what happened? Well, Congress said to EPA, what year did the autism epidemic begin?

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:23.180
EPA is a captive agency. It's captive by the oil industry, the coal industry, and the pesticide

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:28.940
industry. But it's not captive by pharma, because it doesn't regulate pharma. So they actually did

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:36.700
a real study. And they came back and said, 1989, it's a red line. That is the year the epidemic started.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:42.780
Well, a lot of other chronic disease epidemics started at that time as well.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:50.700
Allergies. I had 11 siblings, 70 cousins. I never knew anybody with a peanut allergy.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:57.580
Nobody, prior to 1989, heard of peanut allergies. And now there's EpiPens in every classroom.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:08.300
What happened? Something happened in 1989. And then eczema, nobody ever heard of eczema.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:14.380
When I was a kid, now it's everywhere. It's all these allergies. It's anaphylaxis, asthma.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:21.980
My brother had asthma. He was told by his doctor that there will never be a cure for asthma,

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:27.660
because it's so rare and nobody will ever study it. Well, today, one out of every black kids in

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:34.300
urban areas has asthma. And then the autoimmune disease, 120 autoimmune disease that we never

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:43.740
heard of, juvenile diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, all of this stuff

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:49.340
that nobody ever heard of, and suddenly it's everywhere. And why is nobody asking, where is

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:57.260
it coming from? So the pharma is, of course, making money on it. That $4.3 trillion, the 93% of that,

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:04.940
that goes for $600 EpiPens, Albuterol inhalers, any seizure medications, insulin syringes,

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:13.900
they're cashing in on it. And NIH, right now, instead of doing science and asking the one question

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:20.380
they should be asking, where is it coming from? Instead, they have changed the purpose of that

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:26.860
agency to become an incubator for new pharmaceutical drugs, which they keep half of. Of the Moderna

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:32.700
vaccine, NIH owns half that vaccine. They get half the royalties. They're making tens of billions

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:40.540
of dollars on it. And there are six individuals at NIH who have marching rights to the patent,

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:49.660
who are each collecting $150,000 a year forever from that vaccine. And so these naturally, the

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:55.660
mercantile ambitions of the individual and the agency subsumed the regulatory function of those

01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:01.980
agencies. And I'm going to end that. And I'm going to go over there during the first week.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:14.220
I'm going to go over to Bethesda, my first week in office, and I'm going to get all of the big

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:22.460
wigs from NIH together. And I'm going to say, NIH gives away $42 billion a year, and it gives

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:29.580
it to 56,000 scientists, universities all over the country. And what they're doing now is mainly

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:34.300
developing pharmaceutical drugs to treat the chronic disease epidemic. And if anybody tries to

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:43.660
study, well, where's it coming from? They get a threat from NIH. Do not study that. And NIH can

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:49.340
bankrupt their college. NIH can bankrupt any medical school in the country simply by not giving the

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:55.340
$300 billion, $300 million a year that that medical skill is getting every year from NIH to study

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:02.460
cures, cures, and treatments for chronic disease. Oh, I'm going to go down there and I'm going to

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:07.900
say we're going to give infections, disease, a break, and drug development a break. And we're

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:13.900
going to, for the next eight years, we're going to figure out where's the chronic, why are our kids,

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:21.420
the sickest kids in the world, why do we have the highest chronic disease burden of any country in

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:27.340
the world? Why do we have the highest four times highest healthcare costs in the world and the worst

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:36.700
outcomes? Why are we 79th in the world behind Mongolia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Costa Rica in healthcare?

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:47.020
Why? Why did we have the highest body count from COVID on earth? We had 16% of the COVID deaths in

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:54.060
this country. We only have 4.2% of the global population. Why? Well, CDC said part of it is just

01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:02.380
mismanagement. The other part is we have the highest chronic disease rate burden and COVID was killing

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:11.980
people with great CDC. The average American who died from COVID had 3.8 chronic diseases. So they

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:20.620
had diabetes, they had asthma, they had obesity, and one more. That's what was killing people.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:27.420
It was not COVID. COVID pushed them off the cliff, but the chronic disease got them to the top of

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:35.900
the cliff with one foot over. So I'm going to go down there and I'm going to say we're going to

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:50.060
identify. There's a famous toxicologist in New York named Phil Landrigan. I have used him on many,

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:57.980
many cases. He's a genius and he's very careful now about hanging out with me because the association

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:08.700
could hurt his reputation. But Phil Landrigan has done a series of studies to say, yeah,

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:15.180
something happened in 1989 and what could it be? We know it's not genes. Genes don't cause

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:23.980
epidemics. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So what was it?

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:30.940
What environmental toxins are there that are in the category of suspects? That became ubiquitous

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:38.220
around 1989. That affected every demographic from Cubans and Cubis game Miami to Inuit and Alaska.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:45.980
And that impact boys on neurological injuries of 4 to 1 ratio to girls. What is there that

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:54.460
could be that? And he's come on with about 13 or 14 things that it could possibly be. One of those

01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:05.340
is glyphosate from Roundup that fits that timeline perfectly. Another is atrazine, which is another

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:10.780
pesticide, which is now in 63% of the water systems in the country, neonicotoid pesticides.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:17.980
Same thing. PFOAs and PFAS is the forever chemicals that were put around that timeline

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:22.780
in all of our furniture and all of our children's pajamas. They're flame retardants.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:32.540
Wi-Fi radiation from cell phones. Ultra sound radiation. Some of these things to me are not

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:41.260
suspects, but they have to be treated as suspects so we can eliminate them. High fructose corn

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:48.780
syrup, which clearly is part of the explanation for the obesity and the diabetes epidemic.

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:56.780
So there's a small universe and we have all the data we need already to figure out who's doing it.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:02.940
And what I'll do is I'll go down there and say that's what we're going to do and we're going to

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:09.420
find out. And then the vaccine schedule, which went in 1989, we went from three vaccines to

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:17.740
72 vaccines. The three vaccines I got as a kid, my kids got 72, mandated. And the big

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:25.180
change here was 1989. So that has to be a suspect too. So it's probably all of them or a large part

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.340
of them, our kids are now swimming around in a toxic soup and they're getting all of these

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:36.540
exposures that operate along the same biological pathways and they're probably cumulative. But

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:42.460
let's find out and then let's eliminate them. And you can say to me, well, even if you find out

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.820
it's a high fructose corn syrup, by the way, if you drink Coca-Cola, you should drink Mexican Coke

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:54.860
and other stuff at the high fructose. But let's say we find out it's high fructose corn syrup.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:00.140
What can you do about it? There's million farmers who are tied in that industry. There's big industrial

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:07.020
BMS like Cargill and Un Santo and these huge players. You can never change it, but you can.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:13.020
The same way that we did with Roundup. We got Roundup taken out of all home gardening because

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:20.620
once there's a certain critical mass of science, you can get past this threshold in the courts

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:26.220
called the Dalbert Threshold where you're allowed to take that case to a jury. If there's about

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:31.340
15 studies that say the same thing, you have animal studies, bench studies, human studies,

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.780
they also at some point the judge will say, yeah, you can take this case to a jury. There's not,

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:41.660
well, I'm going to create the science. And at that point, you don't need to change your regulations

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:48.940
because the plaintiff's bar will go out there and vindicate that product and get it off the

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.180
market for that purpose. So anyway, that's the long answer to your question.

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:02.700
So I've studied marketing and promotions most of my adult life and used that for business. And

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:10.300
also now with a genius recovery, my foundation, trying to get my objective there is to change

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:15.020
the global conversation about how people view and treat addicts with compassion instead of judgment

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.100
and find the best forms of treatment that have efficacy and share it with the world. And just

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.900
earlier today we announced we have a, we're going to launch a recovery kit to help people with that.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:30.380
And so I think a lot about packaging and you've got so many studies and so much data and so much

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:39.900
research in your book, The Real Anthony Fauci that I communicated to Tony from Sky Horse

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:48.700
the publisher to create like cards and decks of all of the information in a shareable form,

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:54.220
kind of like an Eckertoll meditation deck or, you know, tarot cards. But with all of this data,

01:12:54.220 --> 01:13:00.860
so that people can take it in sound bites, because they're, I'm constantly, I don't know how all of

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:06.540
this research that you have in here exists. And Anthony Fauci is still walking around a free man.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:14.940
Like when Elon Musk said, arrest Anthony Fauci, what is going on? And I'd be curious of,

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:20.780
you know, some of these people that seem like the just ultimate James Bond villains,

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:26.540
that they just want to watch the world burn. And they, it's just crazy to me. So

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:34.300
how is someone like that who, and Bill Gates, I didn't have any idea just how behind, I mean,

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.060
I'd love for you, because here we are, a lot of people have probably no idea when they hear me,

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:42.460
Bill Gates, I met him in 2006 at All Things Digital. I used to admire him. I thought he was

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:48.620
this incredible businessman. And when you see what he's actually doing and what he's funding,

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:53.580
and there's so much of it, that it gets past the point of coincidence. I mean, this person has an

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:58.700
agenda, like what are some things I'd love for you to just rattle off some things about Bill Gates,

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.900
because you know so much about what he's doing and what he funds.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.300
Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I do do in this book, first of all, that the book's been

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:14.780
through, I think probably about 15 to 20 editions, and in the first edition, and all of them,

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.420
I've note in the beginning that says, if you find a mistake in this book, we want to hear about it.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:27.340
And we will then change it in subsequent editions. I don't want to be pushing information that is

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:33.820
wrong. Oh, you know, people accuse me, you know, including the government of passing on misinformation.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:42.700
My organization has probably the best fact-checking resources in the country. We have a team of

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:52.940
350 PhD scientists, MD physicians, who are part of our scientific advisory team, and

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:59.340
including until he died recently, Luke Montanier won the Nobel Prize for discovering the HIV virus

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:06.060
in 1983. And none of these people would be part of our team if we were promoting misinformation.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:12.140
In fact, you know, what we now know from the Twitter files is that when they were, when the

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:20.300
White House was telling Twitter to remove me and Instagram, which they did, Facebook actually

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:26.780
pushed back and said, what he's saying is actually true. It's not misinformation. And they had to

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:35.020
invent a new term called malinformation, which is information that is true, but it is nevertheless

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:43.260
inconvenient for the government. And so, you know, I invite people to find an error. There's 2,200

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:50.300
footnotes, and there's the new book that just comes out today, I think, on the Wuhan cover-up

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:58.540
as 3,300. What I never try to do is to look into Bill Gates' head, or to Anthony Fauci's head,

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.220
because I don't know what's going on there. I don't know why they made these decisions.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:09.660
I can show these patterns of behavior that were tremendously cynical and self-interested.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:15.900
And I can show that they knew or had reason to know the injuries that they were causing,

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:23.020
the faults in the science like Remdesivir, which Gates was one of the biggest owners of Gilead.

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:31.820
And we can document that Fauci knew that Remdesivir was going to kill people,

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:38.300
and that was going to kill more people than it helped. And that he changed the study, altered

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:46.700
the study outcomes three separate times to make it appear that it was effective, and then got that

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:53.420
approved as the only approved treatment for COVID. And it's probably one of the reasons we had the

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:59.100
highest death rate in this country. But I can show that again and again, but I don't look into his

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:05.100
head and say, here's what he was doing, he was thinking, because I don't know. And I only write

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:11.420
things that I can document. And so, you know, what I would urge people to do is read, you know,

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:18.300
a chapter or two and, you know, make a... I mean, yeah, read it. By the way, what we did here is we put

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:27.500
with each footnote, there's a QR code so that you can, on your phone, you can look up that study

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.820
right there while you're reading. You don't have to go someplace. I think it's the first

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:39.500
book that did that. And so, every study, all those 2,200 studies that are in there are quotes or

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:45.980
whatever. While you're reading the book, in real time, you can go to that study and look at the

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:54.220
source document. Yeah. And it is amazing. And what's even more is just how many copies of this

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:59.900
you sold, where there was so much attempts to... No PR, nothing was talking about it. And you

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.580
sold over a million copies. I think it's like a million and a half or something at this point.

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:11.020
All right. So, would you guys like to take a picture with Bobby in a little bit? Okay. We'll

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:17.820
do that quickly. So, let me ask you a couple more things. First off, I want to give you an

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:23.500
opportunity. What if I not asked you, or anything that you feel would be really useful for entrepreneurs

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:29.820
to hear? I mean, you are... You're running for president. I mean, this has got to be... You

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.980
grew up in a family, though. I mean, this has got to be one of the most stressful things,

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.420
but maybe it's just the environment you grew up in and you're built for this. I don't know.

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:47.260
I mean, I have not... I've been very... I felt very peaceful about this, what I'm doing. There's not

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:56.780
been any time weirdly since I've started... Since I launched this campaign that I've said,

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:03.580
I wish I hadn't done this or what the heck am I doing? I've had that experience with other stuff.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:13.580
There's many times when I... In rock climbing or when I do a white water... A stretch of

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:19.580
sort of airy white water, there's a lot of times where I've said, why am I doing this?

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:28.060
But I've never had one of those moments with this. And my wife is happy. And I think my kids are

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:36.220
happy and proud of me. But what I tried to do is not project about things, but just to live one day

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:44.780
at a time to do my best and then to let the outcome is in God's hands. I had... I came out of the

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:52.700
environmental movement and I saw a lot of people who were... If you're in the environmental movement,

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:59.100
every victory that you have is temporary and every defeat is permanent. You destroy

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:06.460
extinguished species, you're not getting them back. You destroy a sacred piece of land and

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:14.540
pave it over and it's never coming back. And what I watched during those years was a lot of people

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:21.100
who were advocates, who were friends of mine, who just got soul crushed because they'd give their

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:27.900
lives to preserve a creek or resource or a piece of land. They'd see it destroyed and they would

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:33.420
just withdraw and go into isolation and lose hope. And I just said, I'm not going to ever let that

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:41.180
happen to me. I'm going to. I don't have any control over what happens ultimately. That is in God's

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:46.700
hands. The only thing I control is this little piece of real estate inside my own shoes.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:53.580
That's the only thing I can control. And I can get up every day and say, reporting for duty, sir,

01:20:54.300 --> 01:21:01.740
and then go forward and try to keep doing the next right thing, to make my bed, to put the water

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:07.180
in the ice tray before I put it in the freezer, to put the shopping cart back where the shopping

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:12.940
cart is supposed to go, to do the... Are you going out shopping right now? One at a time.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:22.860
There's just a secret. And as long as I do that, I can be peaceful. And it makes... To me,

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:28.700
it gives me power because it makes me... Because I feel like I cannot be defeated. And no matter

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:34.460
what kind of blow that I get dealt, I'm going to get up again. And I'm going to fight because

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:41.260
I've detached from the outcomes. I don't have expectations. I try not to, so I'll never have

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:48.220
disappointments. And that, I think, it makes me a much more effective advocate for people.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:54.300
I mean, you put out a video on Thanksgiving about gratitude that I thought was just absolutely

01:21:54.300 --> 01:22:01.580
incredible. And I never really studied or followed politics that much. I would talk to my friends that

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.140
did prior to the pandemic happening. And then I really started... It was a giant wake-up call of,

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:11.740
wow, who's really running things? I have no idea who's actually running the country right now.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:18.620
Certainly is not Joe Biden. But if not that this would ever happen, but if it did, if Joe Biden or

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:23.980
Donald Trump came to you and asked you for advice, what would you tell them? I would give them advice.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:36.220
I'd say you should get out of this race. That's a great soundbite right there. That's really good.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:44.540
Wow. So, you know, with all our flaws and the flaws of our founding fathers, I still believe

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:50.380
the great American experiment is worth fighting for. And you've, you're taking on one hell of a

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:58.780
battle here. And what sort of helper support do you need the most right now? Well, I mean, the

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:05.020
biggest, the most support we need right now is financial support. I have to get on that because

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:11.180
I'm not running at a political party. I have to get on the ballot in all 50 states. And that means

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:17.420
a million signatures, different configurations of signatures. On average, it's going to cost us

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:23.820
about $14 or $15 of signatures. So I need to raise $15 million. And you can do that

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:32.220
from big donors. If you get one big donor and I need that, you know, they can give to the super

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:38.300
pack, but the campaign itself has to do the ballot access. And so the top donation, the maximum

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:47.740
donation under federal law is $6,600. And they, and, you know, I need to raise in $6,600 increments,

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:52.780
I need to raise $15 million to do that. And then, you know, people who will volunteer,

01:23:54.620 --> 01:24:00.700
go to kennedy24.com. And, you know, if you have anything, if you have resources, intellectual

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:07.340
resources, advice, whatever, I'd love to hear from you. But mainly right now, I need to,

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:13.820
I need to raise money for our ballot fight. Okay. Okay. I was having lunch with today,

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:22.540
with some of the group, and a woman had said to me about protection and why have you not been

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:28.060
granted security protection by the president? And this was put in place because your father was

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:34.220
assassinated, and you still have not gotten it, is what need, and she had mentioned, what can we

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:40.140
do to help with that? Who do you send an email to? What do you do to get you protection? Because

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:44.460
you're paying for your own security right now? Yeah, I mean, they used to, people can send,

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:52.380
you know, an email to the White House. You know what, as you said, the candidates,

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:58.300
I mean, historically, the candidates did not get secret service protection until they were,

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:06.700
until after the conventions. And then, when my dad was killed in 68, I was with him at that time,

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:11.980
they immediately provided secret service protection to all the other candidates, to George McGovern,

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:17.500
George Wallace, Hubert Humphrey, and Zeta, who were running at the same time. And then Congress

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:24.460
passed a law that said that every candidate, as long as they're there, they exceed a certain metric,

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:33.660
which I've exceeded for six months, is entitled to secret service protection 120 days

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:41.580
prior to the general election. But in practice, the president can provide it to anybody

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:46.780
on request. And I'm the first candidate in history who has requested it and not been provided. I've

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:55.660
had a number of credible death threats, including three break-ins at my house and, you know, a guy

01:25:55.660 --> 01:26:03.420
who showed up trying to get to me in the green room prior to his speech in Los Angeles, who I,

01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:10.860
you know, I have a security team that spotted him because he had fake U.S. Marshall badges,

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:17.340
a badge, he had fake Federal ID, and then he was carrying a lot of concealed weapons. He had two

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:22.540
shoulder holsters with full magazines, and then he had a lot of weapons in a backpack, including

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:31.420
laser scope, pistol, with full magazines, a lot of action magazines, guns and stuff.

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:37.660
My team detained him, held him for the police, he was trying to find me,

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:46.300
and the police then arrested him. He said that he wanted to find me for a job interview,

01:26:47.180 --> 01:27:01.500
which, yeah, so then, but my uncle, Ted Kennedy, when he ran in 1980, he was given secret service

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:08.300
protection by President Carter, and they didn't like each other. They really had a lot of personal

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:15.260
antipathy toward each other, but my Carter gave him secret service protection 450 days out, and

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:25.020
Obama received it 450 days out. I think 30, maybe over 30 candidates have received it

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:32.380
before the 120 days. Jesse Jackson, Mitt Romney, almost anybody that you can name received it

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:37.340
early, so it's standard to provide it early, but I think they know that I have to, you know,

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:45.180
one out of every $3 that I raise is going to my security team, so I think the White House is playing

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:56.220
hardball and has decided that they're going to try to hurt me financially, which is not really

01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:04.460
in the spirit of democracy, because when my father became Attorney General in 1961,

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:10.940
the first day at work, he called all of the upper staff of the Justice Department, and he said to

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:18.620
them, we have one rule. We're never going to politicize this agency. Whether you're a Republican

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.580
or Democrat, you're treated equally under the law, and I don't want to hear any even rumors

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:32.220
that people are giving favoritism to somebody who's Democrat. And that, you know, people believe in

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.900
the institutions of our country, because we've consistently had leaders who have respected that.

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:44.780
And in the last couple of years, we've seen this erosion, or a lot of the federal enforcement

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:52.540
agencies are being politicized. And I would say, you know, that it, you know, politicizing the

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:57.660
Secret Service is just, is not a good look. We're supposed to be the exemplary democracy in the

01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:03.420
world, and to say that if people, if you don't like somebody's politics, if they're a political

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:09.580
threat, you're not going to give them protection is not, you know, it's just not good for our democracy.

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:18.380
Yeah, okay. What, what is the most significant or impactful life decision you think you've ever made?

01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:26.540
Oh, I mean, you know, I'd have a hard time with that. I mean, my marriage is, is one.

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:34.460
My, I wouldn't say that I decided to have kids because it just happens, you know.

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:43.900
But I mean, this is one, you know, running is definitely running in this race is definitely

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:51.580
life changing. And how do you handle the criticism and the attacks on you? How do you process that?

01:29:51.580 --> 01:30:01.820
You know, I, I process it by just because I, I was raised in a milieu where we all believe that we

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:07.580
would, you know, that our lives would somehow be consumed in some great controversy. And that

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:14.780
it would be a privilege for us if we were to be able to take a an important part in that. And,

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:20.700
you know, I've, I think I understood from when I was a kid that if you're going to do anything

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:26.380
important with your life, that people are going to attack you and that you're going to get criticism,

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.540
you're going to lose friends, you're going to lose relationships that there's going to be,

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:37.500
you know, there's going to be a hero's journey where you go through these tremendous hardships

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:43.660
where you go through the valley of death, you feel you're completely alone at some points. And that,

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:49.580
that, that's just, that's part of, if you didn't go through that, it would not be very important.

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:59.740
So I feel like, you know, whatever I go through is, is, is a privilege to be able to, you know,

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:04.300
to do something that's important. And it's just part of it. And then I also,

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:13.820
you know, I feel tremendously loved by, by my wife and by my children and by other my friends who

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:18.940
are important to me. And I feel like, you know, everybody else is kind of playing, we're all

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:24.540
walking through kind of a dream, right? And that, you know, life is a dream and that we have to treat

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:31.180
it like that. We have to treat it. We have to ultimately be indifferent to some of the,

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:39.660
to some of the defeats that we, that we suffer, some of the criticism, the injuries,

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:45.900
the wounds that we suffer. We have to get to a place where we're indifferent about it. There's a

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:55.260
famous, I don't know how famous it is, but it's a, it's a story about a monk who was, who, who's,

01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:03.660
whose monastery was invaded by a warlord in China. All the other monks fled and that the warlord

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.060
approached this monk who was meditating and tried to talk to him and he ignored the warlord.

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:14.860
And finally, warlord gets irritated and he says to the monk, he says, don't you know that I could

01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:21.420
run you through with my sword without blinking an eye? And the monk says to him, don't you know

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:27.500
that I could be run through with your sword without blinking an eye? And ultimately, that's kind of

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:33.180
the objective where we all want to be spiritually, where we're indifferent to the personal consequences

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:39.980
of everything that we do and that we live our lives for higher purposes. And, you know, the,

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:47.900
in the Buddhist tradition, the word nirvana means I'm putting out a fire and that means the fire

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:56.380
of ambition, of pride, of, of anger, of a desire. And all of these things that we're supposed to

01:32:56.380 --> 01:33:02.620
view as just clouds that pass over us and that we take an interest in them, but ultimately are,

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:08.860
you know, indifferent and we all go through, you know, difficulties in our lives and we have to be

01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:15.420
able to weather those difficulties without being crushed in our soul or without being ultimately

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:22.060
affected by it and just focus on what we do, you know, and what the choices that we actually get

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:36.780
to make. That's ultimately the only thing that's important. Thank you. We've got another evening

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:44.700
session, but thank you. Thank you very much. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., everyone, and thank you all very

01:33:44.700 --> 01:34:00.140
much. Here's his book. Oh, picture over here. Let's do a picture. We'll do this with the book.

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:03.260
Thank you.
