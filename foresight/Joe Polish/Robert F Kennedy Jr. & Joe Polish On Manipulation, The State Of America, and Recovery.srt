1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
I don't have any control over what happens ultimately, you know, that isn't God's hands.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,800
The only thing I control is this little piece of real estate inside my own shoes.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,280
There's a couple of things that every demagogue can use to manipulate people, and one of those

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,440
is fear, because it disables our capacity for critical thinking.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,320
There's a 2013 poll that showed that 85% of Americans under 35% said they were proud of

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,560
the United States of America.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,240
The same poll taken last month showed only 18%.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,600
My initial bias about psychedelic drugs is, again, colored by my experience of being in

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
recovery for 40 years.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,200
I would tell myself at 9 o'clock in the morning, I am never going to do that again, and at

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,480
4 o'clock in the afternoon, I'd be telling exactly what I said, and, you know, it was

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,480
like somebody else had stepped into my body and was now, you know, a new driver in the

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
truck.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,760
Through a free market, you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
without enriching your community.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,960
You show me a polluter, or I'll show you a fat cat using political clout to escape the

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,920
discipline of the free market and force the public base production costs.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,120
We have to be able to weather those difficulties without being crushed in our soul or without

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,560
being ultimately affected by it, and that's kind of the objective where we all want to

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,320
be spiritually, where we're indifferent to the personal consequences of everything that

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,280
we do, and that we live our lives for all higher purposes.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,480
The vast majority of people in the audience are entrepreneurs, capitalists, love to get

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,520
your views on the environment and capitalism, because that's a topic that there's a lot

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,360
of debate on.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,640
First of all, thank you so much for having me, and thanks for the reception.

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,960
I've been working as an environmental advocate and attorney for 40 years for my entire career,

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,280
but I started out as an attorney for commercial fishmen on the Hudson River, and we built

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,280
that organization.

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,160
They launched a patrol boat, they began, these were people who were capitalists.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,080
They were small business people, and they saw their livelihoods being destroyed by pollution

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,600
on the river, and these were people who, the Hudson River commercial fishery is the oldest

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,400
in North America, it's 350 years old.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Many of the people I represent came from families that have been fishing the river continuously

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,240
since Dutch colonial times, it's a traditional gear of fishery they use.

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,240
The same fishing methods that were taught by the Algonquin Indians to the original Dutch

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,400
settlers of New Amsterdam and then passed down through the generations, and there was

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,880
nothing wrong with their business model, but the general electric company used political

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,880
clout in Albany to get permission to illegally dump PCBs into the river, rather than properly

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,420
disposing them, and it saved them money, it allowed them to out-compete the other producers

40
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:20,660
of capacitators and to win in the marketplace, but they had distorted the market signals

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,340
by cheating the market, and these fishermen knew that their problem was not their business

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:35,580
model, it was that we didn't have free market capitalism on the river, we had a kind of

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,700
corporate crony capitalism that was allowing polluters to use political clout to escape

44
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,180
the discipline of the free market.

45
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,300
One of the things I learned very early on was that we don't have to choose between good

46
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,420
environmental policy and good economic policy, in 100% of the cases, good economic policy

47
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,020
is identical to good environmental policy.

48
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,220
If we want to measure the economy, and this is how we ought to be measuring it, based

49
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,180
upon how it produces jobs and the dignity of jobs over the generations and how it preserves

50
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,260
the value of the assets of our community, if on the other hand we want to do what the

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,100
big polluters often want us to do, which is to treat the planet as if it were business

52
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,940
and liquidation, convert our natural resources to cash as quickly as possible, have a few

53
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,100
years of pollution-based prosperity, we can generate an instantaneous cash flow and the

54
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,020
illusion of a prosperous economy, but our children are going to pay for our joyride,

55
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,220
and they're going to pay for it with denuded landscapes, poor health, huge cleanup costs

56
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,700
that are going to amplify over time and they'll never be able to pay, and environmental injury

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:58,180
is deficit spending, it's a way of loading the cost of our generation's prosperity onto

58
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,300
the backs of our children.

59
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,020
My approach has always been colored by my experience, I worked for 40 years for the

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,660
commercial fishermen and I really kind of colored my worldview about the environment,

61
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,660
and if you can go back 35 or 40 years ago and look at speeches that I was giving back

62
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,540
then where people would ask me, what's the most important solution, most effective solution

63
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,700
to environmental pollution, and I always said the same thing, it's a free market, true

64
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:41,220
free market capitalism, because a free market, a true free market, promotes efficiency, and

65
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,620
efficiency means the elimination of waste, and pollution is waste, and a true free market

66
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,820
would require us to properly value our natural resources, and it's the undervaluation of

67
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:00,380
those resources that cause us to use them wastefully or recklessly, and a true free

68
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,140
market you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich, and without enriching

69
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,060
your community.

70
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,900
What polluters do is they make themselves rich by making everybody else poor, they raise

71
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,460
standards of living for themselves by lowering quality of life for the rest of us, and they

72
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,340
do that by escaping the discipline of the free market.

73
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,660
You show me a polluter, I'll show you a subsidy, I'll show you a fat cat using political clout

74
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,860
to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay its production

75
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,460
costs, and what I did as an environmental advocate, I really always considered myself

76
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:47,300
a free marketer, and I was going out into the marketplace to catch the cheaters and

77
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,860
to bring them to court and say to them, we're going to force you to internalize your costs

78
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,140
the same way that you internalize your profits, because as long as somebody can externalize

79
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,620
those costs, it distorts the marketplace, and none of us gets the advantages of the

80
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,380
efficiency, the prosperity, and the democracy that true free market capitalism offers our

81
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,380
country.

82
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay, great, thank you.

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,860
Let me ask my team, make sure we put a timer up here so we know the time if we could, because

84
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,900
it's not on, thank you.

85
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,820
So I asked the audience to submit some questions, and I can't ask all of them, but one of them

86
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,620
was about psychedelics, and let me preface this by saying, you know that I've been in

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,740
recovery, you've been in recovery for 40 years, and I'm the first person in the world to have

88
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,940
before and after brain scans doing ibogaine and 5MEO-DMT, which I did in 2015 in Mexico,

89
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,780
and we took a film crew, and we filmed it, and then we did interviews with the doctor

90
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,100
that did the before and after brain scans and whatnot, and I've seen miraculous things

91
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,180
happen, but I'm also worried about the pharmaceutical industries like they're doing with everything,

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,260
co-opping it.

93
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,620
So what are your thoughts on psychedelics, because my viewpoint on it is in the field

94
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,300
of recovery, depression, mental illness, things like that.

95
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,860
I mean, my initial bias about psychedelic drugs is, again, colored by my experience

96
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,460
of being in recovery for 40 years and having gone to, I go to like nine meetings a week,

97
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,860
so 12-step meetings.

98
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,180
I've heard a lot of bad stories about people, you know, involvement with drugs and alcohol

99
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,380
and pharmaceutical drugs.

100
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:45,860
My bias is that I don't think that, in most cases, that we can fix things that are wrong

101
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,940
inside of us with things that are outside of us, with all the things that we reach for

102
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,540
when we feel discomfort, whether it's drugs or alcohol or sex or reckless behavior, where

103
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,780
particularly people who are prone to addiction are always looking for things outside of them

104
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,060
to fix, you know, to fill this empty hole that they have inside of them.

105
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:19,420
Having said that, I have seven kids and my wife in 2012 took her own life and left me

106
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,740
with six children.

107
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,820
And so all of those kids were at risk at the time and they all ended up doing really wonderful

108
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,660
things with their lives and they're in good relationships and they're, you know, outside

109
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,300
now of that, what I would call a risk level.

110
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:50,020
One of them was worrying to me because he never processed his mom's death in a way that

111
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,380
I could observe.

112
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,220
He seemed like a happy kid, he was always smiling.

113
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:04,500
He did get in a lot of fist fights and he was a, he became a boxer and he won a lot

114
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,420
of tournaments and then he became a hockey player and, but everything he did, it was

115
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,060
a little bit of violence though and it made me, it made me worried about him and he went

116
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,580
to a couple, about five years ago, he went, he was very self-contained.

117
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:33,060
We never talked about what was going on inside of him and he went to Patagonia to run a white,

118
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,460
to kayak a white water river that I kayaked for many, many years every year called the

119
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,820
Fute Le Faux and he went down there to do it with a friend and he had a five day wait

120
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:54,180
between the time that the, that his kayak trip was going to start and the time that

121
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,780
he arrived there and I had a friend who, oh, I knew a little bit of, just on a quaintance

122
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:07,740
down there who I, who had some land property down there and I asked this guy to put my son

123
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:15,180
up for a couple of days while he was waiting for his trip to start and that guy, the night

124
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:22,060
my son arrived there, he had, that guy said to him, I'm doing an ayahuasca trip tonight

125
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,540
and he said, God sent you boys to me because he was doing it with 20 poinche Indians and

126
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:36,020
he said, I was praying to God that he would send me a gringo to do this with and my, my,

127
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:44,220
my kid ended up doing this and he had this experience where after he drank the ayahuasca,

128
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,900
they gave them all a bucket and they gave him a sleeping bag and it was kind of in an

129
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:55,220
outdoor place with a fire and after he drank it, he felt himself sinking through all the

130
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,940
geological strata of the earth and he could look at all of, he told me he could look at

131
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:07,420
all the folds of stone and geology and he had a total understanding of all of the processes

132
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,900
that had laid them out for the aeons, he ended up being propelled out of the other side of

133
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,940
the earth and then floating through space for what he experienced as hundreds of years

134
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,740
and he would focus on a distant planet and be transported there and on each planet, he

135
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,620
would have an adventure at the end of the adventure, there would be a lesson, a moral

136
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,900
lesson that he would learn that he was supposed to remember. The last place, the last planet

137
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:47,100
he visited, he came into, his mother was there and she started passing through him in and

138
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,260
out of him again and again and every time she did that, he felt all these experiences

139
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:03,340
of forgiveness, of love, of understanding, of comprehension, of empathy and compassion

140
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:10,060
and when he came back from that trip, he was completely changed, he was very open about

141
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,740
talking about his feelings, he was on a real spiritual class, he was very, very openly

142
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,460
just happy all the time and he, the reason I really know that it changed him is he started

143
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:32,460
taking out the garbage and doing the dishes and he's done the dishes constantly without

144
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:41,580
ever being asked since then. He's a 24 year old kid, so you know that's a miracle. So

145
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:49,180
I had that open my mind to the possibility that there may be something that I didn't

146
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,860
understand or that was outside of my kind of bubble of prejudices and then I have a

147
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,500
friend who's an ABCL who had a severe PTSD and he went to Costa Rica and had the same

148
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,940
kind of experience and I had a couple of other friends who are in the NFL and they also had

149
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:16,140
severe brain injuries and depression, terrible, terrible depression and the same thing happened

150
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:23,420
and then I looked at Michael Pollan's documentary which I think is on Netflix and there's one

151
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,740
particularly poignant story, he goes through each of the psychedelics, a show for each one

152
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,740
and I think the third show is on the psilocybin and there's a kid on that show who had severe

153
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:45,660
OCD, he could not, he literally could not go out of his house. He had to do all of these rituals,

154
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,700
all the, he had to constantly clean his hands, he had to walk through the door 10 times or 20

155
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:57,180
times or 60 times and he had to do all these very repetitive rituals and it absolutely paralyzed him

156
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,140
and destroyed his life and he did one psilocybin trip and it was completely gone.

157
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,980
So, you know, my mind is open to the idea that, you know, there may be things that I don't know

158
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,140
about and that people ought to have the freedom and the liberty to experiment with these things.

159
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:25,020
I likely use said at the outset which is, you know, we know the capacity of the pharmaceutical

160
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,980
industry to come and capture this if they see that there's money in it and then to turn it

161
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,500
into something very, very bad and to promote it in ways that it shouldn't be promoted.

162
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,700
So, you know, my inclination and I haven't thought this through that much but my inclination would be

163
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:52,940
to make this available at least in therapeutic settings and maybe more generally but in ways

164
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,700
that would discourage the corporate control exploitation of it.

165
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,420
Yeah, absolutely. No, absolutely. And I mean,

166
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:14,940
we could, you know, I believe that addiction is a solution to pain and addiction works if you're

167
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,660
lonely, depressed, anxiety-ridden in the moment but the problem is it has this thing called

168
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:27,340
consequences that can destroy your life and make your life not work and I think we live in a culture

169
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,220
that we have the largest addiction crisis in human history right now. There's a lot of temptation,

170
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,860
there's a lot of pain, there's a lot of trauma. I think the last three to four years of the pandemic

171
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,340
has created more angst, more pain, more trauma that will last literally generations and I think

172
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,300
millions of lives have been destroyed as a result of it and one of the coping mechanisms

173
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,860
is addiction and I think anything that could help with that and I think psychedelics are one part

174
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:08,780
of that is beneficial. If you become president, what could you do or will you do to fix this issue?

175
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,820
Yeah, I mean, part of the, you know, addiction, like you say, it's a response to internal pain,

176
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:22,540
it's also a response to adamantization, to loneliness, a disconnection to disaffection

177
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,020
and, you know, and we're seeing that's now epidemic in this country where so many of us feel

178
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,940
that we're no longer connected to a community. It was a poll recently that showed that,

179
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:47,980
there's a 2013 poll that showed that when asked, 80, 85 percent of kids of Americans under 35

180
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,500
said they were proud of the United States of America. The same poll taken last month showed

181
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:01,340
only 18 percent. So they've lost faith in our country, they've lost hope for their own future,

182
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,980
they've lost a connection to community and now, you know, we're seeing the biggest cause of suicide

183
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:17,180
among Black youth today, I mean, of death among Black youth is suicide. We lost 106,000 kids last

184
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:24,860
year to fentanyl overdose or to other opioid overdoses. That's double the number of kids that

185
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:34,860
we lost in the 20 year Vietnam War. We're really in a crisis now. One of my program, my kind of

186
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:42,780
moonshot program or Peace Corps program to use metaphors from my uncle's administration will be

187
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:53,900
to start, to launch a string of healing centers around this country, particularly in rural areas

188
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,500
where people will go there and do regenerative farming, regenerative agriculture, grow good food,

189
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,500
healthy food and learn to live in communities again without screens, without cell phones.

190
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:14,860
And I've looked at these places for 40 years. The rehab industry in this country is,

191
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,060
I would say, somewhat predatory at this point, like many, many other industries, but

192
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:30,860
I had a relative who was in a lot of trouble and I started looking all over the world for places that

193
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,340
had a different model. And I found this place in Italy in Tuscany called San Padre Nano and it's a

194
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:45,740
500 acre farm. There's 2,000 kids who live there. It's absolutely free. The only thing they ask you

195
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:56,220
to commit to is to stay there for 5 years. 5 years? Listen, if it's a choice, a lot of kids today

196
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:04,220
are honest, they're actually going to die. And 5 years is like college. And if you can save somebody's

197
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,580
life, it takes time because you have to re-parent the person. You have to reorient them to live in a

198
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:19,020
completely different way. And they're taking people who are criminals, who are not only drug addicts,

199
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,900
but people who are headed for prison, headed for something very bad. They take them and they

200
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:34,460
transform them into good citizens. At that place, they have, it's completely self-supporting.

201
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:43,580
In Italy, you can do a check-off on your taxes to send $1, by approximately $1 on your taxes.

202
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,820
There's a little check-off to San Padre Nano. Most of their money comes from their industries,

203
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,180
so they have one of the best bakeries in Europe and they teach kids traditional baking skills.

204
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:07,820
They have an apparel center where they do weaving and they make accessories, fashion accessories,

205
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,420
so they make purses for De La Valle, for Prada, for Gucci, for these other big brands.

206
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,980
They have a vineyard, 500 acre vineyard, and they make some of the finest wine in Europe.

207
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:30,300
They have kennels and they have a wallpaper factory that makes this hand-painted wallpaper,

208
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,260
very, very traditional with traditional artisans. There's no cell phones allowed,

209
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,540
there's no screens, and the people live together in very, very tight kind of barracks. There's

210
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:49,420
six girls and my relative was a girl and she was put in with six girls who watched her every

211
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,940
move and if she did something selfish, if she did something dishonest, she was called on it,

212
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,180
and it taught her a new way of living in a community and when she came out,

213
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,740
she became very, very successful and not only in her business life but also her social life.

214
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:18,940
She was utterly transformed. Two days ago, I went to a place in Salt Lake City called the other side

215
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:26,220
that is modeled on San Pajagnano and they have now three city blocks full of buildings.

216
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:34,060
They have 300 convicts. They take people out of prison or they take people who are facing long

217
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,540
sentences and they interview them to see if they're suitable for the program. They bring them into

218
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,820
that program and they rehabilitate them and they have to make a two-year commitment.

219
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:54,140
It's absolutely free. Anybody can walk in the street and take advantage of it. They have the

220
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,860
biggest moving company in Salt Lake. They have the biggest storage company in Salt Lake.

221
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:09,820
They have a thrift store that is the size of two Walmart's. They have a construction firm

222
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:16,540
that is very, very successful and they teach the inmates how to be electricians, how to be

223
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:23,660
plumbers, all of these skills that they can use in the world. The guy who started it

224
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,420
was facing his fifth term in prison. He was facing a 29-year prison sentence

225
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,460
and he persuaded the judge to allow him to go to Delancey Street, which is a

226
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,060
therapeutic community in San Francisco. He ended up working there for eight years and then

227
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:50,780
coming out and starting this place. It was so inspiring going to this place and to the other

228
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,020
side and seeing what they'd done because it's a model that can be reproduced elsewhere.

229
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:05,100
I was in prison for the summer of 2001. I won a lawsuit against the Navy

230
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,780
in Puerto Rico for bombing the island of Viegas.

231
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,020
I did it. The judge, there was a corrupt judge who would not enforce my injunction.

232
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,540
The group, I was representing 10,000 people on the island and they asked me to do a civil

233
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:29,020
disobedience to go onto the live fire zone while the Navy was bombing and I was arrested.

234
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,820
They told me, I said, how long am I going to be in jail? They said, well, just probably a day,

235
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:41,180
but I ended up being the whole summer in maximum security prison. I had my son,

236
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,820
my youngest son, was born while I was in prison. The first time I saw him was on visitor's day.

237
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,420
In that prison, which is a federal prison, a much better than state prison,

238
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,740
there was no, I couldn't even go to an AA meeting. There was no opportunities for any of the people

239
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,860
who were living there to make their lives better and we need to do that better. We need to make

240
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,460
sure when people come out of prison, they're actually productive. The guy who was running

241
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:16,780
had to made that when he first started trying to place the convicts and businesses in Salt Lake

242
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:24,620
that nobody wanted them because they're ex-cons. Now they have such a good work record and such a

243
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:31,980
good reputation that he is a list of hundreds and hundreds of businesses on the wall who,

244
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,740
and they employ 100% of the people who leave and everybody in Salt Lake wants people from this

245
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,380
program because they're such responsible workers. Oh, it was inspiring to me to see that, you know,

246
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,700
the transfer of what I saw and said, Patrick, I don't know what happened in this country.

247
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:59,020
In A, the biggest industry in rural areas in our country are prisons. I want to change that and make

248
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:06,540
rehab and restoration of the feeling of community in this country, the skills of living in a community

249
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:12,220
to re-parent all of these kids who are lost today, an entire generation of kids who are lost,

250
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,540
give them the opportunity to go to places where they can learn to be productive members of society

251
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,180
and where they can get inspired again about their lives and regain hope in their lives.

252
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,620
I love that. I love that. It's great.

253
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,820
So you probably met him backstage. I don't know if he's out here, but we have Andre Norman who's

254
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,260
here who spent 14 years in maximum security prison and he became the number three gang leader.

255
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,660
He spent two years in solitary confinement and now this guy's like an absolute angel and just

256
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:52,060
helped so many people and he's in charge of a program which currently has 600,000 tablets in

257
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,340
prisons in the United States soon to be a million and we have genius network content. We have genius

258
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,820
recovery content from my foundation on those tablets. 25% of the world's prisoners are in the

259
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,700
United States who are the highest incarcerating country in the world. I believe it's between 80 to

260
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,140
90% of everyone that's arrested or thrown in jail or prison. Drugs and alcohol were involved.

261
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,140
40% of people that are incarcerated committed a violent crime, so that's a separate issue,

262
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:27,420
but 60% had not. So we are incarcerating a lot of addicts and when someone goes through recovery,

263
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:34,060
as you know, you can take people that were really lying, cheating, stealing, doing bad things and

264
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,380
they become these incredible, compassionate, caring humans and so I think there's something

265
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:44,220
to the whole process of healing and creating that environment. So yeah, I mean, we'll talk more

266
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,700
about that. So let me, I have some questions about tyranny and all that, but before we get to it,

267
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,820
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, what are your thoughts on digital currency?

268
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:02,700
Yeah, I mean, I became a converter. I really didn't know anything about cryptocurrency. My kids all

269
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,940
know are entrepreneurial and are interested in business and they're all in that space. So they

270
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,980
were, you know, they had bought and sold cryptocurrencies and talked a lot about it,

271
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,540
but I was really just on the sideline listening to them. And then I saw what happened during the

272
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:29,180
pandemic, what happened in Toronto or in Ottawa to the strikers. Oh, Children's Health Defense,

273
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:38,220
which was the organization that I ran, started and ran, had embedded in the trucker's convoy

274
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,220
in Canada. We had a reporter embedded and we were helping them and we were, you know,

275
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,860
sending money and publicizing what they were doing and the truckers in Canada

276
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,740
were angry at the mandates and the truckers in Canada are very, very diverse group. A lot of them

277
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,060
are from African descent, a lot of them for Asian, Indian, Bangladesh, and then just white

278
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,740
people from all over Canada, but it's a very, very diverse group and they had started out

279
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,420
in BC and Alberta and they had then done a collective and made a bigger and bigger convoy

280
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:20,060
coming across the country. They wanted to meet with Justin Trudeau and talk to him about the

281
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:27,660
impact of the mandates on their businesses and on their lives. And Prime Minister Trudeau would

282
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:36,860
not meet with them and instead the, and it was, if you look at the videos of this protest in Ottawa,

283
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,540
it looks like wood stock. You know, they had cleanup crews that were picking up garbage,

284
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:48,940
they had crews that were passing out bottled water to people that were feeding the homeless

285
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,140
people and hungry people in Ottawa and there was a field, there was music and there was a lot of

286
00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:01,900
joy. There was nothing nasty or me and spirited about it and it was portrayed that way by the,

287
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,340
by officials, government officials and to a large extent by the mainstream media.

288
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:15,420
But what they did in Canada is they used AI, they used facial recognition systems and they,

289
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,180
and they got the identities of the people who are participating in the protest

290
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,940
and they froze their bank accounts and this was shocking to me because none of them were

291
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,380
charged with the crime. They also took $15 million that we had helped raise for them on PayPal

292
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,420
and they persuaded PayPal to shut off their money so they couldn't access it.

293
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:48,860
And it occurred to me then that, you know, I talked to one of the strikers, the truckers,

294
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:57,340
now they couldn't buy diesel for their trucks, they couldn't buy food for their kids,

295
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:04,460
they couldn't pay their mortgages. I talked to one striker who said he was facing jail time

296
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,420
because he had mandatory alimony payments to his ex-wife and he could not pay them.

297
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,380
And it occurred to me then that, you know, that transactional freedom is as important as freedom

298
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,620
of expression. If you have freedom of expression under the First Amendment, you can say anything

299
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,140
you want about your government without consequence, but if the government then can shut off your

300
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:34,380
capacity to pay your rent, to buy food, you know, put you essentially on the sidewalk and paralyze

301
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,740
you, what does it matter if you have so-called freedom of expression and they don't have to

302
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:45,180
charge you with any crime? And I had actually, I had seen this happening, what's happening in China

303
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,620
where they have what they call programmable currencies, which is, you know, in China now

304
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:59,900
they use, your face is your credit card, so their facial recognition is so ubiquitous and so refined

305
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,780
and sophisticated that when you go to a store to pay, you don't use cash, you know, in many places,

306
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,580
you don't use any credit card, you just use your face to pay and there's, you know, you have a digital

307
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,500
account and on your digital account is other information, including your medical information,

308
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:25,740
including your social credit score. Oh, if you drop below a certain credit score, your capacity

309
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:33,660
to use your accounts now ends and they, for example, they have one system where if, and I'll give

310
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,740
you an example, if there is a, if the government declared a mask day and you're walking around

311
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,340
with your mask below your nostrils and you're seeing on facial recognition system, which knows

312
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,340
everybody, you're going to now lose social credit points or if you're too close to your girlfriend

313
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:58,700
on a, you know, on a social distance, you're not even told about it. You're going to lose social

314
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,620
credit and if you drop below a certain point, at some point, your, your credit, your facial credit

315
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:11,820
card stops working except in grocery stores that are within a certain radius of your home.

316
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,820
So you can't travel, you can't buy gas for your car, you can't buy an airplane ticket,

317
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,500
you can't go to a hotel, you're essentially under house arrest. If the government has the capacity

318
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:29,900
to do that to people, then it has the capacity, I mean, a government that can silence its, its

319
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:36,380
critics as a license for any kind of atrocity. And it is the top of a very, very slippery slope

320
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:45,100
or totalitarian rule. So, you know, I was, again, I was, I was struck at that point by

321
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:52,460
how important it was that we have transactional freedom. And during that period, you may remember

322
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:57,100
this, there were a lot of people in the federal government who were saying, we got to get rid

323
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:04,140
of paper currency. And in fact, in many nations like in Africa and Australia, etc., they were

324
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:11,580
taking away ATM machines. They were doing that on the pretense that paper currency passes germs.

325
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:19,420
So we have to get rid of it. Well, if we go to total digital currency, every transaction that you

326
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:26,380
have is not, is, is visible to the government, the corporations, it's taxable, it's, you know,

327
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:34,220
it's my, it, it, it, it can be monetized for profit by somebody. And you can't, you have no secrets

328
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,020
in your life. If you, you know, if you wanted to buy cigarettes or pornography or liquor or

329
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,380
whatever you want to do, stuff that you don't want to share with the world, you know, somebody's

330
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:51,420
going to know about that. And that's a very, very dangerous thing in a democracy. And, and so, you

331
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:58,460
know, I think it's really important that we keep paper currency number one at people of access to

332
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:07,980
Bitcoin and other currencies and that, and that we look very, very warily at central bank digital

333
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,340
currencies, which are, you know, which they're putting in place right now. And that is how they

334
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,140
did it in China. They started with the central bank digital currency and then they expanded its

335
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:24,300
reach to become any instrument for social control. And to me, that's very dangerous.

336
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,900
Well, well, thank you.

337
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,820
Tell me something that nobody in the world understands about you.

338
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:47,020
I don't know about that. I, you know, as you know, one of the things they say in recovery is that

339
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:57,340
you're as sick as your secrets. And, you know, I understood when I was, when I was getting sober,

340
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,180
that I could not afford to have any secrets. That doesn't mean that you tell the world everything

341
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:10,300
about yourself. But you have to tell somebody, there has to be somebody out there who knows

342
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,420
everything. And so I think, you know, I have that I have a number of people in my life

343
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:24,300
who, who, you know, who literally know everything about me, you know, and, and so, you know, and I

344
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:31,020
think that that's important for all of us. To speak to that, I'd like to get your viewpoint on, because

345
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,140
here you are running for president of the United States. You are openly talking about addiction

346
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:42,540
recovery, which I think is awesome. You're more focused on health than anyone else I know that is,

347
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:49,420
you know, running. So you're a great role model in that arena. And you are sick as your secrets.

348
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,420
I think that is a, it's true. It's actually at one of these genius network annual events in 2015,

349
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,580
where I openly just decided I'm just going to share everything. I talked about drug addiction,

350
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,700
sex addiction, work addiction, you name it. And it was one of the most freeing things that I did,

351
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:11,980
but I also had been going to 12 steps for many years. And what's the difference between how you

352
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:19,820
basically what you share and what you don't. There's secrecy and then there's privacy.

353
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:26,700
And there are trusted people. I always caution people not to make like a Facebook confessional,

354
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,780
where you just go and share it needs to be done and we're ready to do it. So

355
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:39,260
you can't be like an idiot. Right. Right. Right. Well, and some people do, it hurts.

356
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,300
Yeah. You have to make prudent judgments. And, you know, we're not, you know,

357
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:53,100
Jesus said you have to be gentle as lamb, but clever as snakes. And you know, you need to be,

358
00:37:53,100 --> 00:38:00,700
you know, people, God gave us a brain to use it, to make good judgments with,

359
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,260
to make prudent judgments. And there's people that you tell everything to. And there's people

360
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,420
that you tell, you know, but you don't lie. Right. Well, you have a lot at risk for disclosure.

361
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,220
So when did you first start disclosing this to others? Because I think, you know, those

362
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,940
from the 12 step world always will mention that it's in the fourth step that you find

363
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,140
the cravings in the, in the, you know, we'll start to relieve when you share it with someone.

364
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:35,580
Yeah. I mean, I knew, you know, what kept me, I knew that I was an addict from when I was 15

365
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:41,020
years old. When I started, I started the year after my dad had killed, I started taking drugs.

366
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:49,820
And I progressed very, very quickly to heroin. And I was addicted for 14 years on and off. But

367
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:57,820
I always wanted to quit. Oh, I tried to earn this. I was basically, you know, I was, I was

368
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,940
living against conscious at that time. I knew that I did not want to be an addict. But, and I had

369
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:09,260
iron willpower in other parts of my life. I gave up candy for Lent when I was 13. And I didn't need

370
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:15,420
candy again till I was in college. And I gave up desserts the following year for Lent. And I never

371
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,100
had a dessert till I was in my freshman year of college when I was doing, you know, playing sports.

372
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:29,100
And, and I wanted to bulk up. And, but I felt like I could do anything with willpower. But

373
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:36,780
somehow this compulsion was utterly impervious to my willpower. And I would, you know, the most,

374
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:45,100
to me, the most demoralizing feature of addiction was my incapacity to keep contracts with myself.

375
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,540
I tell myself at nine o'clock in the morning, I am never going to do that again. And at four o'clock

376
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,820
in the afternoon, I'd be doing exactly what I said. And, you know, it was like somebody else had

377
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,740
stepped into my body and was now, you know, a new driver in the truck was now nothing to do with me.

378
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:09,260
And it was, it was baffling to me, just bewildering, why can't I control myself?

379
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:16,220
But I tried earnestly, sincerely, honestly for 14 years to stop and couldn't do it.

380
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,380
One of the things I'd never tried was 12 separate programs because of exactly what you said.

381
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,860
There was no way, given my background and my vulnerabilities, that I would step into a room

382
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:33,260
of strangers and start talking about what was happening in my life. And then, you know, I came

383
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:41,020
in in September of 1983. I was arrested. I was in the papers. So at that point, there was no

384
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,740
secret left. And I, you know, it was the best thing that happened to me because I was able, at that

385
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:52,300
point, to come in and, you know, take advantage of this program. But I knew from the beginning,

386
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,820
that, you know, if you're an addict, you are dishonest. You're going, you have to lie. You

387
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:04,700
can't, you know, you can't, you cannot, I don't think, I think it's impossible to be a drug addict

388
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:16,380
and not lie. And so, and I knew that dishonesty was associated with my addiction and that if I

389
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:24,380
did not become rigorously honest in every aspect of my life, that I was, I was going to fall back

390
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,140
in the addiction. And so, you know, I, I put a lot of effort into that. And it was, you know,

391
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:38,940
it was difficult. I remember one time I was in court. And, you know what, it's strange when

392
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:45,340
you're, when you, when you get, I wouldn't say I was a pathological liar, but I was habitual,

393
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:51,740
you know. And if you ask me, where did I get this shirt? I would not, the first,

394
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,260
the first thought in my head would not be, where did I get this shirt? It would be,

395
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:05,180
what can I say to put myself at some advantage in this relationship? I wasn't thinking, you know,

396
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:11,820
of the truth. And I had to break myself of those habits by when I caught myself saying something

397
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,540
dishonest to tell people right then, what I said to you just now is not per truth. And the pain

398
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,340
of doing that a couple of times was what, you know, allowed me to move. I remember reading very,

399
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:36,140
very early on about an obituary at C. S. Lewis, who was a great theologian who wrote the Narnia books

400
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:41,900
and, you know, and a brilliant novelist. But he wrote this obituary about a friend of his

401
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:49,820
where he described his friend as honest as the daylight. And I read that phrase and I was like,

402
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:58,940
wow, I wish, I wish that someday somebody would say that about me. And around that time, I was in

403
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:07,100
court, I was arguing in front of a federal judge in white planes. And he asked me a question,

404
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:13,740
I said something that was not true. And then I sat down and my opponent got up and it was something

405
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,780
that I could have never gotten exposed on or caught. It was only slightly an exaggeration.

406
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:26,620
But I sat down and it would have no consequence to me, could never have any consequence to me other

407
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:34,060
than just my conscience eating at me. And I sat down and I was like, you know, wow, that was not

408
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,940
true. The next time I got up, I said to the judge, I just want to say something what I said to you,

409
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,460
you know, was not true. And there was like this unsilenced in the courtroom, because nobody'd

410
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:54,620
ever heard a lawyer do that before. And then it just went on. And like, and but the pain of doing

411
00:43:54,620 --> 00:44:00,780
that a couple of times, you will get on as you get struck on it as quickly because it's so agonizing

412
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:09,180
to give yourself up. That got me kind of a better habit of, you know, of being on it. And right now

413
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:17,260
it's critical, you know, from my I understand it's critical for my survival. So I'm married to

414
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,060
somebody who I don't think is ever told a lot in her life, you know, and she's an example.

415
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,980
She's a role model for me, but she has no impulse to it. It's like she has

416
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:36,620
she just I've never heard her say anything even slightly self promoting or dishonest or

417
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:45,740
distorted or even exaggeration. And she still manages to be very funny and very interesting.

418
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,860
Wow, that's awesome. Thank you. So let me my friend Alex Mandozian, who's here,

419
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:59,340
he sent this over to me via text, I don't know, maybe a month ago. And it's when it's a quote from

420
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,940
Thomas Jefferson. When the people fear their government, there's tyranny. When a government

421
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:11,500
fears its people, there's liberty. What are your thoughts on that? I think, you know, there are a

422
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:18,780
couple of what I would call alchemies of demagoguery. There are there are buttons that we all have

423
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:27,100
that are that were installed in us during the 20,000 generations that human beings

424
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:35,100
were wandering the African savanna and little groups and warlike groups fighting with other

425
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,700
groups defending themselves against, you know, lions and predators and trying to feed themselves.

426
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:49,500
And and a lot of our our hard wiring was installed during that key evolutionary period.

427
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,420
And, you know, we were following a small a powerful male leader and

428
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,420
doing what we were told and you had to have a unit cohesion and you had to behave like everybody

429
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,740
else because otherwise you wouldn't we're arguing with the leader all the time.

430
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:13,660
You had to do things and we're all have that programming internally. And so there's a couple

431
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,500
of things that every demagogue can use to manipulate people. And one of those is fear.

432
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:28,540
And because it disables our capacity for critical thinking. And during the, you know,

433
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,700
actually during the Great Depression, even before the war in 1932, Franklin Roosevelt

434
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,220
gave a speech where he said to the American public, the only thing we have to fear is fear

435
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:47,180
itself is after Wall Street crash. And what he was saying then was that he saw what was happening

436
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:53,500
in Europe, which was suffering from the same depression. And in Eastern Europe, in Russia,

437
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:01,260
and the Soviet Union, oh, democracy was collapsing everywhere because of the economic pressure.

438
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,700
And you were seeing the rise of tyrants on the right and tyrants on the left. And each one was

439
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,660
using fear. And the other alchemy of demagoguery, which is racism, point to minority groups and

440
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,700
saying they, you know, they did it to you, they're dangerous to you. So these are all things that

441
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:25,580
were installed on us, you know, during that multimillion-year period. And people can come and

442
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:33,820
exploit them today and disable our capacity for critical thinking. Oh, what Roosevelt was saying

443
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:43,340
is the fear is actually our enemy. If we have confidence, we can restore American capitalism.

444
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:49,500
At that point, 30% of the people in this country believe that capitalism had failed and that the

445
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,260
answer was communism. And 30% believe that capitalism had failed and that the answer was fascism.

446
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,660
And there was a small minority who still believed, you know, in democracy and free market capitalism.

447
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,180
And Roosevelt, through his strength of character, through his persuasion, through his

448
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:15,500
absolute indomitable calmness, was able to tell people, don't be scared, the fear is your enemy

449
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,940
because fear is going to be used by demagoguers like Father Coughlin at that time or Huey Long

450
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:28,220
or these other demagoguers who were trying to, you know, drum up anger and fear. And he said,

451
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:35,580
you know, that is the enemy. If we stay calm, we'll come out of this. And he was able to restore

452
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,940
American capitalism because of that. And it's an important lesson, you know, during COVID,

453
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:47,900
you had both Republican and Democratic governments that were using fear to manipulate people,

454
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:54,140
to tell us, do this, do that, and not, you know, they were telling us to do things that they knew

455
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:00,460
and we knew were wrong, to allow censorship of critics, to allow doctors to be silenced,

456
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,740
allow people who said they were injured to be silenced, to ask people who were standing up

457
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,300
for the children and saying, wait a minute, how can you keep kids out of school? They have no

458
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:18,540
vulnerability to COVID. Shut them up. And to silence everybody, silence, you know, where I was,

459
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:25,420
they were giving $1,000 tickets to surfers who were out on the ocean and telling them to go home

460
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:31,900
or disease. And even then, we knew, did not spread outdoors, but it spread at home when you're

461
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,900
locked up. And it was crazy what we were being told to do, but everybody was complying because

462
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:44,300
they were using fear. And to me, you know, my party, the Democratic Party, I said this, you know,

463
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:51,420
time and again, I said, you know, Roosevelt told us, don't use fear. And yet, the entire government

464
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,740
strategy at that time was just to scare the hell out of everybody. You remember, they had the COVID

465
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:01,580
death count every day on CNN, ticking like a time bomb that it was going to come and get you. And

466
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:08,140
everybody was put in this state of, you know, your neighbor is a biohazard. Don't go near them.

467
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,860
And, you know, and we were telling our kids, putting masks on our kids and telling them not to

468
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:19,900
go to, not to smile at their friends, not to hug their friends. And it was atomizing society

469
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:26,860
and fragmenting it and making it, you know, and that kind of society is very easy to manipulate.

470
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:38,460
You know, I'll tell you, can I do one other? There's a, there was a, another one of those

471
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:45,580
alchemies, one of those buttons, is our, our tendency from all those years we spent on the

472
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:52,620
Africans of Anna to follow a strong leader, a person of authority, particularly a male leader,

473
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,020
who will tell us what to do. So there's an experiment called that, you know, the CIA

474
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:08,140
financed a lot of studies during the 1950s and 1960s. And it's here to, to remind control studies,

475
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,780
to figure out how do you manipulate individuals to become a Manchurian candidate? How do you

476
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:19,260
manipulate whole societies in order to impose foreign control or totalitarian control?

477
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,020
The names of the program, the first ones were Operation Bluebird, Operation Hearty Choke.

478
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:35,020
And then the later ones were called MK, Naomi, MK Dietrich, MK Ultra. The MK stands for Mind Control.

479
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:42,940
And they were financing hundreds of studies in universities around the country by usually

480
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,100
sociologists or psychiatrists or social scientists to do different experiments with

481
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:57,580
psychedelic drugs, with torture, with sensory deprivation, with, with, you know, sound deprivation

482
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:09,420
for various forms of other psychiatric drugs, etc. One of those studies was a, was a guy called

483
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:19,500
Stanley Milgram, who was an associate professor at Yale. And he did a study where he recruited

484
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:25,660
about 60 people from all walks of life, students, professors, blacks, whites, business people.

485
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:33,660
Um, every kind of American. And he would bring them in and put them in a room where they had a dial

486
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:39,500
in front of them. And they were told if they turned that dial, it would give an electric pulse

487
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:46,060
to a person who was tied to a chair in the adjoining room. They couldn't see that person. And that

488
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:53,260
person was in fact an actor who was a confederate of Dr. Milgram's. But when they turned it up,

489
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:01,340
he would scream and struggle and plead and beg and cry. So, and Dr. Milgram would say,

490
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:06,460
turn it up, turn it down, turn it up, turn it down, turn it higher, turn it down, turn it higher.

491
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:12,380
And people who were part of that experiment, who were this, you know, the people who were there,

492
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:18,620
recruits the subject, a lot of them were weeping because they did not want to do it. And yet

493
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:23,820
Dr. Milgram was there in a lab coat with, you know, all of these badges on him and stuff. So,

494
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,980
he was this visible figure of authority. Sixty, you can look this up on Wikipedia, which you

495
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:38,780
should not believe for other, but I guess they're actually telling the truth. But if you, but 67%

496
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:46,700
of the people in that experiment turned it up to 250 folks where it was marked

497
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:56,380
potentially lethal. The good news is that 33% of the people got up and walked out.

498
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:03,420
So, there's a, there's a cadre of people who maintain their capacity for critical thinking,

499
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:11,980
even when all of these sort of atavistic stimuli are, are applied against them to disable that.

500
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:18,860
And, you know, that I think is our aim in a democracy is to try to be part of that group of

501
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:27,420
33% who can't be manipulated by fear and can't be manipulated by racism or anti-Semitism or,

502
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:33,420
you know, all of these other alchemies of demagoguery or authority figures. You know,

503
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,180
and my father told me a couple of weeks before he died, I had a conversation with him where he

504
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:45,980
said to me, people in authority lie. And, you know, that is something that is critical in a

505
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:51,820
democracy for the public to know our job, part of our job in democracy is to question everything.

506
00:54:52,860 --> 00:55:01,420
You know, this phrase, trust the experts, it's not a thing. It's a, it certainly is not a feature

507
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:08,300
of democracy. It's not a feature of science. In science, you don't trust the experts. Never.

508
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,740
You know, I've sued five, I've had, what, over 500 cases. And in each one of them,

509
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,900
there was scientific controversy. There was experts on both sides when I sued Monsanto.

510
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:29,020
Monsanto came in with experts from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. My wife, who's an actor,

511
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:36,700
came to court that day on the last day in their testimony. She watched these people and then

512
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:42,940
afterwards, and they were so convincing. She walked out and she said, why are you even troubling

513
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:51,180
this poor company to me? I would like wait till tomorrow. The next day, we had our experts from

514
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:57,820
Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, and the jury gave us $2.2 billion. They had heard both of them,

515
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,380
and they had to decide which expert is lying. And experts have their own prejudice,

516
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,700
they have their own biases, and their own ambitions, et cetera. And so it's not, you know,

517
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,700
trusting the experts is not a feature of science. It's not a feature of democracy. It's a feature

518
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:24,780
of religion and totalitarianism, but it's not something you do. Well, you know, we were all

519
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:31,740
told to do it, right? Again and again, trust the experts. And it's not, it's something that

520
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:40,140
should settle arms off. Yeah, so I want to ask you about the way that I view what has happened

521
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:50,220
during the pandemic was the biggest manipulation mindfuck that's ever I've ever seen in my life.

522
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:57,580
And the 66%, that's scary when you can be manipulated like that, which means there's a

523
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:03,180
lot of vulnerability out there. And so one of the things that led me into addiction was I was

524
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:09,820
raped and molested as a kid. And so I view what pharma and what a lot of these agencies did was

525
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:15,260
they, they raped the population. They raped the globe because rape is non consensual. It's

526
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,780
penetration without consent. And they did it with syringes. They did it with drugs. They did

527
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:26,460
it with massive manipulation and lots of money behind it. And it was just atrocious. And I feel

528
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:32,060
so sad for people that aren't in the position that myself and many people here that lost their jobs

529
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:38,300
that don't have a lot of financial resources and the people that ultimately whose lives were heard

530
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,900
and destroyed the most were people that were poor. And, and then everyone else, you know,

531
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,380
psychologically, there's so many things that happen. So if someone wants to get to get a vaccine,

532
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,460
okay, if you want to get a vaccine, but when it's forced upon you, when you're manipulated

533
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,140
into it, that's a whole nother level. And so I think there should be a hashtag that's something

534
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,460
like pharma rapes or something like that. Maybe that I don't know. But there's a part of me that's

535
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,660
like, you know, I really don't want to take the get angry and, you know, I mean, I love your

536
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:11,660
approach. You're very, you're very conscientious about not wanting to, you know, continue the

537
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,180
battles and the fighting between each other and trying to bring people together. And that's a,

538
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:20,140
that's a tough rope to, to walk. I mean, do you internally, are you just

539
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,140
pissed about this? Or you just like, you know, I just, I'm going to do what I can do. I mean,

540
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:31,580
how do you, what is your emotional state as you take on battles stronger than anyone that I've

541
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:36,620
seen at least in that department? I mean, this book, the real Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Big

542
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:41,900
Pharma and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health, which sold over a million copies

543
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:47,660
with zero features in mainstream media. You've got thousands of reviews, almost all five stars.

544
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:52,060
It's all cited. It's all documented. And when I hear people say, well, he's a kook. He doesn't

545
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:56,780
know what he's talking about. I mean, you put more data here, not just you, but all the top

546
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:02,940
doctors that have been, you know, just treated so horribly. I mean, their careers ruined. And

547
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:09,980
what do they get for it? They're just trying to help people. And so, you know, I guess my question

548
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:17,020
for you is with, this is still happening. And is that, I mean, out of all the reasons that you're,

549
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,660
you're running for president, I mean, what are the main ones? What would, what do you really hope to,

550
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:31,100
to do? I mean, you know, one of the reasons that this happened, you know, one of the reasons that,

551
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:37,660
that inspired me to run was I say this chronic disease epidemic in our country. And we have,

552
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:48,060
when my uncle was president, 6% of Americans had chronic disease. And, and today, and then by 1986,

553
00:59:49,900 --> 01:00:00,300
11.8 had chronic disease. I 2006, 54% of kids had chronic disease. And we don't know what it is today

554
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:08,220
because at that point, NIH stopped publishing the data. They do not want us to see this happening.

555
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:14,380
And to me, it's the biggest thing that's happening right now. The cost of healthcare in this country,

556
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:20,460
the cost of the military, you know, which was supposed to go down to 200 billion a year after

557
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:26,380
the wall came down 1992, we were promised a piece of it. And it's now 1.3 trillion a year.

558
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:33,340
But the cost of healthcare is 4.3 trillion. And 93% of that is chronic disease.

559
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:43,660
These are new diseases, mostly. So what my chronic disease, there's basically four categories. There's

560
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:55,580
obesity when my uncle was president. 6% of American kids were obese today, 42%. And 75% are overweight.

561
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:03,500
They didn't, American kids did not suddenly become lazy. They're being poisoned, mass poisoned,

562
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:11,100
and by something. And we're all being lied to about it. And then neurological diseases,

563
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:19,180
all these diseases had suddenly appeared in the early 90s. ADD, ADHD, speech-related, language-related,

564
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:25,580
ticks, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism. None of us ever heard of these diseases when I was

565
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:33,580
a kid. I worked at the dead center of the battle for rights for people with intellectual disabilities.

566
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:39,180
My aunt, you know, Schreiber, started Special Olympics. I was working at it as a hugger and as

567
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:43,180
a coach. When I was eight years old, I worked for 200 hours. And I was saying, go home from the

568
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:48,860
Ritz-Arden when I was in high school, because this was part of our family DNA. And I never saw a kid

569
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:58,860
with autism, full-blown autism. The CDC's data say that in my generation today, today, right now,

570
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:08,940
autism in 69-year-old men, one in 10,000. And in our children, my children's generation, one in 34.

571
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:18,060
So what happened? Well, Congress said to EPA, what year did the autism epidemic begin?

572
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:23,180
EPA is a captive agency. It's captive by the oil industry, the coal industry, and the pesticide

573
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:28,940
industry. But it's not captive by pharma, because it doesn't regulate pharma. So they actually did

574
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:36,700
a real study. And they came back and said, 1989, it's a red line. That is the year the epidemic started.

575
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:42,780
Well, a lot of other chronic disease epidemics started at that time as well.

576
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:50,700
Allergies. I had 11 siblings, 70 cousins. I never knew anybody with a peanut allergy.

577
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:57,580
Nobody, prior to 1989, heard of peanut allergies. And now there's EpiPens in every classroom.

578
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:08,300
What happened? Something happened in 1989. And then eczema, nobody ever heard of eczema.

579
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:14,380
When I was a kid, now it's everywhere. It's all these allergies. It's anaphylaxis, asthma.

580
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,980
My brother had asthma. He was told by his doctor that there will never be a cure for asthma,

581
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:27,660
because it's so rare and nobody will ever study it. Well, today, one out of every black kids in

582
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:34,300
urban areas has asthma. And then the autoimmune disease, 120 autoimmune disease that we never

583
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:43,740
heard of, juvenile diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, all of this stuff

584
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:49,340
that nobody ever heard of, and suddenly it's everywhere. And why is nobody asking, where is

585
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:57,260
it coming from? So the pharma is, of course, making money on it. That $4.3 trillion, the 93% of that,

586
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:04,940
that goes for $600 EpiPens, Albuterol inhalers, any seizure medications, insulin syringes,

587
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:13,900
they're cashing in on it. And NIH, right now, instead of doing science and asking the one question

588
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:20,380
they should be asking, where is it coming from? Instead, they have changed the purpose of that

589
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:26,860
agency to become an incubator for new pharmaceutical drugs, which they keep half of. Of the Moderna

590
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:32,700
vaccine, NIH owns half that vaccine. They get half the royalties. They're making tens of billions

591
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:40,540
of dollars on it. And there are six individuals at NIH who have marching rights to the patent,

592
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:49,660
who are each collecting $150,000 a year forever from that vaccine. And so these naturally, the

593
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:55,660
mercantile ambitions of the individual and the agency subsumed the regulatory function of those

594
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:01,980
agencies. And I'm going to end that. And I'm going to go over there during the first week.

595
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:14,220
I'm going to go over to Bethesda, my first week in office, and I'm going to get all of the big

596
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:22,460
wigs from NIH together. And I'm going to say, NIH gives away $42 billion a year, and it gives

597
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:29,580
it to 56,000 scientists, universities all over the country. And what they're doing now is mainly

598
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:34,300
developing pharmaceutical drugs to treat the chronic disease epidemic. And if anybody tries to

599
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:43,660
study, well, where's it coming from? They get a threat from NIH. Do not study that. And NIH can

600
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:49,340
bankrupt their college. NIH can bankrupt any medical school in the country simply by not giving the

601
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:55,340
$300 billion, $300 million a year that that medical skill is getting every year from NIH to study

602
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:02,460
cures, cures, and treatments for chronic disease. Oh, I'm going to go down there and I'm going to

603
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,900
say we're going to give infections, disease, a break, and drug development a break. And we're

604
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:13,900
going to, for the next eight years, we're going to figure out where's the chronic, why are our kids,

605
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:21,420
the sickest kids in the world, why do we have the highest chronic disease burden of any country in

606
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:27,340
the world? Why do we have the highest four times highest healthcare costs in the world and the worst

607
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:36,700
outcomes? Why are we 79th in the world behind Mongolia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Costa Rica in healthcare?

608
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:47,020
Why? Why did we have the highest body count from COVID on earth? We had 16% of the COVID deaths in

609
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:54,060
this country. We only have 4.2% of the global population. Why? Well, CDC said part of it is just

610
01:06:54,060 --> 01:07:02,380
mismanagement. The other part is we have the highest chronic disease rate burden and COVID was killing

611
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:11,980
people with great CDC. The average American who died from COVID had 3.8 chronic diseases. So they

612
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:20,620
had diabetes, they had asthma, they had obesity, and one more. That's what was killing people.

613
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:27,420
It was not COVID. COVID pushed them off the cliff, but the chronic disease got them to the top of

614
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:35,900
the cliff with one foot over. So I'm going to go down there and I'm going to say we're going to

615
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:50,060
identify. There's a famous toxicologist in New York named Phil Landrigan. I have used him on many,

616
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:57,980
many cases. He's a genius and he's very careful now about hanging out with me because the association

617
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:08,700
could hurt his reputation. But Phil Landrigan has done a series of studies to say, yeah,

618
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:15,180
something happened in 1989 and what could it be? We know it's not genes. Genes don't cause

619
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:23,980
epidemics. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So what was it?

620
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:30,940
What environmental toxins are there that are in the category of suspects? That became ubiquitous

621
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:38,220
around 1989. That affected every demographic from Cubans and Cubis game Miami to Inuit and Alaska.

622
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:45,980
And that impact boys on neurological injuries of 4 to 1 ratio to girls. What is there that

623
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:54,460
could be that? And he's come on with about 13 or 14 things that it could possibly be. One of those

624
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:05,340
is glyphosate from Roundup that fits that timeline perfectly. Another is atrazine, which is another

625
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:10,780
pesticide, which is now in 63% of the water systems in the country, neonicotoid pesticides.

626
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:17,980
Same thing. PFOAs and PFAS is the forever chemicals that were put around that timeline

627
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:22,780
in all of our furniture and all of our children's pajamas. They're flame retardants.

628
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:32,540
Wi-Fi radiation from cell phones. Ultra sound radiation. Some of these things to me are not

629
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:41,260
suspects, but they have to be treated as suspects so we can eliminate them. High fructose corn

630
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:48,780
syrup, which clearly is part of the explanation for the obesity and the diabetes epidemic.

631
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:56,780
So there's a small universe and we have all the data we need already to figure out who's doing it.

632
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,940
And what I'll do is I'll go down there and say that's what we're going to do and we're going to

633
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:09,420
find out. And then the vaccine schedule, which went in 1989, we went from three vaccines to

634
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:17,740
72 vaccines. The three vaccines I got as a kid, my kids got 72, mandated. And the big

635
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:25,180
change here was 1989. So that has to be a suspect too. So it's probably all of them or a large part

636
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,340
of them, our kids are now swimming around in a toxic soup and they're getting all of these

637
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:36,540
exposures that operate along the same biological pathways and they're probably cumulative. But

638
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:42,460
let's find out and then let's eliminate them. And you can say to me, well, even if you find out

639
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:47,820
it's a high fructose corn syrup, by the way, if you drink Coca-Cola, you should drink Mexican Coke

640
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:54,860
and other stuff at the high fructose. But let's say we find out it's high fructose corn syrup.

641
01:10:54,860 --> 01:11:00,140
What can you do about it? There's million farmers who are tied in that industry. There's big industrial

642
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:07,020
BMS like Cargill and Un Santo and these huge players. You can never change it, but you can.

643
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:13,020
The same way that we did with Roundup. We got Roundup taken out of all home gardening because

644
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:20,620
once there's a certain critical mass of science, you can get past this threshold in the courts

645
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:26,220
called the Dalbert Threshold where you're allowed to take that case to a jury. If there's about

646
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:31,340
15 studies that say the same thing, you have animal studies, bench studies, human studies,

647
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:36,780
they also at some point the judge will say, yeah, you can take this case to a jury. There's not,

648
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:41,660
well, I'm going to create the science. And at that point, you don't need to change your regulations

649
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:48,940
because the plaintiff's bar will go out there and vindicate that product and get it off the

650
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,180
market for that purpose. So anyway, that's the long answer to your question.

651
01:11:55,420 --> 01:12:02,700
So I've studied marketing and promotions most of my adult life and used that for business. And

652
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:10,300
also now with a genius recovery, my foundation, trying to get my objective there is to change

653
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:15,020
the global conversation about how people view and treat addicts with compassion instead of judgment

654
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:19,100
and find the best forms of treatment that have efficacy and share it with the world. And just

655
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,900
earlier today we announced we have a, we're going to launch a recovery kit to help people with that.

656
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:30,380
And so I think a lot about packaging and you've got so many studies and so much data and so much

657
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:39,900
research in your book, The Real Anthony Fauci that I communicated to Tony from Sky Horse

658
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:48,700
the publisher to create like cards and decks of all of the information in a shareable form,

659
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:54,220
kind of like an Eckertoll meditation deck or, you know, tarot cards. But with all of this data,

660
01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:00,860
so that people can take it in sound bites, because they're, I'm constantly, I don't know how all of

661
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:06,540
this research that you have in here exists. And Anthony Fauci is still walking around a free man.

662
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:14,940
Like when Elon Musk said, arrest Anthony Fauci, what is going on? And I'd be curious of,

663
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:20,780
you know, some of these people that seem like the just ultimate James Bond villains,

664
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:26,540
that they just want to watch the world burn. And they, it's just crazy to me. So

665
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:34,300
how is someone like that who, and Bill Gates, I didn't have any idea just how behind, I mean,

666
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,060
I'd love for you, because here we are, a lot of people have probably no idea when they hear me,

667
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:42,460
Bill Gates, I met him in 2006 at All Things Digital. I used to admire him. I thought he was

668
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:48,620
this incredible businessman. And when you see what he's actually doing and what he's funding,

669
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:53,580
and there's so much of it, that it gets past the point of coincidence. I mean, this person has an

670
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:58,700
agenda, like what are some things I'd love for you to just rattle off some things about Bill Gates,

671
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,900
because you know so much about what he's doing and what he funds.

672
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:08,300
Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I do do in this book, first of all, that the book's been

673
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:14,780
through, I think probably about 15 to 20 editions, and in the first edition, and all of them,

674
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:21,420
I've note in the beginning that says, if you find a mistake in this book, we want to hear about it.

675
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:27,340
And we will then change it in subsequent editions. I don't want to be pushing information that is

676
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:33,820
wrong. Oh, you know, people accuse me, you know, including the government of passing on misinformation.

677
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:42,700
My organization has probably the best fact-checking resources in the country. We have a team of

678
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:52,940
350 PhD scientists, MD physicians, who are part of our scientific advisory team, and

679
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:59,340
including until he died recently, Luke Montanier won the Nobel Prize for discovering the HIV virus

680
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:06,060
in 1983. And none of these people would be part of our team if we were promoting misinformation.

681
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:12,140
In fact, you know, what we now know from the Twitter files is that when they were, when the

682
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:20,300
White House was telling Twitter to remove me and Instagram, which they did, Facebook actually

683
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:26,780
pushed back and said, what he's saying is actually true. It's not misinformation. And they had to

684
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:35,020
invent a new term called malinformation, which is information that is true, but it is nevertheless

685
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:43,260
inconvenient for the government. And so, you know, I invite people to find an error. There's 2,200

686
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:50,300
footnotes, and there's the new book that just comes out today, I think, on the Wuhan cover-up

687
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:58,540
as 3,300. What I never try to do is to look into Bill Gates' head, or to Anthony Fauci's head,

688
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:02,220
because I don't know what's going on there. I don't know why they made these decisions.

689
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:09,660
I can show these patterns of behavior that were tremendously cynical and self-interested.

690
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:15,900
And I can show that they knew or had reason to know the injuries that they were causing,

691
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:23,020
the faults in the science like Remdesivir, which Gates was one of the biggest owners of Gilead.

692
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:31,820
And we can document that Fauci knew that Remdesivir was going to kill people,

693
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:38,300
and that was going to kill more people than it helped. And that he changed the study, altered

694
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:46,700
the study outcomes three separate times to make it appear that it was effective, and then got that

695
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:53,420
approved as the only approved treatment for COVID. And it's probably one of the reasons we had the

696
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:59,100
highest death rate in this country. But I can show that again and again, but I don't look into his

697
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:05,100
head and say, here's what he was doing, he was thinking, because I don't know. And I only write

698
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:11,420
things that I can document. And so, you know, what I would urge people to do is read, you know,

699
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:18,300
a chapter or two and, you know, make a... I mean, yeah, read it. By the way, what we did here is we put

700
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:27,500
with each footnote, there's a QR code so that you can, on your phone, you can look up that study

701
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,820
right there while you're reading. You don't have to go someplace. I think it's the first

702
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:39,500
book that did that. And so, every study, all those 2,200 studies that are in there are quotes or

703
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:45,980
whatever. While you're reading the book, in real time, you can go to that study and look at the

704
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:54,220
source document. Yeah. And it is amazing. And what's even more is just how many copies of this

705
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:59,900
you sold, where there was so much attempts to... No PR, nothing was talking about it. And you

706
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,580
sold over a million copies. I think it's like a million and a half or something at this point.

707
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:11,020
All right. So, would you guys like to take a picture with Bobby in a little bit? Okay. We'll

708
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:17,820
do that quickly. So, let me ask you a couple more things. First off, I want to give you an

709
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:23,500
opportunity. What if I not asked you, or anything that you feel would be really useful for entrepreneurs

710
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:29,820
to hear? I mean, you are... You're running for president. I mean, this has got to be... You

711
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,980
grew up in a family, though. I mean, this has got to be one of the most stressful things,

712
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:37,420
but maybe it's just the environment you grew up in and you're built for this. I don't know.

713
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:47,260
I mean, I have not... I've been very... I felt very peaceful about this, what I'm doing. There's not

714
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:56,780
been any time weirdly since I've started... Since I launched this campaign that I've said,

715
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,580
I wish I hadn't done this or what the heck am I doing? I've had that experience with other stuff.

716
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:13,580
There's many times when I... In rock climbing or when I do a white water... A stretch of

717
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:19,580
sort of airy white water, there's a lot of times where I've said, why am I doing this?

718
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:28,060
But I've never had one of those moments with this. And my wife is happy. And I think my kids are

719
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:36,220
happy and proud of me. But what I tried to do is not project about things, but just to live one day

720
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:44,780
at a time to do my best and then to let the outcome is in God's hands. I had... I came out of the

721
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:52,700
environmental movement and I saw a lot of people who were... If you're in the environmental movement,

722
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:59,100
every victory that you have is temporary and every defeat is permanent. You destroy

723
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:06,460
extinguished species, you're not getting them back. You destroy a sacred piece of land and

724
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:14,540
pave it over and it's never coming back. And what I watched during those years was a lot of people

725
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:21,100
who were advocates, who were friends of mine, who just got soul crushed because they'd give their

726
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:27,900
lives to preserve a creek or resource or a piece of land. They'd see it destroyed and they would

727
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:33,420
just withdraw and go into isolation and lose hope. And I just said, I'm not going to ever let that

728
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:41,180
happen to me. I'm going to. I don't have any control over what happens ultimately. That is in God's

729
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:46,700
hands. The only thing I control is this little piece of real estate inside my own shoes.

730
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:53,580
That's the only thing I can control. And I can get up every day and say, reporting for duty, sir,

731
01:20:54,300 --> 01:21:01,740
and then go forward and try to keep doing the next right thing, to make my bed, to put the water

732
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:07,180
in the ice tray before I put it in the freezer, to put the shopping cart back where the shopping

733
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:12,940
cart is supposed to go, to do the... Are you going out shopping right now? One at a time.

734
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:22,860
There's just a secret. And as long as I do that, I can be peaceful. And it makes... To me,

735
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:28,700
it gives me power because it makes me... Because I feel like I cannot be defeated. And no matter

736
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:34,460
what kind of blow that I get dealt, I'm going to get up again. And I'm going to fight because

737
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:41,260
I've detached from the outcomes. I don't have expectations. I try not to, so I'll never have

738
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:48,220
disappointments. And that, I think, it makes me a much more effective advocate for people.

739
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:54,300
I mean, you put out a video on Thanksgiving about gratitude that I thought was just absolutely

740
01:21:54,300 --> 01:22:01,580
incredible. And I never really studied or followed politics that much. I would talk to my friends that

741
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,140
did prior to the pandemic happening. And then I really started... It was a giant wake-up call of,

742
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:11,740
wow, who's really running things? I have no idea who's actually running the country right now.

743
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:18,620
Certainly is not Joe Biden. But if not that this would ever happen, but if it did, if Joe Biden or

744
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:23,980
Donald Trump came to you and asked you for advice, what would you tell them? I would give them advice.

745
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:36,220
I'd say you should get out of this race. That's a great soundbite right there. That's really good.

746
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:44,540
Wow. So, you know, with all our flaws and the flaws of our founding fathers, I still believe

747
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:50,380
the great American experiment is worth fighting for. And you've, you're taking on one hell of a

748
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:58,780
battle here. And what sort of helper support do you need the most right now? Well, I mean, the

749
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:05,020
biggest, the most support we need right now is financial support. I have to get on that because

750
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:11,180
I'm not running at a political party. I have to get on the ballot in all 50 states. And that means

751
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:17,420
a million signatures, different configurations of signatures. On average, it's going to cost us

752
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:23,820
about $14 or $15 of signatures. So I need to raise $15 million. And you can do that

753
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:32,220
from big donors. If you get one big donor and I need that, you know, they can give to the super

754
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:38,300
pack, but the campaign itself has to do the ballot access. And so the top donation, the maximum

755
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:47,740
donation under federal law is $6,600. And they, and, you know, I need to raise in $6,600 increments,

756
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:52,780
I need to raise $15 million to do that. And then, you know, people who will volunteer,

757
01:23:54,620 --> 01:24:00,700
go to kennedy24.com. And, you know, if you have anything, if you have resources, intellectual

758
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:07,340
resources, advice, whatever, I'd love to hear from you. But mainly right now, I need to,

759
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:13,820
I need to raise money for our ballot fight. Okay. Okay. I was having lunch with today,

760
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:22,540
with some of the group, and a woman had said to me about protection and why have you not been

761
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:28,060
granted security protection by the president? And this was put in place because your father was

762
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:34,220
assassinated, and you still have not gotten it, is what need, and she had mentioned, what can we

763
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:40,140
do to help with that? Who do you send an email to? What do you do to get you protection? Because

764
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,460
you're paying for your own security right now? Yeah, I mean, they used to, people can send,

765
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:52,380
you know, an email to the White House. You know what, as you said, the candidates,

766
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:58,300
I mean, historically, the candidates did not get secret service protection until they were,

767
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:06,700
until after the conventions. And then, when my dad was killed in 68, I was with him at that time,

768
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:11,980
they immediately provided secret service protection to all the other candidates, to George McGovern,

769
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:17,500
George Wallace, Hubert Humphrey, and Zeta, who were running at the same time. And then Congress

770
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:24,460
passed a law that said that every candidate, as long as they're there, they exceed a certain metric,

771
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:33,660
which I've exceeded for six months, is entitled to secret service protection 120 days

772
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:41,580
prior to the general election. But in practice, the president can provide it to anybody

773
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:46,780
on request. And I'm the first candidate in history who has requested it and not been provided. I've

774
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:55,660
had a number of credible death threats, including three break-ins at my house and, you know, a guy

775
01:25:55,660 --> 01:26:03,420
who showed up trying to get to me in the green room prior to his speech in Los Angeles, who I,

776
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:10,860
you know, I have a security team that spotted him because he had fake U.S. Marshall badges,

777
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:17,340
a badge, he had fake Federal ID, and then he was carrying a lot of concealed weapons. He had two

778
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:22,540
shoulder holsters with full magazines, and then he had a lot of weapons in a backpack, including

779
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:31,420
laser scope, pistol, with full magazines, a lot of action magazines, guns and stuff.

780
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:37,660
My team detained him, held him for the police, he was trying to find me,

781
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:46,300
and the police then arrested him. He said that he wanted to find me for a job interview,

782
01:26:47,180 --> 01:27:01,500
which, yeah, so then, but my uncle, Ted Kennedy, when he ran in 1980, he was given secret service

783
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:08,300
protection by President Carter, and they didn't like each other. They really had a lot of personal

784
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:15,260
antipathy toward each other, but my Carter gave him secret service protection 450 days out, and

785
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:25,020
Obama received it 450 days out. I think 30, maybe over 30 candidates have received it

786
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:32,380
before the 120 days. Jesse Jackson, Mitt Romney, almost anybody that you can name received it

787
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:37,340
early, so it's standard to provide it early, but I think they know that I have to, you know,

788
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:45,180
one out of every $3 that I raise is going to my security team, so I think the White House is playing

789
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:56,220
hardball and has decided that they're going to try to hurt me financially, which is not really

790
01:27:56,220 --> 01:28:04,460
in the spirit of democracy, because when my father became Attorney General in 1961,

791
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:10,940
the first day at work, he called all of the upper staff of the Justice Department, and he said to

792
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:18,620
them, we have one rule. We're never going to politicize this agency. Whether you're a Republican

793
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:23,580
or Democrat, you're treated equally under the law, and I don't want to hear any even rumors

794
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:32,220
that people are giving favoritism to somebody who's Democrat. And that, you know, people believe in

795
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:37,900
the institutions of our country, because we've consistently had leaders who have respected that.

796
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:44,780
And in the last couple of years, we've seen this erosion, or a lot of the federal enforcement

797
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:52,540
agencies are being politicized. And I would say, you know, that it, you know, politicizing the

798
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:57,660
Secret Service is just, is not a good look. We're supposed to be the exemplary democracy in the

799
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:03,420
world, and to say that if people, if you don't like somebody's politics, if they're a political

800
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:09,580
threat, you're not going to give them protection is not, you know, it's just not good for our democracy.

801
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:18,380
Yeah, okay. What, what is the most significant or impactful life decision you think you've ever made?

802
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:26,540
Oh, I mean, you know, I'd have a hard time with that. I mean, my marriage is, is one.

803
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:34,460
My, I wouldn't say that I decided to have kids because it just happens, you know.

804
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:43,900
But I mean, this is one, you know, running is definitely running in this race is definitely

805
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:51,580
life changing. And how do you handle the criticism and the attacks on you? How do you process that?

806
01:29:51,580 --> 01:30:01,820
You know, I, I process it by just because I, I was raised in a milieu where we all believe that we

807
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:07,580
would, you know, that our lives would somehow be consumed in some great controversy. And that

808
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:14,780
it would be a privilege for us if we were to be able to take a an important part in that. And,

809
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:20,700
you know, I've, I think I understood from when I was a kid that if you're going to do anything

810
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:26,380
important with your life, that people are going to attack you and that you're going to get criticism,

811
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:30,540
you're going to lose friends, you're going to lose relationships that there's going to be,

812
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:37,500
you know, there's going to be a hero's journey where you go through these tremendous hardships

813
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:43,660
where you go through the valley of death, you feel you're completely alone at some points. And that,

814
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:49,580
that, that's just, that's part of, if you didn't go through that, it would not be very important.

815
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:59,740
So I feel like, you know, whatever I go through is, is, is a privilege to be able to, you know,

816
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:04,300
to do something that's important. And it's just part of it. And then I also,

817
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:13,820
you know, I feel tremendously loved by, by my wife and by my children and by other my friends who

818
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:18,940
are important to me. And I feel like, you know, everybody else is kind of playing, we're all

819
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:24,540
walking through kind of a dream, right? And that, you know, life is a dream and that we have to treat

820
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:31,180
it like that. We have to treat it. We have to ultimately be indifferent to some of the,

821
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:39,660
to some of the defeats that we, that we suffer, some of the criticism, the injuries,

822
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:45,900
the wounds that we suffer. We have to get to a place where we're indifferent about it. There's a

823
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:55,260
famous, I don't know how famous it is, but it's a, it's a story about a monk who was, who, who's,

824
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:03,660
whose monastery was invaded by a warlord in China. All the other monks fled and that the warlord

825
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:08,060
approached this monk who was meditating and tried to talk to him and he ignored the warlord.

826
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:14,860
And finally, warlord gets irritated and he says to the monk, he says, don't you know that I could

827
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:21,420
run you through with my sword without blinking an eye? And the monk says to him, don't you know

828
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:27,500
that I could be run through with your sword without blinking an eye? And ultimately, that's kind of

829
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:33,180
the objective where we all want to be spiritually, where we're indifferent to the personal consequences

830
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:39,980
of everything that we do and that we live our lives for higher purposes. And, you know, the,

831
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:47,900
in the Buddhist tradition, the word nirvana means I'm putting out a fire and that means the fire

832
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:56,380
of ambition, of pride, of, of anger, of a desire. And all of these things that we're supposed to

833
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:02,620
view as just clouds that pass over us and that we take an interest in them, but ultimately are,

834
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:08,860
you know, indifferent and we all go through, you know, difficulties in our lives and we have to be

835
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:15,420
able to weather those difficulties without being crushed in our soul or without being ultimately

836
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:22,060
affected by it and just focus on what we do, you know, and what the choices that we actually get

837
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:36,780
to make. That's ultimately the only thing that's important. Thank you. We've got another evening

838
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:44,700
session, but thank you. Thank you very much. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., everyone, and thank you all very

839
01:33:44,700 --> 01:34:00,140
much. Here's his book. Oh, picture over here. Let's do a picture. We'll do this with the book.

840
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:03,260
Thank you.
