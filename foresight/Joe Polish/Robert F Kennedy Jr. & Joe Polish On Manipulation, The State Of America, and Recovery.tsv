0	6240	I don't have any control over what happens ultimately, you know, that isn't God's hands.
6240	11800	The only thing I control is this little piece of real estate inside my own shoes.
11800	17280	There's a couple of things that every demagogue can use to manipulate people, and one of those
17280	21440	is fear, because it disables our capacity for critical thinking.
21440	27320	There's a 2013 poll that showed that 85% of Americans under 35% said they were proud of
27320	29560	the United States of America.
29560	33240	The same poll taken last month showed only 18%.
33240	39600	My initial bias about psychedelic drugs is, again, colored by my experience of being in
39600	41280	recovery for 40 years.
41280	45200	I would tell myself at 9 o'clock in the morning, I am never going to do that again, and at
45200	49480	4 o'clock in the afternoon, I'd be telling exactly what I said, and, you know, it was
49480	54480	like somebody else had stepped into my body and was now, you know, a new driver in the
54480	55480	truck.
55480	59760	Through a free market, you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and
59760	61600	without enriching your community.
61600	66960	You show me a polluter, or I'll show you a fat cat using political clout to escape the
66960	70920	discipline of the free market and force the public base production costs.
70920	77120	We have to be able to weather those difficulties without being crushed in our soul or without
77120	81560	being ultimately affected by it, and that's kind of the objective where we all want to
81560	86320	be spiritually, where we're indifferent to the personal consequences of everything that
86320	91280	we do, and that we live our lives for all higher purposes.
91280	96480	The vast majority of people in the audience are entrepreneurs, capitalists, love to get
96480	100520	your views on the environment and capitalism, because that's a topic that there's a lot
100520	102360	of debate on.
102360	109640	First of all, thank you so much for having me, and thanks for the reception.
109640	116960	I've been working as an environmental advocate and attorney for 40 years for my entire career,
116960	124280	but I started out as an attorney for commercial fishmen on the Hudson River, and we built
124280	126280	that organization.
126280	131160	They launched a patrol boat, they began, these were people who were capitalists.
131160	139080	They were small business people, and they saw their livelihoods being destroyed by pollution
139080	146600	on the river, and these were people who, the Hudson River commercial fishery is the oldest
146600	150400	in North America, it's 350 years old.
150400	156400	Many of the people I represent came from families that have been fishing the river continuously
156400	161240	since Dutch colonial times, it's a traditional gear of fishery they use.
161240	165240	The same fishing methods that were taught by the Algonquin Indians to the original Dutch
165280	171400	settlers of New Amsterdam and then passed down through the generations, and there was
171400	176880	nothing wrong with their business model, but the general electric company used political
176880	185880	clout in Albany to get permission to illegally dump PCBs into the river, rather than properly
185880	191420	disposing them, and it saved them money, it allowed them to out-compete the other producers
191420	200660	of capacitators and to win in the marketplace, but they had distorted the market signals
200660	206340	by cheating the market, and these fishermen knew that their problem was not their business
206340	215580	model, it was that we didn't have free market capitalism on the river, we had a kind of
215580	221700	corporate crony capitalism that was allowing polluters to use political clout to escape
221700	225180	the discipline of the free market.
225180	232300	One of the things I learned very early on was that we don't have to choose between good
232300	238420	environmental policy and good economic policy, in 100% of the cases, good economic policy
238420	242020	is identical to good environmental policy.
242020	246220	If we want to measure the economy, and this is how we ought to be measuring it, based
246220	252180	upon how it produces jobs and the dignity of jobs over the generations and how it preserves
252180	259260	the value of the assets of our community, if on the other hand we want to do what the
259260	264100	big polluters often want us to do, which is to treat the planet as if it were business
264100	270940	and liquidation, convert our natural resources to cash as quickly as possible, have a few
270940	277100	years of pollution-based prosperity, we can generate an instantaneous cash flow and the
277100	282020	illusion of a prosperous economy, but our children are going to pay for our joyride,
282020	287220	and they're going to pay for it with denuded landscapes, poor health, huge cleanup costs
287220	291700	that are going to amplify over time and they'll never be able to pay, and environmental injury
291700	298180	is deficit spending, it's a way of loading the cost of our generation's prosperity onto
298180	302300	the backs of our children.
302300	308020	My approach has always been colored by my experience, I worked for 40 years for the
308020	314660	commercial fishermen and I really kind of colored my worldview about the environment,
314660	320660	and if you can go back 35 or 40 years ago and look at speeches that I was giving back
320660	327540	then where people would ask me, what's the most important solution, most effective solution
327540	332700	to environmental pollution, and I always said the same thing, it's a free market, true
332700	341220	free market capitalism, because a free market, a true free market, promotes efficiency, and
341220	347620	efficiency means the elimination of waste, and pollution is waste, and a true free market
347620	352820	would require us to properly value our natural resources, and it's the undervaluation of
352820	360380	those resources that cause us to use them wastefully or recklessly, and a true free
360380	365140	market you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich, and without enriching
365140	367060	your community.
367060	372900	What polluters do is they make themselves rich by making everybody else poor, they raise
372900	378460	standards of living for themselves by lowering quality of life for the rest of us, and they
378460	382340	do that by escaping the discipline of the free market.
382340	389660	You show me a polluter, I'll show you a subsidy, I'll show you a fat cat using political clout
389660	393860	to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay its production
393860	399460	costs, and what I did as an environmental advocate, I really always considered myself
399460	407300	a free marketer, and I was going out into the marketplace to catch the cheaters and
407300	412860	to bring them to court and say to them, we're going to force you to internalize your costs
412860	418140	the same way that you internalize your profits, because as long as somebody can externalize
418140	424620	those costs, it distorts the marketplace, and none of us gets the advantages of the
424620	430380	efficiency, the prosperity, and the democracy that true free market capitalism offers our
430380	431380	country.
431380	434700	Okay, great, thank you.
434700	439860	Let me ask my team, make sure we put a timer up here so we know the time if we could, because
439860	441900	it's not on, thank you.
441900	447820	So I asked the audience to submit some questions, and I can't ask all of them, but one of them
447820	453620	was about psychedelics, and let me preface this by saying, you know that I've been in
453620	460740	recovery, you've been in recovery for 40 years, and I'm the first person in the world to have
460740	466940	before and after brain scans doing ibogaine and 5MEO-DMT, which I did in 2015 in Mexico,
466940	470780	and we took a film crew, and we filmed it, and then we did interviews with the doctor
470780	475100	that did the before and after brain scans and whatnot, and I've seen miraculous things
475100	481180	happen, but I'm also worried about the pharmaceutical industries like they're doing with everything,
481180	482260	co-opping it.
482260	486620	So what are your thoughts on psychedelics, because my viewpoint on it is in the field
486620	489300	of recovery, depression, mental illness, things like that.
489300	496860	I mean, my initial bias about psychedelic drugs is, again, colored by my experience
496860	502460	of being in recovery for 40 years and having gone to, I go to like nine meetings a week,
502460	504860	so 12-step meetings.
504860	511180	I've heard a lot of bad stories about people, you know, involvement with drugs and alcohol
511180	514380	and pharmaceutical drugs.
514380	525860	My bias is that I don't think that, in most cases, that we can fix things that are wrong
525860	531940	inside of us with things that are outside of us, with all the things that we reach for
531940	538540	when we feel discomfort, whether it's drugs or alcohol or sex or reckless behavior, where
538540	542780	particularly people who are prone to addiction are always looking for things outside of them
542780	548060	to fix, you know, to fill this empty hole that they have inside of them.
548060	559420	Having said that, I have seven kids and my wife in 2012 took her own life and left me
559420	562740	with six children.
562740	569820	And so all of those kids were at risk at the time and they all ended up doing really wonderful
569820	574660	things with their lives and they're in good relationships and they're, you know, outside
574660	579300	now of that, what I would call a risk level.
579300	590020	One of them was worrying to me because he never processed his mom's death in a way that
590020	592380	I could observe.
592380	596220	He seemed like a happy kid, he was always smiling.
596220	604500	He did get in a lot of fist fights and he was a, he became a boxer and he won a lot
604500	609420	of tournaments and then he became a hockey player and, but everything he did, it was
609420	616060	a little bit of violence though and it made me, it made me worried about him and he went
616060	623580	to a couple, about five years ago, he went, he was very self-contained.
623580	633060	We never talked about what was going on inside of him and he went to Patagonia to run a white,
633060	638460	to kayak a white water river that I kayaked for many, many years every year called the
638460	645820	Fute Le Faux and he went down there to do it with a friend and he had a five day wait
645820	654180	between the time that the, that his kayak trip was going to start and the time that
654180	660780	he arrived there and I had a friend who, oh, I knew a little bit of, just on a quaintance
660780	667740	down there who I, who had some land property down there and I asked this guy to put my son
667740	675180	up for a couple of days while he was waiting for his trip to start and that guy, the night
675260	682060	my son arrived there, he had, that guy said to him, I'm doing an ayahuasca trip tonight
682060	688540	and he said, God sent you boys to me because he was doing it with 20 poinche Indians and
688540	696020	he said, I was praying to God that he would send me a gringo to do this with and my, my,
696020	704220	my kid ended up doing this and he had this experience where after he drank the ayahuasca,
704220	707900	they gave them all a bucket and they gave him a sleeping bag and it was kind of in an
707900	715220	outdoor place with a fire and after he drank it, he felt himself sinking through all the
715220	719940	geological strata of the earth and he could look at all of, he told me he could look at
719940	727420	all the folds of stone and geology and he had a total understanding of all of the processes
727420	732900	that had laid them out for the aeons, he ended up being propelled out of the other side of
732900	738940	the earth and then floating through space for what he experienced as hundreds of years
738940	745740	and he would focus on a distant planet and be transported there and on each planet, he
745740	751620	would have an adventure at the end of the adventure, there would be a lesson, a moral
751620	757900	lesson that he would learn that he was supposed to remember. The last place, the last planet
757900	767100	he visited, he came into, his mother was there and she started passing through him in and
767100	773260	out of him again and again and every time she did that, he felt all these experiences
773260	783340	of forgiveness, of love, of understanding, of comprehension, of empathy and compassion
783340	790060	and when he came back from that trip, he was completely changed, he was very open about
790060	797740	talking about his feelings, he was on a real spiritual class, he was very, very openly
797740	803460	just happy all the time and he, the reason I really know that it changed him is he started
803460	812460	taking out the garbage and doing the dishes and he's done the dishes constantly without
812580	821580	ever being asked since then. He's a 24 year old kid, so you know that's a miracle. So
821580	829180	I had that open my mind to the possibility that there may be something that I didn't
829180	834860	understand or that was outside of my kind of bubble of prejudices and then I have a
834860	841500	friend who's an ABCL who had a severe PTSD and he went to Costa Rica and had the same
841500	848940	kind of experience and I had a couple of other friends who are in the NFL and they also had
848940	856140	severe brain injuries and depression, terrible, terrible depression and the same thing happened
856140	863420	and then I looked at Michael Pollan's documentary which I think is on Netflix and there's one
863420	869740	particularly poignant story, he goes through each of the psychedelics, a show for each one
870700	877740	and I think the third show is on the psilocybin and there's a kid on that show who had severe
877740	885660	OCD, he could not, he literally could not go out of his house. He had to do all of these rituals,
885660	890700	all the, he had to constantly clean his hands, he had to walk through the door 10 times or 20
890700	897180	times or 60 times and he had to do all these very repetitive rituals and it absolutely paralyzed him
898140	904140	and destroyed his life and he did one psilocybin trip and it was completely gone.
905340	911980	So, you know, my mind is open to the idea that, you know, there may be things that I don't know
911980	918140	about and that people ought to have the freedom and the liberty to experiment with these things.
918140	925020	I likely use said at the outset which is, you know, we know the capacity of the pharmaceutical
925020	931980	industry to come and capture this if they see that there's money in it and then to turn it
931980	937500	into something very, very bad and to promote it in ways that it shouldn't be promoted.
938460	944700	So, you know, my inclination and I haven't thought this through that much but my inclination would be
944700	952940	to make this available at least in therapeutic settings and maybe more generally but in ways
953020	958700	that would discourage the corporate control exploitation of it.
958700	961420	Yeah, absolutely. No, absolutely. And I mean,
966860	974940	we could, you know, I believe that addiction is a solution to pain and addiction works if you're
975580	979660	lonely, depressed, anxiety-ridden in the moment but the problem is it has this thing called
979660	987340	consequences that can destroy your life and make your life not work and I think we live in a culture
987340	994220	that we have the largest addiction crisis in human history right now. There's a lot of temptation,
994220	1000860	there's a lot of pain, there's a lot of trauma. I think the last three to four years of the pandemic
1000860	1007340	has created more angst, more pain, more trauma that will last literally generations and I think
1007340	1012300	millions of lives have been destroyed as a result of it and one of the coping mechanisms
1012300	1018860	is addiction and I think anything that could help with that and I think psychedelics are one part
1018860	1028780	of that is beneficial. If you become president, what could you do or will you do to fix this issue?
1029500	1035820	Yeah, I mean, part of the, you know, addiction, like you say, it's a response to internal pain,
1035820	1042540	it's also a response to adamantization, to loneliness, a disconnection to disaffection
1043900	1051020	and, you know, and we're seeing that's now epidemic in this country where so many of us feel
1051020	1056940	that we're no longer connected to a community. It was a poll recently that showed that,
1057740	1067980	there's a 2013 poll that showed that when asked, 80, 85 percent of kids of Americans under 35
1067980	1073500	said they were proud of the United States of America. The same poll taken last month showed
1073500	1081340	only 18 percent. So they've lost faith in our country, they've lost hope for their own future,
1081340	1087980	they've lost a connection to community and now, you know, we're seeing the biggest cause of suicide
1087980	1097180	among Black youth today, I mean, of death among Black youth is suicide. We lost 106,000 kids last
1097180	1104860	year to fentanyl overdose or to other opioid overdoses. That's double the number of kids that
1104860	1114860	we lost in the 20 year Vietnam War. We're really in a crisis now. One of my program, my kind of
1114860	1122780	moonshot program or Peace Corps program to use metaphors from my uncle's administration will be
1122780	1133900	to start, to launch a string of healing centers around this country, particularly in rural areas
1134380	1139500	where people will go there and do regenerative farming, regenerative agriculture, grow good food,
1140860	1145500	healthy food and learn to live in communities again without screens, without cell phones.
1146860	1154860	And I've looked at these places for 40 years. The rehab industry in this country is,
1156140	1162060	I would say, somewhat predatory at this point, like many, many other industries, but
1162860	1170860	I had a relative who was in a lot of trouble and I started looking all over the world for places that
1170860	1177340	had a different model. And I found this place in Italy in Tuscany called San Padre Nano and it's a
1177340	1185740	500 acre farm. There's 2,000 kids who live there. It's absolutely free. The only thing they ask you
1185740	1196220	to commit to is to stay there for 5 years. 5 years? Listen, if it's a choice, a lot of kids today
1196220	1204220	are honest, they're actually going to die. And 5 years is like college. And if you can save somebody's
1204220	1209580	life, it takes time because you have to re-parent the person. You have to reorient them to live in a
1209580	1219020	completely different way. And they're taking people who are criminals, who are not only drug addicts,
1219020	1225900	but people who are headed for prison, headed for something very bad. They take them and they
1225900	1234460	transform them into good citizens. At that place, they have, it's completely self-supporting.
1234780	1243580	In Italy, you can do a check-off on your taxes to send $1, by approximately $1 on your taxes.
1243580	1249820	There's a little check-off to San Padre Nano. Most of their money comes from their industries,
1249820	1255180	so they have one of the best bakeries in Europe and they teach kids traditional baking skills.
1255180	1267820	They have an apparel center where they do weaving and they make accessories, fashion accessories,
1267820	1273420	so they make purses for De La Valle, for Prada, for Gucci, for these other big brands.
1274540	1279980	They have a vineyard, 500 acre vineyard, and they make some of the finest wine in Europe.
1279980	1290300	They have kennels and they have a wallpaper factory that makes this hand-painted wallpaper,
1290300	1295260	very, very traditional with traditional artisans. There's no cell phones allowed,
1295260	1300540	there's no screens, and the people live together in very, very tight kind of barracks. There's
1300540	1309420	six girls and my relative was a girl and she was put in with six girls who watched her every
1309420	1314940	move and if she did something selfish, if she did something dishonest, she was called on it,
1314940	1319180	and it taught her a new way of living in a community and when she came out,
1320460	1327740	she became very, very successful and not only in her business life but also her social life.
1327740	1338940	She was utterly transformed. Two days ago, I went to a place in Salt Lake City called the other side
1338940	1346220	that is modeled on San Pajagnano and they have now three city blocks full of buildings.
1346220	1354060	They have 300 convicts. They take people out of prison or they take people who are facing long
1354060	1360540	sentences and they interview them to see if they're suitable for the program. They bring them into
1360540	1365820	that program and they rehabilitate them and they have to make a two-year commitment.
1366780	1374140	It's absolutely free. Anybody can walk in the street and take advantage of it. They have the
1374140	1380860	biggest moving company in Salt Lake. They have the biggest storage company in Salt Lake.
1382060	1389820	They have a thrift store that is the size of two Walmart's. They have a construction firm
1389820	1396540	that is very, very successful and they teach the inmates how to be electricians, how to be
1396540	1403660	plumbers, all of these skills that they can use in the world. The guy who started it
1405660	1411420	was facing his fifth term in prison. He was facing a 29-year prison sentence
1412700	1418460	and he persuaded the judge to allow him to go to Delancey Street, which is a
1418460	1424060	therapeutic community in San Francisco. He ended up working there for eight years and then
1424060	1430780	coming out and starting this place. It was so inspiring going to this place and to the other
1430780	1435020	side and seeing what they'd done because it's a model that can be reproduced elsewhere.
1437740	1445100	I was in prison for the summer of 2001. I won a lawsuit against the Navy
1445820	1448780	in Puerto Rico for bombing the island of Viegas.
1452220	1457020	I did it. The judge, there was a corrupt judge who would not enforce my injunction.
1458300	1462540	The group, I was representing 10,000 people on the island and they asked me to do a civil
1462540	1469020	disobedience to go onto the live fire zone while the Navy was bombing and I was arrested.
1469020	1473820	They told me, I said, how long am I going to be in jail? They said, well, just probably a day,
1473820	1481180	but I ended up being the whole summer in maximum security prison. I had my son,
1481180	1485820	my youngest son, was born while I was in prison. The first time I saw him was on visitor's day.
1487420	1491420	In that prison, which is a federal prison, a much better than state prison,
1492700	1497740	there was no, I couldn't even go to an AA meeting. There was no opportunities for any of the people
1497740	1502860	who were living there to make their lives better and we need to do that better. We need to make
1502860	1508460	sure when people come out of prison, they're actually productive. The guy who was running
1508460	1516780	had to made that when he first started trying to place the convicts and businesses in Salt Lake
1517660	1524620	that nobody wanted them because they're ex-cons. Now they have such a good work record and such a
1524620	1531980	good reputation that he is a list of hundreds and hundreds of businesses on the wall who,
1531980	1537740	and they employ 100% of the people who leave and everybody in Salt Lake wants people from this
1537740	1544380	program because they're such responsible workers. Oh, it was inspiring to me to see that, you know,
1544380	1548700	the transfer of what I saw and said, Patrick, I don't know what happened in this country.
1549820	1559020	In A, the biggest industry in rural areas in our country are prisons. I want to change that and make
1559660	1566540	rehab and restoration of the feeling of community in this country, the skills of living in a community
1566540	1572220	to re-parent all of these kids who are lost today, an entire generation of kids who are lost,
1573260	1580540	give them the opportunity to go to places where they can learn to be productive members of society
1580540	1585180	and where they can get inspired again about their lives and regain hope in their lives.
1585180	1586620	I love that. I love that. It's great.
1591100	1595820	So you probably met him backstage. I don't know if he's out here, but we have Andre Norman who's
1595820	1601260	here who spent 14 years in maximum security prison and he became the number three gang leader.
1601260	1605660	He spent two years in solitary confinement and now this guy's like an absolute angel and just
1605660	1612060	helped so many people and he's in charge of a program which currently has 600,000 tablets in
1612140	1617340	prisons in the United States soon to be a million and we have genius network content. We have genius
1617340	1623820	recovery content from my foundation on those tablets. 25% of the world's prisoners are in the
1623820	1628700	United States who are the highest incarcerating country in the world. I believe it's between 80 to
1628700	1634140	90% of everyone that's arrested or thrown in jail or prison. Drugs and alcohol were involved.
1634780	1640140	40% of people that are incarcerated committed a violent crime, so that's a separate issue,
1640140	1647420	but 60% had not. So we are incarcerating a lot of addicts and when someone goes through recovery,
1647420	1654060	as you know, you can take people that were really lying, cheating, stealing, doing bad things and
1654060	1658380	they become these incredible, compassionate, caring humans and so I think there's something
1658380	1664220	to the whole process of healing and creating that environment. So yeah, I mean, we'll talk more
1664220	1670700	about that. So let me, I have some questions about tyranny and all that, but before we get to it,
1671660	1675820	cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, what are your thoughts on digital currency?
1675820	1682700	Yeah, I mean, I became a converter. I really didn't know anything about cryptocurrency. My kids all
1684380	1690940	know are entrepreneurial and are interested in business and they're all in that space. So they
1691020	1695980	were, you know, they had bought and sold cryptocurrencies and talked a lot about it,
1695980	1702540	but I was really just on the sideline listening to them. And then I saw what happened during the
1702540	1709180	pandemic, what happened in Toronto or in Ottawa to the strikers. Oh, Children's Health Defense,
1709180	1718220	which was the organization that I ran, started and ran, had embedded in the trucker's convoy
1718540	1724220	in Canada. We had a reporter embedded and we were helping them and we were, you know,
1725020	1728860	sending money and publicizing what they were doing and the truckers in Canada
1730300	1735740	were angry at the mandates and the truckers in Canada are very, very diverse group. A lot of them
1735740	1742060	are from African descent, a lot of them for Asian, Indian, Bangladesh, and then just white
1743020	1747740	people from all over Canada, but it's a very, very diverse group and they had started out
1747740	1753420	in BC and Alberta and they had then done a collective and made a bigger and bigger convoy
1753420	1760060	coming across the country. They wanted to meet with Justin Trudeau and talk to him about the
1760060	1767660	impact of the mandates on their businesses and on their lives. And Prime Minister Trudeau would
1767660	1776860	not meet with them and instead the, and it was, if you look at the videos of this protest in Ottawa,
1776860	1782540	it looks like wood stock. You know, they had cleanup crews that were picking up garbage,
1782540	1788940	they had crews that were passing out bottled water to people that were feeding the homeless
1788940	1794140	people and hungry people in Ottawa and there was a field, there was music and there was a lot of
1794140	1801900	joy. There was nothing nasty or me and spirited about it and it was portrayed that way by the,
1801900	1807340	by officials, government officials and to a large extent by the mainstream media.
1808620	1815420	But what they did in Canada is they used AI, they used facial recognition systems and they,
1816060	1821180	and they got the identities of the people who are participating in the protest
1822620	1828940	and they froze their bank accounts and this was shocking to me because none of them were
1828940	1834380	charged with the crime. They also took $15 million that we had helped raise for them on PayPal
1835580	1839420	and they persuaded PayPal to shut off their money so they couldn't access it.
1840460	1848860	And it occurred to me then that, you know, I talked to one of the strikers, the truckers,
1849980	1857340	now they couldn't buy diesel for their trucks, they couldn't buy food for their kids,
1857340	1864460	they couldn't pay their mortgages. I talked to one striker who said he was facing jail time
1864460	1869420	because he had mandatory alimony payments to his ex-wife and he could not pay them.
1870620	1876380	And it occurred to me then that, you know, that transactional freedom is as important as freedom
1876380	1882620	of expression. If you have freedom of expression under the First Amendment, you can say anything
1882620	1888140	you want about your government without consequence, but if the government then can shut off your
1888140	1894380	capacity to pay your rent, to buy food, you know, put you essentially on the sidewalk and paralyze
1894380	1899740	you, what does it matter if you have so-called freedom of expression and they don't have to
1899740	1905180	charge you with any crime? And I had actually, I had seen this happening, what's happening in China
1906140	1912620	where they have what they call programmable currencies, which is, you know, in China now
1912620	1919900	they use, your face is your credit card, so their facial recognition is so ubiquitous and so refined
1919900	1926780	and sophisticated that when you go to a store to pay, you don't use cash, you know, in many places,
1926780	1931580	you don't use any credit card, you just use your face to pay and there's, you know, you have a digital
1931660	1937500	account and on your digital account is other information, including your medical information,
1937500	1945740	including your social credit score. Oh, if you drop below a certain credit score, your capacity
1945740	1953660	to use your accounts now ends and they, for example, they have one system where if, and I'll give
1953660	1959740	you an example, if there is a, if the government declared a mask day and you're walking around
1959740	1965340	with your mask below your nostrils and you're seeing on facial recognition system, which knows
1965340	1971340	everybody, you're going to now lose social credit points or if you're too close to your girlfriend
1971340	1978700	on a, you know, on a social distance, you're not even told about it. You're going to lose social
1978700	1984620	credit and if you drop below a certain point, at some point, your, your credit, your facial credit
1984620	1991820	card stops working except in grocery stores that are within a certain radius of your home.
1991820	1995820	So you can't travel, you can't buy gas for your car, you can't buy an airplane ticket,
1995820	2001500	you can't go to a hotel, you're essentially under house arrest. If the government has the capacity
2001500	2009900	to do that to people, then it has the capacity, I mean, a government that can silence its, its
2009980	2016380	critics as a license for any kind of atrocity. And it is the top of a very, very slippery slope
2017900	2025100	or totalitarian rule. So, you know, I was, again, I was, I was struck at that point by
2025820	2032460	how important it was that we have transactional freedom. And during that period, you may remember
2032460	2037100	this, there were a lot of people in the federal government who were saying, we got to get rid
2037180	2044140	of paper currency. And in fact, in many nations like in Africa and Australia, etc., they were
2044140	2051580	taking away ATM machines. They were doing that on the pretense that paper currency passes germs.
2051580	2059420	So we have to get rid of it. Well, if we go to total digital currency, every transaction that you
2059420	2066380	have is not, is, is visible to the government, the corporations, it's taxable, it's, you know,
2066380	2074220	it's my, it, it, it, it can be monetized for profit by somebody. And you can't, you have no secrets
2074220	2079020	in your life. If you, you know, if you wanted to buy cigarettes or pornography or liquor or
2079020	2084380	whatever you want to do, stuff that you don't want to share with the world, you know, somebody's
2084380	2091420	going to know about that. And that's a very, very dangerous thing in a democracy. And, and so, you
2091420	2098460	know, I think it's really important that we keep paper currency number one at people of access to
2098460	2107980	Bitcoin and other currencies and that, and that we look very, very warily at central bank digital
2107980	2113340	currencies, which are, you know, which they're putting in place right now. And that is how they
2113340	2118140	did it in China. They started with the central bank digital currency and then they expanded its
2118140	2124300	reach to become any instrument for social control. And to me, that's very dangerous.
2124300	2125900	Well, well, thank you.
2132780	2135820	Tell me something that nobody in the world understands about you.
2136780	2147020	I don't know about that. I, you know, as you know, one of the things they say in recovery is that
2148220	2157340	you're as sick as your secrets. And, you know, I understood when I was, when I was getting sober,
2158620	2163180	that I could not afford to have any secrets. That doesn't mean that you tell the world everything
2163260	2170300	about yourself. But you have to tell somebody, there has to be somebody out there who knows
2170300	2175420	everything. And so I think, you know, I have that I have a number of people in my life
2177020	2184300	who, who, you know, who literally know everything about me, you know, and, and so, you know, and I
2184300	2191020	think that that's important for all of us. To speak to that, I'd like to get your viewpoint on, because
2191020	2196140	here you are running for president of the United States. You are openly talking about addiction
2196140	2202540	recovery, which I think is awesome. You're more focused on health than anyone else I know that is,
2202540	2209420	you know, running. So you're a great role model in that arena. And you are sick as your secrets.
2209420	2215420	I think that is a, it's true. It's actually at one of these genius network annual events in 2015,
2215420	2219580	where I openly just decided I'm just going to share everything. I talked about drug addiction,
2219580	2224700	sex addiction, work addiction, you name it. And it was one of the most freeing things that I did,
2224700	2231980	but I also had been going to 12 steps for many years. And what's the difference between how you
2233340	2239820	basically what you share and what you don't. There's secrecy and then there's privacy.
2240540	2246700	And there are trusted people. I always caution people not to make like a Facebook confessional,
2246780	2250780	where you just go and share it needs to be done and we're ready to do it. So
2252140	2259260	you can't be like an idiot. Right. Right. Right. Well, and some people do, it hurts.
2259260	2264300	Yeah. You have to make prudent judgments. And, you know, we're not, you know,
2266540	2273100	Jesus said you have to be gentle as lamb, but clever as snakes. And you know, you need to be,
2273100	2280700	you know, people, God gave us a brain to use it, to make good judgments with,
2280700	2285260	to make prudent judgments. And there's people that you tell everything to. And there's people
2285260	2291420	that you tell, you know, but you don't lie. Right. Well, you have a lot at risk for disclosure.
2291420	2296220	So when did you first start disclosing this to others? Because I think, you know, those
2296220	2300940	from the 12 step world always will mention that it's in the fourth step that you find
2300940	2306140	the cravings in the, in the, you know, we'll start to relieve when you share it with someone.
2306140	2315580	Yeah. I mean, I knew, you know, what kept me, I knew that I was an addict from when I was 15
2315580	2321020	years old. When I started, I started the year after my dad had killed, I started taking drugs.
2322140	2329820	And I progressed very, very quickly to heroin. And I was addicted for 14 years on and off. But
2329820	2337820	I always wanted to quit. Oh, I tried to earn this. I was basically, you know, I was, I was
2337820	2342940	living against conscious at that time. I knew that I did not want to be an addict. But, and I had
2342940	2349260	iron willpower in other parts of my life. I gave up candy for Lent when I was 13. And I didn't need
2349260	2355420	candy again till I was in college. And I gave up desserts the following year for Lent. And I never
2355420	2361100	had a dessert till I was in my freshman year of college when I was doing, you know, playing sports.
2362380	2369100	And, and I wanted to bulk up. And, but I felt like I could do anything with willpower. But
2369100	2376780	somehow this compulsion was utterly impervious to my willpower. And I would, you know, the most,
2378140	2385100	to me, the most demoralizing feature of addiction was my incapacity to keep contracts with myself.
2385980	2390540	I tell myself at nine o'clock in the morning, I am never going to do that again. And at four o'clock
2390540	2395820	in the afternoon, I'd be doing exactly what I said. And, you know, it was like somebody else had
2395820	2401740	stepped into my body and was now, you know, a new driver in the truck was now nothing to do with me.
2402700	2409260	And it was, it was baffling to me, just bewildering, why can't I control myself?
2410220	2416220	But I tried earnestly, sincerely, honestly for 14 years to stop and couldn't do it.
2416220	2420380	One of the things I'd never tried was 12 separate programs because of exactly what you said.
2421420	2426860	There was no way, given my background and my vulnerabilities, that I would step into a room
2426860	2433260	of strangers and start talking about what was happening in my life. And then, you know, I came
2433340	2441020	in in September of 1983. I was arrested. I was in the papers. So at that point, there was no
2441020	2445740	secret left. And I, you know, it was the best thing that happened to me because I was able, at that
2445740	2452300	point, to come in and, you know, take advantage of this program. But I knew from the beginning,
2452300	2457820	that, you know, if you're an addict, you are dishonest. You're going, you have to lie. You
2457820	2464700	can't, you know, you can't, you cannot, I don't think, I think it's impossible to be a drug addict
2464700	2476380	and not lie. And so, and I knew that dishonesty was associated with my addiction and that if I
2476380	2484380	did not become rigorously honest in every aspect of my life, that I was, I was going to fall back
2484380	2490140	in the addiction. And so, you know, I, I put a lot of effort into that. And it was, you know,
2490140	2498940	it was difficult. I remember one time I was in court. And, you know what, it's strange when
2498940	2505340	you're, when you, when you get, I wouldn't say I was a pathological liar, but I was habitual,
2505340	2511740	you know. And if you ask me, where did I get this shirt? I would not, the first,
2512700	2517260	the first thought in my head would not be, where did I get this shirt? It would be,
2518620	2525180	what can I say to put myself at some advantage in this relationship? I wasn't thinking, you know,
2525180	2531820	of the truth. And I had to break myself of those habits by when I caught myself saying something
2531820	2538540	dishonest to tell people right then, what I said to you just now is not per truth. And the pain
2538540	2545340	of doing that a couple of times was what, you know, allowed me to move. I remember reading very,
2545340	2556140	very early on about an obituary at C. S. Lewis, who was a great theologian who wrote the Narnia books
2556140	2561900	and, you know, and a brilliant novelist. But he wrote this obituary about a friend of his
2562860	2569820	where he described his friend as honest as the daylight. And I read that phrase and I was like,
2569820	2578940	wow, I wish, I wish that someday somebody would say that about me. And around that time, I was in
2578940	2587100	court, I was arguing in front of a federal judge in white planes. And he asked me a question,
2587180	2593740	I said something that was not true. And then I sat down and my opponent got up and it was something
2593740	2598780	that I could have never gotten exposed on or caught. It was only slightly an exaggeration.
2600220	2606620	But I sat down and it would have no consequence to me, could never have any consequence to me other
2606620	2614060	than just my conscience eating at me. And I sat down and I was like, you know, wow, that was not
2614060	2620940	true. The next time I got up, I said to the judge, I just want to say something what I said to you,
2620940	2626460	you know, was not true. And there was like this unsilenced in the courtroom, because nobody'd
2626460	2634620	ever heard a lawyer do that before. And then it just went on. And like, and but the pain of doing
2634620	2640780	that a couple of times, you will get on as you get struck on it as quickly because it's so agonizing
2640780	2649180	to give yourself up. That got me kind of a better habit of, you know, of being on it. And right now
2649180	2657260	it's critical, you know, from my I understand it's critical for my survival. So I'm married to
2657260	2662060	somebody who I don't think is ever told a lot in her life, you know, and she's an example.
2663020	2667980	She's a role model for me, but she has no impulse to it. It's like she has
2670140	2676620	she just I've never heard her say anything even slightly self promoting or dishonest or
2676620	2685740	distorted or even exaggeration. And she still manages to be very funny and very interesting.
2686300	2692860	Wow, that's awesome. Thank you. So let me my friend Alex Mandozian, who's here,
2692860	2699340	he sent this over to me via text, I don't know, maybe a month ago. And it's when it's a quote from
2699340	2704940	Thomas Jefferson. When the people fear their government, there's tyranny. When a government
2704940	2711500	fears its people, there's liberty. What are your thoughts on that? I think, you know, there are a
2711500	2718780	couple of what I would call alchemies of demagoguery. There are there are buttons that we all have
2720460	2727100	that are that were installed in us during the 20,000 generations that human beings
2728300	2735100	were wandering the African savanna and little groups and warlike groups fighting with other
2735100	2740700	groups defending themselves against, you know, lions and predators and trying to feed themselves.
2741820	2749500	And and a lot of our our hard wiring was installed during that key evolutionary period.
2750460	2755420	And, you know, we were following a small a powerful male leader and
2756460	2761420	doing what we were told and you had to have a unit cohesion and you had to behave like everybody
2761500	2765740	else because otherwise you wouldn't we're arguing with the leader all the time.
2766780	2773660	You had to do things and we're all have that programming internally. And so there's a couple
2773660	2779500	of things that every demagogue can use to manipulate people. And one of those is fear.
2780780	2788540	And because it disables our capacity for critical thinking. And during the, you know,
2789100	2794700	actually during the Great Depression, even before the war in 1932, Franklin Roosevelt
2795820	2800220	gave a speech where he said to the American public, the only thing we have to fear is fear
2800220	2807180	itself is after Wall Street crash. And what he was saying then was that he saw what was happening
2807180	2813500	in Europe, which was suffering from the same depression. And in Eastern Europe, in Russia,
2813820	2821260	and the Soviet Union, oh, democracy was collapsing everywhere because of the economic pressure.
2821260	2826700	And you were seeing the rise of tyrants on the right and tyrants on the left. And each one was
2826700	2833660	using fear. And the other alchemy of demagoguery, which is racism, point to minority groups and
2833660	2838700	saying they, you know, they did it to you, they're dangerous to you. So these are all things that
2838700	2845580	were installed on us, you know, during that multimillion-year period. And people can come and
2845580	2853820	exploit them today and disable our capacity for critical thinking. Oh, what Roosevelt was saying
2853820	2863340	is the fear is actually our enemy. If we have confidence, we can restore American capitalism.
2863340	2869500	At that point, 30% of the people in this country believe that capitalism had failed and that the
2869500	2875260	answer was communism. And 30% believe that capitalism had failed and that the answer was fascism.
2876380	2881660	And there was a small minority who still believed, you know, in democracy and free market capitalism.
2882780	2887180	And Roosevelt, through his strength of character, through his persuasion, through his
2887180	2895500	absolute indomitable calmness, was able to tell people, don't be scared, the fear is your enemy
2895500	2900940	because fear is going to be used by demagoguers like Father Coughlin at that time or Huey Long
2902060	2908220	or these other demagoguers who were trying to, you know, drum up anger and fear. And he said,
2908220	2915580	you know, that is the enemy. If we stay calm, we'll come out of this. And he was able to restore
2915580	2920940	American capitalism because of that. And it's an important lesson, you know, during COVID,
2920940	2927900	you had both Republican and Democratic governments that were using fear to manipulate people,
2927900	2934140	to tell us, do this, do that, and not, you know, they were telling us to do things that they knew
2934140	2940460	and we knew were wrong, to allow censorship of critics, to allow doctors to be silenced,
2941260	2945740	allow people who said they were injured to be silenced, to ask people who were standing up
2945740	2950300	for the children and saying, wait a minute, how can you keep kids out of school? They have no
2950300	2958540	vulnerability to COVID. Shut them up. And to silence everybody, silence, you know, where I was,
2958540	2965420	they were giving $1,000 tickets to surfers who were out on the ocean and telling them to go home
2966140	2971900	or disease. And even then, we knew, did not spread outdoors, but it spread at home when you're
2971900	2977900	locked up. And it was crazy what we were being told to do, but everybody was complying because
2977900	2984300	they were using fear. And to me, you know, my party, the Democratic Party, I said this, you know,
2984300	2991420	time and again, I said, you know, Roosevelt told us, don't use fear. And yet, the entire government
2991420	2995740	strategy at that time was just to scare the hell out of everybody. You remember, they had the COVID
2995740	3001580	death count every day on CNN, ticking like a time bomb that it was going to come and get you. And
3001580	3008140	everybody was put in this state of, you know, your neighbor is a biohazard. Don't go near them.
3008140	3012860	And, you know, and we were telling our kids, putting masks on our kids and telling them not to
3012860	3019900	go to, not to smile at their friends, not to hug their friends. And it was atomizing society
3019900	3026860	and fragmenting it and making it, you know, and that kind of society is very easy to manipulate.
3028700	3038460	You know, I'll tell you, can I do one other? There's a, there was a, another one of those
3038460	3045580	alchemies, one of those buttons, is our, our tendency from all those years we spent on the
3045580	3052620	Africans of Anna to follow a strong leader, a person of authority, particularly a male leader,
3053420	3059020	who will tell us what to do. So there's an experiment called that, you know, the CIA
3059900	3068140	financed a lot of studies during the 1950s and 1960s. And it's here to, to remind control studies,
3068140	3072780	to figure out how do you manipulate individuals to become a Manchurian candidate? How do you
3072780	3079260	manipulate whole societies in order to impose foreign control or totalitarian control?
3080620	3085020	The names of the program, the first ones were Operation Bluebird, Operation Hearty Choke.
3086380	3095020	And then the later ones were called MK, Naomi, MK Dietrich, MK Ultra. The MK stands for Mind Control.
3095980	3102940	And they were financing hundreds of studies in universities around the country by usually
3102940	3109100	sociologists or psychiatrists or social scientists to do different experiments with
3109900	3117580	psychedelic drugs, with torture, with sensory deprivation, with, with, you know, sound deprivation
3117580	3129420	for various forms of other psychiatric drugs, etc. One of those studies was a, was a guy called
3129420	3139500	Stanley Milgram, who was an associate professor at Yale. And he did a study where he recruited
3139500	3145660	about 60 people from all walks of life, students, professors, blacks, whites, business people.
3146620	3153660	Um, every kind of American. And he would bring them in and put them in a room where they had a dial
3153660	3159500	in front of them. And they were told if they turned that dial, it would give an electric pulse
3160620	3166060	to a person who was tied to a chair in the adjoining room. They couldn't see that person. And that
3166060	3173260	person was in fact an actor who was a confederate of Dr. Milgram's. But when they turned it up,
3174060	3181340	he would scream and struggle and plead and beg and cry. So, and Dr. Milgram would say,
3181340	3186460	turn it up, turn it down, turn it up, turn it down, turn it higher, turn it down, turn it higher.
3187420	3192380	And people who were part of that experiment, who were this, you know, the people who were there,
3192380	3198620	recruits the subject, a lot of them were weeping because they did not want to do it. And yet
3198700	3203820	Dr. Milgram was there in a lab coat with, you know, all of these badges on him and stuff. So,
3203820	3209980	he was this visible figure of authority. Sixty, you can look this up on Wikipedia, which you
3209980	3218780	should not believe for other, but I guess they're actually telling the truth. But if you, but 67%
3219500	3226700	of the people in that experiment turned it up to 250 folks where it was marked
3227260	3236380	potentially lethal. The good news is that 33% of the people got up and walked out.
3237580	3243420	So, there's a, there's a cadre of people who maintain their capacity for critical thinking,
3243420	3251980	even when all of these sort of atavistic stimuli are, are applied against them to disable that.
3252940	3258860	And, you know, that I think is our aim in a democracy is to try to be part of that group of
3258860	3267420	33% who can't be manipulated by fear and can't be manipulated by racism or anti-Semitism or,
3267420	3273420	you know, all of these other alchemies of demagoguery or authority figures. You know,
3273420	3279180	and my father told me a couple of weeks before he died, I had a conversation with him where he
3279180	3285980	said to me, people in authority lie. And, you know, that is something that is critical in a
3285980	3291820	democracy for the public to know our job, part of our job in democracy is to question everything.
3292860	3301420	You know, this phrase, trust the experts, it's not a thing. It's a, it certainly is not a feature
3301420	3308300	of democracy. It's not a feature of science. In science, you don't trust the experts. Never.
3309420	3315740	You know, I've sued five, I've had, what, over 500 cases. And in each one of them,
3315740	3319900	there was scientific controversy. There was experts on both sides when I sued Monsanto.
3320780	3329020	Monsanto came in with experts from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. My wife, who's an actor,
3330220	3336700	came to court that day on the last day in their testimony. She watched these people and then
3336700	3342940	afterwards, and they were so convincing. She walked out and she said, why are you even troubling
3342940	3351180	this poor company to me? I would like wait till tomorrow. The next day, we had our experts from
3351180	3357820	Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, and the jury gave us $2.2 billion. They had heard both of them,
3357820	3362380	and they had to decide which expert is lying. And experts have their own prejudice,
3362380	3368700	they have their own biases, and their own ambitions, et cetera. And so it's not, you know,
3368700	3374700	trusting the experts is not a feature of science. It's not a feature of democracy. It's a feature
3374700	3384780	of religion and totalitarianism, but it's not something you do. Well, you know, we were all
3384860	3391740	told to do it, right? Again and again, trust the experts. And it's not, it's something that
3391740	3400140	should settle arms off. Yeah, so I want to ask you about the way that I view what has happened
3400700	3410220	during the pandemic was the biggest manipulation mindfuck that's ever I've ever seen in my life.
3410220	3417580	And the 66%, that's scary when you can be manipulated like that, which means there's a
3417580	3423180	lot of vulnerability out there. And so one of the things that led me into addiction was I was
3423180	3429820	raped and molested as a kid. And so I view what pharma and what a lot of these agencies did was
3429820	3435260	they, they raped the population. They raped the globe because rape is non consensual. It's
3435260	3440780	penetration without consent. And they did it with syringes. They did it with drugs. They did
3440780	3446460	it with massive manipulation and lots of money behind it. And it was just atrocious. And I feel
3446460	3452060	so sad for people that aren't in the position that myself and many people here that lost their jobs
3452060	3458300	that don't have a lot of financial resources and the people that ultimately whose lives were heard
3458300	3463900	and destroyed the most were people that were poor. And, and then everyone else, you know,
3463900	3468380	psychologically, there's so many things that happen. So if someone wants to get to get a vaccine,
3468940	3472460	okay, if you want to get a vaccine, but when it's forced upon you, when you're manipulated
3472460	3476140	into it, that's a whole nother level. And so I think there should be a hashtag that's something
3476140	3480460	like pharma rapes or something like that. Maybe that I don't know. But there's a part of me that's
3480460	3485660	like, you know, I really don't want to take the get angry and, you know, I mean, I love your
3485660	3491660	approach. You're very, you're very conscientious about not wanting to, you know, continue the
3491660	3495180	battles and the fighting between each other and trying to bring people together. And that's a,
3495740	3500140	that's a tough rope to, to walk. I mean, do you internally, are you just
3501580	3506140	pissed about this? Or you just like, you know, I just, I'm going to do what I can do. I mean,
3506140	3511580	how do you, what is your emotional state as you take on battles stronger than anyone that I've
3511580	3516620	seen at least in that department? I mean, this book, the real Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Big
3516620	3521900	Pharma and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health, which sold over a million copies
3521900	3527660	with zero features in mainstream media. You've got thousands of reviews, almost all five stars.
3527660	3532060	It's all cited. It's all documented. And when I hear people say, well, he's a kook. He doesn't
3532060	3536780	know what he's talking about. I mean, you put more data here, not just you, but all the top
3536780	3542940	doctors that have been, you know, just treated so horribly. I mean, their careers ruined. And
3542940	3549980	what do they get for it? They're just trying to help people. And so, you know, I guess my question
3549980	3557020	for you is with, this is still happening. And is that, I mean, out of all the reasons that you're,
3557020	3561660	you're running for president, I mean, what are the main ones? What would, what do you really hope to,
3563020	3571100	to do? I mean, you know, one of the reasons that this happened, you know, one of the reasons that,
3571180	3577660	that inspired me to run was I say this chronic disease epidemic in our country. And we have,
3577660	3588060	when my uncle was president, 6% of Americans had chronic disease. And, and today, and then by 1986,
3589900	3600300	11.8 had chronic disease. I 2006, 54% of kids had chronic disease. And we don't know what it is today
3600300	3608220	because at that point, NIH stopped publishing the data. They do not want us to see this happening.
3608220	3614380	And to me, it's the biggest thing that's happening right now. The cost of healthcare in this country,
3614380	3620460	the cost of the military, you know, which was supposed to go down to 200 billion a year after
3620460	3626380	the wall came down 1992, we were promised a piece of it. And it's now 1.3 trillion a year.
3627340	3633340	But the cost of healthcare is 4.3 trillion. And 93% of that is chronic disease.
3634540	3643660	These are new diseases, mostly. So what my chronic disease, there's basically four categories. There's
3643660	3655580	obesity when my uncle was president. 6% of American kids were obese today, 42%. And 75% are overweight.
3656380	3663500	They didn't, American kids did not suddenly become lazy. They're being poisoned, mass poisoned,
3664140	3671100	and by something. And we're all being lied to about it. And then neurological diseases,
3671100	3679180	all these diseases had suddenly appeared in the early 90s. ADD, ADHD, speech-related, language-related,
3679180	3685580	ticks, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism. None of us ever heard of these diseases when I was
3685580	3693580	a kid. I worked at the dead center of the battle for rights for people with intellectual disabilities.
3693580	3699180	My aunt, you know, Schreiber, started Special Olympics. I was working at it as a hugger and as
3699180	3703180	a coach. When I was eight years old, I worked for 200 hours. And I was saying, go home from the
3703180	3708860	Ritz-Arden when I was in high school, because this was part of our family DNA. And I never saw a kid
3708860	3718860	with autism, full-blown autism. The CDC's data say that in my generation today, today, right now,
3720220	3728940	autism in 69-year-old men, one in 10,000. And in our children, my children's generation, one in 34.
3729500	3738060	So what happened? Well, Congress said to EPA, what year did the autism epidemic begin?
3738060	3743180	EPA is a captive agency. It's captive by the oil industry, the coal industry, and the pesticide
3743180	3748940	industry. But it's not captive by pharma, because it doesn't regulate pharma. So they actually did
3748940	3756700	a real study. And they came back and said, 1989, it's a red line. That is the year the epidemic started.
3756700	3762780	Well, a lot of other chronic disease epidemics started at that time as well.
3764220	3770700	Allergies. I had 11 siblings, 70 cousins. I never knew anybody with a peanut allergy.
3771580	3777580	Nobody, prior to 1989, heard of peanut allergies. And now there's EpiPens in every classroom.
3777980	3788300	What happened? Something happened in 1989. And then eczema, nobody ever heard of eczema.
3788300	3794380	When I was a kid, now it's everywhere. It's all these allergies. It's anaphylaxis, asthma.
3795420	3801980	My brother had asthma. He was told by his doctor that there will never be a cure for asthma,
3801980	3807660	because it's so rare and nobody will ever study it. Well, today, one out of every black kids in
3807660	3814300	urban areas has asthma. And then the autoimmune disease, 120 autoimmune disease that we never
3814300	3823740	heard of, juvenile diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, all of this stuff
3823740	3829340	that nobody ever heard of, and suddenly it's everywhere. And why is nobody asking, where is
3829340	3837260	it coming from? So the pharma is, of course, making money on it. That $4.3 trillion, the 93% of that,
3838300	3844940	that goes for $600 EpiPens, Albuterol inhalers, any seizure medications, insulin syringes,
3845900	3853900	they're cashing in on it. And NIH, right now, instead of doing science and asking the one question
3853900	3860380	they should be asking, where is it coming from? Instead, they have changed the purpose of that
3860380	3866860	agency to become an incubator for new pharmaceutical drugs, which they keep half of. Of the Moderna
3866860	3872700	vaccine, NIH owns half that vaccine. They get half the royalties. They're making tens of billions
3872700	3880540	of dollars on it. And there are six individuals at NIH who have marching rights to the patent,
3881100	3889660	who are each collecting $150,000 a year forever from that vaccine. And so these naturally, the
3889660	3895660	mercantile ambitions of the individual and the agency subsumed the regulatory function of those
3895660	3901980	agencies. And I'm going to end that. And I'm going to go over there during the first week.
3901980	3914220	I'm going to go over to Bethesda, my first week in office, and I'm going to get all of the big
3914220	3922460	wigs from NIH together. And I'm going to say, NIH gives away $42 billion a year, and it gives
3922460	3929580	it to 56,000 scientists, universities all over the country. And what they're doing now is mainly
3929580	3934300	developing pharmaceutical drugs to treat the chronic disease epidemic. And if anybody tries to
3934300	3943660	study, well, where's it coming from? They get a threat from NIH. Do not study that. And NIH can
3943660	3949340	bankrupt their college. NIH can bankrupt any medical school in the country simply by not giving the
3949340	3955340	$300 billion, $300 million a year that that medical skill is getting every year from NIH to study
3956300	3962460	cures, cures, and treatments for chronic disease. Oh, I'm going to go down there and I'm going to
3962460	3967900	say we're going to give infections, disease, a break, and drug development a break. And we're
3967900	3973900	going to, for the next eight years, we're going to figure out where's the chronic, why are our kids,
3973900	3981420	the sickest kids in the world, why do we have the highest chronic disease burden of any country in
3981420	3987340	the world? Why do we have the highest four times highest healthcare costs in the world and the worst
3988460	3996700	outcomes? Why are we 79th in the world behind Mongolia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Costa Rica in healthcare?
3996700	4007020	Why? Why did we have the highest body count from COVID on earth? We had 16% of the COVID deaths in
4007020	4014060	this country. We only have 4.2% of the global population. Why? Well, CDC said part of it is just
4014060	4022380	mismanagement. The other part is we have the highest chronic disease rate burden and COVID was killing
4022380	4031980	people with great CDC. The average American who died from COVID had 3.8 chronic diseases. So they
4031980	4040620	had diabetes, they had asthma, they had obesity, and one more. That's what was killing people.
4040620	4047420	It was not COVID. COVID pushed them off the cliff, but the chronic disease got them to the top of
4047420	4055900	the cliff with one foot over. So I'm going to go down there and I'm going to say we're going to
4055900	4070060	identify. There's a famous toxicologist in New York named Phil Landrigan. I have used him on many,
4070060	4077980	many cases. He's a genius and he's very careful now about hanging out with me because the association
4077980	4088700	could hurt his reputation. But Phil Landrigan has done a series of studies to say, yeah,
4088700	4095180	something happened in 1989 and what could it be? We know it's not genes. Genes don't cause
4095180	4103980	epidemics. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So what was it?
4103980	4110940	What environmental toxins are there that are in the category of suspects? That became ubiquitous
4110940	4118220	around 1989. That affected every demographic from Cubans and Cubis game Miami to Inuit and Alaska.
4119100	4125980	And that impact boys on neurological injuries of 4 to 1 ratio to girls. What is there that
4125980	4134460	could be that? And he's come on with about 13 or 14 things that it could possibly be. One of those
4134460	4145340	is glyphosate from Roundup that fits that timeline perfectly. Another is atrazine, which is another
4145340	4150780	pesticide, which is now in 63% of the water systems in the country, neonicotoid pesticides.
4151740	4157980	Same thing. PFOAs and PFAS is the forever chemicals that were put around that timeline
4157980	4162780	in all of our furniture and all of our children's pajamas. They're flame retardants.
4166140	4172540	Wi-Fi radiation from cell phones. Ultra sound radiation. Some of these things to me are not
4172540	4181260	suspects, but they have to be treated as suspects so we can eliminate them. High fructose corn
4181260	4188780	syrup, which clearly is part of the explanation for the obesity and the diabetes epidemic.
4188780	4196780	So there's a small universe and we have all the data we need already to figure out who's doing it.
4197660	4202940	And what I'll do is I'll go down there and say that's what we're going to do and we're going to
4202940	4209420	find out. And then the vaccine schedule, which went in 1989, we went from three vaccines to
4210220	4217740	72 vaccines. The three vaccines I got as a kid, my kids got 72, mandated. And the big
4217740	4225180	change here was 1989. So that has to be a suspect too. So it's probably all of them or a large part
4225180	4229340	of them, our kids are now swimming around in a toxic soup and they're getting all of these
4229340	4236540	exposures that operate along the same biological pathways and they're probably cumulative. But
4236540	4242460	let's find out and then let's eliminate them. And you can say to me, well, even if you find out
4242460	4247820	it's a high fructose corn syrup, by the way, if you drink Coca-Cola, you should drink Mexican Coke
4248380	4254860	and other stuff at the high fructose. But let's say we find out it's high fructose corn syrup.
4254860	4260140	What can you do about it? There's million farmers who are tied in that industry. There's big industrial
4260140	4267020	BMS like Cargill and Un Santo and these huge players. You can never change it, but you can.
4267020	4273020	The same way that we did with Roundup. We got Roundup taken out of all home gardening because
4273980	4280620	once there's a certain critical mass of science, you can get past this threshold in the courts
4280620	4286220	called the Dalbert Threshold where you're allowed to take that case to a jury. If there's about
4286220	4291340	15 studies that say the same thing, you have animal studies, bench studies, human studies,
4292220	4296780	they also at some point the judge will say, yeah, you can take this case to a jury. There's not,
4296780	4301660	well, I'm going to create the science. And at that point, you don't need to change your regulations
4301660	4308940	because the plaintiff's bar will go out there and vindicate that product and get it off the
4308940	4313180	market for that purpose. So anyway, that's the long answer to your question.
4315420	4322700	So I've studied marketing and promotions most of my adult life and used that for business. And
4322700	4330300	also now with a genius recovery, my foundation, trying to get my objective there is to change
4330300	4335020	the global conversation about how people view and treat addicts with compassion instead of judgment
4335020	4339100	and find the best forms of treatment that have efficacy and share it with the world. And just
4339100	4343900	earlier today we announced we have a, we're going to launch a recovery kit to help people with that.
4343900	4350380	And so I think a lot about packaging and you've got so many studies and so much data and so much
4350380	4359900	research in your book, The Real Anthony Fauci that I communicated to Tony from Sky Horse
4359900	4368700	the publisher to create like cards and decks of all of the information in a shareable form,
4368700	4374220	kind of like an Eckertoll meditation deck or, you know, tarot cards. But with all of this data,
4374220	4380860	so that people can take it in sound bites, because they're, I'm constantly, I don't know how all of
4380860	4386540	this research that you have in here exists. And Anthony Fauci is still walking around a free man.
4386540	4394940	Like when Elon Musk said, arrest Anthony Fauci, what is going on? And I'd be curious of,
4395660	4400780	you know, some of these people that seem like the just ultimate James Bond villains,
4400780	4406540	that they just want to watch the world burn. And they, it's just crazy to me. So
4407980	4414300	how is someone like that who, and Bill Gates, I didn't have any idea just how behind, I mean,
4414300	4418060	I'd love for you, because here we are, a lot of people have probably no idea when they hear me,
4418060	4422460	Bill Gates, I met him in 2006 at All Things Digital. I used to admire him. I thought he was
4422460	4428620	this incredible businessman. And when you see what he's actually doing and what he's funding,
4428620	4433580	and there's so much of it, that it gets past the point of coincidence. I mean, this person has an
4433580	4438700	agenda, like what are some things I'd love for you to just rattle off some things about Bill Gates,
4438700	4441900	because you know so much about what he's doing and what he funds.
4443580	4448300	Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I do do in this book, first of all, that the book's been
4448300	4454780	through, I think probably about 15 to 20 editions, and in the first edition, and all of them,
4456060	4461420	I've note in the beginning that says, if you find a mistake in this book, we want to hear about it.
4461420	4467340	And we will then change it in subsequent editions. I don't want to be pushing information that is
4467420	4473820	wrong. Oh, you know, people accuse me, you know, including the government of passing on misinformation.
4475180	4482700	My organization has probably the best fact-checking resources in the country. We have a team of
4482700	4492940	350 PhD scientists, MD physicians, who are part of our scientific advisory team, and
4493020	4499340	including until he died recently, Luke Montanier won the Nobel Prize for discovering the HIV virus
4499340	4506060	in 1983. And none of these people would be part of our team if we were promoting misinformation.
4506060	4512140	In fact, you know, what we now know from the Twitter files is that when they were, when the
4512140	4520300	White House was telling Twitter to remove me and Instagram, which they did, Facebook actually
4520300	4526780	pushed back and said, what he's saying is actually true. It's not misinformation. And they had to
4526780	4535020	invent a new term called malinformation, which is information that is true, but it is nevertheless
4535020	4543260	inconvenient for the government. And so, you know, I invite people to find an error. There's 2,200
4543260	4550300	footnotes, and there's the new book that just comes out today, I think, on the Wuhan cover-up
4550300	4558540	as 3,300. What I never try to do is to look into Bill Gates' head, or to Anthony Fauci's head,
4558540	4562220	because I don't know what's going on there. I don't know why they made these decisions.
4562220	4569660	I can show these patterns of behavior that were tremendously cynical and self-interested.
4569660	4575900	And I can show that they knew or had reason to know the injuries that they were causing,
4575900	4583020	the faults in the science like Remdesivir, which Gates was one of the biggest owners of Gilead.
4584060	4591820	And we can document that Fauci knew that Remdesivir was going to kill people,
4591820	4598300	and that was going to kill more people than it helped. And that he changed the study, altered
4598300	4606700	the study outcomes three separate times to make it appear that it was effective, and then got that
4606700	4613420	approved as the only approved treatment for COVID. And it's probably one of the reasons we had the
4613420	4619100	highest death rate in this country. But I can show that again and again, but I don't look into his
4619100	4625100	head and say, here's what he was doing, he was thinking, because I don't know. And I only write
4625100	4631420	things that I can document. And so, you know, what I would urge people to do is read, you know,
4631420	4638300	a chapter or two and, you know, make a... I mean, yeah, read it. By the way, what we did here is we put
4639580	4647500	with each footnote, there's a QR code so that you can, on your phone, you can look up that study
4648140	4651820	right there while you're reading. You don't have to go someplace. I think it's the first
4652140	4659500	book that did that. And so, every study, all those 2,200 studies that are in there are quotes or
4659500	4665980	whatever. While you're reading the book, in real time, you can go to that study and look at the
4665980	4674220	source document. Yeah. And it is amazing. And what's even more is just how many copies of this
4674220	4679900	you sold, where there was so much attempts to... No PR, nothing was talking about it. And you
4679900	4683580	sold over a million copies. I think it's like a million and a half or something at this point.
4684940	4691020	All right. So, would you guys like to take a picture with Bobby in a little bit? Okay. We'll
4691020	4697820	do that quickly. So, let me ask you a couple more things. First off, I want to give you an
4697820	4703500	opportunity. What if I not asked you, or anything that you feel would be really useful for entrepreneurs
4703500	4709820	to hear? I mean, you are... You're running for president. I mean, this has got to be... You
4709820	4713980	grew up in a family, though. I mean, this has got to be one of the most stressful things,
4713980	4717420	but maybe it's just the environment you grew up in and you're built for this. I don't know.
4717420	4727260	I mean, I have not... I've been very... I felt very peaceful about this, what I'm doing. There's not
4727340	4736780	been any time weirdly since I've started... Since I launched this campaign that I've said,
4737500	4743580	I wish I hadn't done this or what the heck am I doing? I've had that experience with other stuff.
4746220	4753580	There's many times when I... In rock climbing or when I do a white water... A stretch of
4753820	4759580	sort of airy white water, there's a lot of times where I've said, why am I doing this?
4761100	4768060	But I've never had one of those moments with this. And my wife is happy. And I think my kids are
4769820	4776220	happy and proud of me. But what I tried to do is not project about things, but just to live one day
4776220	4784780	at a time to do my best and then to let the outcome is in God's hands. I had... I came out of the
4784780	4792700	environmental movement and I saw a lot of people who were... If you're in the environmental movement,
4792700	4799100	every victory that you have is temporary and every defeat is permanent. You destroy
4800060	4806460	extinguished species, you're not getting them back. You destroy a sacred piece of land and
4807100	4814540	pave it over and it's never coming back. And what I watched during those years was a lot of people
4814540	4821100	who were advocates, who were friends of mine, who just got soul crushed because they'd give their
4821100	4827900	lives to preserve a creek or resource or a piece of land. They'd see it destroyed and they would
4827900	4833420	just withdraw and go into isolation and lose hope. And I just said, I'm not going to ever let that
4833420	4841180	happen to me. I'm going to. I don't have any control over what happens ultimately. That is in God's
4841180	4846700	hands. The only thing I control is this little piece of real estate inside my own shoes.
4848140	4853580	That's the only thing I can control. And I can get up every day and say, reporting for duty, sir,
4854300	4861740	and then go forward and try to keep doing the next right thing, to make my bed, to put the water
4861740	4867180	in the ice tray before I put it in the freezer, to put the shopping cart back where the shopping
4867180	4872940	cart is supposed to go, to do the... Are you going out shopping right now? One at a time.
4872940	4882860	There's just a secret. And as long as I do that, I can be peaceful. And it makes... To me,
4882860	4888700	it gives me power because it makes me... Because I feel like I cannot be defeated. And no matter
4888700	4894460	what kind of blow that I get dealt, I'm going to get up again. And I'm going to fight because
4894460	4901260	I've detached from the outcomes. I don't have expectations. I try not to, so I'll never have
4901260	4908220	disappointments. And that, I think, it makes me a much more effective advocate for people.
4909100	4914300	I mean, you put out a video on Thanksgiving about gratitude that I thought was just absolutely
4914300	4921580	incredible. And I never really studied or followed politics that much. I would talk to my friends that
4921580	4926140	did prior to the pandemic happening. And then I really started... It was a giant wake-up call of,
4926140	4931740	wow, who's really running things? I have no idea who's actually running the country right now.
4931740	4938620	Certainly is not Joe Biden. But if not that this would ever happen, but if it did, if Joe Biden or
4938620	4943980	Donald Trump came to you and asked you for advice, what would you tell them? I would give them advice.
4943980	4956220	I'd say you should get out of this race. That's a great soundbite right there. That's really good.
4956620	4964540	Wow. So, you know, with all our flaws and the flaws of our founding fathers, I still believe
4964540	4970380	the great American experiment is worth fighting for. And you've, you're taking on one hell of a
4970380	4978780	battle here. And what sort of helper support do you need the most right now? Well, I mean, the
4978780	4985020	biggest, the most support we need right now is financial support. I have to get on that because
4985020	4991180	I'm not running at a political party. I have to get on the ballot in all 50 states. And that means
4991180	4997420	a million signatures, different configurations of signatures. On average, it's going to cost us
4997420	5003820	about $14 or $15 of signatures. So I need to raise $15 million. And you can do that
5005500	5012220	from big donors. If you get one big donor and I need that, you know, they can give to the super
5012220	5018300	pack, but the campaign itself has to do the ballot access. And so the top donation, the maximum
5018300	5027740	donation under federal law is $6,600. And they, and, you know, I need to raise in $6,600 increments,
5027740	5032780	I need to raise $15 million to do that. And then, you know, people who will volunteer,
5034620	5040700	go to kennedy24.com. And, you know, if you have anything, if you have resources, intellectual
5040700	5047340	resources, advice, whatever, I'd love to hear from you. But mainly right now, I need to,
5047340	5053820	I need to raise money for our ballot fight. Okay. Okay. I was having lunch with today,
5053820	5062540	with some of the group, and a woman had said to me about protection and why have you not been
5062540	5068060	granted security protection by the president? And this was put in place because your father was
5068060	5074220	assassinated, and you still have not gotten it, is what need, and she had mentioned, what can we
5074220	5080140	do to help with that? Who do you send an email to? What do you do to get you protection? Because
5080140	5084460	you're paying for your own security right now? Yeah, I mean, they used to, people can send,
5085100	5092380	you know, an email to the White House. You know what, as you said, the candidates,
5092700	5098300	I mean, historically, the candidates did not get secret service protection until they were,
5098300	5106700	until after the conventions. And then, when my dad was killed in 68, I was with him at that time,
5106700	5111980	they immediately provided secret service protection to all the other candidates, to George McGovern,
5111980	5117500	George Wallace, Hubert Humphrey, and Zeta, who were running at the same time. And then Congress
5117500	5124460	passed a law that said that every candidate, as long as they're there, they exceed a certain metric,
5125660	5133660	which I've exceeded for six months, is entitled to secret service protection 120 days
5135180	5141580	prior to the general election. But in practice, the president can provide it to anybody
5141580	5146780	on request. And I'm the first candidate in history who has requested it and not been provided. I've
5146780	5155660	had a number of credible death threats, including three break-ins at my house and, you know, a guy
5155660	5163420	who showed up trying to get to me in the green room prior to his speech in Los Angeles, who I,
5163420	5170860	you know, I have a security team that spotted him because he had fake U.S. Marshall badges,
5170860	5177340	a badge, he had fake Federal ID, and then he was carrying a lot of concealed weapons. He had two
5177340	5182540	shoulder holsters with full magazines, and then he had a lot of weapons in a backpack, including
5185020	5191420	laser scope, pistol, with full magazines, a lot of action magazines, guns and stuff.
5192380	5197660	My team detained him, held him for the police, he was trying to find me,
5198620	5206300	and the police then arrested him. He said that he wanted to find me for a job interview,
5207180	5221500	which, yeah, so then, but my uncle, Ted Kennedy, when he ran in 1980, he was given secret service
5221500	5228300	protection by President Carter, and they didn't like each other. They really had a lot of personal
5228380	5235260	antipathy toward each other, but my Carter gave him secret service protection 450 days out, and
5237580	5245020	Obama received it 450 days out. I think 30, maybe over 30 candidates have received it
5245660	5252380	before the 120 days. Jesse Jackson, Mitt Romney, almost anybody that you can name received it
5252380	5257340	early, so it's standard to provide it early, but I think they know that I have to, you know,
5257340	5265180	one out of every $3 that I raise is going to my security team, so I think the White House is playing
5265180	5276220	hardball and has decided that they're going to try to hurt me financially, which is not really
5276220	5284460	in the spirit of democracy, because when my father became Attorney General in 1961,
5285420	5290940	the first day at work, he called all of the upper staff of the Justice Department, and he said to
5290940	5298620	them, we have one rule. We're never going to politicize this agency. Whether you're a Republican
5298620	5303580	or Democrat, you're treated equally under the law, and I don't want to hear any even rumors
5304780	5312220	that people are giving favoritism to somebody who's Democrat. And that, you know, people believe in
5312380	5317900	the institutions of our country, because we've consistently had leaders who have respected that.
5319100	5324780	And in the last couple of years, we've seen this erosion, or a lot of the federal enforcement
5324780	5332540	agencies are being politicized. And I would say, you know, that it, you know, politicizing the
5332540	5337660	Secret Service is just, is not a good look. We're supposed to be the exemplary democracy in the
5337660	5343420	world, and to say that if people, if you don't like somebody's politics, if they're a political
5343420	5349580	threat, you're not going to give them protection is not, you know, it's just not good for our democracy.
5349580	5358380	Yeah, okay. What, what is the most significant or impactful life decision you think you've ever made?
5359260	5366540	Oh, I mean, you know, I'd have a hard time with that. I mean, my marriage is, is one.
5368300	5374460	My, I wouldn't say that I decided to have kids because it just happens, you know.
5376380	5383900	But I mean, this is one, you know, running is definitely running in this race is definitely
5383900	5391580	life changing. And how do you handle the criticism and the attacks on you? How do you process that?
5391580	5401820	You know, I, I process it by just because I, I was raised in a milieu where we all believe that we
5401820	5407580	would, you know, that our lives would somehow be consumed in some great controversy. And that
5407580	5414780	it would be a privilege for us if we were to be able to take a an important part in that. And,
5414780	5420700	you know, I've, I think I understood from when I was a kid that if you're going to do anything
5420700	5426380	important with your life, that people are going to attack you and that you're going to get criticism,
5426380	5430540	you're going to lose friends, you're going to lose relationships that there's going to be,
5431900	5437500	you know, there's going to be a hero's journey where you go through these tremendous hardships
5438460	5443660	where you go through the valley of death, you feel you're completely alone at some points. And that,
5443660	5449580	that, that's just, that's part of, if you didn't go through that, it would not be very important.
5450380	5459740	So I feel like, you know, whatever I go through is, is, is a privilege to be able to, you know,
5459740	5464300	to do something that's important. And it's just part of it. And then I also,
5465260	5473820	you know, I feel tremendously loved by, by my wife and by my children and by other my friends who
5473820	5478940	are important to me. And I feel like, you know, everybody else is kind of playing, we're all
5478940	5484540	walking through kind of a dream, right? And that, you know, life is a dream and that we have to treat
5484540	5491180	it like that. We have to treat it. We have to ultimately be indifferent to some of the,
5492140	5499660	to some of the defeats that we, that we suffer, some of the criticism, the injuries,
5500940	5505900	the wounds that we suffer. We have to get to a place where we're indifferent about it. There's a
5505900	5515260	famous, I don't know how famous it is, but it's a, it's a story about a monk who was, who, who's,
5515260	5523660	whose monastery was invaded by a warlord in China. All the other monks fled and that the warlord
5523660	5528060	approached this monk who was meditating and tried to talk to him and he ignored the warlord.
5529180	5534860	And finally, warlord gets irritated and he says to the monk, he says, don't you know that I could
5534860	5541420	run you through with my sword without blinking an eye? And the monk says to him, don't you know
5541420	5547500	that I could be run through with your sword without blinking an eye? And ultimately, that's kind of
5547500	5553180	the objective where we all want to be spiritually, where we're indifferent to the personal consequences
5553180	5559980	of everything that we do and that we live our lives for higher purposes. And, you know, the,
5561340	5567900	in the Buddhist tradition, the word nirvana means I'm putting out a fire and that means the fire
5567900	5576380	of ambition, of pride, of, of anger, of a desire. And all of these things that we're supposed to
5576380	5582620	view as just clouds that pass over us and that we take an interest in them, but ultimately are,
5582620	5588860	you know, indifferent and we all go through, you know, difficulties in our lives and we have to be
5588860	5595420	able to weather those difficulties without being crushed in our soul or without being ultimately
5595420	5602060	affected by it and just focus on what we do, you know, and what the choices that we actually get
5602060	5616780	to make. That's ultimately the only thing that's important. Thank you. We've got another evening
5616780	5624700	session, but thank you. Thank you very much. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., everyone, and thank you all very
5624700	5640140	much. Here's his book. Oh, picture over here. Let's do a picture. We'll do this with the book.
5642860	5643260	Thank you.
