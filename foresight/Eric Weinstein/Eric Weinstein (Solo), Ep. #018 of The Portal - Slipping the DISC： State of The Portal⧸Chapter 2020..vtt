00:00.000 --> 00:13.400
Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host Eric Weinstein and this is sort of an unusual

00:13.400 --> 00:17.520
edition of the portal because it's coming at the beginning of a new decade and I wanted

00:17.520 --> 00:21.960
to set some intentions and also to sort of recap where we've been for the last half a

00:21.960 --> 00:27.320
year that the show has been on the on the air and on the internet. There are no notes.

00:27.320 --> 00:31.840
There's nothing planned. What I'd like to do is to just try to speak directly about

00:31.840 --> 00:38.400
some of the things that have been on my mind and give you all my thoughts on your feedback

00:38.400 --> 00:43.240
on the show and where I think we're going to be going to next. So with with your permission,

00:43.240 --> 00:49.040
let's begin. It's been a pretty interesting half of a year. The show has built up a fairly

00:49.040 --> 00:54.560
sizable audience and what's more, there are a lot of influential and important voices

00:54.560 --> 00:59.800
within our audience. So I know that when I'm speaking, I'm reaching a lot of the people

00:59.800 --> 01:04.800
who would be on my dream list of people to interview, to talk to and in fact, to plot

01:04.800 --> 01:11.560
next steps with. So I think we've had a pretty successful run of it. We can still grow the

01:11.560 --> 01:16.120
show bigger, but the show is now large enough that I actually don't mind losing some of

01:16.120 --> 01:22.960
our listeners and some of our viewers by going into more challenging topics. And so I don't

01:22.960 --> 01:28.560
think that our primary goal is going to be building the audience quite as much as it

01:28.560 --> 01:33.640
was during the first six months. Furthermore, I think what's been somewhat confusing is

01:33.640 --> 01:41.280
that we've had, if I recall correctly, 16 different interview episodes and one solo episode

01:41.280 --> 01:47.280
so far. And I don't think that that is exactly what the portal was intended to be. In fact,

01:47.280 --> 01:52.200
you could argue that the portal has not even begun. What we've done is to build up an audience

01:52.200 --> 01:59.040
and to habituate the audience to a different style of interaction. I think we had to figure

01:59.040 --> 02:04.680
out what we were going to do if we wanted to bring you certain high level concepts that

02:04.680 --> 02:09.720
often get lost because the admonition to make sure that you don't lose your audience along

02:09.720 --> 02:14.760
the way means that you never get very far because you're always doing the sort of preliminary

02:14.760 --> 02:18.080
groundwork and you're never actually getting to the meat of the issue. And I think one

02:18.080 --> 02:22.560
of the things that we are very proud of is that we have a very motivated audience who's

02:22.560 --> 02:29.120
willing to sometimes even listen to the show more than once or do it with a notepad so

02:29.120 --> 02:33.160
that if there are unfamiliar concepts, they can be looked up. And in fact, we've noted

02:33.160 --> 02:38.160
that there have been several communities springing up around the show so that people can trade

02:38.160 --> 02:43.560
their questions. And we've been watching you guys answer each other's questions in a way

02:43.560 --> 02:48.920
that's really been gratifying. So having a lot of experts in the audience has been a

02:48.920 --> 02:55.760
huge boon to the show. And we hope to try to figure out how to make community in a meaningful

02:55.760 --> 03:01.320
sense a larger part of the show on a going forward basis. One of those efforts that's

03:01.320 --> 03:06.520
particularly special is that we're trying to enlist artists. That could be visual artists,

03:06.640 --> 03:13.800
it could be digital artists, it could also be musicians. And the idea we have is that

03:13.800 --> 03:21.040
that legion of artists will be able to help push out many of the higher level ideas that

03:21.040 --> 03:28.720
we would find challenging to do just in speech by using sort of the brain's full abilities

03:28.720 --> 03:34.240
to take in new information and also to use the sort of the transcendent modality to kind

03:34.280 --> 03:41.040
of open hearts and minds to truly different and unfamiliar ways of thinking. So I think

03:41.040 --> 03:48.680
we may try to get that going. We need obviously to build a website. We need to have some way

03:48.680 --> 03:54.400
in which people who wish to avoid advertising can can subscribe to the podcast and other

03:54.400 --> 03:59.120
people who want to contribute and be part of this as a movement. We just held our first

03:59.240 --> 04:04.800
live show at the Ice House in Pasadena and thanks everybody who came out. The show sold

04:04.800 --> 04:09.560
out extremely quickly even though we sort of didn't exactly advertise where and when

04:09.560 --> 04:14.800
it was except for cryptically at first. And one of the things that allowed us to do is

04:14.800 --> 04:24.280
to meet the listenership on Moss and you know, it was a truly interesting and in many different

04:24.320 --> 04:29.920
ways diverse group of people. There were pretty even split between anti and pro Trump voices.

04:29.920 --> 04:36.520
People got along great. So we don't seem to be as affected as I was concerned. We might be by

04:36.520 --> 04:43.880
the election cycle. And what I sensed was is that people really want to use the show to coalesce

04:43.880 --> 04:48.880
and come together. And there's a lot of fear at the moment about anything tribal or anything

04:48.920 --> 04:56.400
cult like and therefore anything that might be tribal trades at a discount. So I think we might

04:56.400 --> 05:02.440
actually take a contrarian position and decide that the show in fact deserves more community

05:02.440 --> 05:08.640
based on the way in which we see our our listenership and our viewership going. And so

05:08.640 --> 05:14.920
rather than fear that anything would emerge with leadership because all of course anything with

05:14.920 --> 05:20.320
leadership looks like Hitler to many people. Anything that looks at all ritualistic looks

05:20.320 --> 05:25.560
like a cult. I think we're not going to worry about those things quite so much. So I think if I

05:25.560 --> 05:32.360
can, I'm going to try to realize that in fact the audience is leading and that I need to do a

05:32.360 --> 05:39.440
better job of just accepting that there's a lot of interest in new ways of thinking. And this is

05:39.440 --> 05:44.680
one way of kind of getting unstuck to try to find the portal out of the stasis. And so if the show

05:44.680 --> 05:49.560
is to be true to its original mission, I think we're going to have to take some risks, which might

05:49.560 --> 05:56.640
mean drinking songs, it might mean ritualistic behavior, and hopefully it'll mean a lot more

05:56.640 --> 06:02.800
opportunities to interact through live dates. The show is going to remain unabashedly a commercial

06:02.800 --> 06:08.240
enterprise because otherwise it would never happen. And I want to give a huge shout out to

06:08.400 --> 06:16.760
Cast Media, who has been the original studio and effectively co-producer of the show along with

06:16.760 --> 06:23.160
Jesse Michaels, and the advertisers and the sponsors who've been paying for the equipment for

06:23.160 --> 06:28.240
the people who worked on the show so that nobody had to shell out anything in order to get this.

06:28.240 --> 06:33.920
The show would never have happened if it wasn't taking place as a commercial enterprise. And so

06:34.080 --> 06:38.480
even though some of you find the ads annoying, although others of you find them actually entertaining

06:38.480 --> 06:44.720
or interesting, what we need to do is to come up with a better model and a model in which sponsors

06:44.720 --> 06:51.520
get access to the kind of heart and passion for sticking with the show. So I think I'm going to

06:51.520 --> 06:57.320
try to figure out how the risk-vertiser model works in earnest this year. But it's also important to

06:57.320 --> 07:01.920
me that those of you who wish to avoid having your brain sullied with any kind of commercial

07:01.920 --> 07:07.480
intrusion have an option to do that. We've been doing that through the YouTube videos. And in that

07:07.480 --> 07:14.040
respect, I feel like in general, if you're willing to sit through maybe an initial ad that rolls

07:14.040 --> 07:18.320
before the video goes, you usually have an uninterrupted viewing or listening experience

07:18.320 --> 07:22.920
thereafter. We'll try to get the videos a little bit and better sync with the audio. But most

07:22.920 --> 07:29.320
importantly, what I want to get to is what the show is really about. And the last thing I will

07:29.320 --> 07:35.880
say on the initial housekeeping is we probably needed to recognize earlier that we need your

07:35.880 --> 07:42.280
help. A lot of you guys are audio engineers or your graphic designers or your website builders.

07:42.280 --> 07:49.200
I don't quite know how to source the talent we need from the pool, but I've been bombarded by

07:49.200 --> 07:55.000
wonderful offers from many of you, some of you at the absolute top of your field who want to

07:55.000 --> 08:00.520
help this podcast because you want to see this grow as a movement. And maybe I was slow to

08:00.520 --> 08:07.400
recognize how genuine the interest was. And just to say, thank you. I mean, I think it's just it's

08:07.400 --> 08:12.600
sort of hard to recognize that it's working for various internal psychological reasons. I've been

08:12.600 --> 08:19.600
incredibly touched and I really want to incorporate some of the offers of help because Lord knows

08:19.600 --> 08:24.480
we need it. Just haven't figured out how to do it yet. So stay tuned. I think we'll be organizing

08:24.480 --> 08:31.280
that shortly. We've now got a Facebook group for the portal podcast. We've got an Instagram

08:31.280 --> 08:37.120
account that's growing. Twitter's still our largest following, but the actual subscriptions to the

08:37.120 --> 08:43.760
podcast on both YouTube through Apple and other places are now quite large. And I think it'll

08:43.760 --> 08:50.400
be increasingly hard to shut down these channels to you so that even if we lose one or two of them

08:50.400 --> 08:55.920
because of something we say, hopefully we'll remain engaged and we'll try to make sure that we're

08:55.920 --> 09:03.760
not vulnerable to having the oxygen cutoff. Alright, so what is it that is happening in 2020? What

09:03.760 --> 09:09.920
kind of a decade are we up for? What's going to be going on with the portal during the coming

09:10.800 --> 09:15.680
year, coming 10 years? I think that the first thing that I want to signal is that we are

09:15.680 --> 09:23.120
finally ready to take on something which I have always found terrifying. And that has to do with

09:23.120 --> 09:29.040
idea suppression. Now, before we get to idea suppression and how it functions and what it is,

09:29.600 --> 09:37.040
I want to take new listeners through a very brief description of how we would order the world

09:37.040 --> 09:43.920
relative to the portal and its objectives. So if you will, let me take you back to the end of World

09:43.920 --> 09:50.960
War II. There's a lot of prehistory, but we can't afford to do everything. So shortly after World

09:50.960 --> 09:58.480
War II, there were two very important events in the early 1950s from our perspective, one of which

09:58.480 --> 10:03.440
was the unlocking of the three-dimensional structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953.

10:04.000 --> 10:14.400
And the other was the explosions of hydrogen devices using work of Edward Teller and Stanislaw

10:14.400 --> 10:21.680
Ulam and what that changed in the human picture because we went from a short period where we

10:21.680 --> 10:27.760
were dealing with atomic bombs, where ducking cover was a plausible solution to dealing with

10:27.760 --> 10:35.200
hydrogen devices in which the destructive power was really incalculable. It's the power of gods

10:35.200 --> 10:43.440
used to power the sun here on earth. Now, to my way of thinking, since the early 1950s,

10:43.440 --> 10:50.960
there has been no comparable explosion of wisdom to go along with this new found power that humans

10:51.040 --> 10:55.920
have, this new god-like power. So I've called this the twin nuclei problem of Sel and Adam.

10:57.520 --> 11:02.640
And I think what we've had is an incredible run of luck, and I think it's the most

11:03.360 --> 11:08.960
magical and marvelous thing, but I don't believe that we can count on luck forever. And in fact,

11:08.960 --> 11:17.040
given some of the events of early 2020 taking place in Iraq and Iran, I would say that history

11:17.920 --> 11:24.160
at the scale that we were accustomed to it during the, let's say, first half of the 20th century

11:25.120 --> 11:28.720
could start up at any moment, and we're entirely unprepared for this.

11:30.960 --> 11:36.160
Now, in the story that has this major through line that we've been following,

11:37.440 --> 11:43.040
the next thing that happens that's really important is a guy named Derek DeSola Price

11:44.000 --> 11:48.640
starts to calculate that science is on an exponential trajectory. And rather than

11:48.640 --> 11:53.680
thinking that that's a great thing, he starts to understand that anything on an exponential

11:53.680 --> 12:00.720
trajectory can't really go on because it's going to burn itself out. And if science is the original

12:01.360 --> 12:06.720
seed corn, if you will, of technology and technology of economics, then effectively,

12:06.720 --> 12:11.200
what's going to happen in science is going to percolate through a chain, through technology,

12:11.200 --> 12:18.480
and into the economy with a potential stagnation coming. Now, he started to arrive at these ideas,

12:18.480 --> 12:26.400
I think, at Yale in the late 1950s. It was not well understood what he was talking about. And

12:26.400 --> 12:32.480
still, I'm always shocked that the book Science Since Babylon, which he wrote and which discusses

12:32.480 --> 12:37.760
this issue, is so much less well known than, say, Thomas Kuhn's structure of scientific

12:37.840 --> 12:43.600
revolutions. For some reason, this is so disparate to so many people that we actually don't discuss

12:43.600 --> 12:55.200
it much. Studying this work led to the idea of talking about egos, that is, embedded growth

12:55.200 --> 13:01.120
obligations. Now, embedded growth obligations are the way in which institutions play in their future

13:01.120 --> 13:07.920
predicated on legacies of growth. And since the period between the end of World War II in 1945

13:07.920 --> 13:15.520
and the early 70s had such an unusually beautiful growth regime, many of our institutions became

13:15.520 --> 13:23.200
predicated upon low variance, technology-led, stable, broadly distributed growth. Now, this is

13:23.200 --> 13:30.160
a world we have not seen in an organic way since the early 1970s. And yet, because it was embedded

13:30.160 --> 13:36.880
in our institutions, what we have is a world in which the expectation is still present in the form

13:36.880 --> 13:43.040
of an embedded growth obligation. That is, the pension plans, the corporate ladders are all still

13:43.040 --> 13:48.880
built very much around a world that has long since vanished. We have effectively become a

13:48.880 --> 13:55.920
growth cargo cult. That is, once upon a time, planes used to land in the Pacific, let's say,

13:55.920 --> 14:02.880
during World War II. And the indigenous people looked at the airstrips and the behavior of

14:02.880 --> 14:09.840
the air traffic controllers. And they've been mimicking those behaviors in the years since

14:09.840 --> 14:15.280
as ritual, but the planes no longer land. Well, in large measure, our institutions are built for

14:15.280 --> 14:22.880
a world in which growth doesn't happen in the same way anymore. All right. What then happened

14:22.960 --> 14:27.600
was that a different structure, which I have termed the gated institutional narrative,

14:28.320 --> 14:34.960
came to become repurposed. Now, the gated institutional narrative is like an exchange,

14:34.960 --> 14:40.480
a financial exchange, if you will, except it's an exchange of information and ideas. And in order

14:40.480 --> 14:46.160
to actually participate in this particular special conversation, you need to have a seat

14:46.160 --> 14:52.320
on the exchange. That is, you need to write for an important paper like the Wall Street Journal,

14:52.400 --> 14:58.480
or you need to be a senator or a congressman so that you can gain access to the news media,

14:58.480 --> 15:04.560
or you need to be sitting at a news desk. In any of these situations, whether you're a professor

15:04.560 --> 15:11.440
or a reporter or a politician, if you can gain a seat inside of the gated institutional narrative,

15:11.440 --> 15:17.200
you can attempt to converse with other people within that particular conversation. The rest of

15:17.200 --> 15:23.920
us do not really have the same level or kind of access to this highly rarefied discussion. And I've

15:23.920 --> 15:29.040
previously compared this to what we would term a promotion inside of the world of professional

15:29.040 --> 15:36.560
wrestling. It's an agreed upon structure in which people often agree to simulate dispute,

15:37.280 --> 15:41.600
rather than actually have disputes because somebody could get really seriously injured.

15:41.600 --> 15:48.400
But they're in fact working together to produce an engaging and regular product

15:48.400 --> 15:55.840
for mass consumption. The problem with this gated institutional narrative is that in general,

15:55.840 --> 16:01.600
it doesn't contain the most important ideas. And that is where the gating function comes in.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.440
The most important ideas are likely to be the ideas that are most disruptive. What if the

16:07.440 --> 16:13.120
entire food pyramid, for example, was wildly off? What if fats were not the great danger we

16:13.120 --> 16:20.640
thought they were? And those waving fields of wheat that are fabled in American song, in fact,

16:20.640 --> 16:27.440
give rise to carbs, which are very dangerous to us all. So if everything were inverted, let's say,

16:27.440 --> 16:32.960
where in a world where instead of banishing volatility during the so-called Great Moderation

16:33.040 --> 16:39.440
before 2008, we were actually building the tinder for the world's largest financial forest fire.

16:40.160 --> 16:45.440
What if, in fact, we had all sorts of things exactly backwards and completely wrong? What if

16:45.440 --> 16:50.400
diversity wasn't always a sign of our strength, but sometimes a sign of our weakness? What if,

16:50.400 --> 16:58.160
for example, immigration, far from being an issue of xenophobes versus xenophiles, was actually an

16:58.160 --> 17:03.840
instrument of redistribution, having very little to do with xenophobia or xenophilia to begin with?

17:04.480 --> 17:09.680
These sorts of ideas can't be entertained inside of the gated institutional narrative.

17:09.680 --> 17:15.520
And that's where the gating function comes in. What was originally a function intended to ensure

17:15.520 --> 17:20.880
quality control of the narrative became an instrument for something else. And this is where I want

17:20.880 --> 17:25.840
to introduce the most important concept that I think we will be dealing with on a going forward

17:25.840 --> 17:33.680
basis in 2020 on this program, the disk. What is the disk? The disk stands for the distributed

17:33.680 --> 17:41.920
idea suppression complex. Now, taking it apart, the center of it is idea suppression. Not all

17:41.920 --> 17:49.600
ideas are good, and so idea suppression is very frequently understood as an important concept

17:49.600 --> 17:54.480
when we're talking about something like bigotry or we're talking about something like violent

17:54.560 --> 18:00.640
ideology. Of course, we want to suppress certain ideas. But these are not the ideas that are

18:00.640 --> 18:08.400
principally important inside of the disk. The disk is actually a complex. It is a large collection

18:08.400 --> 18:13.200
of different structures, and it's not controlled in any one place. Many of these have emerged

18:13.200 --> 18:22.400
separately. But what makes an aspect of the disk, what shows you a particular component,

18:22.400 --> 18:30.160
is that it protects institutions from individuals who are making valid and reasonable points.

18:30.880 --> 18:35.760
So if you imagine that the institutions have become incredibly fragile because they're in

18:35.760 --> 18:44.240
fact built for growth, and that plan for their growth if it obligates them to tell untruths and

18:44.240 --> 18:50.480
to hide certain characteristics because they are not in fact able to grow at the rates in

18:50.480 --> 18:58.400
which they are supposed to, you need some complex for making sure that that information doesn't reach

18:58.960 --> 19:05.360
the bottom entrance to a pyramid structure. Let's talk about some aspects of idea suppression.

19:06.080 --> 19:12.480
The two stories that I'm following most closely, and we can date this particular episode by talking

19:12.480 --> 19:18.080
about current events, I think that's fine. The two stories I'm following most closely

19:18.720 --> 19:23.280
with interest from the perspective of understanding the disk are the story

19:24.080 --> 19:30.800
of Andrew Yang and the media, and the story of Jeffrey Epstein and his recent demise.

19:32.720 --> 19:39.200
Now in neither of these cases is my principal interest the ostensible subject matter. In the

19:39.200 --> 19:45.760
case of Andrew Yang, Andrew is going through a weird ritual that I've noted repeatedly,

19:45.840 --> 19:52.880
election cycle after election cycle. Perhaps the most three recent versions of this situation

19:52.880 --> 20:02.080
have been with Ron Paul in his run for president, with Bernie Sanders in his run for the presidency,

20:02.080 --> 20:10.160
and now with Andrew Yang. In all of these cases, we see a very bizarre behavior inside of the news

20:10.160 --> 20:16.960
media. That is that when the candidate starts to gain traction with the public, they become left

20:16.960 --> 20:24.960
off of lists, they become misreported. Very often a reporter will stand in front of the graphic

20:26.240 --> 20:32.800
that has that particular candidate alongside others, and we don't really know why this is

20:32.800 --> 20:37.680
occurring, and we don't know how these instructions are going out. But in the case of Andrew Yang,

20:37.680 --> 20:44.240
because this is taking place in a highly connected internet era, we have people chronicling all of

20:44.240 --> 20:50.160
the myriad ways in which Andrew Yang's candidacy is distorted. In particular, there appears to be

20:50.160 --> 20:55.040
a different level of distortion taking place at one particular news media outlet.

20:57.440 --> 21:02.560
We need to better understand exactly what is the political economy of the news.

21:03.520 --> 21:10.240
In the case of Andrew Yang, the key question would be, why aren't the regular news media

21:10.240 --> 21:19.120
and the competing news media reporting on the outside effort being made to make sure that

21:19.120 --> 21:24.320
Andrew does not appear normally with other candidates in this democratic primary field?

21:26.400 --> 21:31.920
It doesn't make logical sense if you believe that the principal reason for reporting on the

21:31.920 --> 21:37.200
election is to make sure that the voters have an early opportunity to hear all voices and to

21:37.200 --> 21:41.760
begin to make their decisions, rather than immediately trying to pick a narrative about

21:41.760 --> 21:48.320
front runners who are always taken to be inevitable. That's a conserved feature of this bizarre

21:48.320 --> 21:54.560
election coverage cycle after cycle. The first thing I want to do is recommend that you google

21:54.560 --> 22:02.320
MSNBC and Andrew Yang and Yang Media Blackout and look at the impressive data set that has been

22:02.320 --> 22:10.160
collected, which shows a singular focus that can be inferred from the data on Andrew Yang.

22:11.040 --> 22:16.960
To an extent, this has also happened with Tulsi Gabbard. To an extent, there's been some carry

22:16.960 --> 22:22.560
over from Bernie Sanders, but Bernie Sanders' showing in 2016 was so strong that the same

22:22.560 --> 22:28.240
games that were applied to Sanders then cannot easily be applied now. But the key question we

22:28.240 --> 22:35.280
have is why is the news media spending so much on one candidate who doesn't appear to be that large

22:35.280 --> 22:40.880
to keep that candidate from growing? I think this is an interesting topic and what it has to do with

22:40.880 --> 22:47.920
is making maps of silence. Now, through the efforts of Dana Boyd and the data and society group,

22:47.920 --> 22:53.680
we've learned about a doctrine called strategic silence, and that is that there are certain

22:53.680 --> 22:58.800
things that the media may not want to happen. Therefore, rather than simply reporting the

22:58.800 --> 23:06.960
facts of the matter, they make editorial decisions so as not to give fodder or fuel for some

23:06.960 --> 23:11.360
undesirable outcome. Now, we can partially understand that in the case of copycat killings

23:12.080 --> 23:19.200
after, let's say, gun massacres, but it's much harder to understand why somebody coming from

23:19.200 --> 23:24.320
outside of the political system would be treated to something like strategic silence or strategic

23:24.320 --> 23:30.960
distortion. What we need to do is to have a better understanding of the maps of silence and maps of

23:30.960 --> 23:36.880
distortion that take place in our press. What Andrew has done that is special and unique is

23:36.960 --> 23:43.840
that he's given us a very large N for our dataset. We now have enough different incidents of this

23:43.840 --> 23:50.080
that we can begin to piece together what might be inferred from this very bizarre behavior.

23:50.080 --> 23:55.680
The second example of this that I find fascinating is the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Now, you'll hear

23:55.680 --> 24:00.320
a lot of other people say, well, Epstein didn't kill himself or it's obviously this or it's obviously

24:00.320 --> 24:08.080
that. I have a decidedly smaller interest in those questions. The questions that fascinate me

24:08.080 --> 24:13.120
have to do not with Epstein, not with who might have killed him, whether he died by his own hand,

24:13.760 --> 24:20.160
but they have to deal with the sense-making apparatus that is the news media around this

24:21.600 --> 24:28.960
untimely exit from our world. Now, Jeffrey Epstein was accused of trafficking and had a very bizarre

24:28.960 --> 24:33.920
life that is difficult for many of us to understand where he got a slap on the wrist in Florida

24:33.920 --> 24:42.800
and appeared to operate with impunity even after his conviction in Florida as a sex offender.

24:44.640 --> 24:51.360
What's fascinating is that if anyone remembers the Watergate era, the news media used to go

24:52.320 --> 25:00.880
to federal agencies and ask whether or not something was true or false. This gave us the

25:00.880 --> 25:11.360
phrase, a non-denial denial. When the question arises, let's say in this case, does Jeffrey Epstein

25:11.360 --> 25:18.240
have any ties to any known intelligence community? That question can be asked, let's say, to the

25:18.240 --> 25:24.560
CIA, to the State Department, to the NSA. You might expect that you'd get an answer. Absolutely,

25:24.560 --> 25:32.480
this person had no ties because the idea of the intelligence agencies being connected to a known

25:32.480 --> 25:38.080
sex trafficker seems preposterous at one level, but you could also imagine that they'd get no

25:38.080 --> 25:45.440
comment. Now, we don't even have that in this situation. I did this fairly recently with

25:45.440 --> 25:51.040
The New York Times and tried to simply use their own search engine. Have you asked the question

25:51.040 --> 25:56.800
whether Jeffrey Epstein had ties to the intelligence agencies? The other questions that arise in this

25:56.800 --> 26:04.880
case are, when is the last known recording of Ghislaine Maxwell's passport crossing a border?

26:04.880 --> 26:09.760
This is a simple factual question. A reporter would be dispatched, they would call up somebody

26:09.760 --> 26:14.480
like Interpol, they would try to find out whether people would speak about it or not speak about

26:14.480 --> 26:20.240
it. Under any circumstances, they would be able to print an interesting story. For example,

26:20.240 --> 26:27.280
Interpol has no comment, or Interpol says that the last recorded border where Ghislaine Maxwell's

26:27.280 --> 26:37.440
passport showed up was a border crossing in New York City. Under any circumstances, it is very

26:37.440 --> 26:44.000
bizarre to see the map of silence around these questions. Another such question is, if Jeffrey

26:44.000 --> 26:51.600
Epstein's fortune came from currency trading, where are the records from his office in Valard House

26:51.600 --> 27:00.080
in Manhattan? He had a very large office in a trophy property on the island of Manhattan,

27:00.080 --> 27:05.040
and to the best of my knowledge, I have seen no printed discussion of where the supposed

27:05.040 --> 27:11.760
trading records of this person who seemed to amass a fortune. Another weird thing about this fortune

27:11.760 --> 27:20.560
is that he seemed to live life as a high-eleven figure individual, owning islands and incredible

27:21.520 --> 27:27.120
properties and multiple jets, and yet all of the assets I've seen accounted for puts him

27:27.120 --> 27:32.240
instead in nine-figure territory. Now, that's two orders of magnitude difference,

27:32.240 --> 27:38.320
and I don't think that there are many nine-figure rich who would live anything like Jeffrey Epstein's

27:38.320 --> 27:43.120
lifestyle. It appears that most of the assets were put towards a kind of front, if you will.

27:44.880 --> 27:49.920
So, we don't have any idea about where the records are of his trading. We don't have any idea where

27:50.720 --> 28:02.320
the passport of his partner was seen last, and we also have no confirmation that any of our major

28:02.320 --> 28:08.800
government agencies have denied that Jeffrey Epstein, the accused sex trafficker, was tied to any

28:08.800 --> 28:16.080
intelligence community. In all of those situations, what you can map with honesty and without having

28:16.080 --> 28:23.280
to go anywhere near Tinfoil Hat territory is that there's something broken with our sense-making

28:23.280 --> 28:27.600
apparatus, because in the Watergate era, you could have assigned this to a cub reporter,

28:27.600 --> 28:32.880
and they would have known exactly what to do. Where are our no comments on the record? No one knows.

28:34.960 --> 28:42.320
All right, in those two circumstances, that gives you an idea about how the disc,

28:42.320 --> 28:48.400
the distributed idea suppression complex, works inside of journalism. There is some sort of

28:48.400 --> 28:55.200
editorial function that is keeping us from learning certain things because certain stories do not run

28:55.840 --> 29:01.680
with a little bit of poetic liberty. This seems to be what Paul Simon was talking about in sounds

29:01.680 --> 29:07.760
of silence. What we're listening for now are the silences. Where else are we confronted with

29:07.760 --> 29:13.120
silence? What are the other things we would expect where we don't hear particular ideas?

29:13.920 --> 29:19.120
Now, obviously, you have a situation where I've been talking for quite some time about the idea

29:19.120 --> 29:23.920
that there are many reasons that one might ask to restrict immigration. The Sierra Club used to

29:25.280 --> 29:30.000
support a restriction of immigration. Farm workers unions used to support restrictions on

29:30.000 --> 29:38.320
immigration. But sometime in the fairly recent past, it became an edifices of the elite that

29:38.320 --> 29:43.760
the only reason for supporting a restriction in immigration, the only possible reason, could be

29:43.760 --> 29:51.520
that you were xenophobic and probably racist. Now, I don't exactly know where these ideas came from,

29:51.520 --> 29:57.280
but I know that these ideas are prima facie and preposterous. They make no sense. And so I've been

29:57.280 --> 30:03.360
talking for some time about where are the media willing to discuss all of the reasons that one

30:03.360 --> 30:08.240
might want to restrict immigration, having nothing to do with xenophobia, the so-called

30:08.240 --> 30:14.000
xenophilic restrictionist perspective. This is another place where there is no public discussion

30:14.000 --> 30:19.920
and we have no idea why. So once you begin to look for these silences, these gaps,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.880
you start to become rather terrified that somehow the world is not behaving properly,

30:24.880 --> 30:27.360
and that's one of the reasons that people are flocking to this podcast.

30:29.280 --> 30:36.000
This is, however, not my major focus. My major focus of the distributed idea suppression complex

30:36.000 --> 30:45.920
or disc has to do with what happens inside of our universities. Now, I'm in a somewhat unusual

30:45.920 --> 30:54.800
position in that both myself and my wife have PhDs as well as my brother and his wife. And we've

30:54.800 --> 31:00.080
all appeared in interviews within the last five years. So maybe you've seen all of us on camera

31:00.080 --> 31:06.800
or have some idea of how Brett Weinstein, Heather Hying, Pia Malani, and I sound.

31:07.600 --> 31:14.880
What some of you don't know is that I believe that inside of that group of four,

31:16.080 --> 31:21.600
one of us wrote a book immediately after getting a PhD, which is Heather Hying's book,

31:21.600 --> 31:27.920
Antipode, about her solo travels to the jungles of Madagascar. So if you have a young woman in

31:27.920 --> 31:34.640
your life who's looking for a pretty impressive female role model, I would say Heather's toughness,

31:35.600 --> 31:39.840
intelligence, and grit makes for a pretty terrific reading. And I'd recommend buying

31:39.840 --> 31:46.000
the book Antipode for that young lady. In the case of the remaining three,

31:47.120 --> 31:56.240
none of us wrote a book immediately afterwards. However, I think that the quality of the discoveries

31:56.320 --> 32:05.120
that were being explored was incredibly high. And in each case, what I thought happened to those

32:05.120 --> 32:13.040
was most unexpected. Now, what are these ideas that I'm claiming were suppressed? So I would say

32:13.040 --> 32:21.200
that in one case, we were talking about the reasons why we die. One of these theses contained what

32:21.200 --> 32:29.760
I think is one of the best models for the reasons that we have these finite life spans. And of course,

32:29.760 --> 32:33.600
we're all subject to what might be called environmental insult. If a piano falls on

32:33.600 --> 32:37.600
your head while you're walking down the street, that's usually going to be your exit. But why

32:37.600 --> 32:44.800
we age, why we get cancer and why we die, I think has not been very well understood at the molecular

32:44.800 --> 32:51.280
level. And I think perhaps one of the first mature attempts to do this took place in my

32:51.280 --> 32:57.200
brother's thesis at the University of Michigan. This is one of the major ideas that I wish to

32:57.200 --> 33:06.000
be exploring in 2020. If biology is one of the greatest ideas man has ever had in the form of

33:06.000 --> 33:11.680
natural and sexual selection in the work of Darwin and Wallace, I would say that the other complex

33:11.760 --> 33:18.720
of great ideas, truly top ideas, would be what I would call geometric dynamics. Those are the

33:18.720 --> 33:24.800
ideas that take place underneath theoretical physics, whether we're talking about the standard model

33:24.800 --> 33:31.360
or general relativity. Now, we now believe that all fundamental physical phenomena can be divided

33:31.360 --> 33:37.120
between these two great theories. In one case, that of Einstein's general relativity, it's been

33:37.120 --> 33:43.920
known for about a hundred years that the substrate of the theory is Riemann's theory of differential

33:43.920 --> 33:50.960
geometry, that is, Riemannian geometry. What is much more recent, perhaps slightly less than 50

33:50.960 --> 33:58.320
years old, thanks to Jim Simons and C. N. Yang, is the knowledge that the classical theory

33:58.320 --> 34:04.240
underneath quantum field theory is, in fact, a different form of geometry known as Eris-Mannian

34:04.240 --> 34:12.240
geometry, Fiber-Bundle geometry, Gage theory, or you know, Steenrod geometry, whatever you want to

34:12.240 --> 34:21.760
call it. So, the idea that geometry is the birthplace of fundamental physics, I think, is now

34:21.760 --> 34:28.160
generally understood by all practicing theoretical physicists functioning at the top level.

34:29.040 --> 34:36.960
Inside of that complex, we've been stuck for approximately, I don't know, 47 years where

34:36.960 --> 34:43.440
theory used to lead experiment, and we used to make predictions, and the predictions would usually

34:43.440 --> 34:49.360
be confirmed in relatively short order. We have not had a period of stagnation inside of theoretical

34:49.360 --> 34:55.760
physics that mirrors this, with the closest comparable period, perhaps being the period from

34:55.840 --> 35:02.880
the late 1920s, with the advent of quantum electrodynamics, to the late 1940s, with the

35:02.880 --> 35:09.920
beginning of renormalization theory being ushered in at the Shelter Island, Pocono, and Old Stone

35:09.920 --> 35:18.960
conferences. So, that 20-year period is now more than doubled, and we haven't been making progress.

35:19.600 --> 35:28.720
And I've been very uncomfortable with the idea of coming forward with ideas. Why? Well, to be honest,

35:28.720 --> 35:33.680
it's very rare for anyone outside of theoretical physics to have reasonable ideas in physics.

35:33.680 --> 35:39.040
I could explain why, but the physicists are fantastic. They've got all sorts of no-go theorems,

35:39.040 --> 35:45.520
and all sorts of considerations that have to be kept in mind. And effectively, what they've got

35:45.600 --> 35:50.640
is a world that is so tightly constrained when it comes to understanding where we are,

35:51.280 --> 35:56.640
that almost every new idea is instantly dead on arrival. Now, this has been incredibly

35:56.640 --> 36:01.280
demotivating to people in the field, and it does feel, from many different perspectives,

36:01.280 --> 36:06.400
like we're almost at the end, if not of all of physics, at least of this chapter of physics.

36:07.360 --> 36:12.400
But what I'm starting to see is that the field has become exhausted. It has been telling the

36:12.400 --> 36:18.400
same story since 1984 about how string theory is our leading theory of quantum gravity, that

36:18.400 --> 36:26.400
quantum gravity is the replacement for Einstein's search for a unified field. And as the accelerator

36:26.400 --> 36:33.040
turns up, the Higgs and little else as effectively no new physical theories arise with confirmations,

36:33.040 --> 36:39.200
as the only major updates to our model of the physical world are things like massive

36:39.200 --> 36:44.720
neutrinos or the accelerating expansion of the universe coming from experiment. The theoretical

36:44.720 --> 36:51.120
physics community has been very slow to own up to just how much trouble it's in. It's an incredibly

36:51.120 --> 36:57.760
demanding life. It has incredible standards for rigor and intellectual honesty, and quite honestly,

36:57.760 --> 37:03.440
it's been lying for far too long to sustain the kind of integrity that's needed in that community.

37:04.080 --> 37:10.560
Now, I don't know whether I'm nuts, but I do know that at previous points, I've suggested

37:10.560 --> 37:15.600
things into both the mathematical and physics communities that have later been shown by other

37:15.600 --> 37:23.760
people to be correct. And while I was waiting for some kind of confirmation, I was being told,

37:23.760 --> 37:27.680
Eric, you're completely off base, you're not getting it. One of these situations involves

37:27.680 --> 37:36.720
something called the Cyberg-Witton equations, which I put forward in the 1980s, probably 87.

37:37.360 --> 37:42.320
And I was told that these couldn't possibly be right, that they weren't sufficiently non-linear.

37:43.760 --> 37:49.280
I'll tell the whole story about how if spinners were involved, then obviously Nigel Hitchens

37:49.280 --> 37:53.200
would have told us so, blah, blah, blah. None of this was true. And in 1994,

37:54.080 --> 37:59.920
Natty Cyberg and Edward Witton made a huge splash with these equations. I remember being in the

37:59.920 --> 38:06.160
room and seeing the equations written at MIT on the board, and I was thinking, well, wait a minute,

38:06.160 --> 38:10.960
those are the equations that I put forward. If those equations are being put forward by Witton,

38:10.960 --> 38:15.040
why is it that the community isn't telling him that they're wrong for the same reasons that

38:15.040 --> 38:22.320
they told me that they were wrong? This is also how idea suppression works. When you are young

38:22.320 --> 38:27.920
and when you are vulnerable and when you need the help of older members of your academic community

38:27.920 --> 38:35.360
to bring you forward, you're extremely vulnerable to what might be termed the duot de senor of the

38:35.360 --> 38:40.000
academic community. Now, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, or the prima notte,

38:40.640 --> 38:46.320
there was an old legend that the lords of the manor would command the right to take the virginity

38:46.320 --> 38:52.960
of every bride on her wedding night until there arose a miller's daughter known as the mugnaia.

38:53.840 --> 39:00.080
Now, the mugnaia had a different plan for she wished instead to be with her husband and not

39:00.080 --> 39:05.680
the evil lord of the manor. So what she did was she smuggled a knife underneath her robes

39:06.240 --> 39:11.920
and appeared in the bed chamber of the lord of the manor and killed him. Now, this is celebrated

39:11.920 --> 39:17.280
in the festival of the oranges, which is potentially the world's largest food fight in which armed

39:17.280 --> 39:23.200
combatants throw oranges at each other. I think it's in Italy, if I'm not mistaken, celebrating

39:23.200 --> 39:29.520
the victory of the mugnaia. But right now, we have a problem in our intellectual disciplines,

39:29.520 --> 39:35.680
which is that when we come forward with our best ideas, very often, even if they're slightly wrong,

39:35.680 --> 39:41.920
they're slammed. And when they're slammed, sometimes the older members of the community

39:41.920 --> 39:47.280
then take the ideas for themselves at a later point. This has to stop. And I think I've been

39:47.280 --> 39:52.320
trying to gather courage to put forward some ideas, which I think some of them, some aspects of them

39:52.320 --> 39:58.080
may be wrong, but are certainly quite interesting. And given that our leading theories have completely

39:58.080 --> 40:05.120
stalled out and failed to ship a product for depending upon how you count, you know, nearly 40

40:05.120 --> 40:09.600
years or 50 years, depending upon whether it's the anomaly cancellation or something called the

40:09.600 --> 40:15.920
Veneziano model. I think it's time to simply ignore these people and realize that the leading

40:15.920 --> 40:22.320
lights of our most important community have failed. If we don't figure out the full source code,

40:22.880 --> 40:28.080
going beyond Einstein, going beyond the standard model, we can't know whether we're actually

40:28.080 --> 40:33.600
literally trapped in our local area, or whether we have some hope of going out and looking at the

40:33.680 --> 40:39.040
night sky with an idea that that might be the roadmap to our future. So whether or not we're

40:39.040 --> 40:45.360
consigned by Einstein to the Elon Musk program, let's say, of exploring the moon and Mars,

40:45.360 --> 40:51.600
or whether, in fact, we might get on the Star Trek or Star Wars program of exploring the cosmos,

40:51.600 --> 40:58.320
has to do with whether or not we can get the source code. So the next thing has to do with

40:58.320 --> 41:04.400
who we are, what is this place, and what I've called geometric unity. It is the aim of making

41:04.400 --> 41:11.120
the portal a place where I can have a channel that cannot be controlled by the academic complex.

41:11.760 --> 41:16.720
And I'll come back to that in a second. The third area that I want to talk about has to do

41:17.360 --> 41:25.440
with markets. Now, markets are really the sponsor of our freedom. By having a non-centrally

41:25.440 --> 41:32.320
directed locally organized human activity, free agents are able to contract freely with each

41:32.320 --> 41:39.360
other, exchange with each other, build prosperity, lift each other up. And if you are a progressive,

41:39.360 --> 41:45.680
you almost certainly really have to appreciate the power of markets. But our markets are in great

41:45.680 --> 41:51.280
danger at the moment, in my opinion, because they are being meddled with and they are returning

41:51.280 --> 41:57.280
results that indicate that only a tiny fraction of us are worthy of reaping the true rewards of

41:57.280 --> 42:01.440
the markets, while many of us feel that we are being left behind. If you look at the wealth

42:01.440 --> 42:07.600
structure of the silent generation, boomer generation, generation X and the millennials or

42:07.600 --> 42:14.880
Gen Y, you see that the millennials have at this age a massed far smaller percentages of the wealth

42:14.880 --> 42:18.400
than the boomers did at the same age. And I don't think it's because they're lazy or they're not

42:18.400 --> 42:24.400
talented. So we have a very dangerous situation shaping up where our younger generations are

42:24.400 --> 42:31.200
not fully bought in. In fact, in the last year, I just bought my first house. I'm 54 years old,

42:31.200 --> 42:39.120
born in 1965. I bought one car and then had to rebuy it when it hadn't got rear-ended.

42:39.120 --> 42:44.880
There's something very bizarre about that pattern for somebody who is educated at an Ivy League

42:44.880 --> 42:50.480
undergraduate institution and has an advanced degree from potentially our leading institution

42:50.480 --> 42:58.160
in the country. We've created a world in which it's simply too hard for regular people to advance

42:58.160 --> 43:03.440
properly because the society is not growing. Now, rather than complain about it, I'd rather do

43:03.440 --> 43:09.760
something about it. So partially what I hope to do is to show you what's been going on with GDP

43:09.760 --> 43:15.680
and inflation by introducing a new theory that combines the two greatest theories we have. So

43:15.680 --> 43:21.840
if you think about biology as being driven by the theory of natural and sexual selection,

43:22.480 --> 43:28.000
and if you think about physics as being driven by geometric dynamics either coming from Riemann

43:28.000 --> 43:34.800
or Erasmannian geometry, then in fact, what would be the meeting place of our two greatest theories?

43:35.680 --> 43:40.880
The only place that I'm aware of is that it takes place in economics. And why is that?

43:40.880 --> 43:48.000
Because you have apes carrying on the theory of selection, but by other means through markets.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.480
And what are markets? Markets are an attempt to create an as-if physical system

43:53.760 --> 43:58.800
by uniformizing apples and oranges so that we have a basis for their comparison by using

43:58.800 --> 44:06.320
mediums of exchange, like money. So in so doing, economics is the logical meeting place for the

44:06.320 --> 44:13.120
two greatest theories man has ever had. And this was explored in the early, rather the mid-1990s,

44:13.120 --> 44:20.080
early to mid-1990s by P. Mellani, my wife and collaborator and myself, in work that never

44:20.080 --> 44:25.120
got out of Harvard University. That's not quite true. There is a book called The Physics of Wall

44:25.120 --> 44:32.240
Street by James Weatherall, which touches upon this. But this work died because of something

44:32.240 --> 44:39.760
called the Harvard Job Market Committee. And my wife went into that job market committee meeting,

44:41.680 --> 44:46.560
having her work presented there, thinking that she could apply anywhere in the country and being

44:46.560 --> 44:51.040
told instead that she had almost nothing and that she'd be lucky to escape with a PhD.

44:51.920 --> 44:57.360
Now, in these three cases, that is, a theory of death that comes out of my brother's work at

44:57.360 --> 45:04.960
the University of Michigan, a theory of productivity and how our wealth is inflated away coming out

45:04.960 --> 45:11.120
of my wife's work at Harvard, and another theory about what is this place and how do these different

45:11.120 --> 45:17.360
geometries come together, which would be the subject of geometric unity. All three of these ideas

45:18.080 --> 45:23.920
met a level of resistance that none of us had ever anticipated or encountered. And I think it's

45:23.920 --> 45:29.600
been terrifying to me to think about the idea of going up against the institutions. However,

45:29.600 --> 45:35.840
last year I made an interesting calculation. I decided to look at the presidencies of all of

45:35.840 --> 45:41.760
our leading research institutions and to try to figure out how many of them belonged to people

45:42.480 --> 45:52.000
who came after the baby boom. In a previous world, let's say the world of the early 1980s,

45:52.000 --> 46:00.000
approximately half of the heads of research institutions would be Gen X and Gen Y, that is,

46:00.960 --> 46:08.800
Xers and Millennials. However, almost no research university, certainly almost no leading

46:08.880 --> 46:13.360
research university, with I think the exception of the University of California at Berkeley,

46:13.360 --> 46:18.560
when I did this calculation last year, was under anything other than the presidency of

46:18.560 --> 46:24.880
a baby boomer. Now, what had happened? Well, we got rid of a mandatory retirement requirement

46:24.880 --> 46:31.680
that probably affected things fairly significantly. And we began to concentrate all sorts of power

46:31.680 --> 46:37.360
in one generation's ideas. Now, generations aren't magical things. What they are are instead

46:37.360 --> 46:43.360
cohorts that are exposed to some set of circumstances that is peculiar to the time in which they are

46:43.360 --> 46:49.920
growing up. So, for example, if your primary experience is that you work hard as a kid with

46:49.920 --> 46:54.640
a paper route and an internship, you go to college, you work your way up a ladder and everything

46:54.640 --> 46:59.600
works out fine, and pretty soon before you know it, you've got three kids in two homes,

47:00.320 --> 47:06.400
that's your idea of what a normal life is. Now, this is sort of the basis of the meme

47:06.400 --> 47:11.760
okay boomer, because many of the rest of us who followed this generation have no idea how you

47:11.760 --> 47:18.560
would accomplish that in these times. I actually put the blame slightly more on the silent generation

47:18.560 --> 47:22.000
than most people do. I think if you look at it, you realize a lot of the problems that we're

47:23.600 --> 47:30.080
having now began through intergenerational issues initiated by the silence rather than the boomers,

47:30.080 --> 47:36.400
but it's a pretty stark division between the exers millennials and Gen Z and the silence

47:36.400 --> 47:42.720
and the boomers as the major generations that are still extant. In this situation,

47:42.720 --> 47:48.560
it's terrifying to say what I'm about to say next, but it is time to inflict ourselves on our own

47:48.560 --> 47:57.200
institutions. It is time to have Gen X candidates for presidencies, not necessarily just of the

47:57.200 --> 48:05.680
political parties, because we've spent what is it, 20 years on on men born in the summer of 1946

48:05.680 --> 48:10.320
so far. I mean, we're just at the beginning of baby boom presidencies, and we've been doing it

48:10.320 --> 48:19.360
since 1992. That doesn't make a lot of sense. On the other hand, I think that the presidencies of

48:19.600 --> 48:27.680
companies or CEO roles, I think that the issue of university presidents, many of these things have

48:27.680 --> 48:33.760
been tilted far too much towards these other generations. I think that Gen X has a very

48:33.760 --> 48:40.000
interesting story to tell. We were not highly infantilized in terms of when we were growing up.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.520
In fact, we had the moniker of the latchkey kids, and we're also not large enough to get

48:45.520 --> 48:50.880
things just by chanting them. We have always had the pressure of having to make some degree of

48:50.880 --> 48:57.760
sense, because we're just too small as a generation. In fact, what I'd like to do, I've said that I

48:57.760 --> 49:02.560
believe that string theory is effectively an affirmative action program for mathematically

49:02.560 --> 49:08.960
talented baby boomers who do not wish to sully themselves with the problem of working on the

49:08.960 --> 49:14.720
physical and real world as we have it. What I'd like to do is to bring you these three theories

49:14.720 --> 49:22.000
over the course of the next year or two. That is, a theory of death, a theory of markets,

49:22.000 --> 49:27.120
and how the agents within those markets and the measurement of those markets should be changed

49:27.120 --> 49:33.600
and understood, and a theory also about who we are and what is this place in which we find

49:33.600 --> 49:39.440
ourselves called geometric unity. The purpose of the portal, if you will, is to create a channel

49:39.440 --> 49:47.520
that has never existed. Now, I could try to submit everything to Fizz review of letters. I could try

49:47.520 --> 49:53.760
to submit to econometrica. I could try to go through all of the normal channels, and I think

49:53.760 --> 50:01.440
what I've started to realize is part of the problem of having screwed up all of this early stuff

50:02.160 --> 50:08.800
in our lives, of having tried to do this the formal and right way, so to speak.

50:09.920 --> 50:15.120
The privilege of having been screwed over so directly and so beautifully by this system

50:15.120 --> 50:20.560
is the right to raise the middle finger to the institutions. How dare you expect that I'm going

50:20.560 --> 50:28.240
to use your quiet procedures? If you think about what peer review is, it's the exact opposite of

50:28.320 --> 50:33.440
what peer review should mean. Peer review should mean that you publish your article, and then the

50:33.440 --> 50:39.440
peers in the community review it. But in fact, what it is is peer suppression. You take your

50:39.440 --> 50:45.920
article and you mail it off to somebody who you don't know. That person gets an early look at it.

50:45.920 --> 50:52.400
They might hold it up in review. They then inflict any changes that they want or they reject it for

50:52.400 --> 50:57.760
reasons that make no sense, and then it's handed back to you. Now, why does it have such a positive

50:58.960 --> 51:04.960
spin? It's not long-standing in the community. It doesn't seem to have a very long history,

51:04.960 --> 51:10.720
but it came out of an effort to quality control new ideas. We wanted to know if new ideas were

51:10.720 --> 51:16.480
coming from reputable people. Were they using reasonable methods? Were they reasonably familiar

51:16.480 --> 51:24.480
with their fields? In fact, that is the good reason that we had this new technique of peer review.

51:24.560 --> 51:29.600
Previously, editors had been tasked with being responsible for the field and figuring out

51:29.600 --> 51:36.640
whether or not something was up to snuff. In this new situation, it was perfectly constructed for

51:36.640 --> 51:42.880
abuse. In fact, what you find is that it's like what my brother refers to as the low-posted speed

51:42.880 --> 51:49.360
limit in a southern town. The key question isn't peer review. It's how is it enforced for different

51:49.360 --> 51:56.480
people? That is, if you are a famous professor who is well plugged into a journal where your

51:56.480 --> 52:01.120
friend is the editor, you're going to have an entirely different experience with peer review

52:01.120 --> 52:08.480
than if you submit the exact same article coming from some place that is not well known to that

52:08.480 --> 52:15.360
journal and in which there is a bias against that group. For example, if I were to point out that

52:15.360 --> 52:24.080
every purebred dog in a kennel show is a product of intelligent design, that is, that humans

52:24.080 --> 52:31.760
have commanded canines with whom and how they can mate, that process has produced things like

52:31.760 --> 52:39.360
doxons and poodles. However, if I use words like intelligent design, I guarantee you that even though

52:39.360 --> 52:45.040
it's clearly true that dogs are intelligently designed, that that paper will be rejected

52:45.040 --> 52:51.840
because there is a belief that we should have a line which says no paper on intelligent design

52:51.840 --> 52:58.080
has ever been accepted by a leading peer review journal. Now, that political understanding

52:58.080 --> 53:04.160
of intelligent design has to do with both a reasonable idea and an unreasonable idea.

53:04.960 --> 53:10.080
The reasonable idea is that you should not be able to smuggle Jesus into evolutionary

53:10.080 --> 53:16.000
theory. You should not be able to do young earth creationism inside of a scientific context.

53:16.000 --> 53:23.760
That is the previous reasonable version of peer review. It makes sense as quality control.

53:24.640 --> 53:29.520
But what happens when you start talking about perception mediated selection? For example,

53:30.160 --> 53:36.080
pseudo-copulation in orchids, which we've discussed before, or in the predatory system

53:36.080 --> 53:42.800
with the muscle lampicillus, where the perception of the bass matters because it thinks that it's

53:42.800 --> 53:50.640
consuming a baitfish, but in fact, that's a fake baitfish filled with the young of the muscle.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.680
In both of those cases, you have perception mediated selection, and you could make an argument

53:55.760 --> 54:00.640
that that should be called intelligent design. But those magic words can't appear in that journal.

54:00.640 --> 54:07.520
Why? For a political reason. So what we have is we've created a system based around quality control

54:07.520 --> 54:14.400
that in fact is rife and open for abuse. In that system, we now have to realize that we need other

54:14.400 --> 54:20.800
channels. We need an ability to route around. We need to be able to reinsert dissidents and people

54:20.800 --> 54:26.000
who do not get along with institutions back inside of the institutions. If you look at

54:26.000 --> 54:32.880
Noam Chomsky sitting at MIT, you will realize that it was once the case that such people were much

54:32.880 --> 54:37.520
more common. You can look up a fellow, an old friend of mine named Serge Lang, and you could

54:37.520 --> 54:42.720
scarcely believe that such a person could have existed at Yale, but that person very much did

54:42.720 --> 54:49.360
exist. You can look at an old controversy about David Baltimore and a woman named Margo O'Toole

54:49.360 --> 54:58.880
and the courage of Mark Ptashny and Walter Gilbert in fighting a Nobel laureate when Margo O'Toole

54:58.880 --> 55:06.160
accused a colleague of the Nobel laureate of misconduct or at least irreproducibility of results.

55:07.200 --> 55:12.880
We have a long and storied history that has gone wildly off the rails with the crisis in

55:12.960 --> 55:19.280
current sense-making. The purpose of the portal was always to set up a channel by which we would

55:19.280 --> 55:24.960
have enough people watching that we could attempt to keep people from being rolled in the alleys

55:24.960 --> 55:29.680
when they contradicted the institutions. That is, in large measure, what we're here to do.

55:29.680 --> 55:34.480
If you look at our episode with Timor Karan, we introduced you to a concept of preference

55:34.480 --> 55:42.480
falsification. Right now, the danger of the Andrew Yang and the Jeffrey Epstein situations is that

55:42.480 --> 55:47.440
they have conveniently communicated to many people, of course we're going to mess with your

55:47.440 --> 55:52.720
sense-making. What is it you're prepared to do about it? This brings us to a final issue which

55:52.720 --> 55:58.960
I think is incredibly important, which has to do with why there are no living heroes. In effect,

55:59.600 --> 56:05.600
we almost don't believe in heroism. As soon as somebody starts to make us excited about the world

56:05.600 --> 56:10.960
and what is possible for the individual, we come to start feeling terrible about that person unless

56:10.960 --> 56:16.240
they're trapped inside of a Marvel movie or something like that. If you go back to the history

56:16.240 --> 56:20.800
of ticker tape parades, you will see that there were many ticker tape parades given

56:20.800 --> 56:26.560
for individual aviators, individual explorers, ships captains who put their ship at risk to

56:26.560 --> 56:36.480
rescue the crew of another. In fact, this pattern largely stopped. My contention is that the difficult

56:36.480 --> 56:44.560
case of Charles Lindbergh may have marked a turning point. In Lindbergh's case, he had flown

56:44.560 --> 56:50.480
solo to Europe from the United States and come back a hero, I believe in the late 1920s. Lindbergh

56:50.480 --> 56:56.000
was a very difficult human being to deal with because he was an authentic hero and he was also

56:56.000 --> 57:02.400
somebody who believed in America first in an isolationism. Given the Nazi menace in Europe,

57:03.200 --> 57:10.400
I think that's almost an unforgivable position. Nevertheless, the fact is that Lindbergh commanded

57:10.400 --> 57:16.400
tremendous popularity and that popularity could have been used to keep the U.S. out of a war.

57:17.600 --> 57:24.960
What I find is that since Lindbergh, it has been very rare to elevate any individual to the point

57:24.960 --> 57:31.360
where they can oppose our institutions. The Pete Seegers and Albert Einstein's of the world who

57:31.440 --> 57:39.120
fought against McCarthyism were a huge danger to the industry that was cropping up around

57:39.120 --> 57:45.120
anti-communism. When it came to the Vietnam War, it was very dangerous to have popular

57:45.120 --> 57:51.840
entertainers like John Lennon who were against it. We have been frightened about individuals

57:51.840 --> 57:56.880
coming to rival our institutions in terms of power. That's what's so great about

57:56.880 --> 58:02.240
the New Revolution and long-form podcasting and all of these other forms of social media.

58:02.240 --> 58:07.520
Now, we have a great danger in that most of these platforms are mediated. We saw what happened to

58:07.520 --> 58:14.400
Alex Jones. It's quite possible that if these powerful institutions come to believe that a

58:14.400 --> 58:20.800
particular individual should be removed, they can always choose to enforce the rules in a different

58:20.800 --> 58:30.160
way. We saw recently the advent of terms of service changes to include dead naming. Now,

58:30.160 --> 58:37.520
if I say that Walter Carlos composed the album Switched on Bach or performed the album Switched

58:37.520 --> 58:44.400
on Bach, that is a true statement. But because Walter Carlos became Wendy Carlos, I have no idea

58:44.400 --> 58:50.080
whether or not I can be accused of dead naming. Imagine that you have 100 such rules, rules that

58:50.160 --> 58:56.400
are never spelled out, never clear, that can be enforced any which way to deny someone access to

58:56.400 --> 59:02.480
the major platforms. This is the great danger with this moment. We have unprecedented access,

59:02.480 --> 59:08.400
but we also have a gating function which can be turned on at any time if we fall out of line with

59:08.400 --> 59:15.520
the institutions. I want to read you one tweet that has been on my mind for quite some time.

59:15.520 --> 59:20.000
This tweet came from a contributor to The Washington Post, who's a professor at the Fletcher

59:20.000 --> 59:25.680
School. It said, good morning, Eric. I'm going to leave out the parentheses. I've read up on a

59:25.680 --> 59:31.280
few of your notions, and I have some thoughts, but my basic conclusion is simple. What's true

59:31.280 --> 59:40.160
isn't new, and what's new isn't true. I think it's fantastic. I was stung by it because at first,

59:40.160 --> 59:44.640
I was under the impression that we were still living in a world in which The Washington Post,

59:44.640 --> 59:50.400
New York Times, Harvard, Stanford, what have you, control the major conversation.

59:51.520 --> 59:58.080
Coming off of a recent date at the Ice House in Pasadena, which was a live gig with Peter Thiel,

59:58.080 --> 01:00:04.240
I've started to realize how powerful this new movement is. We can reach anyone anywhere. What

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.760
I now believe is that the gated institutional narrative has been spoiling for a fight. We are

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.400
quickly coming to the point where we have a David and Goliath moment. We now need to try to

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.600
re-inflict the individuals who are uncorrelated, who are not particularly good at taking orders,

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.560
who don't like committee meetings, who don't want to sign loyalty oaths, but who are passionately

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.840
committed to the public good and to some version of intellectual meta-honesty.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.680
We need these people to once again take up positions inside of the institutions,

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.720
and I would like to, in fact, inflict myself on my favorite institution, Harvard University.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.200
The children of Harvard University have always been divided into white sheep and black sheep,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.080
and there's no question that I represent black sheep Harvard. But I also think that one of the

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.800
features of the university that makes it great is that it has tolerated both its white sheep

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:03.040
and its black sheep. It is time to do battle with the oppressive structures that have been used to

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:09.120
silence new ideas. If in my family I assert that there might be as many as three revolutionary

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:16.160
Nobel quality ideas in one clutch, how many ideas might there be suppressed if that is actually

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:22.240
true? How many people are sitting on top of intellectual gold that never got its chance

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.840
to see the light of day? What I'd like to do is to try to do battle with the disc, to show you

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.000
that it exists, to try to figure out how it works, and to try to show that the tools that we currently

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.240
have may be powerful enough to defeat it. This is the actual purpose of the portal, and I think

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:46.720
even if we lose some viewers and some listeners, even if people start to see articles appearing

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:52.560
that say how terrible the show is and how it's trying to foment some kind of unrest, to hell with

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.480
them. We are in an amazing position to try to do something new and to stand up for a lot of people

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.840
who may have given up on their own original ideas and to try to spark a revolution because if I'm

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:10.640
right the disc has been sitting up on top of some of our best and most hopeful ideas for a way out

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.720
of our economic condundrums, our military problems, ideas which have some chance of delivering us to

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.840
a much more interesting and brighter tomorrow. So I hope that this is going to be an unbelievable

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.400
decade. Thank you guys for sticking with it. I'm sorry if this was a little bit long, but it was a

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.960
lot to say and it was heartfelt and quite important to me to get it out, and we will return to trying

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.160
to get you high quality content either in the form of interviews which you've become used to on the

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.360
portal, or perhaps some new visual content that allows you to understand ideas that would be very

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.680
difficult to communicate, but for some novel means of presentation. We hope to approach the community

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.440
to try to coordinate people who are eager to contribute back into the program

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.400
and maybe get a little bit of a closer relationship to our content going forward,

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.680
maybe influence it a little bit, and we haven't figured out all of the bugs. So thanks for being

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.880
part of the initial experiment. Thanks for sticking with us and we're looking forward to being with you

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.400
in the coming year and decade ahead. So you've been through the portal for our first solo episode

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:23.120
of 2020, and be well everybody. Stay tuned.
