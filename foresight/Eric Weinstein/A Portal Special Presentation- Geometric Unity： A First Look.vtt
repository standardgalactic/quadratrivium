00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host Eric Weinstein and I think that

00:04.680 --> 00:08.560
today's must be the most unusual episode yet of a podcast that has been

00:08.560 --> 00:14.040
marked by almost regular unusual episodes. Now this is the first podcast that

00:14.040 --> 00:17.840
I'm recording at home. I don't really have a home recording studio so we're

00:17.840 --> 00:21.840
really doing this from chicken wire and masking tape. But I am sheltering in

00:21.840 --> 00:27.440
place because of the worldwide COVID pandemic and what we've been asked by

00:27.440 --> 00:30.720
the state of California and by the federal government is to shelter in

00:30.720 --> 00:36.560
place for an upcoming month because today is April 1st. Now during a pandemic I

00:36.560 --> 00:41.160
can assure you that no one is interested in April Fool's jokes. So the question is

00:41.160 --> 00:45.560
what to do with the April Fool's tradition in a situation in which nobody

00:45.560 --> 00:50.880
wants a prank. I thought that this was probably the best time to launch an idea

00:50.880 --> 00:55.640
that I've been playing with for years and that idea is that it is dangerous to

00:55.640 --> 01:01.520
have a world in which we are afraid to talk about what we think is true. When I

01:01.520 --> 01:05.920
think about what happened during the beginning of the COVID pandemic I find

01:05.920 --> 01:12.200
that we were in general intimidated from sharing our fears about the virus. We

01:12.200 --> 01:17.040
were told that if we wore masks that we were acting in a peculiar fashion. If we

01:17.040 --> 01:21.480
refused to shake hands that we were behaving in a strange and unpleasant

01:21.840 --> 01:26.040
social way. We did not want to be alarmist. We did not want to be seen as

01:26.040 --> 01:30.640
chicken little and in fact it was extremely important that we not be seen

01:30.640 --> 01:37.160
as xenophobic given that the outbreak was originating in Wuhan China. In fact

01:37.160 --> 01:41.080
perhaps the most dangerous idea was that this outbreak might have been

01:41.080 --> 01:46.120
connected to some research being done in a lab perhaps a bio weapons lab. We

01:46.120 --> 01:50.680
really don't know where this epidemic began. What is the etiology of something

01:50.680 --> 01:55.480
that is causing the entire world economy to effectively shut down? What I

01:55.480 --> 02:00.280
believe is that that silence has been deadly. We have many people who have now

02:00.280 --> 02:05.360
lost their lives because we did not feel free to exchange ideas to think and to

02:05.360 --> 02:10.360
talk and in fact many of the people who warned us first were the freest members

02:10.360 --> 02:14.640
of society having been previously cancelled by standard mainstream

02:14.640 --> 02:19.400
institutions and their associated media. So what I thought would be important

02:19.560 --> 02:24.480
for in April Fool's Day that no one wants to actually participate in was to deal

02:24.480 --> 02:30.720
with an idea that maybe one day a year we should all be free to share crazy

02:30.720 --> 02:35.240
ideas that are going around between our ears and in our head. We're having

02:35.240 --> 02:39.120
conversations with ourselves wondering is anyone else seeing the same thing that

02:39.120 --> 02:44.280
I'm seeing. But we are too afraid because the social stigma for actually

02:44.280 --> 02:48.200
believing in things that maybe things are possible or perhaps there's a

02:48.200 --> 02:53.200
conspiracy somewhere. Perhaps we are ill-prepared. For example, I believe that

02:53.200 --> 02:58.160
our current pandemic is exacerbated because our government and our readiness

02:58.160 --> 03:02.600
is ours failed to stock adequate supplies and that these supplies were

03:02.600 --> 03:07.200
called for in the academic literature for years. There was absolutely no excuse

03:07.200 --> 03:11.080
not to have personal protective equipment stocked for doctors and

03:11.080 --> 03:14.920
nurses and hospitals to say nothing of all of the people who were in the front

03:14.920 --> 03:21.680
lines of treating patients sick with COVID. Now currently I don't believe that

03:21.680 --> 03:25.760
you can trust the World Health Organization. Absolutely not. I don't think

03:25.760 --> 03:28.880
you can trust the Surgeon General of the United States and I absolutely don't

03:28.880 --> 03:34.040
think you can trust the CDC because they are all covering for our inadequacy. This

03:34.040 --> 03:38.520
was a problem that we always knew was coming and we at one point had stocks

03:38.520 --> 03:42.040
which apparently were depleted under a previous administration and not restocked

03:42.080 --> 03:48.120
under this administration. In fact, our fear of dealing with a pervasive

03:48.120 --> 03:53.480
institutional incompetence has blinded us to the degradation in our society

03:53.480 --> 03:58.560
across all major institutions. As I've discussed before on the program, I believe

03:58.560 --> 04:02.920
that this has a singular etiology. That is, that because of embedded growth

04:02.920 --> 04:07.840
obligations coming from the previous era of unsustainable post-war growth from

04:07.840 --> 04:14.160
about 1945 to 1971-73 something like that, we built in expectations to our

04:14.160 --> 04:19.160
system that cannot currently be met. We will not have technology that follows

04:19.160 --> 04:25.840
the same breakneck pace of innovation. As a result, we have a system whereby the

04:25.840 --> 04:30.360
heads of our organizations are forced to cover for their inadequacies because

04:30.360 --> 04:34.560
growth is built into the system that cannot be sustained. Therefore, there is

04:34.560 --> 04:40.160
not the funding, the manpower, there is not the wherewithal to continue many of

04:40.160 --> 04:44.920
our programs because we do not actually have the ability to continue to simply

04:44.920 --> 04:50.760
grow our way out, at least so far. So what's today's program about? Well, I

04:50.760 --> 04:56.120
thought that what I would do is to let go of something that I've been keeping

04:56.120 --> 05:10.600
pretty close for, I think, about 37 years. When I was around 19, I started, it's hard

05:10.600 --> 05:16.160
to talk about, when I was around 18 or 19, I was at the University of Pennsylvania

05:16.160 --> 05:21.560
and I thought I saw a glimmer of hope. I thought I saw that some new equations

05:21.560 --> 05:25.440
that were being played with might actually provide a solution to some of the

05:25.440 --> 05:30.680
problems that had bedeviled Einstein and others for years in the quest for a

05:30.680 --> 05:35.440
unified field theory. Now, it's an embarrassing thing to say that one is a

05:35.440 --> 05:40.280
unified field theorist. It is effectively equivalent to saying I'm interested in

05:40.280 --> 05:46.600
perpetual motion machines or that I have a private cure for cancer that I'm

05:46.600 --> 05:51.240
trying on rabbits in my backyard. However, I actually think that it's

05:51.280 --> 05:57.960
important to fess up because that's exactly what this is. Now, in my situation,

05:57.960 --> 06:04.320
I have an extremely unusual history and I really don't want to get bogged down in

06:04.320 --> 06:08.440
all of the things that happened while I was a student trying to develop this

06:08.440 --> 06:13.240
theory because it is not a particularly happy story. I believe that this theory

06:13.360 --> 06:21.760
is an incredibly joyous one. Now, in this situation, I want to talk about what it

06:21.760 --> 06:27.520
means to have a theory of everything. We've never seen one and in fact, not

06:27.520 --> 06:30.840
only have we never seen a theory of everything, we've never even seen, I

06:30.840 --> 06:35.000
believe, a candidate for a theory of everything. And because a theory of

06:35.000 --> 06:38.360
everything would have to have different characteristics than I believe every

06:38.360 --> 06:42.520
theory that has gone before, we don't think enough about what the difference is

06:42.680 --> 06:47.880
between what we would normally call in physics an effective theory and a

06:47.880 --> 06:53.200
fundamental one. Now, if you're familiar with the M.C. Escher drawing called

06:53.560 --> 07:00.760
Drawing Hands, it is a lithograph of two hands apparently drawing each other

07:00.760 --> 07:08.480
into existence on some kind of a canvas or piece of paper. That is sometimes

07:08.520 --> 07:13.320
referred to as a strange loop. But it, in fact, is an attempt to answer the

07:13.320 --> 07:18.560
question, what is the fire that lights itself? This is the problem that

07:18.560 --> 07:22.680
bedevils us when we search for a unified theory that doesn't bedevil us, in my

07:22.680 --> 07:28.600
opinion, in any previous effective theory. Now, why is that? Well, many people

07:28.600 --> 07:33.000
confuse a theory of everything as if they imagine that it's a theory in which

07:33.000 --> 07:36.680
you can compute every eventuality. And it is absolutely not that because the

07:36.680 --> 07:41.320
computational power is very different than the question of whether or not the

07:41.320 --> 07:46.600
rules are effectively given. I've analogized it to a game of chess and

07:47.000 --> 07:51.040
knowing all of the rules is equivalent to a theory of everything. Knowing how to

07:51.040 --> 07:56.240
play chess well is an entirely different question. But in the case of a theory of

07:56.240 --> 08:01.080
everything, or a unified field theory, if you will, many people also take it to

08:01.080 --> 08:06.120
be an answer to the question, why is there something rather than nothing? And I

08:06.120 --> 08:09.400
don't think that this is, in fact, what a theory of everything is meant to be

08:09.400 --> 08:15.000
either. Now, why is that? Well, because I believe at some level it is impossible for

08:15.000 --> 08:20.800
most of us to imagine an airtight argument, mathematically speaking, which

08:20.800 --> 08:27.360
coaxes out of an absolute void a something. However, there's a different

08:27.360 --> 08:32.080
question which I think might actually animate us and which is the right

08:32.080 --> 08:37.800
question to ask of a potential candidate. And that is, how does one get

08:37.800 --> 08:45.120
everything from almost nothing? In the MC Escher drawing or lithograph, hands

08:45.120 --> 08:50.320
drawing hands or drawing hands, what we see is that the paper is presupposed.

08:50.880 --> 08:55.000
That is, if you could imagine a theory of everything, it would be like saying, if I

08:55.000 --> 09:00.320
posit the paper, can the paper will the ink into being such that the ink gives

09:00.360 --> 09:04.480
rise to the pens and the pens draw the hands, which in fact, manipulate the

09:04.480 --> 09:10.480
pens to use the ink. That kind of a problem is one which is of a very

09:10.480 --> 09:14.960
different character than everything that has gone before. It is also, in my

09:14.960 --> 09:19.520
opinion, an explanation of why the physics community has been stalled for

09:19.520 --> 09:25.040
nearly 50 years since around 1973, when the standard model was intellectually

09:25.080 --> 09:31.840
in place. Now, consider this. We have never had in modern times a drought where no

09:31.840 --> 09:37.280
person working in pure fundamental theory has taken a trip to Stockholm just as a

09:37.280 --> 09:43.760
rough indicator for contributing to the standard model. No one, in my opinion,

09:43.760 --> 09:49.200
since let's see, Frank Wilczek, who was born in 1951, no one born after that

09:49.200 --> 09:53.400
time has in fact contributed to the standard model in a clear and profound

09:53.440 --> 09:57.720
way. That is not to say that no work has been done, but for the most part, the

09:57.720 --> 10:02.680
current generation of physicists has for more than 40 years and almost 50 years

10:02.680 --> 10:08.160
remain stagnant within the standard paradigm of physics, which is positing

10:08.160 --> 10:13.040
theories that are then verified by experiment. Now, my belief, which is

10:13.040 --> 10:18.920
relatively radical, is that there is no way to get to our final destination

10:18.960 --> 10:23.560
using the tools that have gotten us to where we are now. In other words, what

10:23.560 --> 10:27.800
got you here cannot get you there. And in particular, one of the biggest

10:27.800 --> 10:32.480
problems we have is the political economy of science. We have effectively

10:32.480 --> 10:38.280
starved our scientific enterprise for resources, creating a dire and cutthroat

10:38.280 --> 10:43.400
competition, which has completely deranged the scientific tradition. And so one

10:43.400 --> 10:46.600
of the things that's going to happen in this lecture is that I'm simply going

10:46.600 --> 10:51.640
to announce that I have broken and have broken for many years with just about

10:51.640 --> 10:56.440
every expectation of standard science. That is not to say that the equations or

10:56.440 --> 11:01.160
the style of presentation is going to be foreign, quite the contrary. I have every

11:01.160 --> 11:06.840
intention of writing up some results in standard terminology wherever possible

11:06.840 --> 11:12.200
using popular mathematical type setting programs, but it goes far deeper than

11:12.200 --> 11:16.400
this. My belief is that what we've created is a career structure, a journal

11:16.400 --> 11:21.920
structure, an employment structure, an access structure that cannot possibly

11:21.920 --> 11:30.160
complete the job. And why is that? Well, what if in the last leg, in fact, we had

11:30.160 --> 11:36.960
a situation by which an attempt at the fundamental theory would result almost

11:36.960 --> 11:41.680
certainly in career suicide? Now, if you think of that as an explanation, you would

11:41.720 --> 11:47.760
realize that it has the power to synchronize failure across many seemingly

11:47.760 --> 11:51.720
independent experiments. And I believe that that's exactly what's been going on

11:51.720 --> 11:56.000
through the so-called string theory revolutions one, two, and perhaps three.

11:57.680 --> 12:05.440
Now, in that case, what happened was a theory became fixed in the minds of really

12:05.440 --> 12:08.960
the baby boom generation of physicists because it allowed for infinite

12:08.960 --> 12:13.840
elaboration within a mathematical or, more particularly, a geometric context.

12:14.480 --> 12:19.680
And those supposed physicists spent their time submitting papers to what's called

12:20.760 --> 12:25.920
the high energy section of the so-called preprint archive. But in fact, most of

12:25.920 --> 12:30.400
these papers have nothing to do with high energy physics whatsoever. And if you're

12:30.400 --> 12:37.000
looking for the designation, it's HEPTH, high energy physics-theory. Now, if you

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
look through those papers, they don't seem to have much to do with particles.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.280
They don't seem to have to do with forces and spacetime. They seem to have to do

12:43.280 --> 12:49.320
with very strange and obscure mathematical issues. And in the years since the

12:49.840 --> 12:54.400
string theory program got particularly reanimated, I guess that would be around

12:54.400 --> 12:59.760
1984 with the anomaly cancellation of Green and Schwartz, what you'll find is

12:59.760 --> 13:05.080
that physics became very active and simultaneously ground to a halt. It

13:05.080 --> 13:10.360
failed to remain a physical subject. It became something like a medieval quest

13:10.360 --> 13:16.520
for the number of angels to dance on the head of a pit. Now, in this circumstance,

13:16.520 --> 13:20.800
I think it's very important to realize that this is not a paper, and we are not

13:20.800 --> 13:24.720
submitting to the archive. In fact, the archive requires people who are not

13:24.720 --> 13:29.680
employed at universities to get permission from some member of the

13:29.680 --> 13:32.680
community, which is called an endorsement, which I find absolutely

13:32.720 --> 13:37.480
insulting, and I refuse to go along with. Furthermore, we are expected to cite

13:37.480 --> 13:42.720
papers, sometimes which are behind paywalls. And I think that it's absolutely

13:42.720 --> 13:47.640
immoral to ask people to pay outside the system to read the papers to cite

13:47.640 --> 13:52.200
other people's work. I could go on about the number of things that are currently

13:52.200 --> 13:56.360
wrong with the system, but instead what I would like to do is to simply joyously

13:57.280 --> 14:04.280
I have every intention of simply sharing this with you and jealously guarding my

14:04.280 --> 14:09.280
right to shepherd this through. Now, what does that mean? In two previous episodes,

14:09.280 --> 14:13.760
we've had interactions with academicians, which I think are interesting and bear

14:13.760 --> 14:19.000
scrutiny. In the first case, in an interview with the economist Tyler Cowan,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.400
I talked to Tyler about the fact that the Boschian Commission was in fact

14:23.640 --> 14:28.920
committing economic malpractice. Now, why was that? It was because they decided

14:28.920 --> 14:32.640
that they needed to transfer a trillion dollars over 10 years and that they had

14:32.640 --> 14:38.320
found a devious way of doing it, which is to adjust the CPI. By backing out the

14:38.320 --> 14:42.760
amount of adjustment needed to get a trillion dollars, they decided that a

14:42.760 --> 14:49.480
1.1% overstatement in the CPI would cause a reduction in entitlements, that is

14:49.520 --> 14:54.440
Medicare and Medicaid payments together with Social Security, as well as an

14:54.440 --> 15:01.440
increase in taxes because tax brackets are also indexed. Now, to my mind, it is

15:01.440 --> 15:06.080
absolutely unconscionable to say that you have a right to transfer wealth

15:06.080 --> 15:12.080
cryptically by adjusting a fundamental barometer. That would be like saying, in

15:12.080 --> 15:15.480
order to meet our global warming targets, we have to recalibrate all the

15:15.480 --> 15:20.040
thermometers to show that, in fact, things have cooled. One simply can't do

15:20.040 --> 15:25.400
that in science, but Tyler's response I found was very interesting. His

15:25.400 --> 15:29.520
perspective was that this was, in fact, not a terrible thing because it was

15:29.520 --> 15:35.640
quote, directionally correct. And in general, he believed that because the CPI

15:35.640 --> 15:39.160
should be considered overstated that this was not the world's most terrible

15:39.160 --> 15:43.680
thing to do as an economist. I respect Tyler a great deal and I enjoy his

15:43.720 --> 15:48.520
company, but I have to say that I am absolutely of a different opinion. My

15:48.520 --> 15:53.400
belief is that one has no rights and no ability as a scientist to fudge the data

15:53.400 --> 15:59.800
to meet social goals in this fashion. Another interesting interaction was the

15:59.800 --> 16:05.920
interaction with Professor Agnes Collard of the University of Chicago. Now, when

16:05.920 --> 16:11.680
she listened to episode 19 about Brett Weinstein, she found that it was a very

16:11.720 --> 16:16.800
compelling episode. But strangely, even though the point of the episode was to

16:16.800 --> 16:21.360
surface Brett's long forgotten theory, because Brett had not been acknowledged

16:21.360 --> 16:25.640
as having predicted that laboratory mice would in particular have radically

16:25.640 --> 16:30.720
elongated telomeres, where it was thought that all mice had radically elongated

16:30.720 --> 16:38.000
telomeres, which has incredible potential implications for drug testing and all of

16:38.040 --> 16:44.320
the work that is done on laboratory rodents as model organisms. This is an

16:44.320 --> 16:48.200
episode you should definitely listen to if you haven't already. But Agnes's

16:48.200 --> 16:53.160
perspective was very different than mine. Her feeling was that because we were in

16:53.160 --> 16:58.240
a situation in which the work actually surfaced, that the system worked even if

16:58.240 --> 17:01.640
it was the case that Brett's name was erased from the history of the

17:01.640 --> 17:07.760
development and that his theory was put in a situation in which it was not

17:07.800 --> 17:11.440
able to carry the day because, in fact, there was no record of the fact that a

17:11.440 --> 17:16.240
prediction had been made. Now, I disagreed with Agnes on that program

17:16.960 --> 17:22.040
vociferously. But what I found was that it was very telling. In general, our

17:22.040 --> 17:28.640
academic population has given up on the previous and quaint idea of decency,

17:28.640 --> 17:34.360
proprietary, truth, fairness, because there simply isn't the resource for

17:34.360 --> 17:40.680
everyone. Now, I believe that current science is not necessarily unsalvageable,

17:40.680 --> 17:45.040
but it will be unsalvageable if we don't get the very people that I rail against

17:45.280 --> 17:49.720
far more money. And I know that's very confusing. But my belief is that the

17:49.720 --> 17:53.680
inadequate resources that we have put aside are very similar to the inadequate

17:53.680 --> 17:57.560
masks that we have put aside for our doctors. We have asked some of the

17:57.560 --> 18:03.480
world's most gifted and smartest people to devote their lives to the study of

18:03.520 --> 18:07.760
science and technology. And we have inadequately prepared them. We've put

18:07.760 --> 18:11.520
their lives and their families' lives under incredible pressures. And what I

18:11.520 --> 18:15.520
wish to do is to, in fact, point to the very people who I have been most angry

18:15.520 --> 18:19.480
at for years and say that part of the problem is that we need to take a hard

18:19.480 --> 18:23.560
look at how we've invested in science and technology and give the very people

18:23.560 --> 18:28.800
that I'm most angry at more money. I will explain more about this later, but I

18:28.800 --> 18:32.880
do want to give you an introduction to this episode. What I will be doing is

18:32.880 --> 18:38.040
to screen a very unusual and somewhat awkward lecture at the University of

18:38.040 --> 18:44.160
Oxford. Now, why is it so awkward? Well, first of all, I had left standard

18:44.160 --> 18:51.840
research perhaps 20 years earlier, almost. Further, I'm not a physicist. And I

18:51.840 --> 18:57.040
have only taken one or two courses in the physics major sequence. I think I've

18:57.040 --> 19:01.800
taken one semester of mechanics. And perhaps I took an advanced general

19:01.800 --> 19:06.840
relativity course in college. But in general, no one goes into a theoretical

19:06.840 --> 19:10.840
physics department and attempts to lecture physics physicists on physics.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.640
And why is that? Well, because physics is incredibly demanding. And this is

19:14.640 --> 19:18.440
almost certainly the world's most interesting and most accomplished

19:18.440 --> 19:22.840
intellectual community. These are guys who don't miss a trick. There are so

19:22.840 --> 19:26.880
many things to know and it is such a difficult field that it is effectively

19:26.880 --> 19:31.680
almost impossible to contribute from outside. Chemists don't do it and once

19:31.760 --> 19:34.960
in a blue moon, mathematicians will attempt to talk about actual real

19:34.960 --> 19:40.480
physics. So one thing that you're seeing is a very unusual circumstance where

19:40.480 --> 19:44.320
somebody is trying to figure out how to give their first lecture in a physics

19:44.320 --> 19:49.200
department. And it concerns the possibility of a theory which attempts to

19:49.200 --> 19:55.960
solve the problem of how does a fire light itself. Another thing that you'll

19:55.960 --> 20:00.240
see is that it's relatively difficult to read my handwriting. I'm not going to

20:01.120 --> 20:05.000
make any bones about it. I've been very vocal about having learning differences,

20:05.000 --> 20:09.680
dysgraphia, dyslexia, all sorts of different issues. Symbols come extremely

20:09.680 --> 20:13.360
difficult to me. I don't want to spend this time making excuses. What I do want

20:13.360 --> 20:19.000
to say is the following. I will be attempting to record a short PowerPoint

20:19.000 --> 20:23.160
presentation for after the lecture to say at least some of what some of the

20:23.160 --> 20:28.520
constructions are more clearly. This is not meant to be the actual presentation

20:28.560 --> 20:32.440
of the theory. What this is is an introduction, a down payment and above

20:32.440 --> 20:37.600
all a historical account of what happened seven years ago at the University

20:37.600 --> 20:42.280
of Oxford when I tried to present these ideas. I've talked before about the

20:42.280 --> 20:46.920
twin nuclei problem and our need to get off of this planet. And if we have a

20:46.920 --> 20:50.640
hope of getting off of this planet, it really comes from fundamental physics.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.240
You see 100 years ago or perhaps 105 when Albert Einstein gave us general

20:56.280 --> 21:01.760
relativity. He effectively consigned us for life to the solar system. Why is

21:01.760 --> 21:07.600
that? Well, his model, his geometric model of space and time, effectively

21:07.600 --> 21:12.480
creates a speed limit known as C or the speed of light. Now, there are three

21:12.480 --> 21:16.920
rocks that are at least interesting for habitation by humans, although two of

21:16.920 --> 21:21.440
them are marginal, the moon and Mars. One of them, of course, is unbelievable,

21:21.440 --> 21:25.880
the earth. But I doubt that we're going to be able to steward the earth through

21:25.880 --> 21:29.680
our new godlike powers, which I've called the twin nuclei problem of

21:29.680 --> 21:33.920
cell and atom. We've unlocked the power of both. And I don't think we have the

21:33.920 --> 21:39.480
wisdom to stay all in one place. So the question that I had was, if there is

21:39.480 --> 21:43.160
any ability to escape to the cosmos that we can see in the night sky, where

21:43.160 --> 21:47.480
would it come from? We are almost positive that Albert Einstein's theory of

21:47.480 --> 21:52.160
relativity is in some weird way incomplete. The Schwarzschild singularities

21:52.160 --> 21:57.400
which give us black holes and the initial singularities of the Robertson

21:57.400 --> 22:01.920
Walker Friedman universe, which are associated with the Big Bang, are some

22:01.920 --> 22:08.600
clue that there is some subtle flaw in Einstein's theory. So how to go beyond

22:08.600 --> 22:13.160
Einstein? I mean, what Einstein did to Newton was to recover Newton as a

22:13.160 --> 22:18.320
special case of a more general theory that is more flexible. And in fact, this

22:18.360 --> 22:21.800
is the same problem that we have. Because Albert Einstein's theory is so

22:21.800 --> 22:26.480
fundamental, we effectively begin every theoretical physics seminar with a

22:26.480 --> 22:30.640
statement about spacetime. In other words, Albert Einstein is locked in at the

22:30.640 --> 22:35.320
ground floor. So if we can't get below the ground floor to the foundations, it's

22:35.320 --> 22:38.640
very difficult to make progress. This is one of the things that is making it

22:38.640 --> 22:43.120
almost impossible for us to go beyond the initial revolutions of the 20th

22:43.160 --> 22:50.440
century. Do I know that this new theory, if it works, will allow us to escape? I do

22:50.440 --> 22:55.000
not. There's no one who can say that. And I don't think I have the skills to

22:55.000 --> 22:59.040
develop the physical consequences of the theory, even if the theory turns out to

22:59.040 --> 23:06.520
be mostly right. What I will say is that I think that the theory is the first of

23:06.520 --> 23:12.960
its kind that I've seen. I believe that in part what you will see is that at a

23:13.000 --> 23:18.560
minimum, it is like fool's gold. It appears to explain why we think we see

23:18.560 --> 23:23.200
three generations. But it also says that perhaps they aren't really three

23:23.200 --> 23:27.040
generations of matter. Perhaps there are only two, even though physicists tell us

23:27.040 --> 23:31.560
that there are at least three or perhaps more. I believe that physics tells us

23:31.560 --> 23:35.320
that the universe is chiral, that is left-right asymmetric. But the theory is

23:35.320 --> 23:39.720
itself not chiral. Instead, it chooses to present a different idea, which is that

23:39.720 --> 23:45.120
perhaps chirality is emergent, much the way our hands are individually left-right

23:45.120 --> 23:49.400
asymmetric, as our pinky is not a reflection of our thumb. But the thumb on

23:49.400 --> 23:54.920
each hand is a pairing to the other one, as is the pinky. Now, what does that

23:54.920 --> 23:59.720
mean? It means that if perhaps there is matter and there is force that is

23:59.720 --> 24:05.440
decoupled from our ordinary world, that that matter might restore the parity or

24:05.440 --> 24:11.080
the chirality, rather would break the chirality, and restore parity between

24:11.080 --> 24:15.960
these two halves, the matter we see and the matter that is missing. There are a

24:15.960 --> 24:20.440
good number of other things that happen in the theory. It replaces space-time with

24:20.440 --> 24:25.440
what I've termed an observer's. Now, an observer's is an unusual gadget in that

24:25.440 --> 24:29.680
it's thought of as two separate places where physics takes place, connected by

24:29.680 --> 24:35.320
a map. That means effectively that we are in something like a stadium where there

24:36.000 --> 24:41.040
are stands and there is a pitch, and the playing field that we think we see may

24:41.040 --> 24:45.680
not, in fact, be where most of the action is taking place. In fact, not all of the

24:45.680 --> 24:50.520
fields live on the same space. So when we see waves and particles dancing around,

24:50.520 --> 24:54.040
they may have separate origins in each of the two components of the

24:54.040 --> 25:01.360
observer's. What I hope to do after this is to gracefully and gradually develop

25:01.400 --> 25:07.240
the theory under my leadership. Now, why do I say that? There is a belief in

25:07.240 --> 25:12.880
physics and in most fields that the field should behave in a communal fashion,

25:12.880 --> 25:16.840
and that people should put forward their ideas and other people should joyously

25:16.840 --> 25:23.600
build upon them, and that the community should be allowed to name the various

25:23.600 --> 25:29.480
accomplishments for whoever they say accomplished those things. There's not

25:30.400 --> 25:35.560
a way in hell that I'm letting that happen. My experience with this community

25:35.560 --> 25:39.520
is that it simply can't be trusted to behave equitably given the fact that it

25:39.520 --> 25:44.840
is so resource-starved and constrained. People simply do not have the freedom to

25:44.840 --> 25:49.520
be generous, kind, and accurate as to who did what. Furthermore, there is an

25:49.520 --> 25:54.520
incredible premium on cherry topping. That is, who finished something off is

25:54.520 --> 25:58.600
considered bizarrely much more important than who found something to begin with.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.680
Imagine you located an island and you named the island after the first person

26:03.680 --> 26:08.200
who could plant the flag on the top of the highest peak. This is patently offensive

26:08.200 --> 26:13.840
and ridiculous. There's a story years ago about how Hilbert almost scooped

26:13.840 --> 26:18.600
Einstein by giving the Hilbert action from which Einstein's equations could be

26:18.600 --> 26:23.440
recovered. Really? Not a chance. So, if Hilbert came up with the Hilbert action

26:23.440 --> 26:27.400
and recovered Einstein's equations, so what? I mean, the real theory actually

26:27.400 --> 26:31.880
takes place in Einstein and Grossman before Albert Einstein even works out a

26:31.880 --> 26:36.440
lot of the flaws in the original theory. It's about the ideas. It's not about the

26:36.440 --> 26:41.840
formulas and it's not about racing to the final form. Now, I know that the

26:41.840 --> 26:46.360
community won't agree with that but think about this. What I'm doing is taking an

26:46.360 --> 26:51.000
incredible risk. I'm addressing you here on April Fool's Day and I'm saying that

26:51.000 --> 26:55.040
if there is a fool, it is certainly me because I have sat on this theory for

26:55.080 --> 27:01.480
almost 40 years. Now, I've never known. Is it true? Is it false? It's impossible to

27:01.480 --> 27:06.200
tell when you're only talking to yourself. But in this situation, what I've done

27:06.200 --> 27:10.640
is I've taken a tremendous amount of risk and now I'm trying to share it with

27:10.640 --> 27:16.080
you. Hopefully, I know that, well, Newton did his greatest work when he was

27:16.080 --> 27:21.840
sheltering from a great plague in England and I would like to

27:21.840 --> 27:26.200
think that perhaps, whether or not this is correct, simply the act of somebody

27:26.200 --> 27:33.440
trying earnestly to share hope and some path forward would be uplifting. Now,

27:33.440 --> 27:38.560
under the worst circumstances, if this doesn't work, what do I think? This is a

27:38.560 --> 27:42.960
question I'm asked frequently. And there are two things that I'll say. Many years

27:42.960 --> 27:48.040
ago, around 1987, I put forward some equations that I thought might become my

27:48.080 --> 27:52.640
thesis at the Harvard Department of Mathematics and they were disallowed for

27:52.640 --> 27:59.000
a variety of reasons. Those equations were later discovered in, I believe, 1994

27:59.000 --> 28:03.840
and I sat in a lecture in which I saw these equations go up on a board at the

28:03.840 --> 28:08.520
very end at MIT. And I looked at those equations and I said, huh, those are the

28:08.520 --> 28:13.880
exact equations I was told could never work. Why is the leading physicist in the

28:13.880 --> 28:17.160
world placing them on the board and saying that these are the equations from

28:17.200 --> 28:23.440
which all of something called Donaldson theory can be derived? What I'm giving you,

28:23.440 --> 28:32.480
at least at a minimum, had the ability years earlier to provide those equations

28:32.480 --> 28:36.240
from a different source. There's something called cyber-witten theory, which I

28:36.240 --> 28:40.280
have no claim on. But the actual equations that are called the cyber-witten

28:40.280 --> 28:45.360
equations came originally as an outgrowth from investigations of this

28:45.400 --> 28:50.760
theory. So at a bare minimum, the cyber-witten revolution should have happened

28:50.760 --> 28:55.280
at Harvard rather than Princeton and it should have been recognized that this

28:55.280 --> 28:59.520
theory was capable of at least at a minimum giving birth to that as a side

28:59.520 --> 29:03.960
project. The other thing that I think is incredibly important is that we've

29:03.960 --> 29:11.160
never seen how a universe that looks like ours could possibly emerge from almost

29:11.160 --> 29:15.440
no assumptions whatsoever. And I believe that even if this theory were to turn out

29:15.440 --> 29:19.520
to be wrong, which I don't think is likely, I believe that it would give us

29:19.520 --> 29:24.960
something to go on. We would at least have a first candidate of how a hopeful

29:24.960 --> 29:29.120
theory of everything would look and how it would go wrong. So under any

29:29.120 --> 29:32.920
circumstance, I think that I'm going to be fine if the theory doesn't work out.

29:33.360 --> 29:37.560
I will have at least taken my shot on goal. And I think that that's probably

29:37.560 --> 29:42.880
more than almost anyone can ask from a life to attempt to make contact with the

29:42.880 --> 29:47.000
deepest question that we've ever had, which is what is this place and what

29:47.000 --> 29:53.880
brought it into being? Lastly, I want to just talk about a personal aspect of

29:53.880 --> 30:01.120
this, which is what does it mean to come to an end? Whether or not this theory in

30:01.160 --> 30:08.520
fact does what I claim, I think it does. I don't know. But I do know that sooner or

30:08.520 --> 30:14.560
later in the era of intercontinental land exploration, someone found the last

30:14.560 --> 30:18.680
land mass. And that must have been a very strange moment when there was nothing

30:18.680 --> 30:24.320
left to do. I think whether or not this theory in fact accomplishes that is one

30:24.320 --> 30:29.280
question. But we all have to plan for what it is that we think will happen when

30:29.280 --> 30:34.880
man at last learns his own source code. In fact, this was the last edge question

30:34.880 --> 30:39.240
that I answered for John Brockman, which is, does something unprecedented happen

30:39.240 --> 30:44.920
when man at last learns his own source code? I don't know the answer to this,

30:45.000 --> 30:50.480
but I want to return to the same spirit that I started this one. I was 18 or 19,

30:50.560 --> 30:54.720
which is that of joyous investigation of brave, open-hearted

30:55.320 --> 31:00.720
undertakings. And I also want to bring back a different style of scientific

31:00.720 --> 31:06.080
investigation. There's been far too much communalism. In fact, there is a belief

31:06.080 --> 31:09.960
that there are no lone researchers and that everything is produced by a

31:09.960 --> 31:16.800
community. And pardon my French, but this is absolute horseshit. I have been so

31:16.800 --> 31:23.280
long alone with these principles, equations and ideas that I don't even

31:23.280 --> 31:29.760
know what my adult life will look like once I discord them. And I begin to talk

31:29.760 --> 31:33.120
about them with the community at large. I've talked to many theoretical

31:33.120 --> 31:38.320
physicists who've taken some interest in them, but I've never put out enough to

31:38.320 --> 31:43.320
absolutely ensure that people are seeing what it is that I'm seeing. So whether

31:43.320 --> 31:47.440
or not the April Fool's joke is on me, I cannot tell you, but I can promise you

31:47.440 --> 31:51.600
that I'm not trying to play one on you. What I hope to show you is a lecture

31:51.640 --> 31:54.920
that was the first of three versions of this lecture that were delivered in

31:54.920 --> 32:00.000
Oxford over the course of a week. And one of the things that has held me back

32:00.000 --> 32:04.800
is that I have a great number of people who I have to thank for effectively

32:04.800 --> 32:09.080
being my underground railroad when my career got into serious trouble to make

32:09.080 --> 32:15.720
sure, who made sure that I always had an opportunity to fight another day. And

32:15.720 --> 32:19.480
some of the most important of those people, one of whom occurs on this

32:19.480 --> 32:24.640
video, is Marcus DeSotois. And Marcus, I just wanted to say thank you for your

32:24.640 --> 32:28.200
bravery, your courage, your friendship, and your encouragement. I know I've been

32:28.200 --> 32:32.800
absolutely impossible to you. I've made you wait for this and I just want to say

32:32.800 --> 32:38.680
how much I love you. I also want to thank Isidore Singer for effectively saving

32:38.680 --> 32:43.720
me from not getting a PhD by, I think, putting pressure on the Harvard

32:43.720 --> 32:48.400
Department. And for coming to my assistance, making sure that I got a

32:48.400 --> 32:53.200
postdoc at MIT, despite not having any publications at all. I'd like to thank

32:53.200 --> 32:57.640
Raoul Bot, who's no longer with us, who I should have invited to my wedding. I was

32:57.640 --> 33:00.600
very angry at him, but I didn't realize that he was saving me in a very

33:00.600 --> 33:05.160
difficult situation against a department that probably just wanted to see me gone.

33:05.160 --> 33:10.200
I'd like to thank Peter Thiel, one of my closest friends, who's like a brother to

33:10.200 --> 33:16.880
me, for allowing me these seven years since this lecture to lick my wounds, to

33:16.880 --> 33:25.360
get strong, to have a 401k, to buy a house, and to begin coming back to regular

33:25.360 --> 33:30.520
society after a very difficult and strained career. I'd like to thank Adil

33:30.520 --> 33:35.920
Abdullali and Michael Grossberg, the two greatest best friends from college that

33:35.920 --> 33:41.640
I could have. I'd like to thank my grandfather, Harry Rubin, who believed

33:41.640 --> 33:46.760
in things that couldn't possibly be true and made some of them happen. I'd like

33:46.760 --> 33:50.000
to thank my parents, Karen and Les Weinstein, for all the good things that

33:50.000 --> 33:53.280
they did. I'd like to thank my brother Bret Weinstein and his family, Heather

33:53.280 --> 33:59.880
and the kids, for sticking by me. And I'd like to thank my in-laws in Bombay,

33:59.880 --> 34:06.600
India. I hope you guys are well. And lastly, I would very much like to thank my

34:06.600 --> 34:12.040
wife and my two kids for putting up with a lot of lost weekends, a lot of lost

34:12.040 --> 34:16.520
vacations, and believing that just maybe there was something to this and

34:16.520 --> 34:22.560
sticking by me all these years. So I hope everybody really enjoys this. It may

34:22.560 --> 34:27.720
not be comprehensible. And after this video finishes, I'll do a short

34:27.720 --> 34:31.800
presentation of some of the constructions that took place. Not all of the

34:31.800 --> 34:34.600
equations and things, which I think some of them were sort of botched on the

34:34.600 --> 34:39.480
board because I became disoriented the night before and rearranged things in a

34:39.480 --> 34:45.720
way that probably wasn't optimal. But I'll attempt to clarify these things

34:45.720 --> 34:51.480
going forward and to begin to present the theory as I see whether or not I can

34:51.480 --> 34:56.880
bring myself to once again work on it somewhat close to full-time as a 54-

34:56.880 --> 35:04.320
year-old father of two. So sit back, relax, and coming up next is the first of my

35:04.360 --> 35:10.120
three lectures at Oxford University on Geometric Unity. Be well.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.920
Well, welcome to this special Simone lecture. My name is Mark Stasotoy. I'm a

35:27.920 --> 35:31.560
professor of mathematics here and the Simone Professor for the Public

35:31.600 --> 35:35.840
Understanding of Science. And Charles Simone prepared a manifesto when he

35:35.840 --> 35:40.000
endowed this chair to guide the holder of the professorship in their mission.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.400
And I'd like to read one part of that manifesto to you. It said,

35:44.400 --> 35:49.720
scientific speculation when so labelled and when the concept of speculation and

35:49.720 --> 35:53.760
its place in the scientific method has been made clear to the audience can be

35:53.760 --> 35:59.040
very exciting. It is a very effective communication tool and it is by no

35:59.080 --> 36:03.840
means discouraged. And it is in the spirit of this part of my mission as a

36:03.840 --> 36:07.960
Simone Professor that I would like to introduce today's Simone special

36:07.960 --> 36:12.800
lecture. I first met Eric Weinstein when we were both postdocs at the Hebrew

36:12.800 --> 36:17.200
University just over 20 years ago. And I had the feeling then that he was

36:17.200 --> 36:22.760
working on something big. But it wasn't until two years ago that Eric met me in

36:22.760 --> 36:26.800
a bar in New York and we began he began to explain the mathematics that he'd

36:26.800 --> 36:31.800
been working on in private for the last 20 years. As he took me through the

36:31.800 --> 36:36.040
equations he had been formulating, I began to see emerging before my eyes

36:36.040 --> 36:40.800
potential answers to many of the major problems in physics. It was an

36:40.800 --> 36:46.320
extremely exciting, daring proposal and also mathematically so natural that it

36:46.320 --> 36:50.560
started to work its magic on me. Over the last two years I have had the

36:50.560 --> 36:54.400
privilege of being taken through the twists and turns of Eric's ideas.

36:55.160 --> 36:59.280
After our postdocs in Israel, while I went the academic route getting my

36:59.280 --> 37:03.680
professorship here in Oxford, Eric went a more independent route working in

37:03.680 --> 37:08.200
economics, government and finance. So he comes here today as something of an

37:08.200 --> 37:13.720
insider and an outsider. A difficult place from which to propose bold ideas.

37:13.720 --> 37:18.920
But having spent time seeing how powerful these ideas appear to be, I felt

37:18.920 --> 37:23.320
that it was time that Eric shared his ideas more widely. As I believe his

37:23.360 --> 37:27.520
perspective could give the scientific community a new story to explain some of

37:27.520 --> 37:31.600
the big questions on the scientific books. I'm therefore very happy to provide

37:31.600 --> 37:36.120
a platform here in Oxford for Eric to share his ideas on a new theory he

37:36.120 --> 37:41.720
calls geometric unity. The lecture will be approximately 70 minutes after which

37:41.720 --> 37:45.120
we will have a period to ask questions. Eric.

37:45.120 --> 37:56.480
So it's a great pleasure to be here in Oxford. For those of you who are not

37:56.480 --> 38:02.760
aware, it is possible that no other university in the world has kept so

38:02.760 --> 38:09.720
tightly and kept the faith for so long with Einstein's great vision of a final

38:09.760 --> 38:14.960
theory for physics as a theory of pure geometry. A sort of elegance and

38:14.960 --> 38:18.520
simplicity of the highest order. And the names that are associated with Oxford

38:18.520 --> 38:25.040
that weigh heavy on me are Atia, Penrose, Siegel, Woodhouse, Hitchin. It's a very

38:25.040 --> 38:31.320
long list of people who, even when fashion did not hold those ideas in

38:31.320 --> 38:35.680
favor, always kept the faith that there was much to be learned from the

38:35.720 --> 38:40.440
geometric perspective on physics. Of course, unified field theory in some

38:40.440 --> 38:44.960
sense acquired a stigma with Einstein's failure to find it. And the sense that

38:44.960 --> 38:50.320
even someone like Einstein being tempted by the siren song of geometry

38:50.320 --> 38:55.880
might lose their footing and go astray. And in the years since, we've had a

38:55.880 --> 39:00.960
replacement theory which is that what is really calling our generations is the

39:01.880 --> 39:08.280
quest to quantize general relativity and gravity. And I'd like to go back to

39:08.280 --> 39:14.000
the sort of earlier perspective that there is no evidence to date, in my

39:14.000 --> 39:21.080
mind, that we are being called to quantize general relativity directly. In

39:21.080 --> 39:26.320
fact, there's been more effort spent on that quest without very tangible

39:26.360 --> 39:31.920
results than Einstein spent as one man searching for years for unified field

39:31.920 --> 39:37.280
theory. So we have to, in some sense, begin to undo some of what we think we

39:37.280 --> 39:42.240
know in order to truly reconsider and allow me to put some of these ideas

39:42.240 --> 39:51.960
before you today. Marcus asked me to begin presenting these ideas here. And

39:52.000 --> 39:58.440
hopefully this is a first opportunity, but if the ideas are not good, then

39:58.440 --> 40:03.840
lighting on the aisles will lead you to safety and your exits may be behind you.

40:03.840 --> 40:08.360
But in the event of a good flight, hopefully this will begin a conversation

40:08.360 --> 40:13.200
rather than end one. I feel in some sense that I'm presenting the works of

40:13.200 --> 40:19.720
another man, a younger man, someone who came of age right in the middle of the

40:19.760 --> 40:25.560
great string theory boom with the anomaly cancellation in 1984. And I

40:25.560 --> 40:30.840
look at this work and I see a young person struggling with the idea, why

40:30.840 --> 40:34.440
can't I see that string theory is going to answer all of these questions over

40:34.440 --> 40:39.240
the next 10 years, as we were told at the time. And making a very dangerous

40:39.240 --> 40:43.480
decision, which was, I think I'm not going to follow that particular path and

40:43.480 --> 40:47.640
I'm going to follow another. And it's not clear where this path is going to

40:47.640 --> 40:53.040
lead us, but we're going to explore it today and see as best we can. So in some

40:53.040 --> 40:56.640
sense, I've been able to polish some of that young man's work, but I'm also

40:56.640 --> 41:00.680
struggling to reconstruct it because as someone spending full time on that

41:00.680 --> 41:08.120
theory, he knew a lot of things that I no longer know. So with that as a

41:08.120 --> 41:11.560
beginning, I'm just going to say one disclaimer, which is that this is not a

41:11.600 --> 41:17.520
usual talk. And whatever contract a speaker usually has with the audience,

41:17.520 --> 41:23.080
right now we're going to break that contract. This is a talk about ideas.

41:23.080 --> 41:27.280
Some of these ideas are bold, some of them may offend some people because

41:27.280 --> 41:30.680
there's a sense that you don't have a right to be considering those ideas. But

41:30.680 --> 41:34.360
I go back to the admonition of Jim Watson that said, if you're going to try to

41:34.360 --> 41:38.760
make progress, big progress, you are by definition unqualified to be doing

41:38.760 --> 41:47.880
whatever it is that you're doing. So in that spirit, let us begin. What is

41:47.880 --> 41:53.200
physics to physicists today? How do they see it different from the way in which

41:53.200 --> 41:58.440
we might imagine the layperson sees physics? Ed Whitten was asked this

41:58.440 --> 42:06.320
question in a talk he gave on physics and geometry many years ago, and he

42:06.360 --> 42:11.600
pointed us to three fundamental insights, which were his big three

42:11.600 --> 42:16.680
insights in physics. And they correspond to the three great equations. So the

42:16.680 --> 42:25.880
first one is that somehow physics takes place in an arena. And that arena is a

42:25.880 --> 42:35.960
manifold X together with some kind of semi-Romanian metric structure. Something

42:36.000 --> 42:40.320
that allows us to take length and angle so that we can perform measurements at

42:40.320 --> 42:46.680
every point in this spacetime or higher dimensional structure, leaving us a

42:46.680 --> 42:54.720
little bit of headroom. The equation most associated with this is the Einstein

42:54.720 --> 43:21.040
field equation. And, of course, I've run into the margin. So it says,

43:25.680 --> 43:30.760
that a piece of the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, minus an even

43:30.760 --> 43:35.440
smaller piece, the scalar curvature multiplied by the metric, is equal, or

43:35.440 --> 43:40.920
plus the cosmological constant, is equal to some amount of matter and energy, the

43:40.920 --> 43:47.480
stress energy tensor. So it's intrinsically a curvature equation. The

43:47.480 --> 43:53.080
second fundamental insight, I'm going to begin to start drawing pictures here as

43:53.120 --> 44:01.960
well. So if this is the spacetime manifold, the arena, the second one concerns

44:01.960 --> 44:10.560
symmetry groups, which cannot necessarily be deduced from any structure inside of

44:10.560 --> 44:16.120
the arena. They are additional data that come to us out of the blue without

44:16.160 --> 44:25.560
explanation. And these symmetries form a non-Abelian group, which is currently

44:25.560 --> 44:44.360
SU3 color cross SU2 weak isospin cross U1 weak hypercharge, which breaks down to

44:44.720 --> 44:55.120
SU3 cross U1, where the broken U1 is the electromagnetic symmetry. This equation

44:55.120 --> 45:01.160
is also a curvature equation, the corresponding equation, and it says that

45:01.160 --> 45:11.480
this time the curvature of an auxiliary structure known as a gauge potential, when

45:11.480 --> 45:24.560
differentiated in a particular way, is equal, again, to the amount of stuff in

45:24.560 --> 45:29.440
the system that is not directly involved in the left-hand side of the equation. So

45:29.440 --> 45:33.480
it has many similarities to the above equation. Both involve curvature, one

45:33.480 --> 45:37.120
involves a projection or a series of projections, the other involves a

45:37.120 --> 45:57.920
differential operator. The third point surrounds the matter in the system. And

45:57.920 --> 46:12.120
here we have a Dirac equation, again coupled to a connection. But one of the

46:12.120 --> 46:18.560
great insights is that the reason for the lightness of matter in the natural mass

46:18.560 --> 46:25.240
scale of physics has to do with the fact that this psi really should have two

46:25.240 --> 46:29.800
components, and the differential operator should map to one component on the

46:29.800 --> 46:34.160
other side of the equation, but the mass operator should map to another. And so if

46:34.160 --> 46:39.200
one of the components is missing, if the equation is intrinsically lopsided,

46:39.200 --> 46:44.960
chiral, asymmetric, then the mass term and the differential term have

46:44.960 --> 46:50.120
difficulty interacting, which is sort of overcompensating for the mass scale of

46:50.120 --> 46:52.360
the universe, so you get to a point where you actually have to define a

46:52.360 --> 46:57.480
massless equation, but then just like overshooting a putt, it's easier to knock

46:57.480 --> 47:02.480
it back by putting in a Higgs field in order to generate an as-if fundamental

47:02.480 --> 47:06.240
mass through the Yukawa couplings.

47:22.920 --> 47:29.760
So matter is asymmetric, and therefore light.

47:34.560 --> 47:39.800
And then interestingly, he went on to say one more thing. He said, of course, these

47:39.800 --> 47:44.760
three central observations must be supplemented with the idea that this all

47:44.800 --> 47:54.440
takes place, treated in quantum mechanical fashion or quantum field

47:54.440 --> 48:00.280
theoretic. So it's a bit of an aftermarket modification rather than, in his

48:00.280 --> 48:08.920
opinion at the time, one of the core insights. I actually think that that's in

48:08.960 --> 48:14.800
some sense about right. Now, one of my differences with the community in

48:14.800 --> 48:20.920
some sense is that I question whether the quantum isn't in good enough shape,

48:20.920 --> 48:24.440
that we don't know whether we have a serious quantum mechanical problem or not.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.240
We know that we have a quantum mechanical problem, a quantum field

48:27.240 --> 48:31.480
theoretic problem, relative to the current formulations of these theories, but we

48:31.480 --> 48:35.960
know that in some other cases, the quantum becomes incredibly natural,

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
sometimes sort of almost magically natural. And we don't know whether the

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
true theories that we will need to be generalizing, in some sense, have

48:46.000 --> 48:49.480
beautiful quantum mechanical treatments, whereas the effective theories that we're

48:49.480 --> 48:58.440
dealing with now may not survive the quantization. So what I want to do is I

48:58.440 --> 49:03.840
want to imagine a different sort of incompatibility. So let's take our great

49:03.880 --> 49:14.400
three theories and just visually treat them as the vertices of a triangle. So I'm

49:14.400 --> 49:20.880
going to put general relativity in Einstein's formulation, and I'm going to

49:20.880 --> 49:25.800
put the, I probably won't write this again, Yang-Mills, Maxwell, Anderson-Higgs

49:26.760 --> 49:42.120
theory over here, and I'm going to write the Dirac theory. What I want to explore is

49:42.120 --> 49:48.080
the incompatibility is not at the quantum level, but the geometric input. All three

49:48.080 --> 49:52.480
of these are geometric theories. And the question is, what are the

49:52.480 --> 49:56.920
incompatibilities or incompatibilities at the level of geometry before the

49:56.920 --> 50:03.880
theory is treated quantum mechanically? Well, in the case of Einstein's general

50:03.880 --> 50:10.520
relativity, we can rewrite the Einstein theory by saying that there's a projection

50:10.520 --> 50:16.120
map due to Einstein of a curvature tensor, where I'm going to write that

50:16.120 --> 50:24.640
curvature tensor as I would in the Yang-Mills theory. That should be an LC for

50:24.640 --> 50:30.080
Levy-Chavita. So the Einstein projection of the curvature tensor of the Levy-Chavita

50:30.080 --> 50:36.720
connection of the metric on this side, and on this side, I'm going to write down

50:36.720 --> 50:40.800
this differential operator, the adjoint of the exterior derivative coupled to a

50:40.800 --> 50:52.360
connection. And you begin to see that we're missing an opportunity potentially.

50:52.360 --> 50:57.880
What if the FAs were the same in both contexts? Then you're applying two

50:57.880 --> 51:02.920
separate operators, one zero-eth order and destructive in the sense that it

51:02.920 --> 51:08.960
doesn't see the entire curvature tensor. The other inclusive, but a first order.

51:09.360 --> 51:14.200
And so the question is, is there any opportunity to do anything that combines

51:14.200 --> 51:20.840
these two? But the problem is, is that the hallmark of the Yang-Mills theory is

51:20.840 --> 51:25.560
the freedom to choose the data, the internal quantum numbers that give all

51:25.560 --> 51:31.560
the particles their personalities beyond the mass and the spin.

51:32.560 --> 51:38.760
In addition to all of that freedom is some means of taking away some of the

51:38.760 --> 51:42.800
redundancy that comes with that freedom, which is the action of the gauge group.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.920
Now we can allow the gauge group of symmetries to act on both sides of the

51:46.960 --> 52:07.960
equation. But the key problem is that if I act on connections on the right and then

52:07.960 --> 52:16.880
take the Einstein projection, this is not equal to first taking the projection

52:16.880 --> 52:34.880
and then conjugating with the gauge action. So the problem is, is that the projection

52:34.880 --> 52:40.360
is based on the fact that you have a relationship between the intrinsic

52:40.360 --> 52:46.600
geometry, if this is an ad-valued two-form, the two-form portion of this, and the

52:46.600 --> 52:50.840
adjoint portion of this are both associated to the structure group of the

52:50.840 --> 52:55.640
tangent bundle. But the gauge rotation is only acting on one of the two factors,

52:55.640 --> 53:00.400
yet the projection is making use of both of them. So there is a fundamental

53:00.400 --> 53:04.880
incompatibility in the claim that Einstein's theory is a gauge theory

53:04.880 --> 53:11.560
relies more on analogy than on an exact mapping between the two theories. What

53:11.560 --> 53:16.280
about the incompatibilities between the Einstein theory of general relativity and

53:16.440 --> 53:22.880
the Dirac theory of matter? I was very struck that if we're going to try to

53:22.880 --> 53:28.000
quantize gravity and we associate gravity with the spin-to-field g mu nu,

53:28.000 --> 53:39.120
we actually have a pretty serious problem, which is if you think about spinors,

53:39.400 --> 53:46.880
electrons, quarks, as being waves in a medium, and you think about photons as

53:46.880 --> 53:54.560
being waves in a different medium, photons medium does not depend on the

53:54.560 --> 53:59.760
existence of a metric. One forms are defined whether or not a metric is

53:59.760 --> 54:05.680
present. It's spinors or not. So if we are going to take the spin-to g mu nu

54:05.760 --> 54:10.000
field to be quantum mechanical, if it blinks out and does whatever the quantum

54:10.000 --> 54:15.080
does between observations, in the case of the photon, it's saying that the waves

54:15.080 --> 54:19.800
may blink out, but the ocean need not blink out. In the case of the Dirac

54:19.800 --> 54:23.920
theory, it is the ocean, the medium in which the waves live that becomes

54:23.920 --> 54:28.600
uncertain itself. So even if you're comfortable with the quantum, to me,

54:28.600 --> 54:34.120
this becomes a bridge too far. So the question is, how do we liberate the

54:34.160 --> 54:50.320
definition? How do we get the metric out from its responsibilities? It's been

54:50.320 --> 54:55.240
assigned far too many responsibilities. It's responsible for a volume form, for

54:55.240 --> 55:00.640
differential operators, it's responsible for measurement, it's responsible for

55:00.640 --> 55:07.400
being a dynamical field, part of the field content of the system. Lastly, we

55:07.400 --> 55:11.920
have the compatibilities between Yang-Mills and the Dirac theory. These

55:11.920 --> 55:15.560
may be the most mild of the various incompatibilities, but it is an

55:15.560 --> 55:21.880
incompatibility of naturality. Where the Dirac field, Einstein's field, and the

55:21.880 --> 55:27.400
connection fields are all geometrically well motivated, we push a lot of the

55:27.400 --> 55:31.720
artificiality that we do not understand into the potential for the scalar field

55:31.720 --> 55:35.920
that gives everything its mass. So we tend to treat it as something of a

55:35.920 --> 55:45.320
mysterious fudge factor. So the question is, if we have a Higgs field, why is it

55:45.320 --> 55:54.200
here, and why is it geometric? It has long been the most artificial sector of

55:54.200 --> 56:04.000
our models. The proposal that I want to put to you today is that one of the

56:04.000 --> 56:09.080
reasons that we may be having trouble with unification is, is that the duty, our

56:09.080 --> 56:19.400
duty, may be to generalize all three vertices before we can make progress.

56:19.840 --> 56:28.600
That's daunting because in each case it would appear that we can make an

56:28.600 --> 56:33.960
argument that this, that, and the other vertex are the simplest possible theories

56:33.960 --> 56:40.000
that could live at that vertex. We know, for example, the Dirac operator is the

56:40.000 --> 56:43.360
most fundamental of all the elliptic operators in Euclidean signature

56:43.360 --> 56:49.600
generating all of the Tia-Singer theory. We know that Einstein's theory is in

56:49.600 --> 56:54.120
some sense a unique spin to massless field capable of communicating gravity

56:54.120 --> 56:57.000
which can be arrived at from field theoretic rather than geometric

56:57.000 --> 57:01.280
considerations. In the Yang-Mills case it can be argued that the Yang-Mills theory

57:01.280 --> 57:05.440
is the simplest theory that can possibly result. Where we're taking the simplest

57:05.440 --> 57:09.040
Lagrangian in the Einstein case looking only at the scalar curvature, in the

57:09.040 --> 57:13.120
Yang-Mills case we have no substructure, and so we're doing the most simple-minded

57:13.120 --> 57:16.680
thing we can do by taking the norm square of the curvature and saying

57:16.680 --> 57:20.800
whatever the field strength is let's measure that size. So if each one of

57:20.800 --> 57:24.320
these is simplest possible doesn't Occam's razor tell us that if we wish to

57:24.320 --> 57:28.840
remain in geometric field theory that we've already reached bottom and what

57:28.840 --> 57:33.440
we're being asked to do is to abandon this as merely an effective theory? That's

57:33.440 --> 57:36.840
possible and I would say that that in some sense represents a lot of

57:36.840 --> 57:42.680
conventional wisdom. But there are other possibilities. There are other possibilities

57:42.680 --> 57:47.320
that while each of these may be simplest in its category they are not

57:47.320 --> 58:01.840
simplest in their interaction. For example we know that Dirac famously took the

58:01.840 --> 58:06.920
square root of the Klein-Gordon equation to achieve the Dirac equation. He

58:06.920 --> 58:10.560
actually took two square roots one of the differential operator and another of

58:10.560 --> 58:16.000
the algebra on which it acts. But could not could we not do the same thing by

58:16.000 --> 58:21.080
reinterpreting what we saw in Donaldson theory, in Chern-Simon's theory, and

58:21.080 --> 58:24.480
finding that there are first-order equations that imply second-order

58:24.480 --> 58:28.680
equations that are nonlinear and in the curvature? So let's imagine the

58:28.680 --> 58:37.440
following. We replace the standard model with a true second-order theory. We

58:37.440 --> 58:40.720
imagine that general relativity is replaced by a true first-order theory

58:40.720 --> 58:45.640
and then we find that the true second-order theory admits of a square

58:45.640 --> 58:50.760
root and can be linked with the true first-order theory. This would be a

58:50.760 --> 59:01.160
program for some kind of unification of Dirac's type but in the force sector. The

59:01.160 --> 59:04.680
question is does this really make any sense? Are there any possibilities to do

59:04.680 --> 59:14.120
any such thing? So what I'd like to do is I'd like to talk a little bit about

59:14.120 --> 59:35.720
what the geometric unity proposal is. So we have a division into intrinsic theories

59:35.720 --> 59:50.760
and auxiliary theories between physics and mathematics, more specifically

59:50.760 --> 59:58.520
geometry. An intrinsic physical theory would be general relativity. An auxiliary

59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.280
physical theory would be the Yang-Mills theory with the freedom to choose

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.640
internal quantum numbers. At the mathematical level an intrinsic theory

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:24.080
would be, let's be a little fastidious, the older semi-Romanian geometry, a study

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.880
of manifolds with length and angle. But auxiliary geometry is really what's

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.120
taken off of late since the revolution partially begun at Oxford when

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.120
his singer brought insights from Stony Brook to the UK. And so we're going to

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:50.000
call this fiber bundle theory or modern gauge theory. Geometric unity is the

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.080
search for some way to break down the walls between these four boxes. What's

01:00:54.080 --> 01:01:00.080
natural to one theory is unnatural to another. Semi-Romanian geometry is

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.880
dominated by these projection operators as well as the ability to use the

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.440
Levy-Chavita connection. Now some aspects of this are less explored. Torsion

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.720
tensors are definable in semi-Romanian geometry but they are not used to the

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.320
extent that you might imagine. In the case of fiber bundle theory the discovery

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:26.080
of physicists that the gauge group was fantastically important came as

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.480
something of a shock to the mathematicians who had missed that structure

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.960
and have since exploited it to great effect. So what we'd like to do is we'd

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.240
like to come up with some theory that is intrinsic but allows us to play some of

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.640
the games that exist in other boxes. How can we try to have our cake

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:54.000
eat it and use all the full suite of techniques that are available to us. So

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.920
our perspective is that it is the quantum that may be the comparatively

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:04.000
easy part and that the unification of the geometry which is not occurred may be

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.280
what we're being asked to do. So let's try to figure out what would a final

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:17.320
theory even look like. When I was a bit younger I remember reading this question

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.240
of Einstein which he said I'm not really interested in some of the details of

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.000
physics what really concerns me is whether the creator had any choice in

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.640
how the world was constructed. And some people may have read that as a

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.160
philosophical statement but I took that as an actual call for a research

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.000
program. So I'd like to describe that research program and try to unpack what

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.480
I think he was saying. We talk a lot about unification but we hardly ever

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:57.440
actually imagine if we had a unified theory what would it look like. Let us

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.160
imagine that we cannot figure out the puzzle of why is there something rather

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.440
than nothing. But if we do have a something that that something has as

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.720
little structure as possible but still invites us to work mathematically. So to

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.680
me the two great theories that we have mathematically and in physics are

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.040
calculus and linear algebra. If we have calculus and linear algebra I'm gonna

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.640
imagine that we have some manifold at least one of dimension four but it's

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.200
not a space time it doesn't have a metric it's not broken down into two

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.240
different kinds of coordinates which then have some bleed into each other but

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.000
still maintains a distinction it's just some sort of flabby proto space time.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.280
And in the end it's got to fill up with stuff and give us some kind of an

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.600
equation. So let me write an equation.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:19.880
So I have in mind differential operators parameterized by some fields omega which

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.840
when composed are not of second order if these are first-order operators but of

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:32.960
zero-width order and some sort of further differential operator saying that

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:41.360
whatever those two operators are in composition is in some sense harmonic. Is

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:49.360
such a program even possible. So if the universe is in fact capable of being the

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.200
fire that lights itself is it capable of managing its own flame as well and

01:04:54.200 --> 01:05:01.360
closing up. What I'd like to do is to set ourselves an almost impossible task

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:09.160
which is to begin with this little data in a sandbox to use the computer science

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:27.200
concept. So if here's physical reality standard physics is over here we're

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:40.360
going to start with a sandbox and all we're going to put in it is x4 and we're

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:45.120
going to set ourselves a straight-jacketed task of seeing how close we can

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.840
come to dragging out a model that looks like the natural world that follows this

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:59.720
trajectory. While it may appear that that is not a particularly smart thing to do I

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.680
would like to think that we could agree that it is quite possible that if that

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.080
were to be the case we might say that this is what Einstein meant by a creator

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.120
which was his anthropomorphic concept for necessity and elegance and design

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:23.400
having no choice in the making of the world. So with that let us begin to think

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:29.960
about what we mean today by geometric unity. GU comes in four flavors but I'm

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.240
only getting one shot to do this so I'm going to do the most exciting of them to

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:43.400
me. There's a completely exogenous flavor and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:49.000
take the concept of observation and I'm going to break the world into two pieces.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.280
A place where we do our observation and a place where most of the activity takes

01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:01.920
place and I'm going to try to do this without loss of generality. So in this

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.320
case we have x4 and it can map into some other space and we're going to call this

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:17.720
an Observerse. The idea of an Observerse is a bit like a stadium you have a

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.080
playing field and you have stands. They aren't distinct entities they're coupled

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.760
and so fundamentally we're going to replace one space with two. Exogenous

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.840
model simply means that you is unrestricted although larger than x4 so

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.360
any manifold of four dimension higher that is capable of admitting x4 as an

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:44.840
immersion. The next model we have is the bundle

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:58.840
theoretic in which case u sits over x as a fiber bundle. The most exciting which is

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.520
the one we'll deal with today is the endogenous model. Where x4 actually

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:12.320
grows the space u where the activity takes place. So we talk about extra

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.320
dimensions but these are in some sense not extra dimensions they're implicit

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:21.800
dimensions within x4 and last to proceed without loss of generality we have the

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:29.520
tautological model. In that case x4 equals u and the immersion is the

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.360
identity and without loss of generality we simply play our games on one space.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:50.520
Now we need rules. The rules are no choice of fundamental metric so we

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.960
imagine that Einstein was presented with a fork in the road and it's always

01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:01.360
disturbing not to follow Einstein's path but we're in fact going to turn

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.040
Einstein's game on its head and see if we can get anywhere with that right. It's

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.720
also a possibility that because Einstein's theory is so perfect that if

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.360
there's anything wrong with it it's very hard to unthink it because

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.600
everything is built on top of it. So let's make no choice of fundamental metric

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.400
and in fact let's go more ambitious and let's say we're going to reverse the

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.560
logic of Einstein. Einstein the metric is fundamental but the Levy-Chavita

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.560
connection from which we deduce the curvature is emergent. So the

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:34.240
fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is that every metric causes

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.160
a connection to emerge and then the curvature is built on the connection.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.560
We turn this around we imagine we're looking for a connection and we wish it

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.240
to build a metric because connections are amenable to quantization in a way

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:51.520
that metrics are not. The next point is that we always want to have a plan to

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.880
return to finite dimensions without losing sight of the quantum and lastly

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:03.360
we want to liberate matter from its dependence on the metric for its very

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.520
existence. So we now need to build fermions onto our four-dimensional

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.960
manifold in some way without ever choosing a metric if we're even to have

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.200
any hope of playing a game involving matter starting from this perspective of

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:25.120
no information other than the most bare information. Let's get started. We take

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:31.120
x4. We need metrics we have none. We're not allowed to choose one so we do the

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:39.960
standard trick is we choose them all. So we allow u14 to equal the space of

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:48.320
metrics on x4 point-wise. Therefore if we propagate on top of this, let me call

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.640
this the projection operator, if we propagate on u14 we are in some sense

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.920
following a Feynman-like idea of propagating over the space of all

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:03.680
metrics but not at a field level at a point-wise, tensorial level. Is there a

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.040
metric on u14? Well we both want one and don't want one. If we had a metric from

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.960
the space of all metrics we could define fermions but we would also lock out any

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.880
ability to do dynamics. We want some choice over what this metric is but we

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.240
don't want full choice because we want enough to be able to define the matter

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:30.000
fields to begin with. It turns out that if this is x4 and this is this

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.880
particular endogenous choice of u14, we have a ten-dimensional metric along the

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:49.760
fibers. So we have a g10 mu nu. Further for every point in the fibers we get a

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:59.200
metric downstairs on the base space. So if we pull back the cotangent bundle, we

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:12.440
get a metric g4 mu nu on pi star of the cotangent bundle of x. We now define the

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:19.720
chimeric bundle. And the chimeric bundle is the direct sum of the vertical

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.840
tangent bundle along the fibers with the pullback, which we're going to call the

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:33.720
horizontal bundle, from the base space. So the chimeric bundle is going to be the

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:43.200
vertical tangent space of ten dimensions to u, direct sum, the four-dimensional

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:50.160
cotangent space, which we're going to call horizontal to u. And the great thing

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.080
about the chimeric bundle is that it has an a priori metric. It's got a metrics on

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.960
the four, a metric on the ten, and we can always decide that the two of them are

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.320
naturally perpendicular to each other. Furthermore, it is almost canonically

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.000
isomorphic to the tangent bundle or the cotangent bundle because we either have

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.840
four out of fourteen or ten out of fourteen dimensions on the nose. So the

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.240
question is, what are we missing? And the answer is that we're missing exactly the

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:25.160
data of a connection. So this bundle, chimeric, c, we have c is equal to the

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:33.040
tangent bundle of u up to a choice of a connection theta. And this is exactly what

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.680
we wanted. We have a situation where we have some field on the manifold x in the

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.240
form of a connection, which is amenable, more friendly to quantization, which is

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.160
now determining a metric, turning around the Levy-Chivita game. And the only

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.680
problem is, is that we've had to buy ourselves into a different space than the

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:59.160
one we thought we wanted to work on. But now, as theta changes, the fermions are

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.840
defined on the chimeric bundle, and it's the isomorphism from the chimeric bundle

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:08.920
to the tangent bundle of the space u, which is varying, which means that the

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.160
fermions no longer depend on the metric, they no longer depend on the theta

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.840
connection. They are there if things go quantum mechanical. And we've achieved our

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.480
objective of putting the matter fields and the spin one fields on something of the

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:35.120
same footing. But, and I want to emphasize this, one thing most of us, we think a lot

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.960
about final theories and about unification. But until you actually start

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:47.120
daring to try to do it, you don't realize what the process of it feels like. Now,

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.560
try to imagine conducting your life where you have no children, let's say, and no

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.640
philanthropic urges. What you want to do is you want to use all of your money for

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:03.640
yourself and die penniless, right, like a perfect finish. Assuming that that's what

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.400
you wanted to do, it would be pretty nerve-wracking at the end, right? How many

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.680
days left do I have? How many dollars left do I have? This is the process of

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.200
unification in physics. You start giving away all of your most valuable

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.840
possessions. And you don't know whether you've given them away too early, whether

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.760
you've husband them too long. And so in this process, what we've just done is

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.880
we've started to paint ourselves into a corner. We got something we wanted, but

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.160
we've given away freedom. We're now dealing with a 14-dimensional world.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:58.720
So let me just sum this up by saying, between fundamental and emergent, standard

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:08.880
model and GR. Let's do GR. Fundamental is the metric. Emergent is the

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:17.480
connection. Here in GU, it is the connection that's fundamental and the

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:25.960
metric that's emergent. In the next unit of GU, so this is sort of the first

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.680
unit of GU. Are there any quick questions happening to do with confusion or may I

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:39.560
proceed to the next unit? Okay. The next unit of GU is the unified field content.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:50.520
What does it mean for our fields to become unified? There are, in fact, only at

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:58.240
this moment two fields that know about X. Theta, which is the connection that we've

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:10.360
just talked about, and a section, sigma, that takes us back so that we can

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:18.640
communicate back and forth between U and X. We now need field content that only

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:32.520
knows about U, which now has a metric depending on theta. A particular member

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.400
of the audience is a hedge fund manager who taught me that there is something of

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.400
a universal trade, and a universal trade has four components. You have to have a

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.800
view, you have to have a trade expression, you have to be able to calculate your

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.040
cost of carry, and you need a catalyst. Our view is going to be that somebody

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.400
doesn't understand what trade is possible, and we're going to make a trade that

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.200
looks like one of the worst trades of all time, and hopefully, if we have enough

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.080
conviction, we're going to have a catalyst to show that we actually got the

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.960
better part of the deal. What is that trade? What is it that we think has been

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:22.000
blocking progress? In GR, the Ramanian geometry, as we've said, we have the

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:30.800
projection operators, and we also have the Levy-Chavita connection. In the

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:40.400
auxiliary theory, we have freedom to choose our field content, and we have the

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:50.120
ability to get rid of much excess through the symmetries of the gauge group. We

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:55.280
are going to take particle theory, and we're going to make a bad trade, or what

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.120
appears to be a bad trade, which is that we are going to give away the freedom to

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.440
choose our field content, which is already extremely, as I think I said in the

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:10.080
abstract, baroque, with all of the different particle properties, and we're

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.440
going to lose the ability to use the gauge group because we're going to trade it

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:41.040
all. You have the family cow, and you have some magic beans. So it's now time to

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.080
trade the family cow for the magic beans and bring them home and see whether or

01:19:45.080 --> 01:20:09.400
not we got the better of the deal. Okay. What is it that we get for the Levy-Chavita

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:16.280
connection? Well, not much. One thing we get is that normally the space of

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:22.280
connections is an affine space, not a vector space, but an affine space, almost a

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:27.760
vector space, a vector space up to a choice of origin. But with the Levy-Chavita

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.160
connection, rather than having an infinite plane with an ability to take

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.120
differences, but no real ability to have a group structure, you pick out one point

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:43.920
which then becomes the origin. That means that any connection A has a torsion

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:51.120
tensor A, which is equal to the connection minus the Levy-Chavita connection. So we

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:56.480
get a tensor that we don't usually have. Gauge potentials are not usually well

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.480
defined, they're only defined up to a choice of gauge. So that's one of the

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.640
things we get for our Levy-Chavita connection, but because the gauge group is

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.280
going to go missing, this has terrible properties with respect to the gauge

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.920
group. It almost looks like a representation, but in fact, if we let the

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:22.080
gauge group act, there's going to be an affine shift. Furthermore, as we've said

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:27.520
before, the ability to use projection operators together with the gauge group

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.800
is frustrated by virtue of the fact that these two things do not commute with

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.440
each other. So now the question is, how are we going to prove that we're

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:49.920
actually making a good trade? Okay. First thing we need to do is that we still

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.760
have the right to choose intrinsic field content. We have an intrinsic field

01:21:53.760 --> 01:22:02.640
theory. So if you consider the structure bundle of the spinners, we built the

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:10.080
chimeric bundle, so we can define Dirac spinners on the chimeric bundle. If we're

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.720
in Euclidean signature, a 14-dimensional manifold has Dirac spinners of dimension

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:22.120
2 to the dimension of the space divided by 2. So 2 to the 14 over 2, 2 to the

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:36.960
7th is 128. So we have a map into a structure group of U128. At least in

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:43.080
Euclidean signature, we can get to mixed signatures later. From that, we can form

01:22:43.080 --> 01:23:02.160
the associated bundle and sections of this bundle are either, depending upon how

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:16.920
you want to think about it, the gauge group H, or C, a space of sigma fields,

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:29.280
nonlinear. There's no reason that we can't choose this as field content. Again,

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.440
we're being led by the nose like a bull. If we want to make use of the symmetries of

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.240
the theory, we have to promote some symmetry to being part of the theory, and we

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.880
have to let it be subjected to dynamical laws. We're going to lose control over it.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.920
But we're not dead yet, right? We're fighting for our life to make sure that

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:53.960
this trade has some hope. So potentially, by including symmetries as field content,

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:59.000
we will have some opportunity to make use of the projection. So for those of you

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:11.600
who... So when I was thinking about this, I used to be amazed by ships and bottles.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.520
I must confess that I never figured out what the trick was for ships and bottles.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:22.560
But once I saw it, I remembered thinking, that's really clever. So if you've never seen it,

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.840
you have a ship which is like a curvature tensor. And imagine that the mast is the

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:35.720
Ricci curvature. If you just try to shove it into the bottle, you're undoubtedly going

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:41.560
to snap the mast. So you imagine that you've transformed your gauge fields, you've kept

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:47.560
track of where the Ricci curvature was, you try to push it from one space like ad-valued

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:54.560
two forms into another space like ad-valued one forms where connections live. That's

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.480
not a good idea. Instead, what we do is the following. Imagine that you're carrying around

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.480
group theoretic information. What you do is you do a transformation based on the group

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:10.120
theory. So you lower the mast, you push it through the neck, having some string attached

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:19.120
to the mast, and then you undo the transformation on the other side. This is exactly what we're

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:24.640
going to hope is going to save us in this bad trade that we've made. Because we're going

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.440
to add field content that has the ability to lower the mast and bring the mast back

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.920
up, we're going to hope to have a theory which is going to create a commutative situation.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:41.920
But then once we've had this idea, we start to get a little bolder. Let's think about

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:49.600
unified content. We know that we want a space of connections, A, for our field theory. But

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.400
we know because we have a Levy-Chevita connection that this is going to be equal on the nose

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.440
to ad-valued one forms as a vector space. The gauge group represents an ad-valued one

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:13.200
forms. So if we also have the gauge group, but we think of that instead as a space of

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:20.200
sigma fields, what if we take the semi-direct product at a group theoretic level between

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:27.200
the two and call this our group of interest? Well, by analogy, we've always had a problem

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:35.820
with the Poincare group being too intrinsically tied to rigid, flat Minkowski space. What

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.400
if we wanted to do quantum field theory in some situation, which was more amenable to

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:46.160
a curved space situation? It's possible that we should be basing it around something more

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.720
akin to the gauge group. And in this case, we're mimicking the construction where XC

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:58.720
here would be analogous to the Lorenz group, fixing a point in Minkowski space. And ad-valued

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.960
one forms would be analogous to the four momentums. We take in the semi-direct product to create

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.000
the inhomogeneous Lorenz group, otherwise known as the Poincare group, or rather it's

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.000
double cover to allow spin. So we're going to call this the inhomogeneous gauge group

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:25.540
or Iggy. And this is going to be a really interesting space because it has a couple of properties.

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:33.540
One is it has a very interesting subgroup. Now, of course, H includes into G by just

01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:45.260
including onto the first factor. But in fact, there's a more interesting homomorphism brought

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:52.320
to you by the Levy-Civita connection. So this magic beam trade is going to start to enter

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:57.600
more and more into our consciousness. If I take an element H, and I map that in the

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:04.600
obvious way into the first factor, but I map it onto the Morro-Cartain form, I think that's

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:21.640
what I wish I remembered more of this stuff, into the second factor, it turns out that

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:28.640
this is actually a group homomorphism. And so we have a non-trivial embedding, which

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.680
is in some sense diagonal between the two factors. That subgroup we are going to refer

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:41.680
to as the tilted gauge group. And now our field content, at least in the Bosonic sector,

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:47.360
is going to be a group manifold, an infinite dimensional function space league group, but

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:54.360
a group nonetheless. And we can now look at G mod the tilted gauge group. And if we have

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:07.080
any interesting representation of H, we can form homogeneous vector bundles and work with

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.520
induced representations. And that's what the fermions are going to be. So the fermions

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:17.400
in our theories are going to be H modules. And the idea is that we're going to work

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:24.400
with vector bundles, curly E, of the form inhomogeneous gauge group, product it over

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:39.800
the tilted gauge group. And we're going to work with vector bundles, curly E, of the

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:48.520
form inhomogeneous gauge group. Now just as in the finite dimensional case, we have

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:54.920
a linear and a nonlinear component. Right? Because at a topological level, this is just

01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:01.920
a Cartian product. So if we wish to take products of fermions, of spinorial fields,

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:06.480
we have a place to accept them. We can't figure out necessarily how to map them into

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:11.480
the nonlinear sector, but we don't want to. So just the way when we look at supersymmetry,

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.960
we can take products of the spin one-half fields and map them into the linear sector.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:23.960
We can do the same thing here. So what we're talking about is something like a supersymmetric

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:29.240
extension of the inhomogeneous gauge group analogous to supersymmetric extensions of

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:36.240
the double cover of the inhomogeneous Lorentz or Poincare group. Further, because this construction

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:43.680
is at the level of groups, we've left a slot on the left-hand side on which to act. So

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:50.680
for example, if we want to take regular representations on the group, we can act by the group G on

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:55.680
the left-hand side because we're allowing the tilted gauge group to act on the right-hand

01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:02.680
side. So it's perfectly built for representation theory. And if you think back to Wigner's classification

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.840
and the concept that a particle should correspond to an irreducible representation of the inhomogeneous

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:13.840
Lorentz group, we may be able to play the same games here up to the issue of infinite dimensionality.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:22.040
So right now our field content is looking pretty good. It's looking unified in the sense

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.240
that it has an algebraic structure that is not usually enjoyed by field content, and

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:32.920
field content from different sectors can interact and know about each other, provided

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:39.920
we can drag something out of this with meaning. Now, what would it mean to be able to use

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:50.840
a gauge group in an intrinsic theory like this? We would be talking about something like

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:58.400
an action, let's say a first order action, and it would take the group G, let's say to

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:06.040
the real numbers, invariant, not under the full group, but under the tilted gauge subgroup.

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:19.940
And now the question is, do we have any such actions that are particularly nice, and could

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:25.940
we recognize them the way Einstein did by trying to write down not the action, and Hilbert

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:31.500
was the first one to write that down, but I always feel defensive because I think Einstein

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:36.060
and Grossman did so much more to begin the theory in that the Lagrangian that got written

01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:42.540
down was really just an inevitability. So just humor me for this talk and let me call it

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:48.300
the Einstein-Grossman Lagrangian. Hilbert has certainly done fantastic things and has

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:55.300
a lot of credit elsewhere, and he did do it first. But here what we had was that Einstein

01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:02.140
thought in terms of the differential of the action, not the action itself. So what we're

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:09.140
looking for is equations of motion where some field alpha, where alpha belongs to the one

01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:16.420
forms on the group. Now in this section of GU, unified field content is only one part

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:35.660
of it, but what we really want is unified field content plus a tool kit. So what we

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:46.660
want is a tool kit. So we've restricted ourselves to one gauge group. This big unitary group

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:51.700
on the spinners using whatever sort of inner product naturally exists on the spinners,

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:58.700
and not spinners value in an auxiliary structure, but intrinsic spinners. The tool kit that

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:07.540
we have is that the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:16.140
bundle, looks like the Clifford algebra at the level of vector spaces, which is just

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:35.380
looking like the exterior algebra on the chimeric bundle. That means that it's graded

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:40.420
by degrees. Chimeric bundle has dimension 14, so there's a 0 part, a 1 part, a 2 part

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:47.420
all the way up to 14. Plus we have forms in the manifold. So the question is, if I want

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:55.260
to look at omega i valued in the adjoint bundle, there's going to be some element phi i, which

01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:02.260
is pure trace, right? Because it's the same representations appearing where in the usually

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:20.780
auxiliary directions as well as the geometric directions. So we get an entire suite of

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:28.620
invariants together with trivially associated invariants that come from using the hodge star

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:36.500
operator on the form. So I'm just going to call them for completeness. I'm not going

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:43.500
to deal with them. Now this is a tremendous amount of freedom that we've just gained.

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:48.980
Normally we keep losing freedom, but this is the first time we actually begin to see

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.580
that we have a lot of freedom, and we're going to actually retain some of this freedom to

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:59.580
the end of the talk. But the idea being that I can now start to define operators, which

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:07.340
correspond to the ship and the bottle problem. I can take field content, epsilon and pi, where

01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:15.820
epsilon, where these are elements of the inhomogeneous gauge group. In other words,

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:23.260
epsilon is a gauge transformation, and pi is a gauge potential. And I can start to define

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:35.860
operators. I'm going to use, so in this case I'm going to define operators, and I'm going

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:52.940
to define operators. In this case, if I have a phi, which is one of these invariants, in

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:59.440
the form piece I can either take a contraction, or I can take a wedge product. In the Lie

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:05.940
algebra piece I can either take a Lie product, or because I'm looking at the unitary group

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.540
there's a second possibility, which is I can multiply everything by i and go from skew

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:14.340
her mission to her mission, and take a Jordan product using anti-commutators rather than

01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:19.060
commutators. So I actually have a fair amount of freedom, and I'm going to use a magic bracket

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:23.460
notation, which in whatever situation I'm looking for knows what it wants to be. Does

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:28.100
it want to do contraction? Does it want to do wedge product, Lie product, Jordan product?

01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:35.100
But the point is I now have a suite of ways of moving forms around. So for example, I

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:43.620
can define a shear of operator that takes i forms, and I can define a shear of operator

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:51.820
valued in the adjoint bundle. To much higher degree forms valued in the adjoint bundle.

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:11.780
So in this case, for example, it would take a two form to a d minus three plus two, or

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:19.060
a d minus one form. So curvature is an ad-valued two form. And if I had such a she-ab operator,

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:30.660
it would take ad-valued two forms to ad-valued d minus one forms, which is exactly the right

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:37.820
space to be an alpha coming from the derivative of an action. And this is exactly what Einstein

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:44.300
was doing. He took the curvature, which was large, and he bent it back, and he sheared

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:50.660
off the vial curvature, and they took that part, and he pushed it back along the space

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:55.780
of metrics to give us something which we nowadays call Ricci flow, an ability for the curvature

01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:03.340
to direct us to the next structure. Well, we're doing the same thing here. We're taking

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:10.340
the curvature, and we can now push it back onto the space of connections.

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:40.340
So in this case, the idea is that we've actually got something for our magic beans. We have

01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:58.740
an ability now to get equations of motion, which go along the group in some sense. It's

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:04.740
as if it was a gradient vector field, except we're using forms rather than vectors. But

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:11.740
now, what are the transformation properties? Well, because the curvature, so you have she-ab,

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:18.740
because the curvature of a connection, hit by a gauge transformation, is equal on the

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:25.740
nose to the adjoin action on the Lie algebra of the curvature, we know that if we have

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:55.740
two possible actions of conjugation under a bracket, and the bracket respects the action

01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:02.540
of the gauge group, we know that this is going to be well preserved. In other words, we're

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:08.300
going to get a form that is gauge invariant relative to the tilted gauge group. And so

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:15.940
as a result, we now have the possibility for equations of motion, which are well defined,

01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.660
even though they involve projection operators, because we've built the symmetries into the

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:26.660
theory and we're working on a group manifold to begin with. What about the torsion? Can

01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:34.260
we rescue the torsion? Here again, we have good news. The torsion is problematic, but

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:41.100
if I look at a different field, which I'm going to call the augmented torsion, and I

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:48.140
define it to be the regular torsion, which would be pi, minus this expression, this turns

01:41:53.620 --> 01:42:00.620
out to be beautifully invariant again. So neither this term nor this term is gauge

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:06.780
invariant, but they fail to be gauge invariant in exactly the same way. So an important principle

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.980
of life, which I took too long to realize, is that if you have one disease, you're in

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.420
real trouble. But if you have two diseases, you always have the possibility of having

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.140
one disease kill the other disease. This is true in renormalization theory, it's true

01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:23.260
in black-scholes theory, it's true all over the place. So what we have here is we've got

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:27.460
more diseases into the theory, but an even number of diseases allow us to have no disease

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:33.060
at all. So now we have two great tensors. We've got one tensor coming from the curvature

01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:40.060
and the Shiav operator, we have another tensor coming from the torsion and it's augmentation.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:43:00.500
We're doing okay.

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:10.060
We're not doing physics yet, we're just building tools. We've built ourselves a little bit

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.740
of freedom, we have some reprieves, we've still got some very big debts to pay back for this

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:21.460
magic beans trade. We're in the wrong dimension, we don't have good field content, we're stuck

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:26.260
on this one spinner, we've built ourselves some projection operators, we've picked up

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:33.420
some symmetric non-linear sigma field. What can we write down in terms of equations of

01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:41.660
motion? Let's start with Einstein's concept. If we do Shiav of the curvature tensor of

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:53.860
a gauge potential hit with an operator defined by the epsilon sigma field, it's going to

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:03.660
be 0, plus the star operator acting on the augmented torsion of the pair. This contains

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:16.500
all of the information when pi is 0 in Einstein's tensor. In other words, there is a spinorial

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:22.940
analog of the vial curvature, a spinorial analog of the traceless Ricci curvature and

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:29.940
a spinorial analog of the scalar curvature. This operator should shear off the analog

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:35.020
of the vial curvature just the way Einstein's projection shears off the vial curvature when

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:40.380
you're looking at the tangent bundle. This term, which is now gauge invariant, may be

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:47.380
considered as containing a piece that looks like lambda times g mu nu, or a cosmological

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:54.620
constant. This piece here can be made to contain a piece that looks like Einstein's tensor,

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:11.420
and so this looks very much like the vacuum field equation. We have to add in something

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:16.700
else. I'm going to be a little bit vague because I'm still giving myself some freedom as we

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:23.700
write this up. But we're going to define whatever tensor we need for these terms here. This is

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:38.500
gauge invariant, this is gauge invariant, and this is gauge invariant with respect to

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:45.980
the tilted gauge group. These two tensors together should be exact, and this tensor on

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:55.620
its own should be exact. We're going to call the exact tensor the swerveture. So the particular

01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:05.300
Chiav operator we call the swerve, so it's swerve curvature plus the adjustment needed

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:12.300
for exactness, and another gauge invariant term which is not usually gauge invariant.

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:21.300
So that's pretty cool. If that works, we've now taken the Einstein equation, and we've

01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:30.180
put it not on the space of metrics, but we've put a generalization and an analog on the

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:35.780
space of gauge potentials much more amenable to quantization with much more algebraic structure

01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:39.940
and symmetry in the form of the inhomogeneous gauge group and its homogeneous vector bundles,

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:46.940
some of which may be super symmetric. Now the question is, we've integrated so tightly

01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:55.740
with the matter field, we have to ask ourselves the question, can we see unification here?

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:05.940
Let's define matter content in the form of omega zero tensored in the spinners, which

01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:12.940
is a fancy way of saying spinners. Together with a copy of the one forms tensored in the

01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:24.380
spinners. And let me come up with two other copies of the same data.

01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:37.180
So I'll make a d minus one just by duality, so imagine that there's a hodge star operator.

01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:48.460
And when I was a little kid, I had the soma cube. I don't know if you ever played with

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.940
one of these things, they're fantastic. And I later found out that this guy who invented

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:57.060
the soma cube, which you had to put together pieces, there was one piece that looked like

01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:03.220
this object. And he was like this amazing guy in the resistance during World War II.

01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:09.980
So I would like to name this the somatic complex, after I guess his name was Piet Hein, I think.

01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:16.980
So this complex, I'm going to choose to start filling in some operators. The exterior derivative

01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:22.020
coupled to a connection, but in the case of spinners, we're going to put a slash through

01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:29.020
and let's make this the identity. We'd now like to come up with a second operator here.

01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:34.660
And this second operator here should have the property that the complex should be exact

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:41.660
and the obstruction to it being a true complex, to nil potency, should be exactly the generalization

01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:51.060
of the Einstein equations, thus unifying the spinorial matter with the nil potency.

01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:57.020
The intrinsic replacement for the curvature equations.

01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:04.020
Well, we know that DA, composed with itself, is going to be the curvature. And we know

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:14.460
that we want that to be hit by a shiav operator. And if shiav is a derivation, you can start

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:22.140
to see that that's going to be curvature, so you want something like fA followed by

01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:29.260
shiav over here to cancel. Then you think, okay, well how am I going to get at getting

01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:34.460
this augmented torsion? And then you realize that the information in the inhomogeneous

01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.180
gauge group, you actually have information not for one connection, but for two connections.

01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:46.180
So in one case, I can do plus star to pick up the A sub pi, but I'm also going to have

01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:03.980
a derivative operator if I just do a star operation. So I need another derivative operator

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:10.540
to kill it off here. So I'm going to take minus the derivative with respect to the connection

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:17.540
H inverse DA naught H, which defines the connection one form as well as having the same derivative

01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:26.460
coming from the Levy-Civita connection on U. So in other words, I have two derivative

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:31.140
operators here. I have two ad-valued one forms. The difference between them is going to be

01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:36.100
of zero with order, and it's going to be precisely the augmented torsion. That's the same game

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:43.100
I'm going to repeat here. So I'm going to do the same thing here. I'm going to define

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:50.100
a bunch of terms where in the numerator I'm going to pick up the pi as well as the derivative

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:09.620
in the denominator because I have no derivative here. I'm going to pick up this H inverse

01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:17.060
DA naught H. I'm going to do that again on the other side. There are going to be plus

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.980
and minus signs, but it's a magic bracket that knows whether or not it should be a plus

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:41.380
sign or a minus sign. I apologize for that, but I'm not able to keep that straight. And

01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:48.380
then there's going to be one extra term where all these T's have the epsilon and pi. So

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.660
some crazy series of differential operators on the northern route. So if you take the

01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:01.820
high road or you take the low road, when you take the composition of the two, the differential

01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:07.580
operators fall out, and you're left with an obstruction term that looks like the Einstein

01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:14.580
field equation. That's pretty good, if true. Can you go farther? Well, look at how close

01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:21.580
this field content is to the picture from deformation theory that we learned about in low-dimensions.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:29.500
The low-dimensional world works by saying that similar to what we learned in the previous

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:38.500
lecture, we're going to look at what we learned in the previous lecture. We're going to look

01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:51.580
atalities mapped to field content, mapped to equations, usually in the curvature. And

01:52:54.620 --> 01:53:00.620
when you linearize that, if you're in low enough dimensions, you have omega 0, omega

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:07.040
1, sometimes omega 0 again, and then something that comes from omega 2. And if you can get

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:12.140
that sequence to terminate by looking at something like a half signature theorem or a bent back

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.300
diram complex in the case of dimension three,

01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.600
you have an Atia-Singer theory.

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.260
And remember, we need some way to get out

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:20.780
of infinite dimensional trouble.

01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:23.060
You have to have someone to call when things go wrong

01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.460
overseas and you have to be able to get your way home.

01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:27.420
And in some sense, we call an Atia-Singer

01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.620
and say we're in some infinite dimensional space.

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:32.220
Can't you cut out some finite dimensional problem

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:34.400
that we can solve even though we start getting ourselves

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.860
into serious trouble?

01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:40.500
And so we're going to do the same thing down here.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:49.220
We're going to have omega 0 add, omega 1 add, direct sum,

01:53:49.220 --> 01:54:03.700
omega 0 add, omega d minus 1 add.

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:05.140
And it's almost the same operators.

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:10.420
And this is now not just a great guess.

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:13.820
It's actually the information for the deformation theory

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:18.620
of the linearized replacement of the Einstein field

01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:19.860
equations.

01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:22.340
So this is computing the Zyrowski tangent space,

01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:25.500
just as if you were doing self-dual theory,

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.220
or churn-Simon's theory.

01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:30.500
You've got two somatic complexes, right?

01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:33.300
One of them is Bose.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:36.420
One of them is Fermi.

01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:40.260
The obstruction to both of them is a common generalization

01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.060
of the Einstein field equations.

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:48.540
What's more is if you start to think about this,

01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:52.660
this is some version of Hodg's theory with funky operators.

01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:56.140
So you can ask yourself, well, what are the harmonic forms

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:58.140
in a fractional spin context?

01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:01.140
Well, they're different depending upon whether you

01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:04.580
take the degree 0 piece together with the degree 2 piece,

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:05.780
or you take the degree 1 piece.

01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:06.980
Let's just take the degree 1 piece.

01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.380
You get some kind of equation.

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.940
So I'm going to decide that I have a zeta field, which is an

01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:23.860
omega 1 tensor spinors, and a field new, which is a zeta

01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:32.980
spinors, and a field new, which always strikes me as a

01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:47.460
Yiddish field, new is omega 0 tensor S. What equation would

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.780
they solve if we were doing Hodg's theory relative to

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:50.780
this complex?

01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:56.220
The equation would look something like this.

01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:13.980
There'd be one equation that was very simple, and then

01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:15.820
there'd be one equation that would be like really hard to

01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:16.820
guess.

01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:46.420
I hope I'm not screwing this up.

01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:58.180
But all these boards, I still feel like I'm

01:56:58.180 --> 01:56:59.620
managing to run out of room.

01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:49.460
Now, if you have something like that, that would be a

01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.420
hell of a Dirac equation.

01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:55.660
You've got differential operators over here.

01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:57.020
You've got differential operators.

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:08.580
I guess I didn't write them in.

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:11.020
But you would have two differential operators over

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:13.180
here, and you'd have this differential operator coming

01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:15.020
from this more cartain form.

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.980
So I apologize on being a little loose here.

01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:21.300
But the idea is you have two of these terms of 0th order,

01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:23.540
three of these terms would be first order.

01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:26.060
And on this side, one term would be first order.

01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:33.660
And that's not there.

01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.660
That was a mistake.

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:39.260
Oh, no, sorry.

01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.820
That was a mistake, calling it a mistake.

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:44.300
These are two separate equations.

01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:48.220
So you have two separate fields, new in zeta.

01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:51.540
And you have a couple set of differential equations that are

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.580
playing the role of the Dirac theory.

01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:56.740
Coming from the Hodge theory of a complex whose

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:59.420
obstruction to being a cosmology theory would be the

01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:02.260
replacement to the Einstein field equations, which would be

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:07.100
rendered gauge invariant on a group relative to a tilted

01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:08.900
subgroup.

01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:09.820
OK.

01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.380
So now we've dealt with two of the three sectors.

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:18.980
Is there any generalization of the Yang-Mills equation?

01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:22.220
Well, if we were to take the Einstein field equation

01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:27.500
generalization and take the norm square of it, oh, there's

01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:31.900
some point I should make here, just one second.

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:35.580
I've been treating this as if everything is first order.

01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:43.540
But what really happens here is that you've got symmetries,

01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:53.740
you've got symmetric field content, you've got ordinary

01:59:53.740 --> 02:00:02.980
connections, and we're neglecting to draw the fact

02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.460
that there have to be equations here, too.

02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:07.100
These equations are first order.

02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:12.500
So why do we get to call this a first order theory if there

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:16.780
are equations here which are of second order?

02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.380
Well, it's not a pure first order theory.

02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:21.060
But when I say a first order theory in this context, what I

02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:24.020
really mean is that the second order equations are

02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:26.740
completely redundant on the first order equations by

02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:28.620
virtue of the symmetry principle.

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.260
That is, any solution of the first order equations should

02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:36.820
automatically imply a solution of the second order equations.

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:41.380
So from that perspective, I can pretend that this isn't here

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.780
because it is sufficient to solve the first order equations.

02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:58.860
So I can now look, let's call that entire replacement, which

02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.060
we previously called alpha.

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:02.100
I'm going to set alpha equal to epsilon because I've actually

02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:03.940
been using epsilon.

02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.260
The portion that is just the first order equations, and take

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:10.660
the normed square of that, that gives me a new Lagrangian.

02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:14.180
And if I solve that new Lagrangian, it leads to

02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:19.140
equations of motion that look like exactly what we said before.

02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.660
And it ends up defining an operator that looks

02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.540
something like this.

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:37.380
dA star, the adjoint of the Shiav operator.

02:01:37.380 --> 02:02:04.260
So in other words, this piece gives you some portion that

02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:07.940
looks like, right, from the Swarovitcher tensor.

02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:09.860
There's going to be some component that's playing the

02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:13.100
role of Einstein's field equations directly in the

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:16.060
Ricci tensor, but generalized.

02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:18.500
And then you're going to have some differential operator

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:22.340
here so that the replacement for the Yang-Mills term, instead

02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:27.060
of dA star of fA, you've got these two Shiav and adjoint

02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:31.460
Shiav together in the center, generalizing the

02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.540
Yang-Mills theory.

02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:35.540
Then you say, well, how come we don't just see the

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.540
Yang-Mills theory?

02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:39.260
Why don't we see general relativity as well?

02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:41.620
But in the full expansion, there's also a term that's

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.900
zero at the order that's effectively acting like the

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:46.060
identity, which hits this as well.

02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:47.980
So you have one piece that looks like the Yang-Mills

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:50.860
theory, and in these second order equations, you also

02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:55.460
have a piece that looks like the Einstein theory.

02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:59.020
And this is in the vacuum equations.

02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:05.300
So then the question is, how do you see the Dirac theory

02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:07.060
coming out of this?

02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:09.220
And so what we're just trying to put together now before we

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:14.460
come out with the manuscript for this is putting these two

02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:18.460
elliptic complexes together, the Dirac terms, go between the

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:21.140
two complexes.

02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.540
So the idea is that the stress energy tensor should be the

02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:27.660
up and back term, and the Dirac equations should come out

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:31.020
of the term that goes up and over versus the term that goes

02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.060
over and up.

02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:34.900
And you need some cancellations to make sure that

02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.580
everything is of zero with order,

02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:38.980
properly invariant, et cetera.

02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:41.100
And that's taking a little time, because frankly, I'm not

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:42.620
good at keeping track of indices, minus

02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:43.940
signs, left, right.

02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:45.620
It's a learning-disabled nightmare.

02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.060
We've got one more unit to go.

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.060
I mean, there's a fifth unit that has to do with

02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:04.500
mathematical applications, but this is sort of a physics

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:05.780
talk for today.

02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.980
Is there any questions before we go into the last unit and

02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:12.500
then really handle questions for real?

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.060
All right, let me show you the next little bit.

02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.660
We've got problems.

02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:22.340
We're not in four dimensions, we're in 14.

02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.300
We don't have great field content, because we've just

02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:26.900
got these unadorned spinners, and we're doing gauge

02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:31.740
transformations effectively on the intrinsic geometric

02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:35.700
quantities, not on some safe auxiliary data that's

02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:40.140
tensor-producted with what our spinners are.

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:42.380
How is it that we're going to find anything realistic?

02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:44.500
And then we have to remember, everything we've been doing

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:47.220
recently has been done on you.

02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:58.420
We've forgotten about x.

02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:00.220
How does all of this look to x?

02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:07.340
So x is sitting down here, and all the action is

02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:09.820
happening up here on u14.

02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:11.500
There's a projection operator.

02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:12.740
I've used pi twice.

02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:15.780
It's not here in the field content, it's just projection.

02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:19.620
And I've got a sigma, which is a section.

02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:38.780
What does zeta pulled back or nu pulled back look like on

02:05:38.780 --> 02:06:06.140
x4?

02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:10.980
Let's try to think about how we would come up with this field

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:13.020
content, starting from first principle.

02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:18.180
Let's imagine that there's nothing to begin with.

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.980
Then you have one copy of matter, whatever it is that we

02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:27.180
see in our world, the first generation.

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:32.100
In order for that to become interesting, it has to have an

02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:38.060
equation, so it has to get mapped somewhere.

02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:40.340
Then we see the muon and all the rest of the matter that

02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:43.540
comes with it, and we have a second generation.

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:49.580
Then in the mid-1970s, Pearl finds the tau particle, and we

02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:51.220
start to get panicked that we don't

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:54.420
understand what's going on.

02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:56.900
One thing we can do is we can move these equations around

02:06:56.900 --> 02:07:02.100
a little bit, and move the equation for the first

02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:04.460
generation back.

02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:06.700
And then we can start adding particles.

02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:08.180
Let's imagine that we could guess what

02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:09.740
particles we'd add.

02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:14.780
We'd add a pseudo generation of 16 particles, spin three halves

02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:18.700
never before seen, not necessarily super partners,

02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.940
but we read a Schwinger matter with familiar internal quantum

02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:24.460
numbers, but potentially so that they're flipped, so that

02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:26.500
matter looks like anti-matter to this generation.

02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:34.180
Then we add, just for the heck of it, 144 spin one-half

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:37.660
fermions, which contain a bunch of particles with

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:40.740
familiar quantum numbers, but also some very exotic looking

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:42.580
particles that nobody's ever seen before.

02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:49.140
Now we start doing something different.

02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:51.380
We make an accusation.

02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:54.340
One of our generations isn't a regular generation.

02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:55.700
It's an imposter.

02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:59.420
At low energy in a cooled state, potentially it looks just

02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:01.580
the same as these other generations.

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:05.340
But were we somehow able to turn up the energy?

02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:08.180
Imagine that it would unify differently with this new

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:11.980
matter that we've posited, rather than simply unifying

02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.300
onto itself.

02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:15.940
So two of the generations would unify onto themselves, but

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:19.460
this third generation would fuse with the new particles

02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:22.740
that we've already added.

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:25.300
We consolidate geometrically.

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:28.860
We can add some zero-eth order terms.

02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:32.540
And we imagine that there is an elliptic complex that would

02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:35.940
govern this state of affairs.

02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:38.980
We then choose to add some stuff that we can't see at all,

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:40.140
that's dark.

02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:44.860
And this matter would be governed by forces that were

02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:45.700
dark, too.

02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.700
There might be dark electromagnetism, and dark

02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:50.900
strong, and dark weak.

02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:53.380
It might be that things break in that sector completely

02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:54.020
differently.

02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:57.060
And it doesn't break down to an SU3 cross SU2 cross U1,

02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:59.780
because these are different SU3s, SU2s, and U1s.

02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:04.580
And it may be that there would be a high-energy SU5, or

02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:08.540
some patissalaam model.

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:11.740
Imagine then that chirality was not fundamental, but it was

02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.900
emergent, that you had some complex.

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:17.300
And as long as there were cross terms, these two halves

02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:18.340
would talk to each other.

02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:21.020
But if the cross terms went away, the two terms would

02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:22.540
become decoupled.

02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.700
And just the way we have a left hand and we have a right

02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:28.140
hand, and you ask me, imagine you have a neurological

02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:31.340
condition and an oliver sac, sort of an idiom, and if

02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:33.340
somebody's only aware of one side of their body, and they

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:34.660
say, oh my god, I'm deformed.

02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:36.940
I'm asymmetric.

02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:39.060
But we actually have a symmetry between the two

02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:40.500
things that can't see each other.

02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:45.700
Then we would still have a chiral world, but the

02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:47.740
chirality wouldn't be fundamental.

02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:50.900
There'd be something else keeping the fermions light.

02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:53.260
And that would be the absence of the cross terms.

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:55.940
Now, if you look at what happens in our replacement for

02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:59.940
the Einstein field equations, the term that would

02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:01.700
counterbalance the scalar curvature.

02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:04.540
If you put these equations on a sphere, they wouldn't be

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:09.220
satisfied if the t term had a zero expectation value, because

02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:11.580
there would be non-trivial scalar curvature in the

02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:15.420
swervature terms, but there'd be nothing to counterbalance it.

02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.860
So it's fundamentally the scalar curvature that would

02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:23.620
coax the VEV on the augmented torsion out of the vacuum to

02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:25.060
have a non-zero level.

02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:27.460
And if you pumped up that sphere and it smeared out the

02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:29.900
curvature, which you can't get rid of because of topological

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:34.980
considerations, let's say from Chernvet theory, you would

02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:39.540
have a very diffuse, very small term.

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:41.620
And that term would be the term that was playing the role of

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:43.660
the cosmological constant.

02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:46.500
So in a large universe, you'd have a curvature that was

02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:50.020
spread out, and things would be very light, and things would

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:52.540
get very dark due to the absence of curvature

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:53.980
linking the sectors.

02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:02.140
And that turns out to be exactly our complex.

02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:11.140
So in other words, just to recap, starting with nothing

02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:17.020
other than a four-man fold, we built a bundle U. The bundle

02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:19.300
U had no metric, but it almost had a metric.

02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:22.380
It had a metric up to a connection.

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:24.580
There was another bundle on top of that bundle called the

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:25.420
chimeric bundle.

02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:28.780
The chimeric bundle had an intrinsic metric.

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.700
We built our spinners on that.

02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:33.620
We restricted ourselves to those spinners.

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:39.020
We moved most of our attention to the emergent metric on U14,

02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:43.380
which gave us a map between the chimeric bundle and the

02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:45.620
tangent bundle of U14.

02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:51.420
We built a toolkit allowing us to choose symmetric field

02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:56.340
content, to define equations of motion on the cotangent space

02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:00.100
of that field content, to form a homogeneous vector bundle

02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:05.660
with the fermions, to come up with unifications of the

02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:08.380
Einstein field equations, Yang-Mills equations, and

02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:10.020
Dirac equations.

02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:13.420
We then broke those things apart under decomposition,

02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:17.260
pulling things back from U14, and we found a three-generation

02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:20.700
model where nothing has been put in by hand.

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:25.860
And we have a 10-dimensional normal component, which looks

02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:27.140
like the spin-10 theory.

02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:37.220
I can tell you where there are problems in this story.

02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:40.100
I can tell you that when we moved from Euclidean metric

02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:43.300
to Minkowski metric, we seemed to be off by a sign somewhere,

02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.740
or I could be mistaken.

02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:49.060
I could tell you that the propagation in 14 dimensions

02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:51.620
has to be worked out so that we would be fooled into thinking

02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:53.100
we were in a four-dimensional world.

02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:57.100
There are lots of things to ask about this theory.

02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:02.060
But I find it remarkable that tying our hands, we find

02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:04.980
ourselves with new equations, unifications, and three

02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:09.860
generations, in a way that seems surprisingly rich,

02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:17.140
certainly unexpected, and I think I'll stop there.

02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:18.700
Thank you very much for your time.

02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:28.300
So thanks for watching that video.

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:31.340
What I thought I would do, since that was the first time I'd

02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:34.900
really presented the theory at all in public.

02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:38.220
And I'd gotten somewhat turned around on my trip to England

02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:42.020
and trying probably stupidly to do last minute corrections,

02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:44.300
got me a bit confused in a few places,

02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:46.180
and I wrote some things on the board I probably

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:51.020
shouldn't have, I thought I would try a partial explainer

02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:53.780
for technically-oriented people so that they're not

02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:56.540
mystified by the video.

02:13:56.540 --> 02:14:00.100
And any errors here are my own.

02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:04.140
I'm known to make many, so hopefully they

02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:06.620
won't be too serious, but we'll find out.

02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:11.100
So this is a supplementary explainer for the geometric unity

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.540
talk at Oxford that you just saw.

02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:17.300
First of all, I think the most important thing to begin with

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:20.900
is to ask what new hard problems arise when you're

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:23.100
trying to think about a fundamental theory that

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.100
aren't found in any earlier theory.

02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:28.500
Now, every time you have an effective theory, which

02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:32.100
is a partial theory, there is always the idea

02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:36.260
that you can have recourse to a lower-level strata.

02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:39.460
So you don't have to explain, in some sense, everything

02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:42.580
coming from very little or nothing.

02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:45.740
I think that the really difficult issue that people

02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:49.580
don't talk enough about is the problem of the fire that

02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:50.580
lights itself.

02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:52.380
And I think this was beautifully demonstrated

02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:55.220
by M.C. Escher in his famous lithograph,

02:14:55.220 --> 02:15:00.100
Drawing Hands, where he takes the idea of the canvas

02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:03.580
or the paper as a given, but somehow he

02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:07.860
imagines that the canvas could wheel into existence

02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:12.100
the ink needed to draw the hands that move the pen

02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:14.740
to draw the hands.

02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:18.060
That concept is actually the super tricky part,

02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:20.700
in my opinion, about going from effective theories

02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:23.380
to any attempt at a fundamental theory.

02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:26.460
So with that said, what I want to think about

02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:32.300
is what antecedents does this concept have in physics?

02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:34.020
And I find that there really aren't

02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:37.020
any candidate theories of everything

02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:39.140
or unified field theories that I can find

02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:44.140
that plausibly give us an idea of how a canvas would

02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:48.020
wheel an entire universe into being.

02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:51.300
And so that really, to me, is the conceptual problem

02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:53.860
that I think bedoubles this and makes

02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:55.980
this step quite a bit more difficult

02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:59.700
than some of the previous technical steps.

02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:01.420
If you ask for antecedents, however,

02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:03.580
there is one that, at least within physics,

02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:04.900
is relatively famous.

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:08.180
And that is by John Archibald Wheeler.

02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:09.860
And it is a picture, in some sense,

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:12.540
of the universe contemplating itself.

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:15.660
And so this idea that somehow the universe would contemplate

02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:19.020
itself into existence, maybe the letter U

02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:22.140
is, in some sense, analogous to the paper

02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:26.060
and somehow the I, rather than the hand,

02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:29.980
is drawn across to look at a different part of the U.

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.100
And whether or not that has meaning

02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:34.340
is intrinsically always a question.

02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:36.660
People are animated by it, but I don't know

02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:38.820
that people have actually worked on it.

02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:41.420
The quote of Einstein's, I think,

02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:44.180
that really speaks to me often the most,

02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:46.380
and maybe even was my thesis problem,

02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:51.340
was he asked whether the creator had any choice

02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:53.500
in how the universe was constructed.

02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:56.780
And so I think if you believe that the canvas is itself,

02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:05.860
that which generates all of the content

02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:09.100
and all of the action, you're left with a puzzle

02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:11.660
as to how would you move forward from this?

02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:15.220
It might be easier, in a mathematical sense,

02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:18.380
to temporarily put the U on its back,

02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:21.660
to put it more in line with a standard picture

02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:23.620
that many mathematicians and physicists

02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:24.780
will be familiar with.

02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:32.420
In sector one of the geometric unity theory,

02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:35.740
space time is replaced and recovered

02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:39.020
by the observers contemplating itself.

02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:41.580
And so there are several sectors of GU,

02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:44.620
and I wanted to go through at least four of them.

02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:50.380
In Einstein's space time, we have not only four degrees

02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:52.780
of freedom, but also a space time metric

02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:55.580
representing rulers and protractors.

02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:58.100
If we're going to replace that, it's very tricky

02:17:58.100 --> 02:17:59.940
because it's almost impossible to think

02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:03.500
about what would be underneath Einstein's theory.

02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:06.220
Now there's a huge problem in the spinorial sector,

02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:08.940
which I don't know why more people don't worry about,

02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:11.220
which is that spinners aren't defined

02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:15.860
for representations of the double cover of GL4R,

02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:20.100
the general linear groups effective spin analog.

02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:22.660
And as such, if we imagine that we will one day

02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:26.300
quantize gravity, we will lose our definition,

02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:30.220
not of the electrons, but let's say of the medium

02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:32.100
in which the electrons operate.

02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:34.940
That is, there will be no spinorial bundle

02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:37.500
until we have an observation of a metric.

02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:42.500
So one thing we can do is to take a manifold xd

02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:45.860
as the starting point and see if we can create

02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:48.140
an entire universe from no other data,

02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:49.820
not even with a metric.

02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:53.900
So since we don't choose a metric, what we instead do

02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:57.740
is to work over the space of all possible point-wise metrics.

02:18:57.740 --> 02:18:59.580
So not quite in the Feynman sense,

02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:04.580
but in the sense that we will work over a bundle

02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:10.060
that is of a quite a bit larger dimension.

02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:13.660
So for example, if x was a four-dimensional,

02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:17.060
therefore d equals four, then y in this case

02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:19.780
would be d squared, which would be 16,

02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:22.820
plus 3d, which would be 12, making 28,

02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:25.220
divided by two, which would be 14.

02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:27.700
So in other words, a four-dimensional universe,

02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:30.500
or sorry, a four-dimensional proto-spacetime,

02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.220
not a spacetime, but a proto-spacetime with no metric,

02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:35.900
would give rise to a 14-dimensional

02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:40.620
observer's portion called y.

02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:45.220
Now I believe that in the lecture in Oxford,

02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:48.140
I called that u, so I'm sorry for the confusion,

02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:49.420
but of course this shifts around

02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:51.300
every time I take it out of the garage,

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:53.740
and that's one of the problems with working on a theory

02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:55.640
in solitude for many years.

02:19:57.660 --> 02:19:59.540
So we have two separate spaces,

02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:01.540
and we have fields on the two spaces.

02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:04.220
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer

02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:08.340
to fields on the xd space by Hebrew letters.

02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:10.500
So instead of g mu nu for a metric,

02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:15.060
I just wrote gimel mem nun,

02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:18.300
and the idea being that I want to separate Latin

02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:23.300
and Greek fields on the y space from the rather rarer field

02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:26.640
that actually live directly on x.

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:28.220
So this is a little bit confusing.

02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:30.500
One way of thinking about it is to think

02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:35.540
of the observer's as the stands plus the pitch in a stadium.

02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.480
I think I may have said that in the lecture,

02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:43.180
but this is what replaces the questions of where and when

02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:46.700
in the newspaper's story that is a fundamental theory.

02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:48.900
Where and when correspond to space and time?

02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:52.860
Who and what correspond to bosons and fermions?

02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:56.860
And how and why correspond to equations

02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.700
and the Lagrangian that generates them?

02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:01.980
So if you think about those six quantities,

02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:03.740
you'll realize that that's really what the content

02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:05.500
of a fundamental theory is assuming

02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:07.100
that it can be quantized properly.

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.500
Most fields, and in this case,

02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:15.500
we're going to call the collection of two tuples, omega.

02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:18.860
So inside of omega, that will be in the first tuple,

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:21.580
we'll have epsilon and pi written,

02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:23.900
sort of a non-traditional variation

02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:26.100
of how we write this symbol for pi.

02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:31.140
In the second tuple, we'll have the letters new and zeta,

02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:32.520
and I would like them not to move

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:35.620
because they honor particular people who are important.

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.820
So most fields, in this case, omega,

02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:41.700
are dancing on y, which was called u

02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:43.300
in the lecture, unfortunately.

02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:45.820
But they're observed via pullback

02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:47.140
as if they lived on x.

02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:48.740
In other words, if you're sitting in the stands,

02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:51.700
you might feel that you're actually literally on the pitch,

02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:53.220
even though that's not true.

02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:55.980
So what we've done is we've taken the u of Wheeler,

02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:59.220
we've put it on its back, and created a w structure.

02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:01.060
And the w structure is meant to say

02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:03.100
that there's a bundle on top of a bundle.

02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:06.620
Again, geometric unity is more flexible than this,

02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:09.260
but I wanted to make the most concrete approach

02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:11.880
to this possible for at least this introduction.

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:17.220
And sometimes we don't need to state

02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:19.900
that y would in fact be a bundle.

02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:23.340
You could be an immersion of x into any old manifold,

02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:25.780
but I'd like to go with the most ambitious version

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:27.500
of gu first.

02:22:27.500 --> 02:22:30.820
So the two projection maps are pi two and pi one.

02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:33.860
And what we're going to say up top is that we're gonna have

02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:39.940
a symbol z and an action of a group row on z,

02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:44.180
standing in for any bundle associated

02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:46.460
to the principal bundle, which is generated

02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:50.140
as the unitary bundle of the spinners

02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:53.300
on the chimeric tangent bundle to y.

02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:54.380
That's a bit of a mouthful,

02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:58.100
but the key issue was that on the manifold y,

02:22:58.100 --> 02:22:59.740
there happens to be a bundle,

02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:02.580
which is isomorphic non-canonically

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:04.420
to the tangent bundle of y,

02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:08.820
which has a definite and canonical metric.

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.260
And in fact, that carries the spinners.

02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:14.220
So this is the way in which we get spinners

02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:16.300
without ever having to choose a metric,

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.020
but we pick up some technical debt

02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:20.220
to use the computer science concept

02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:23.460
by actually having to now work on two different spaces,

02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:26.900
x and y, and we're not merely working on x anymore.

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:31.940
This leads to the mark of Zorro.

02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:34.460
That is, we know that whenever we have a metric

02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:36.780
by the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry,

02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:38.180
we always get a connection.

02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:41.100
It happens, however, that what is missing

02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:45.820
to turn the canonical chimeric bundle on y

02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:48.180
into the tangent bundle of y,

02:23:48.180 --> 02:23:51.460
is in fact a connection on the space x.

02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:54.500
So there is one way in which we've reversed

02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:56.500
the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry,

02:23:56.500 --> 02:23:59.660
where a connection on x leads to a metric on y.

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:02.980
So if we do the full transmission mechanism out,

02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:05.740
Gimel on x leads to alpha sub-Gimel

02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:09.260
for the Levy-Civita connection on x.

02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:14.260
Alpha sub-Gimel leads to G sub-alpha, which is,

02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:19.900
sorry, G sub-alpha, I'm not used to using Hebrew in math,

02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:27.420
so G sub-alpha then is a metric on y

02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:32.340
and that creates a Levy-Civita connection

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:34.860
of the metric on the space y as well,

02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:37.860
which then induces one on the spinorial bundles.

02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:43.420
In sector two, the inhomogeneous gauge group on y

02:24:43.420 --> 02:24:45.620
replaces the Poincare group

02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:49.260
and the internal symmetries that are found on x.

02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:51.740
And in fact, you use a fermionic extension

02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:53.700
of the inhomogeneous gauge group

02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:56.220
to replace the supersymmetric Poincare group.

02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.580
And that would be, with the field content,

02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:02.700
zero forms tensored with spinors

02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:05.740
directs some one forms tensored with spinors

02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:09.640
all up on y as the fermionic field content.

02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:13.060
So that gets rid of the biggest problem

02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:15.180
because the internal symmetry group

02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:17.180
is what causes the failure, I think,

02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:20.100
of supersymmetric particles to be seen in nature,

02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:23.060
which is we have two different origin stories,

02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:27.340
which is a little bit like Lilith and Genesis.

02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:31.580
We can't easily say we have a unified theory

02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.980
if spacetime and the SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 group

02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:38.580
that lives on spacetime have different origins

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:39.860
and cannot be related.

02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:42.020
In this situation, we tie our hands

02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:45.500
and we have no choice over the group content.

02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:48.700
So just to fix bundle notation,

02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:53.420
we let H be the structure group of a bundle,

02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:55.940
P sub H over a base space B.

02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:59.340
We use pi for the projection map.

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:04.340
We've reserved the variation in the pi orthography

02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.420
for the field content,

02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.780
and we try to use right principle actions.

02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:11.580
I'm terrible with left and right, but we do our best.

02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:14.860
We use H here, not G,

02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:18.900
because we wanna reserve G for the inhomogeneous extension

02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:21.500
of H once we move to function spaces.

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:24.460
So with function spaces,

02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:28.460
we can take the bundle of groups

02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:32.740
using the adjoint action of H on itself

02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:34.780
and form the associated bundle

02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:37.580
and then move to C infinity sections

02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:41.700
to get the so-called gauge group of automorphisms.

02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:45.180
We have a space of connections, typically denoted by A,

02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:49.140
and we're going to promote omega one

02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:54.140
tensored in the adjoint bundle to notation of script N

02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:57.380
as the affine group,

02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:02.380
which acts directly on the space of connections.

02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:09.580
Now, the inhomogeneous gauge group

02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:12.020
is formed as the semi-direct product

02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:15.020
of the gauge group of automorphisms together

02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:17.780
with the affine group of translations

02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:20.140
of the space of connections.

02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:23.580
And you can see here is a version

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:25.420
of an explicit group multiplication rule.

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:26.820
I hope I got that one right.

02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:29.860
And then we have an action of G

02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:31.700
that is the inhomogeneous gauge group

02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:33.140
on the space of connections

02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:36.500
because we have two different ways to act on connections.

02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:39.300
We can either act by gauge transformations

02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:41.700
or we can act by affine translations.

02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:44.660
So putting them together gives us something

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:46.660
for the inhomogeneous gauge group to do.

02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:49.660
We then get a by connection.

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.500
In other words, because we have two different ways

02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:53.260
of pushing a connection around,

02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:55.620
if we have a choice of a base connection,

02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:57.940
we can push the base connection around

02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:00.660
in two different ways according to the portion of it

02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:05.660
that is coming from the gauge transformations, curly H,

02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:09.700
or the affine translations coming from curly N.

02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:15.540
We can call this map the by connection,

02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:18.860
which gives us two separate connections

02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:21.820
for any point in the inhomogeneous gauge group.

02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:25.260
And we can notice that it can be viewed

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:31.380
as a section of a bundle over the base space to come

02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:35.100
when we find an interesting embedding of the gauge group

02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:38.300
that is not the standard one in the inhomogeneous gauge group.

02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:42.100
So our summary diagram looks something like this.

02:28:43.460 --> 02:28:45.500
Take a look at the tau sub A naught.

02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:48.820
We will find a homomorphism of the gauge group

02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:50.620
into its inhomogeneous extension

02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:53.860
that isn't simply inclusion under the first factor.

02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:59.740
And I'm realizing that I have the wrong pi

02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:05.300
that should just be a simple pi projecting down.

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:08.060
We have a map from the inhomogeneous gauge group

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:12.100
via the by connection to A cross A,

02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:13.580
connections cross connections,

02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:16.420
and that that behaves well according

02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:18.180
to the difference operator delta

02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:19.900
that takes the difference of two connections

02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:21.920
and gives an honest ad-valued one form.

02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:23.820
Okay.

02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:28.300
The infinitesimal action of a gauge transformation

02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:29.860
or at least an infinitesimal one

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:32.220
on a point inside of the group

02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:36.540
is given by a somewhat almost familiar expression

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:39.700
which should remind us of how the first term

02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:41.860
in the gauge deformation complex

02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:46.860
for self-dual Yang-Mills actually gets started.

02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:51.860
And so by acting via this interesting embedding

02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:57.920
of the inhomogeneous gauge group on, sorry,

02:29:57.920 --> 02:29:59.720
the embedding of the gauge group

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:01.760
inside its inhomogeneous extension,

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.200
but the non-trivial one,

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:06.560
we get something very close to the original first step

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:09.400
of the two-step deformation complex.

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:10.960
Now, in sector three,

02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:13.880
there are payoffs to the magic beans trade.

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:17.520
The big issue here is that we've foregone the privilege

02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:20.800
of being able to choose and dial in our own field content

02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:23.320
and we've decided to remain restricted

02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:25.960
to anything we can generate only from XD,

02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:27.560
in this case, X4.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:31.320
So we generated Y14 from X4

02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:34.280
and then we generated chimeric tangent bundles

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:35.320
on top of that.

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.720
We built spinners off of the chimeric tangent bundle

02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:41.240
and we have not made any other choices.

02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:44.120
So we're dealing with, I think it's U128,

02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:48.040
U2 to the seventh.

02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:52.320
That is our structure group

02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:56.520
and it's fixed by the choice of X4,

02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:57.800
not anything else.

02:30:58.680 --> 02:30:59.960
So what do we get?

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:04.080
Well, as promised, there is a tilted homomorphism

02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:08.680
which takes the gauge group into its inhomogeneous extension.

02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:11.120
It acts as inclusion on the first factor

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:13.160
but it uses the Levy-Tevita connection

02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:16.680
to create a second sort of more cartan form.

02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:18.800
I hope I remember the terminology right.

02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:19.840
It's been a long time.

02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:23.120
The map is injective because it's injective

02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:24.280
under the first factor,

02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:27.160
but it actually gives us a non-trivial embedding

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:31.080
of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous extension

02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:33.360
which makes the whole theory work.

02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:36.720
We then get to Shiav operators.

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:39.960
Now, a Shiav operator is a map

02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:43.720
from the group across the ad-valued I-forms.

02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:46.080
In this case, the particular Shiav operators

02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:48.960
we're interested in is mapping I-forms

02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:52.680
to D minus three plus I-forms.

02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:56.080
So for example, you would map a two-form

02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:02.080
to D minus three plus I.

02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:07.120
So if D, for example, were 14,

02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:11.920
then an I were equal to two,

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:15.800
then 14 minus three is equal to 11,

02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:19.560
plus two is equal to 13.

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:24.560
So that would be an ad-valued 14 minus one form,

02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:28.400
which is exactly the right place

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:31.120
for something to form a current

02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:34.420
that is the differential of a Lagrangian on the space.

02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:39.080
Now, the augmented torsion.

02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:40.880
The torsion is a very strange object.

02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:42.860
It's introduced sort of right at the beginning

02:32:42.860 --> 02:32:45.880
of learning differential geometry,

02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:47.320
but it really doesn't get used very much.

02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:49.600
One of the reasons it doesn't get used in gauge theory

02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:51.360
is that it's not gauge invariant.

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:53.080
It has a gauge invariant piece to it,

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:56.160
but then a piece that spoils the gauge invariant.

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.920
But because we have two connections,

02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:02.720
one of the ideas was to introduce two diseases

02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:04.080
and then to take a difference.

02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:06.560
And as long as the disease is the same in both,

02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:09.880
the difference will not have the disease

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:11.800
because both diseases are included,

02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:13.920
but with a minus sign between them.

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:17.440
So the augmented torsion is relatively well-behaved

02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:22.440
relative to this particular slanted or tilted embedding

02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:25.760
of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous extension,

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:28.520
which this is very nice

02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.240
because now we actually have a use for the torsion.

02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:34.640
We have an understanding of why it may never have figured,

02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:35.960
particularly into geometry,

02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:37.760
is that you need two of two connections

02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:40.840
rather than one to see the advantages of torsion at all.

02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:45.840
So here's an example of one ship and a bottle operator.

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:48.080
I think this would be sort of analogous

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:52.400
if I'm not mistaken to trying to take the Ricci curvature

02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:56.120
from the entire Riemann curvature.

02:33:56.120 --> 02:33:57.680
But if you think about what Einstein did,

02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.960
Einstein had to go further

02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:03.480
and reduce the Ricci curvature to the scalar curvature

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.400
and then sort of dial the components of the traceless Ricci

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:10.760
and the scalar curvature to get the right proportions.

02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:13.760
So there are many Schiave operators

02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:16.960
and you have to be very careful about which one you want.

02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.400
And once you know exactly what it is you're trying to hit,

02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:22.520
you can choose the Schiave operator to be bespoke

02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:26.560
and get the contractions that you need.

02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.600
Now, I've made you guys sit through a lot.

02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:35.640
So I wanted to give you sort of humorously

02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:40.640
a feeling of positivity for the exhaustion.

02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.600
So the years of anxious searching in the dark

02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:45.360
with their intense longing,

02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:47.800
their intense alternations of confidence and exhaustion

02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:49.720
and the final emergence into the light,

02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:52.840
only those who have experienced it can understand it.

02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:54.480
I've just always thought this was like

02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:56.280
the most sensitive and beautiful quote

02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:59.560
and I wish it were one of his better known quotes,

02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:03.720
but I think it's so singular that it's hard to feel

02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.320
what it was that he was talking about

02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:08.520
because in fact, he sort of explains this in the last line.

02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:11.680
So given that you've been on a long journey,

02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.840
here is something of what geometric unity equations

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:17.160
might look like.

02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:20.440
So in the first place, you have the swerved curvature,

02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:23.160
the Schiave applied to the curvature tensor.

02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:26.240
That in general does not work out to be exact.

02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:30.280
So you can't have it as the differential of a Lagrangian.

02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.280
And in fact, we talk about swirls, swerves, twirls, eddies,

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.720
there has to be a quadratic eddy tensor

02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:41.680
that I occasionally forget when I pull this thing

02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:43.040
out of moth balls.

02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:45.360
And the two of those together make up

02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:47.680
what I call the total swerved curvature.

02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:49.440
And on the other side of the equation,

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:51.720
you have the displaced torsion,

02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:53.520
which I've called the dysplasian.

02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:57.160
And to get rid of the pesky sort of minus sign

02:35:57.160 --> 02:35:58.800
and hodge star operator,

02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:03.240
this would be the replacement for the Einstein equation,

02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:06.200
not on x where we would perceive it,

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:11.200
but on y before being pulled back onto the manifold x.

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:15.400
So a condensation of that would be very simple.

02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.840
In simplest terms, we would be saying

02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.520
that the swerved curvature is equal to the dysplasian.

02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.280
And at least in this sector of the four main equations

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:25.920
of theoretical physics,

02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:28.280
this would be the replacement for the Einstein equations,

02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:31.120
again on y before being pulled back to x.

02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:36.640
Next is the sketch of the fermionic field content.

02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:40.000
I'm not sure whether that should have been sector four,

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.320
sector three, but it's gonna be very brief.

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:45.560
I showed some pictures during the lecture

02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:47.360
and I'm not gonna go back through them,

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.280
but I wanted to just give you an idea

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:52.640
of where this mysterious third generation,

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:53.880
I think, comes from.

02:36:55.160 --> 02:37:00.160
So if we review the three identities here,

02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.160
we see that if we have a space V,

02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.880
thought of like as a tangent bundle,

02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:08.440
and then you have spinners built on the tangent bundle.

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:10.840
When you product, tensor product,

02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:14.240
the tangent bundle with its own spinners,

02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:15.960
it breaks up into two pieces.

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.440
One piece is the so-called cartin product,

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:21.640
which is sort of the sum of the highest weights.

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:25.120
And the other is a second copy of the spinners

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.640
gotten through the Clifford contraction.

02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:29.040
So that's well known.

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.040
But now what I think fewer people know,

02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:34.760
many people know that the spinners

02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:36.720
have a sort of an exponential property.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:39.440
That is the spinners of a direct sum

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:42.280
are the tensor product of the spinners

02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:45.120
of the two summands of the direct sum.

02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:48.480
So that's a very nice sort of version of an exponential.

02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:50.040
An exponential would take a sum

02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:51.440
and turn it into a product.

02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:54.960
What happens when you're trying to think

02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:59.960
about a tangent space in Y is being broken up

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:03.880
into a tangent space along an immersed X

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:05.480
together with its normal bundle.

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:09.280
So imagine that X and Y are the tangent space to X

02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.520
and a normal bundle.

02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:14.040
So the Rarita-Schwinger piece,

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:16.520
that is the spin three halves piece,

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:21.520
has a funny kind of an almost exponential property.

02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:25.080
That is the Rarita-Schwinger content

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:27.480
of a direct sum of vector spaces

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:32.360
is equal to the Rarita-Schwinger of the first tensor

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.680
producted with the ordinary spinners in the second,

02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:37.520
direct sum with the ordinary spinners in the first,

02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:42.160
tensor producted with the Rarita-Schwinger content

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.680
of the second sum and.

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:46.360
But then there's this extra interesting term,

02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.320
which is the spinners on the first sum and tensor

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.920
producted with the spinners on the second sum and.

02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.120
Now recalling that when I started my career,

02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:59.000
we did not know that neutrinos were massive

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.520
and I figured that they probably had to be massive

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:04.880
because I desperately wanted a 16 dimensional space

02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:06.880
of internal quantum numbers, not 15,

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:10.760
because my ideas only work if the space

02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:13.600
of internal quantum numbers is of dimension two to the N

02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:16.360
and one of my favorite equations at the time

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:18.960
was 15 equals two to the fourth.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.240
Not literally true, but almost true.

02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:24.160
And thankfully in the late 1990s,

02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:28.280
the case for 16 particles in a generation

02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:31.440
was strengthened when neutrinos were found to have mass.

02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.440
But that remaining term in the southeast corner,

02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:40.560
the spinners on X, tensor spinners on Y,

02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:45.560
looks like the term above it in line 2.15.

02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:50.560
And that in fact is the third generation of matter

02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.560
in my opinion, that is it is not a true generation.

02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:59.720
It is broken off and would unify very differently

02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:01.600
if we were able to heat the universe

02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.840
to the proper temperature.

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:07.400
So starting to sum up, this is not the full theory.

02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:10.880
I'm just presenting this in part to dip my toe back

02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:11.720
into the water.

02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:14.280
It's a daunting task to try to address people

02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:16.160
about something you've been thinking about for a long time

02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:19.840
and have no idea whether it's even remotely correct.

02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:22.000
This is the Einsteinian replacement

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.560
and it must be pulled back to X.

02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:24.560
That's the first thing.

02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:27.800
The Yang-Mills Maxwell piece comes from a direct square

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:29.040
of the Einstein replacement.

02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:31.880
That is, I don't believe that we're really looking

02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:33.360
for a unifying equation.

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:36.440
I think we're looking for a unifying direct square.

02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:38.040
Dirac famously took the square root

02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:39.920
of the Klein-Gordon equation

02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:43.280
and he gave us the Dirac equation.

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:46.560
And in fact, I believe that the Dirac equation

02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.360
and the Einstein equation are to be augmented

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.760
and fit into the square root part of a Dirac square.

02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:57.680
And I believe that the Yang-Mills content

02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.920
and Higgs version of the Klein-Gordon equation

02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:05.480
would go in the square part of the Dirac square.

02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:08.800
So two of these equations unify differently than two others

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.160
and the two pairs are unified

02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.080
in the content of a Dirac square.

02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:19.520
The Dirac piece will be done separately elsewhere

02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:20.960
when we get around to it

02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:24.600
and contains the Ririta-Schwinger field content

02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:26.240
which is fundamental and new.

02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:29.600
There are only two generations in this model.

02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:33.000
I think people have accepted that there are three

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.280
but I don't believe that there are three.

02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:35.120
I think that there are two

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:36.520
and that the third unifies

02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:38.880
other matter at higher energies.

02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:41.080
The Cortic-Higgs piece comes

02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:43.280
from the Dirac squaring of a quadratic.

02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:45.560
Remember, there's an eddy tensor

02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:48.920
which is quadratic in the augmented torsion.

02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:51.800
The metric does multiple duties here

02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:56.040
is it's the main field in this version of GU

02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:58.120
with the sort of strongest assumptions

02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:01.760
as field content that is originally on X

02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:05.760
where as most of the rest of the field content is on Y

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:07.840
but it also acts as the observer

02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.120
pulling back the full content of Y

02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:15.920
onto X to be interpreted as if it came from X all along

02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:18.880
generating the sort of illusion

02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:20.680
of internal quantum numbers.

02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:22.840
And I should say that the Petit-Salem theory

02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:26.480
which is usually advertised as I think SU4

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:28.560
cross SU2 cross SU2

02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:32.000
is really much more naturally spin six cross spin four

02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.840
when the trace portion of the space of metrics

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:39.760
is put in with the proper sign

02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:42.360
if you're trying to generate the sector

02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:45.160
that begins as X1 comma three.

02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:49.000
Remember, XD where D equals four

02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:52.240
is the generic situation

02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:53.760
but you have all these different sectors.

02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:55.080
I believe that these sectors

02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:57.840
probably exist if this model is correct

02:42:57.840 --> 02:42:59.760
but we are trapped in the one three sector

02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:01.840
so you have to figure out what the implications are

02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:05.080
for pushing that indefinite signature up

02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.400
into an indefinite signature on the Y manifold

02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:11.680
and there are signatures that make it look

02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:14.640
like the Petit-Salem rather than directly

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:17.780
in the spin 10 SU5 line of thinking.

02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:22.120
So we will attempt to present the full theory shortly

02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:24.400
and shortly keep in mind this took seven years

02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:28.120
to just bring me to want to come back to this

02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:30.720
but it must be reassembled from decades of notes

02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:33.080
and that's part of the problem when you're working alone

02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:36.280
and you're not really expecting to talk to anybody.

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:39.480
So I want to thank you for your patience and your time

02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:40.760
and I just want to read a bunch of names

02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:42.080
of people who mattered to me

02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:44.680
and if I've done anything wrong,

02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:46.400
this is not no reflection on them.

02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:48.760
Marcus DeSotois, Peter Thiel,

02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:51.560
Isidore Singer, Raoul Botte, Michael Grossberg,

02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:54.320
Adil Abdullali, Harry and Sophie Rubin,

02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.200
Brett Weinstein and family,

02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:58.480
Heather Hying and Zach and Toby,

02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:00.600

Graham Siegel, Robert Herman and here in Esther Milani.

02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.480
Errors and omissions because I have too many people to thank

02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:26.680
are all my own as for the claims

02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:30.600
that should reflect badly on no one else other than myself.

02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:32.640
And most especially, I just want to say

02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:35.360
that I've asked a tremendous amount from my family

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:38.680
to stick with me on this quixotic quest.

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:40.960
And I want to thank Pia Milani,

02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:43.200
Nyla Weinstein and Zev Weinstein.

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.440
I love you all very much

02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:46.440
and thank you for making this possible.

02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:50.360
I do want to leave you with one thought.

02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:53.440
I really think that we've gotten completely bent out of shape

02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:57.880
about trying to formalize and routinize science

02:44:57.880 --> 02:44:59.160
and it doesn't work.

02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.040
You cannot mandate science as social engineering.

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:04.640
You can't decide that science is always

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:07.160
in the zeitgeist and done by committee.

02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:10.040
In fact, it is essential to understand

02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:12.880
that science will not conform to what you want.

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:15.240
One of the things that I'm very proud of

02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:16.640
and I think is quite true

02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:20.680
is the saying that great science

02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:25.440
has the scientific method as it's radio edit.

02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:27.280
I don't think that great science

02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.240
is actually done the way we say it's done.

02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:33.080
And I think that directs 1963 Scientific American article

02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.280
should be read by absolutely everyone.

02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:38.720
Every time major theories have come out,

02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:40.800
they've almost always been wrong,

02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:44.040
but they're not wrong in an important way.

02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:47.120
And I think that we have to fix the political economy

02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:49.960
of people racing to correct theories

02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:53.320
or point out that there's no agreement with the experiment.

02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:56.840
We are killing many of our best ideas

02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:00.320
by creating a terrible and combative environment

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:02.920
which already attempts to apportion credit

02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:06.200
for work and more importantly risk

02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:09.840
undertaken by individuals.

02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:14.240
And I just think that I want people to understand

02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:16.720
that I've always wanted to share this,

02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:21.560
but I detest the culture that I saw that cropped up

02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:22.960
around what has now become known

02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:25.280
as the cyber-witten equations.

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:26.640
When they were put forward,

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:29.840
there was a period of time where I watched people

02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:32.000
as if it a feeding trough,

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.480
trying to stay up around the clock

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:36.640
to use a new machine tool that had been given to them

02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:38.680
to claim credit.

02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.240
And it profoundly pushed me away from the community.

02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:45.320
We have to become more ethical

02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:47.440
and we have to honor the people

02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:51.280
who are trying to speak and act imaginatively.

02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:54.040
Now, if this doesn't work, if it's silly,

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:57.480
I'll have egg on my face and I'll go on, I'll be fine.

02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:01.880
But I'm very worried that maybe some of the best ideas

02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:05.440
are between the ears of people without the confidence

02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:10.440
in the Hutzpah and just the sort of almost psychotic drive

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:13.640
to push things across the finishing line.

02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:16.600
We've got to be kinder and nicer and more decent

02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:19.360
and stop stealing people's lives, their credit,

02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:22.640
their future and their ability to have families

02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:25.880
and make a living and that's absolutely essential to me.

02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:28.880
And I look forward to finding out whether this theory

02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:31.520
has merit to it or is without merit,

02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:34.160
but I guarantee that if I'm going to go down with the ship,

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:36.520
I'm also not going to be knocked off the ship

02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:40.080
as I was many years ago, completely unfairly.

02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:41.560
And I won't dwell on it,

02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:44.600
but the amount of power you professors have

02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:48.840
is absolutely almost without parallel

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.680
because nobody really understands enough

02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:53.540
to adjudicate disputes that happen in academics.

02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:57.120
I'm going to insist that we fund you better

02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.480
and that you are nicer to the people who depend upon you

02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:03.480
in this beautiful chain that we call

02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:08.880
science, scientific method and most particularly

02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:11.120
American science, which I think is still

02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:12.600
the envy of the world.

02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:14.160
So you've been through the portal.

02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:15.520
I know it was a long slog.

02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:17.640
I hope you found it interesting and enjoyable

02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:19.680
and we'll see you again soon.

02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:21.240
Be well everybody, stay safe.
