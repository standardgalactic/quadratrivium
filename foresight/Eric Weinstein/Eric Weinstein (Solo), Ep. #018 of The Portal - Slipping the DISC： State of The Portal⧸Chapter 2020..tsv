0	13400	Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host Eric Weinstein and this is sort of an unusual
13400	17520	edition of the portal because it's coming at the beginning of a new decade and I wanted
17520	21960	to set some intentions and also to sort of recap where we've been for the last half a
21960	27320	year that the show has been on the on the air and on the internet. There are no notes.
27320	31840	There's nothing planned. What I'd like to do is to just try to speak directly about
31840	38400	some of the things that have been on my mind and give you all my thoughts on your feedback
38400	43240	on the show and where I think we're going to be going to next. So with with your permission,
43240	49040	let's begin. It's been a pretty interesting half of a year. The show has built up a fairly
49040	54560	sizable audience and what's more, there are a lot of influential and important voices
54560	59800	within our audience. So I know that when I'm speaking, I'm reaching a lot of the people
59800	64800	who would be on my dream list of people to interview, to talk to and in fact, to plot
64800	71560	next steps with. So I think we've had a pretty successful run of it. We can still grow the
71560	76120	show bigger, but the show is now large enough that I actually don't mind losing some of
76120	82960	our listeners and some of our viewers by going into more challenging topics. And so I don't
82960	88560	think that our primary goal is going to be building the audience quite as much as it
88560	93640	was during the first six months. Furthermore, I think what's been somewhat confusing is
93640	101280	that we've had, if I recall correctly, 16 different interview episodes and one solo episode
101280	107280	so far. And I don't think that that is exactly what the portal was intended to be. In fact,
107280	112200	you could argue that the portal has not even begun. What we've done is to build up an audience
112200	119040	and to habituate the audience to a different style of interaction. I think we had to figure
119040	124680	out what we were going to do if we wanted to bring you certain high level concepts that
124680	129720	often get lost because the admonition to make sure that you don't lose your audience along
129720	134760	the way means that you never get very far because you're always doing the sort of preliminary
134760	138080	groundwork and you're never actually getting to the meat of the issue. And I think one
138080	142560	of the things that we are very proud of is that we have a very motivated audience who's
142560	149120	willing to sometimes even listen to the show more than once or do it with a notepad so
149120	153160	that if there are unfamiliar concepts, they can be looked up. And in fact, we've noted
153160	158160	that there have been several communities springing up around the show so that people can trade
158160	163560	their questions. And we've been watching you guys answer each other's questions in a way
163560	168920	that's really been gratifying. So having a lot of experts in the audience has been a
168920	175760	huge boon to the show. And we hope to try to figure out how to make community in a meaningful
175760	181320	sense a larger part of the show on a going forward basis. One of those efforts that's
181320	186520	particularly special is that we're trying to enlist artists. That could be visual artists,
186640	193800	it could be digital artists, it could also be musicians. And the idea we have is that
193800	201040	that legion of artists will be able to help push out many of the higher level ideas that
201040	208720	we would find challenging to do just in speech by using sort of the brain's full abilities
208720	214240	to take in new information and also to use the sort of the transcendent modality to kind
214280	221040	of open hearts and minds to truly different and unfamiliar ways of thinking. So I think
221040	228680	we may try to get that going. We need obviously to build a website. We need to have some way
228680	234400	in which people who wish to avoid advertising can can subscribe to the podcast and other
234400	239120	people who want to contribute and be part of this as a movement. We just held our first
239240	244800	live show at the Ice House in Pasadena and thanks everybody who came out. The show sold
244800	249560	out extremely quickly even though we sort of didn't exactly advertise where and when
249560	254800	it was except for cryptically at first. And one of the things that allowed us to do is
254800	264280	to meet the listenership on Moss and you know, it was a truly interesting and in many different
264320	269920	ways diverse group of people. There were pretty even split between anti and pro Trump voices.
269920	276520	People got along great. So we don't seem to be as affected as I was concerned. We might be by
276520	283880	the election cycle. And what I sensed was is that people really want to use the show to coalesce
283880	288880	and come together. And there's a lot of fear at the moment about anything tribal or anything
288920	296400	cult like and therefore anything that might be tribal trades at a discount. So I think we might
296400	302440	actually take a contrarian position and decide that the show in fact deserves more community
302440	308640	based on the way in which we see our our listenership and our viewership going. And so
308640	314920	rather than fear that anything would emerge with leadership because all of course anything with
314920	320320	leadership looks like Hitler to many people. Anything that looks at all ritualistic looks
320320	325560	like a cult. I think we're not going to worry about those things quite so much. So I think if I
325560	332360	can, I'm going to try to realize that in fact the audience is leading and that I need to do a
332360	339440	better job of just accepting that there's a lot of interest in new ways of thinking. And this is
339440	344680	one way of kind of getting unstuck to try to find the portal out of the stasis. And so if the show
344680	349560	is to be true to its original mission, I think we're going to have to take some risks, which might
349560	356640	mean drinking songs, it might mean ritualistic behavior, and hopefully it'll mean a lot more
356640	362800	opportunities to interact through live dates. The show is going to remain unabashedly a commercial
362800	368240	enterprise because otherwise it would never happen. And I want to give a huge shout out to
368400	376760	Cast Media, who has been the original studio and effectively co-producer of the show along with
376760	383160	Jesse Michaels, and the advertisers and the sponsors who've been paying for the equipment for
383160	388240	the people who worked on the show so that nobody had to shell out anything in order to get this.
388240	393920	The show would never have happened if it wasn't taking place as a commercial enterprise. And so
394080	398480	even though some of you find the ads annoying, although others of you find them actually entertaining
398480	404720	or interesting, what we need to do is to come up with a better model and a model in which sponsors
404720	411520	get access to the kind of heart and passion for sticking with the show. So I think I'm going to
411520	417320	try to figure out how the risk-vertiser model works in earnest this year. But it's also important to
417320	421920	me that those of you who wish to avoid having your brain sullied with any kind of commercial
421920	427480	intrusion have an option to do that. We've been doing that through the YouTube videos. And in that
427480	434040	respect, I feel like in general, if you're willing to sit through maybe an initial ad that rolls
434040	438320	before the video goes, you usually have an uninterrupted viewing or listening experience
438320	442920	thereafter. We'll try to get the videos a little bit and better sync with the audio. But most
442920	449320	importantly, what I want to get to is what the show is really about. And the last thing I will
449320	455880	say on the initial housekeeping is we probably needed to recognize earlier that we need your
455880	462280	help. A lot of you guys are audio engineers or your graphic designers or your website builders.
462280	469200	I don't quite know how to source the talent we need from the pool, but I've been bombarded by
469200	475000	wonderful offers from many of you, some of you at the absolute top of your field who want to
475000	480520	help this podcast because you want to see this grow as a movement. And maybe I was slow to
480520	487400	recognize how genuine the interest was. And just to say, thank you. I mean, I think it's just it's
487400	492600	sort of hard to recognize that it's working for various internal psychological reasons. I've been
492600	499600	incredibly touched and I really want to incorporate some of the offers of help because Lord knows
499600	504480	we need it. Just haven't figured out how to do it yet. So stay tuned. I think we'll be organizing
504480	511280	that shortly. We've now got a Facebook group for the portal podcast. We've got an Instagram
511280	517120	account that's growing. Twitter's still our largest following, but the actual subscriptions to the
517120	523760	podcast on both YouTube through Apple and other places are now quite large. And I think it'll
523760	530400	be increasingly hard to shut down these channels to you so that even if we lose one or two of them
530400	535920	because of something we say, hopefully we'll remain engaged and we'll try to make sure that we're
535920	543760	not vulnerable to having the oxygen cutoff. Alright, so what is it that is happening in 2020? What
543760	549920	kind of a decade are we up for? What's going to be going on with the portal during the coming
550800	555680	year, coming 10 years? I think that the first thing that I want to signal is that we are
555680	563120	finally ready to take on something which I have always found terrifying. And that has to do with
563120	569040	idea suppression. Now, before we get to idea suppression and how it functions and what it is,
569600	577040	I want to take new listeners through a very brief description of how we would order the world
577040	583920	relative to the portal and its objectives. So if you will, let me take you back to the end of World
583920	590960	War II. There's a lot of prehistory, but we can't afford to do everything. So shortly after World
590960	598480	War II, there were two very important events in the early 1950s from our perspective, one of which
598480	603440	was the unlocking of the three-dimensional structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953.
604000	614400	And the other was the explosions of hydrogen devices using work of Edward Teller and Stanislaw
614400	621680	Ulam and what that changed in the human picture because we went from a short period where we
621680	627760	were dealing with atomic bombs, where ducking cover was a plausible solution to dealing with
627760	635200	hydrogen devices in which the destructive power was really incalculable. It's the power of gods
635200	643440	used to power the sun here on earth. Now, to my way of thinking, since the early 1950s,
643440	650960	there has been no comparable explosion of wisdom to go along with this new found power that humans
651040	655920	have, this new god-like power. So I've called this the twin nuclei problem of Sel and Adam.
657520	662640	And I think what we've had is an incredible run of luck, and I think it's the most
663360	668960	magical and marvelous thing, but I don't believe that we can count on luck forever. And in fact,
668960	677040	given some of the events of early 2020 taking place in Iraq and Iran, I would say that history
677920	684160	at the scale that we were accustomed to it during the, let's say, first half of the 20th century
685120	688720	could start up at any moment, and we're entirely unprepared for this.
690960	696160	Now, in the story that has this major through line that we've been following,
697440	703040	the next thing that happens that's really important is a guy named Derek DeSola Price
704000	708640	starts to calculate that science is on an exponential trajectory. And rather than
708640	713680	thinking that that's a great thing, he starts to understand that anything on an exponential
713680	720720	trajectory can't really go on because it's going to burn itself out. And if science is the original
721360	726720	seed corn, if you will, of technology and technology of economics, then effectively,
726720	731200	what's going to happen in science is going to percolate through a chain, through technology,
731200	738480	and into the economy with a potential stagnation coming. Now, he started to arrive at these ideas,
738480	746400	I think, at Yale in the late 1950s. It was not well understood what he was talking about. And
746400	752480	still, I'm always shocked that the book Science Since Babylon, which he wrote and which discusses
752480	757760	this issue, is so much less well known than, say, Thomas Kuhn's structure of scientific
757840	763600	revolutions. For some reason, this is so disparate to so many people that we actually don't discuss
763600	775200	it much. Studying this work led to the idea of talking about egos, that is, embedded growth
775200	781120	obligations. Now, embedded growth obligations are the way in which institutions play in their future
781120	787920	predicated on legacies of growth. And since the period between the end of World War II in 1945
787920	795520	and the early 70s had such an unusually beautiful growth regime, many of our institutions became
795520	803200	predicated upon low variance, technology-led, stable, broadly distributed growth. Now, this is
803200	810160	a world we have not seen in an organic way since the early 1970s. And yet, because it was embedded
810160	816880	in our institutions, what we have is a world in which the expectation is still present in the form
816880	823040	of an embedded growth obligation. That is, the pension plans, the corporate ladders are all still
823040	828880	built very much around a world that has long since vanished. We have effectively become a
828880	835920	growth cargo cult. That is, once upon a time, planes used to land in the Pacific, let's say,
835920	842880	during World War II. And the indigenous people looked at the airstrips and the behavior of
842880	849840	the air traffic controllers. And they've been mimicking those behaviors in the years since
849840	855280	as ritual, but the planes no longer land. Well, in large measure, our institutions are built for
855280	862880	a world in which growth doesn't happen in the same way anymore. All right. What then happened
862960	867600	was that a different structure, which I have termed the gated institutional narrative,
868320	874960	came to become repurposed. Now, the gated institutional narrative is like an exchange,
874960	880480	a financial exchange, if you will, except it's an exchange of information and ideas. And in order
880480	886160	to actually participate in this particular special conversation, you need to have a seat
886160	892320	on the exchange. That is, you need to write for an important paper like the Wall Street Journal,
892400	898480	or you need to be a senator or a congressman so that you can gain access to the news media,
898480	904560	or you need to be sitting at a news desk. In any of these situations, whether you're a professor
904560	911440	or a reporter or a politician, if you can gain a seat inside of the gated institutional narrative,
911440	917200	you can attempt to converse with other people within that particular conversation. The rest of
917200	923920	us do not really have the same level or kind of access to this highly rarefied discussion. And I've
923920	929040	previously compared this to what we would term a promotion inside of the world of professional
929040	936560	wrestling. It's an agreed upon structure in which people often agree to simulate dispute,
937280	941600	rather than actually have disputes because somebody could get really seriously injured.
941600	948400	But they're in fact working together to produce an engaging and regular product
948400	955840	for mass consumption. The problem with this gated institutional narrative is that in general,
955840	961600	it doesn't contain the most important ideas. And that is where the gating function comes in.
962400	967440	The most important ideas are likely to be the ideas that are most disruptive. What if the
967440	973120	entire food pyramid, for example, was wildly off? What if fats were not the great danger we
973120	980640	thought they were? And those waving fields of wheat that are fabled in American song, in fact,
980640	987440	give rise to carbs, which are very dangerous to us all. So if everything were inverted, let's say,
987440	992960	where in a world where instead of banishing volatility during the so-called Great Moderation
993040	999440	before 2008, we were actually building the tinder for the world's largest financial forest fire.
1000160	1005440	What if, in fact, we had all sorts of things exactly backwards and completely wrong? What if
1005440	1010400	diversity wasn't always a sign of our strength, but sometimes a sign of our weakness? What if,
1010400	1018160	for example, immigration, far from being an issue of xenophobes versus xenophiles, was actually an
1018160	1023840	instrument of redistribution, having very little to do with xenophobia or xenophilia to begin with?
1024480	1029680	These sorts of ideas can't be entertained inside of the gated institutional narrative.
1029680	1035520	And that's where the gating function comes in. What was originally a function intended to ensure
1035520	1040880	quality control of the narrative became an instrument for something else. And this is where I want
1040880	1045840	to introduce the most important concept that I think we will be dealing with on a going forward
1045840	1053680	basis in 2020 on this program, the disk. What is the disk? The disk stands for the distributed
1053680	1061920	idea suppression complex. Now, taking it apart, the center of it is idea suppression. Not all
1061920	1069600	ideas are good, and so idea suppression is very frequently understood as an important concept
1069600	1074480	when we're talking about something like bigotry or we're talking about something like violent
1074560	1080640	ideology. Of course, we want to suppress certain ideas. But these are not the ideas that are
1080640	1088400	principally important inside of the disk. The disk is actually a complex. It is a large collection
1088400	1093200	of different structures, and it's not controlled in any one place. Many of these have emerged
1093200	1102400	separately. But what makes an aspect of the disk, what shows you a particular component,
1102400	1110160	is that it protects institutions from individuals who are making valid and reasonable points.
1110880	1115760	So if you imagine that the institutions have become incredibly fragile because they're in
1115760	1124240	fact built for growth, and that plan for their growth if it obligates them to tell untruths and
1124240	1130480	to hide certain characteristics because they are not in fact able to grow at the rates in
1130480	1138400	which they are supposed to, you need some complex for making sure that that information doesn't reach
1138960	1145360	the bottom entrance to a pyramid structure. Let's talk about some aspects of idea suppression.
1146080	1152480	The two stories that I'm following most closely, and we can date this particular episode by talking
1152480	1158080	about current events, I think that's fine. The two stories I'm following most closely
1158720	1163280	with interest from the perspective of understanding the disk are the story
1164080	1170800	of Andrew Yang and the media, and the story of Jeffrey Epstein and his recent demise.
1172720	1179200	Now in neither of these cases is my principal interest the ostensible subject matter. In the
1179200	1185760	case of Andrew Yang, Andrew is going through a weird ritual that I've noted repeatedly,
1185840	1192880	election cycle after election cycle. Perhaps the most three recent versions of this situation
1192880	1202080	have been with Ron Paul in his run for president, with Bernie Sanders in his run for the presidency,
1202080	1210160	and now with Andrew Yang. In all of these cases, we see a very bizarre behavior inside of the news
1210160	1216960	media. That is that when the candidate starts to gain traction with the public, they become left
1216960	1224960	off of lists, they become misreported. Very often a reporter will stand in front of the graphic
1226240	1232800	that has that particular candidate alongside others, and we don't really know why this is
1232800	1237680	occurring, and we don't know how these instructions are going out. But in the case of Andrew Yang,
1237680	1244240	because this is taking place in a highly connected internet era, we have people chronicling all of
1244240	1250160	the myriad ways in which Andrew Yang's candidacy is distorted. In particular, there appears to be
1250160	1255040	a different level of distortion taking place at one particular news media outlet.
1257440	1262560	We need to better understand exactly what is the political economy of the news.
1263520	1270240	In the case of Andrew Yang, the key question would be, why aren't the regular news media
1270240	1279120	and the competing news media reporting on the outside effort being made to make sure that
1279120	1284320	Andrew does not appear normally with other candidates in this democratic primary field?
1286400	1291920	It doesn't make logical sense if you believe that the principal reason for reporting on the
1291920	1297200	election is to make sure that the voters have an early opportunity to hear all voices and to
1297200	1301760	begin to make their decisions, rather than immediately trying to pick a narrative about
1301760	1308320	front runners who are always taken to be inevitable. That's a conserved feature of this bizarre
1308320	1314560	election coverage cycle after cycle. The first thing I want to do is recommend that you google
1314560	1322320	MSNBC and Andrew Yang and Yang Media Blackout and look at the impressive data set that has been
1322320	1330160	collected, which shows a singular focus that can be inferred from the data on Andrew Yang.
1331040	1336960	To an extent, this has also happened with Tulsi Gabbard. To an extent, there's been some carry
1336960	1342560	over from Bernie Sanders, but Bernie Sanders' showing in 2016 was so strong that the same
1342560	1348240	games that were applied to Sanders then cannot easily be applied now. But the key question we
1348240	1355280	have is why is the news media spending so much on one candidate who doesn't appear to be that large
1355280	1360880	to keep that candidate from growing? I think this is an interesting topic and what it has to do with
1360880	1367920	is making maps of silence. Now, through the efforts of Dana Boyd and the data and society group,
1367920	1373680	we've learned about a doctrine called strategic silence, and that is that there are certain
1373680	1378800	things that the media may not want to happen. Therefore, rather than simply reporting the
1378800	1386960	facts of the matter, they make editorial decisions so as not to give fodder or fuel for some
1386960	1391360	undesirable outcome. Now, we can partially understand that in the case of copycat killings
1392080	1399200	after, let's say, gun massacres, but it's much harder to understand why somebody coming from
1399200	1404320	outside of the political system would be treated to something like strategic silence or strategic
1404320	1410960	distortion. What we need to do is to have a better understanding of the maps of silence and maps of
1410960	1416880	distortion that take place in our press. What Andrew has done that is special and unique is
1416960	1423840	that he's given us a very large N for our dataset. We now have enough different incidents of this
1423840	1430080	that we can begin to piece together what might be inferred from this very bizarre behavior.
1430080	1435680	The second example of this that I find fascinating is the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Now, you'll hear
1435680	1440320	a lot of other people say, well, Epstein didn't kill himself or it's obviously this or it's obviously
1440320	1448080	that. I have a decidedly smaller interest in those questions. The questions that fascinate me
1448080	1453120	have to do not with Epstein, not with who might have killed him, whether he died by his own hand,
1453760	1460160	but they have to deal with the sense-making apparatus that is the news media around this
1461600	1468960	untimely exit from our world. Now, Jeffrey Epstein was accused of trafficking and had a very bizarre
1468960	1473920	life that is difficult for many of us to understand where he got a slap on the wrist in Florida
1473920	1482800	and appeared to operate with impunity even after his conviction in Florida as a sex offender.
1484640	1491360	What's fascinating is that if anyone remembers the Watergate era, the news media used to go
1492320	1500880	to federal agencies and ask whether or not something was true or false. This gave us the
1500880	1511360	phrase, a non-denial denial. When the question arises, let's say in this case, does Jeffrey Epstein
1511360	1518240	have any ties to any known intelligence community? That question can be asked, let's say, to the
1518240	1524560	CIA, to the State Department, to the NSA. You might expect that you'd get an answer. Absolutely,
1524560	1532480	this person had no ties because the idea of the intelligence agencies being connected to a known
1532480	1538080	sex trafficker seems preposterous at one level, but you could also imagine that they'd get no
1538080	1545440	comment. Now, we don't even have that in this situation. I did this fairly recently with
1545440	1551040	The New York Times and tried to simply use their own search engine. Have you asked the question
1551040	1556800	whether Jeffrey Epstein had ties to the intelligence agencies? The other questions that arise in this
1556800	1564880	case are, when is the last known recording of Ghislaine Maxwell's passport crossing a border?
1564880	1569760	This is a simple factual question. A reporter would be dispatched, they would call up somebody
1569760	1574480	like Interpol, they would try to find out whether people would speak about it or not speak about
1574480	1580240	it. Under any circumstances, they would be able to print an interesting story. For example,
1580240	1587280	Interpol has no comment, or Interpol says that the last recorded border where Ghislaine Maxwell's
1587280	1597440	passport showed up was a border crossing in New York City. Under any circumstances, it is very
1597440	1604000	bizarre to see the map of silence around these questions. Another such question is, if Jeffrey
1604000	1611600	Epstein's fortune came from currency trading, where are the records from his office in Valard House
1611600	1620080	in Manhattan? He had a very large office in a trophy property on the island of Manhattan,
1620080	1625040	and to the best of my knowledge, I have seen no printed discussion of where the supposed
1625040	1631760	trading records of this person who seemed to amass a fortune. Another weird thing about this fortune
1631760	1640560	is that he seemed to live life as a high-eleven figure individual, owning islands and incredible
1641520	1647120	properties and multiple jets, and yet all of the assets I've seen accounted for puts him
1647120	1652240	instead in nine-figure territory. Now, that's two orders of magnitude difference,
1652240	1658320	and I don't think that there are many nine-figure rich who would live anything like Jeffrey Epstein's
1658320	1663120	lifestyle. It appears that most of the assets were put towards a kind of front, if you will.
1664880	1669920	So, we don't have any idea about where the records are of his trading. We don't have any idea where
1670720	1682320	the passport of his partner was seen last, and we also have no confirmation that any of our major
1682320	1688800	government agencies have denied that Jeffrey Epstein, the accused sex trafficker, was tied to any
1688800	1696080	intelligence community. In all of those situations, what you can map with honesty and without having
1696080	1703280	to go anywhere near Tinfoil Hat territory is that there's something broken with our sense-making
1703280	1707600	apparatus, because in the Watergate era, you could have assigned this to a cub reporter,
1707600	1712880	and they would have known exactly what to do. Where are our no comments on the record? No one knows.
1714960	1722320	All right, in those two circumstances, that gives you an idea about how the disc,
1722320	1728400	the distributed idea suppression complex, works inside of journalism. There is some sort of
1728400	1735200	editorial function that is keeping us from learning certain things because certain stories do not run
1735840	1741680	with a little bit of poetic liberty. This seems to be what Paul Simon was talking about in sounds
1741680	1747760	of silence. What we're listening for now are the silences. Where else are we confronted with
1747760	1753120	silence? What are the other things we would expect where we don't hear particular ideas?
1753920	1759120	Now, obviously, you have a situation where I've been talking for quite some time about the idea
1759120	1763920	that there are many reasons that one might ask to restrict immigration. The Sierra Club used to
1765280	1770000	support a restriction of immigration. Farm workers unions used to support restrictions on
1770000	1778320	immigration. But sometime in the fairly recent past, it became an edifices of the elite that
1778320	1783760	the only reason for supporting a restriction in immigration, the only possible reason, could be
1783760	1791520	that you were xenophobic and probably racist. Now, I don't exactly know where these ideas came from,
1791520	1797280	but I know that these ideas are prima facie and preposterous. They make no sense. And so I've been
1797280	1803360	talking for some time about where are the media willing to discuss all of the reasons that one
1803360	1808240	might want to restrict immigration, having nothing to do with xenophobia, the so-called
1808240	1814000	xenophilic restrictionist perspective. This is another place where there is no public discussion
1814000	1819920	and we have no idea why. So once you begin to look for these silences, these gaps,
1820000	1824880	you start to become rather terrified that somehow the world is not behaving properly,
1824880	1827360	and that's one of the reasons that people are flocking to this podcast.
1829280	1836000	This is, however, not my major focus. My major focus of the distributed idea suppression complex
1836000	1845920	or disc has to do with what happens inside of our universities. Now, I'm in a somewhat unusual
1845920	1854800	position in that both myself and my wife have PhDs as well as my brother and his wife. And we've
1854800	1860080	all appeared in interviews within the last five years. So maybe you've seen all of us on camera
1860080	1866800	or have some idea of how Brett Weinstein, Heather Hying, Pia Malani, and I sound.
1867600	1874880	What some of you don't know is that I believe that inside of that group of four,
1876080	1881600	one of us wrote a book immediately after getting a PhD, which is Heather Hying's book,
1881600	1887920	Antipode, about her solo travels to the jungles of Madagascar. So if you have a young woman in
1887920	1894640	your life who's looking for a pretty impressive female role model, I would say Heather's toughness,
1895600	1899840	intelligence, and grit makes for a pretty terrific reading. And I'd recommend buying
1899840	1906000	the book Antipode for that young lady. In the case of the remaining three,
1907120	1916240	none of us wrote a book immediately afterwards. However, I think that the quality of the discoveries
1916320	1925120	that were being explored was incredibly high. And in each case, what I thought happened to those
1925120	1933040	was most unexpected. Now, what are these ideas that I'm claiming were suppressed? So I would say
1933040	1941200	that in one case, we were talking about the reasons why we die. One of these theses contained what
1941200	1949760	I think is one of the best models for the reasons that we have these finite life spans. And of course,
1949760	1953600	we're all subject to what might be called environmental insult. If a piano falls on
1953600	1957600	your head while you're walking down the street, that's usually going to be your exit. But why
1957600	1964800	we age, why we get cancer and why we die, I think has not been very well understood at the molecular
1964800	1971280	level. And I think perhaps one of the first mature attempts to do this took place in my
1971280	1977200	brother's thesis at the University of Michigan. This is one of the major ideas that I wish to
1977200	1986000	be exploring in 2020. If biology is one of the greatest ideas man has ever had in the form of
1986000	1991680	natural and sexual selection in the work of Darwin and Wallace, I would say that the other complex
1991760	1998720	of great ideas, truly top ideas, would be what I would call geometric dynamics. Those are the
1998720	2004800	ideas that take place underneath theoretical physics, whether we're talking about the standard model
2004800	2011360	or general relativity. Now, we now believe that all fundamental physical phenomena can be divided
2011360	2017120	between these two great theories. In one case, that of Einstein's general relativity, it's been
2017120	2023920	known for about a hundred years that the substrate of the theory is Riemann's theory of differential
2023920	2030960	geometry, that is, Riemannian geometry. What is much more recent, perhaps slightly less than 50
2030960	2038320	years old, thanks to Jim Simons and C. N. Yang, is the knowledge that the classical theory
2038320	2044240	underneath quantum field theory is, in fact, a different form of geometry known as Eris-Mannian
2044240	2052240	geometry, Fiber-Bundle geometry, Gage theory, or you know, Steenrod geometry, whatever you want to
2052240	2061760	call it. So, the idea that geometry is the birthplace of fundamental physics, I think, is now
2061760	2068160	generally understood by all practicing theoretical physicists functioning at the top level.
2069040	2076960	Inside of that complex, we've been stuck for approximately, I don't know, 47 years where
2076960	2083440	theory used to lead experiment, and we used to make predictions, and the predictions would usually
2083440	2089360	be confirmed in relatively short order. We have not had a period of stagnation inside of theoretical
2089360	2095760	physics that mirrors this, with the closest comparable period, perhaps being the period from
2095840	2102880	the late 1920s, with the advent of quantum electrodynamics, to the late 1940s, with the
2102880	2109920	beginning of renormalization theory being ushered in at the Shelter Island, Pocono, and Old Stone
2109920	2118960	conferences. So, that 20-year period is now more than doubled, and we haven't been making progress.
2119600	2128720	And I've been very uncomfortable with the idea of coming forward with ideas. Why? Well, to be honest,
2128720	2133680	it's very rare for anyone outside of theoretical physics to have reasonable ideas in physics.
2133680	2139040	I could explain why, but the physicists are fantastic. They've got all sorts of no-go theorems,
2139040	2145520	and all sorts of considerations that have to be kept in mind. And effectively, what they've got
2145600	2150640	is a world that is so tightly constrained when it comes to understanding where we are,
2151280	2156640	that almost every new idea is instantly dead on arrival. Now, this has been incredibly
2156640	2161280	demotivating to people in the field, and it does feel, from many different perspectives,
2161280	2166400	like we're almost at the end, if not of all of physics, at least of this chapter of physics.
2167360	2172400	But what I'm starting to see is that the field has become exhausted. It has been telling the
2172400	2178400	same story since 1984 about how string theory is our leading theory of quantum gravity, that
2178400	2186400	quantum gravity is the replacement for Einstein's search for a unified field. And as the accelerator
2186400	2193040	turns up, the Higgs and little else as effectively no new physical theories arise with confirmations,
2193040	2199200	as the only major updates to our model of the physical world are things like massive
2199200	2204720	neutrinos or the accelerating expansion of the universe coming from experiment. The theoretical
2204720	2211120	physics community has been very slow to own up to just how much trouble it's in. It's an incredibly
2211120	2217760	demanding life. It has incredible standards for rigor and intellectual honesty, and quite honestly,
2217760	2223440	it's been lying for far too long to sustain the kind of integrity that's needed in that community.
2224080	2230560	Now, I don't know whether I'm nuts, but I do know that at previous points, I've suggested
2230560	2235600	things into both the mathematical and physics communities that have later been shown by other
2235600	2243760	people to be correct. And while I was waiting for some kind of confirmation, I was being told,
2243760	2247680	Eric, you're completely off base, you're not getting it. One of these situations involves
2247680	2256720	something called the Cyberg-Witton equations, which I put forward in the 1980s, probably 87.
2257360	2262320	And I was told that these couldn't possibly be right, that they weren't sufficiently non-linear.
2263760	2269280	I'll tell the whole story about how if spinners were involved, then obviously Nigel Hitchens
2269280	2273200	would have told us so, blah, blah, blah. None of this was true. And in 1994,
2274080	2279920	Natty Cyberg and Edward Witton made a huge splash with these equations. I remember being in the
2279920	2286160	room and seeing the equations written at MIT on the board, and I was thinking, well, wait a minute,
2286160	2290960	those are the equations that I put forward. If those equations are being put forward by Witton,
2290960	2295040	why is it that the community isn't telling him that they're wrong for the same reasons that
2295040	2302320	they told me that they were wrong? This is also how idea suppression works. When you are young
2302320	2307920	and when you are vulnerable and when you need the help of older members of your academic community
2307920	2315360	to bring you forward, you're extremely vulnerable to what might be termed the duot de senor of the
2315360	2320000	academic community. Now, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, or the prima notte,
2320640	2326320	there was an old legend that the lords of the manor would command the right to take the virginity
2326320	2332960	of every bride on her wedding night until there arose a miller's daughter known as the mugnaia.
2333840	2340080	Now, the mugnaia had a different plan for she wished instead to be with her husband and not
2340080	2345680	the evil lord of the manor. So what she did was she smuggled a knife underneath her robes
2346240	2351920	and appeared in the bed chamber of the lord of the manor and killed him. Now, this is celebrated
2351920	2357280	in the festival of the oranges, which is potentially the world's largest food fight in which armed
2357280	2363200	combatants throw oranges at each other. I think it's in Italy, if I'm not mistaken, celebrating
2363200	2369520	the victory of the mugnaia. But right now, we have a problem in our intellectual disciplines,
2369520	2375680	which is that when we come forward with our best ideas, very often, even if they're slightly wrong,
2375680	2381920	they're slammed. And when they're slammed, sometimes the older members of the community
2381920	2387280	then take the ideas for themselves at a later point. This has to stop. And I think I've been
2387280	2392320	trying to gather courage to put forward some ideas, which I think some of them, some aspects of them
2392320	2398080	may be wrong, but are certainly quite interesting. And given that our leading theories have completely
2398080	2405120	stalled out and failed to ship a product for depending upon how you count, you know, nearly 40
2405120	2409600	years or 50 years, depending upon whether it's the anomaly cancellation or something called the
2409600	2415920	Veneziano model. I think it's time to simply ignore these people and realize that the leading
2415920	2422320	lights of our most important community have failed. If we don't figure out the full source code,
2422880	2428080	going beyond Einstein, going beyond the standard model, we can't know whether we're actually
2428080	2433600	literally trapped in our local area, or whether we have some hope of going out and looking at the
2433680	2439040	night sky with an idea that that might be the roadmap to our future. So whether or not we're
2439040	2445360	consigned by Einstein to the Elon Musk program, let's say, of exploring the moon and Mars,
2445360	2451600	or whether, in fact, we might get on the Star Trek or Star Wars program of exploring the cosmos,
2451600	2458320	has to do with whether or not we can get the source code. So the next thing has to do with
2458320	2464400	who we are, what is this place, and what I've called geometric unity. It is the aim of making
2464400	2471120	the portal a place where I can have a channel that cannot be controlled by the academic complex.
2471760	2476720	And I'll come back to that in a second. The third area that I want to talk about has to do
2477360	2485440	with markets. Now, markets are really the sponsor of our freedom. By having a non-centrally
2485440	2492320	directed locally organized human activity, free agents are able to contract freely with each
2492320	2499360	other, exchange with each other, build prosperity, lift each other up. And if you are a progressive,
2499360	2505680	you almost certainly really have to appreciate the power of markets. But our markets are in great
2505680	2511280	danger at the moment, in my opinion, because they are being meddled with and they are returning
2511280	2517280	results that indicate that only a tiny fraction of us are worthy of reaping the true rewards of
2517280	2521440	the markets, while many of us feel that we are being left behind. If you look at the wealth
2521440	2527600	structure of the silent generation, boomer generation, generation X and the millennials or
2527600	2534880	Gen Y, you see that the millennials have at this age a massed far smaller percentages of the wealth
2534880	2538400	than the boomers did at the same age. And I don't think it's because they're lazy or they're not
2538400	2544400	talented. So we have a very dangerous situation shaping up where our younger generations are
2544400	2551200	not fully bought in. In fact, in the last year, I just bought my first house. I'm 54 years old,
2551200	2559120	born in 1965. I bought one car and then had to rebuy it when it hadn't got rear-ended.
2559120	2564880	There's something very bizarre about that pattern for somebody who is educated at an Ivy League
2564880	2570480	undergraduate institution and has an advanced degree from potentially our leading institution
2570480	2578160	in the country. We've created a world in which it's simply too hard for regular people to advance
2578160	2583440	properly because the society is not growing. Now, rather than complain about it, I'd rather do
2583440	2589760	something about it. So partially what I hope to do is to show you what's been going on with GDP
2589760	2595680	and inflation by introducing a new theory that combines the two greatest theories we have. So
2595680	2601840	if you think about biology as being driven by the theory of natural and sexual selection,
2602480	2608000	and if you think about physics as being driven by geometric dynamics either coming from Riemann
2608000	2614800	or Erasmannian geometry, then in fact, what would be the meeting place of our two greatest theories?
2615680	2620880	The only place that I'm aware of is that it takes place in economics. And why is that?
2620880	2628000	Because you have apes carrying on the theory of selection, but by other means through markets.
2628000	2632480	And what are markets? Markets are an attempt to create an as-if physical system
2633760	2638800	by uniformizing apples and oranges so that we have a basis for their comparison by using
2638800	2646320	mediums of exchange, like money. So in so doing, economics is the logical meeting place for the
2646320	2653120	two greatest theories man has ever had. And this was explored in the early, rather the mid-1990s,
2653120	2660080	early to mid-1990s by P. Mellani, my wife and collaborator and myself, in work that never
2660080	2665120	got out of Harvard University. That's not quite true. There is a book called The Physics of Wall
2665120	2672240	Street by James Weatherall, which touches upon this. But this work died because of something
2672240	2679760	called the Harvard Job Market Committee. And my wife went into that job market committee meeting,
2681680	2686560	having her work presented there, thinking that she could apply anywhere in the country and being
2686560	2691040	told instead that she had almost nothing and that she'd be lucky to escape with a PhD.
2691920	2697360	Now, in these three cases, that is, a theory of death that comes out of my brother's work at
2697360	2704960	the University of Michigan, a theory of productivity and how our wealth is inflated away coming out
2704960	2711120	of my wife's work at Harvard, and another theory about what is this place and how do these different
2711120	2717360	geometries come together, which would be the subject of geometric unity. All three of these ideas
2718080	2723920	met a level of resistance that none of us had ever anticipated or encountered. And I think it's
2723920	2729600	been terrifying to me to think about the idea of going up against the institutions. However,
2729600	2735840	last year I made an interesting calculation. I decided to look at the presidencies of all of
2735840	2741760	our leading research institutions and to try to figure out how many of them belonged to people
2742480	2752000	who came after the baby boom. In a previous world, let's say the world of the early 1980s,
2752000	2760000	approximately half of the heads of research institutions would be Gen X and Gen Y, that is,
2760960	2768800	Xers and Millennials. However, almost no research university, certainly almost no leading
2768880	2773360	research university, with I think the exception of the University of California at Berkeley,
2773360	2778560	when I did this calculation last year, was under anything other than the presidency of
2778560	2784880	a baby boomer. Now, what had happened? Well, we got rid of a mandatory retirement requirement
2784880	2791680	that probably affected things fairly significantly. And we began to concentrate all sorts of power
2791680	2797360	in one generation's ideas. Now, generations aren't magical things. What they are are instead
2797360	2803360	cohorts that are exposed to some set of circumstances that is peculiar to the time in which they are
2803360	2809920	growing up. So, for example, if your primary experience is that you work hard as a kid with
2809920	2814640	a paper route and an internship, you go to college, you work your way up a ladder and everything
2814640	2819600	works out fine, and pretty soon before you know it, you've got three kids in two homes,
2820320	2826400	that's your idea of what a normal life is. Now, this is sort of the basis of the meme
2826400	2831760	okay boomer, because many of the rest of us who followed this generation have no idea how you
2831760	2838560	would accomplish that in these times. I actually put the blame slightly more on the silent generation
2838560	2842000	than most people do. I think if you look at it, you realize a lot of the problems that we're
2843600	2850080	having now began through intergenerational issues initiated by the silence rather than the boomers,
2850080	2856400	but it's a pretty stark division between the exers millennials and Gen Z and the silence
2856400	2862720	and the boomers as the major generations that are still extant. In this situation,
2862720	2868560	it's terrifying to say what I'm about to say next, but it is time to inflict ourselves on our own
2868560	2877200	institutions. It is time to have Gen X candidates for presidencies, not necessarily just of the
2877200	2885680	political parties, because we've spent what is it, 20 years on on men born in the summer of 1946
2885680	2890320	so far. I mean, we're just at the beginning of baby boom presidencies, and we've been doing it
2890320	2899360	since 1992. That doesn't make a lot of sense. On the other hand, I think that the presidencies of
2899600	2907680	companies or CEO roles, I think that the issue of university presidents, many of these things have
2907680	2913760	been tilted far too much towards these other generations. I think that Gen X has a very
2913760	2920000	interesting story to tell. We were not highly infantilized in terms of when we were growing up.
2920000	2925520	In fact, we had the moniker of the latchkey kids, and we're also not large enough to get
2925520	2930880	things just by chanting them. We have always had the pressure of having to make some degree of
2930880	2937760	sense, because we're just too small as a generation. In fact, what I'd like to do, I've said that I
2937760	2942560	believe that string theory is effectively an affirmative action program for mathematically
2942560	2948960	talented baby boomers who do not wish to sully themselves with the problem of working on the
2948960	2954720	physical and real world as we have it. What I'd like to do is to bring you these three theories
2954720	2962000	over the course of the next year or two. That is, a theory of death, a theory of markets,
2962000	2967120	and how the agents within those markets and the measurement of those markets should be changed
2967120	2973600	and understood, and a theory also about who we are and what is this place in which we find
2973600	2979440	ourselves called geometric unity. The purpose of the portal, if you will, is to create a channel
2979440	2987520	that has never existed. Now, I could try to submit everything to Fizz review of letters. I could try
2987520	2993760	to submit to econometrica. I could try to go through all of the normal channels, and I think
2993760	3001440	what I've started to realize is part of the problem of having screwed up all of this early stuff
3002160	3008800	in our lives, of having tried to do this the formal and right way, so to speak.
3009920	3015120	The privilege of having been screwed over so directly and so beautifully by this system
3015120	3020560	is the right to raise the middle finger to the institutions. How dare you expect that I'm going
3020560	3028240	to use your quiet procedures? If you think about what peer review is, it's the exact opposite of
3028320	3033440	what peer review should mean. Peer review should mean that you publish your article, and then the
3033440	3039440	peers in the community review it. But in fact, what it is is peer suppression. You take your
3039440	3045920	article and you mail it off to somebody who you don't know. That person gets an early look at it.
3045920	3052400	They might hold it up in review. They then inflict any changes that they want or they reject it for
3052400	3057760	reasons that make no sense, and then it's handed back to you. Now, why does it have such a positive
3058960	3064960	spin? It's not long-standing in the community. It doesn't seem to have a very long history,
3064960	3070720	but it came out of an effort to quality control new ideas. We wanted to know if new ideas were
3070720	3076480	coming from reputable people. Were they using reasonable methods? Were they reasonably familiar
3076480	3084480	with their fields? In fact, that is the good reason that we had this new technique of peer review.
3084560	3089600	Previously, editors had been tasked with being responsible for the field and figuring out
3089600	3096640	whether or not something was up to snuff. In this new situation, it was perfectly constructed for
3096640	3102880	abuse. In fact, what you find is that it's like what my brother refers to as the low-posted speed
3102880	3109360	limit in a southern town. The key question isn't peer review. It's how is it enforced for different
3109360	3116480	people? That is, if you are a famous professor who is well plugged into a journal where your
3116480	3121120	friend is the editor, you're going to have an entirely different experience with peer review
3121120	3128480	than if you submit the exact same article coming from some place that is not well known to that
3128480	3135360	journal and in which there is a bias against that group. For example, if I were to point out that
3135360	3144080	every purebred dog in a kennel show is a product of intelligent design, that is, that humans
3144080	3151760	have commanded canines with whom and how they can mate, that process has produced things like
3151760	3159360	doxons and poodles. However, if I use words like intelligent design, I guarantee you that even though
3159360	3165040	it's clearly true that dogs are intelligently designed, that that paper will be rejected
3165040	3171840	because there is a belief that we should have a line which says no paper on intelligent design
3171840	3178080	has ever been accepted by a leading peer review journal. Now, that political understanding
3178080	3184160	of intelligent design has to do with both a reasonable idea and an unreasonable idea.
3184960	3190080	The reasonable idea is that you should not be able to smuggle Jesus into evolutionary
3190080	3196000	theory. You should not be able to do young earth creationism inside of a scientific context.
3196000	3203760	That is the previous reasonable version of peer review. It makes sense as quality control.
3204640	3209520	But what happens when you start talking about perception mediated selection? For example,
3210160	3216080	pseudo-copulation in orchids, which we've discussed before, or in the predatory system
3216080	3222800	with the muscle lampicillus, where the perception of the bass matters because it thinks that it's
3222800	3230640	consuming a baitfish, but in fact, that's a fake baitfish filled with the young of the muscle.
3231280	3235680	In both of those cases, you have perception mediated selection, and you could make an argument
3235760	3240640	that that should be called intelligent design. But those magic words can't appear in that journal.
3240640	3247520	Why? For a political reason. So what we have is we've created a system based around quality control
3247520	3254400	that in fact is rife and open for abuse. In that system, we now have to realize that we need other
3254400	3260800	channels. We need an ability to route around. We need to be able to reinsert dissidents and people
3260800	3266000	who do not get along with institutions back inside of the institutions. If you look at
3266000	3272880	Noam Chomsky sitting at MIT, you will realize that it was once the case that such people were much
3272880	3277520	more common. You can look up a fellow, an old friend of mine named Serge Lang, and you could
3277520	3282720	scarcely believe that such a person could have existed at Yale, but that person very much did
3282720	3289360	exist. You can look at an old controversy about David Baltimore and a woman named Margo O'Toole
3289360	3298880	and the courage of Mark Ptashny and Walter Gilbert in fighting a Nobel laureate when Margo O'Toole
3298880	3306160	accused a colleague of the Nobel laureate of misconduct or at least irreproducibility of results.
3307200	3312880	We have a long and storied history that has gone wildly off the rails with the crisis in
3312960	3319280	current sense-making. The purpose of the portal was always to set up a channel by which we would
3319280	3324960	have enough people watching that we could attempt to keep people from being rolled in the alleys
3324960	3329680	when they contradicted the institutions. That is, in large measure, what we're here to do.
3329680	3334480	If you look at our episode with Timor Karan, we introduced you to a concept of preference
3334480	3342480	falsification. Right now, the danger of the Andrew Yang and the Jeffrey Epstein situations is that
3342480	3347440	they have conveniently communicated to many people, of course we're going to mess with your
3347440	3352720	sense-making. What is it you're prepared to do about it? This brings us to a final issue which
3352720	3358960	I think is incredibly important, which has to do with why there are no living heroes. In effect,
3359600	3365600	we almost don't believe in heroism. As soon as somebody starts to make us excited about the world
3365600	3370960	and what is possible for the individual, we come to start feeling terrible about that person unless
3370960	3376240	they're trapped inside of a Marvel movie or something like that. If you go back to the history
3376240	3380800	of ticker tape parades, you will see that there were many ticker tape parades given
3380800	3386560	for individual aviators, individual explorers, ships captains who put their ship at risk to
3386560	3396480	rescue the crew of another. In fact, this pattern largely stopped. My contention is that the difficult
3396480	3404560	case of Charles Lindbergh may have marked a turning point. In Lindbergh's case, he had flown
3404560	3410480	solo to Europe from the United States and come back a hero, I believe in the late 1920s. Lindbergh
3410480	3416000	was a very difficult human being to deal with because he was an authentic hero and he was also
3416000	3422400	somebody who believed in America first in an isolationism. Given the Nazi menace in Europe,
3423200	3430400	I think that's almost an unforgivable position. Nevertheless, the fact is that Lindbergh commanded
3430400	3436400	tremendous popularity and that popularity could have been used to keep the U.S. out of a war.
3437600	3444960	What I find is that since Lindbergh, it has been very rare to elevate any individual to the point
3444960	3451360	where they can oppose our institutions. The Pete Seegers and Albert Einstein's of the world who
3451440	3459120	fought against McCarthyism were a huge danger to the industry that was cropping up around
3459120	3465120	anti-communism. When it came to the Vietnam War, it was very dangerous to have popular
3465120	3471840	entertainers like John Lennon who were against it. We have been frightened about individuals
3471840	3476880	coming to rival our institutions in terms of power. That's what's so great about
3476880	3482240	the New Revolution and long-form podcasting and all of these other forms of social media.
3482240	3487520	Now, we have a great danger in that most of these platforms are mediated. We saw what happened to
3487520	3494400	Alex Jones. It's quite possible that if these powerful institutions come to believe that a
3494400	3500800	particular individual should be removed, they can always choose to enforce the rules in a different
3500800	3510160	way. We saw recently the advent of terms of service changes to include dead naming. Now,
3510160	3517520	if I say that Walter Carlos composed the album Switched on Bach or performed the album Switched
3517520	3524400	on Bach, that is a true statement. But because Walter Carlos became Wendy Carlos, I have no idea
3524400	3530080	whether or not I can be accused of dead naming. Imagine that you have 100 such rules, rules that
3530160	3536400	are never spelled out, never clear, that can be enforced any which way to deny someone access to
3536400	3542480	the major platforms. This is the great danger with this moment. We have unprecedented access,
3542480	3548400	but we also have a gating function which can be turned on at any time if we fall out of line with
3548400	3555520	the institutions. I want to read you one tweet that has been on my mind for quite some time.
3555520	3560000	This tweet came from a contributor to The Washington Post, who's a professor at the Fletcher
3560000	3565680	School. It said, good morning, Eric. I'm going to leave out the parentheses. I've read up on a
3565680	3571280	few of your notions, and I have some thoughts, but my basic conclusion is simple. What's true
3571280	3580160	isn't new, and what's new isn't true. I think it's fantastic. I was stung by it because at first,
3580160	3584640	I was under the impression that we were still living in a world in which The Washington Post,
3584640	3590400	New York Times, Harvard, Stanford, what have you, control the major conversation.
3591520	3598080	Coming off of a recent date at the Ice House in Pasadena, which was a live gig with Peter Thiel,
3598080	3604240	I've started to realize how powerful this new movement is. We can reach anyone anywhere. What
3604240	3609760	I now believe is that the gated institutional narrative has been spoiling for a fight. We are
3610400	3616400	quickly coming to the point where we have a David and Goliath moment. We now need to try to
3616400	3621600	re-inflict the individuals who are uncorrelated, who are not particularly good at taking orders,
3621600	3626560	who don't like committee meetings, who don't want to sign loyalty oaths, but who are passionately
3627200	3631840	committed to the public good and to some version of intellectual meta-honesty.
3632480	3637680	We need these people to once again take up positions inside of the institutions,
3637680	3642720	and I would like to, in fact, inflict myself on my favorite institution, Harvard University.
3642720	3647200	The children of Harvard University have always been divided into white sheep and black sheep,
3647200	3652080	and there's no question that I represent black sheep Harvard. But I also think that one of the
3652080	3656800	features of the university that makes it great is that it has tolerated both its white sheep
3656800	3663040	and its black sheep. It is time to do battle with the oppressive structures that have been used to
3663040	3669120	silence new ideas. If in my family I assert that there might be as many as three revolutionary
3669120	3676160	Nobel quality ideas in one clutch, how many ideas might there be suppressed if that is actually
3676160	3682240	true? How many people are sitting on top of intellectual gold that never got its chance
3682240	3687840	to see the light of day? What I'd like to do is to try to do battle with the disc, to show you
3687920	3694000	that it exists, to try to figure out how it works, and to try to show that the tools that we currently
3694000	3700240	have may be powerful enough to defeat it. This is the actual purpose of the portal, and I think
3700240	3706720	even if we lose some viewers and some listeners, even if people start to see articles appearing
3706720	3712560	that say how terrible the show is and how it's trying to foment some kind of unrest, to hell with
3712560	3718480	them. We are in an amazing position to try to do something new and to stand up for a lot of people
3718480	3723840	who may have given up on their own original ideas and to try to spark a revolution because if I'm
3723840	3730640	right the disc has been sitting up on top of some of our best and most hopeful ideas for a way out
3730640	3736720	of our economic condundrums, our military problems, ideas which have some chance of delivering us to
3736720	3741840	a much more interesting and brighter tomorrow. So I hope that this is going to be an unbelievable
3741840	3746400	decade. Thank you guys for sticking with it. I'm sorry if this was a little bit long, but it was a
3746400	3750960	lot to say and it was heartfelt and quite important to me to get it out, and we will return to trying
3750960	3756160	to get you high quality content either in the form of interviews which you've become used to on the
3756160	3761360	portal, or perhaps some new visual content that allows you to understand ideas that would be very
3761360	3767680	difficult to communicate, but for some novel means of presentation. We hope to approach the community
3767680	3771440	to try to coordinate people who are eager to contribute back into the program
3771440	3776400	and maybe get a little bit of a closer relationship to our content going forward,
3776400	3781680	maybe influence it a little bit, and we haven't figured out all of the bugs. So thanks for being
3781680	3786880	part of the initial experiment. Thanks for sticking with us and we're looking forward to being with you
3787840	3792400	in the coming year and decade ahead. So you've been through the portal for our first solo episode
3792400	3803120	of 2020, and be well everybody. Stay tuned.
