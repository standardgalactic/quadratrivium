0	4680	Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host Eric Weinstein and I think that
4680	8560	today's must be the most unusual episode yet of a podcast that has been
8560	14040	marked by almost regular unusual episodes. Now this is the first podcast that
14040	17840	I'm recording at home. I don't really have a home recording studio so we're
17840	21840	really doing this from chicken wire and masking tape. But I am sheltering in
21840	27440	place because of the worldwide COVID pandemic and what we've been asked by
27440	30720	the state of California and by the federal government is to shelter in
30720	36560	place for an upcoming month because today is April 1st. Now during a pandemic I
36560	41160	can assure you that no one is interested in April Fool's jokes. So the question is
41160	45560	what to do with the April Fool's tradition in a situation in which nobody
45560	50880	wants a prank. I thought that this was probably the best time to launch an idea
50880	55640	that I've been playing with for years and that idea is that it is dangerous to
55640	61520	have a world in which we are afraid to talk about what we think is true. When I
61520	65920	think about what happened during the beginning of the COVID pandemic I find
65920	72200	that we were in general intimidated from sharing our fears about the virus. We
72200	77040	were told that if we wore masks that we were acting in a peculiar fashion. If we
77040	81480	refused to shake hands that we were behaving in a strange and unpleasant
81840	86040	social way. We did not want to be alarmist. We did not want to be seen as
86040	90640	chicken little and in fact it was extremely important that we not be seen
90640	97160	as xenophobic given that the outbreak was originating in Wuhan China. In fact
97160	101080	perhaps the most dangerous idea was that this outbreak might have been
101080	106120	connected to some research being done in a lab perhaps a bio weapons lab. We
106120	110680	really don't know where this epidemic began. What is the etiology of something
110680	115480	that is causing the entire world economy to effectively shut down? What I
115480	120280	believe is that that silence has been deadly. We have many people who have now
120280	125360	lost their lives because we did not feel free to exchange ideas to think and to
125360	130360	talk and in fact many of the people who warned us first were the freest members
130360	134640	of society having been previously cancelled by standard mainstream
134640	139400	institutions and their associated media. So what I thought would be important
139560	144480	for in April Fool's Day that no one wants to actually participate in was to deal
144480	150720	with an idea that maybe one day a year we should all be free to share crazy
150720	155240	ideas that are going around between our ears and in our head. We're having
155240	159120	conversations with ourselves wondering is anyone else seeing the same thing that
159120	164280	I'm seeing. But we are too afraid because the social stigma for actually
164280	168200	believing in things that maybe things are possible or perhaps there's a
168200	173200	conspiracy somewhere. Perhaps we are ill-prepared. For example, I believe that
173200	178160	our current pandemic is exacerbated because our government and our readiness
178160	182600	is ours failed to stock adequate supplies and that these supplies were
182600	187200	called for in the academic literature for years. There was absolutely no excuse
187200	191080	not to have personal protective equipment stocked for doctors and
191080	194920	nurses and hospitals to say nothing of all of the people who were in the front
194920	201680	lines of treating patients sick with COVID. Now currently I don't believe that
201680	205760	you can trust the World Health Organization. Absolutely not. I don't think
205760	208880	you can trust the Surgeon General of the United States and I absolutely don't
208880	214040	think you can trust the CDC because they are all covering for our inadequacy. This
214040	218520	was a problem that we always knew was coming and we at one point had stocks
218520	222040	which apparently were depleted under a previous administration and not restocked
222080	228120	under this administration. In fact, our fear of dealing with a pervasive
228120	233480	institutional incompetence has blinded us to the degradation in our society
233480	238560	across all major institutions. As I've discussed before on the program, I believe
238560	242920	that this has a singular etiology. That is, that because of embedded growth
242920	247840	obligations coming from the previous era of unsustainable post-war growth from
247840	254160	about 1945 to 1971-73 something like that, we built in expectations to our
254160	259160	system that cannot currently be met. We will not have technology that follows
259160	265840	the same breakneck pace of innovation. As a result, we have a system whereby the
265840	270360	heads of our organizations are forced to cover for their inadequacies because
270360	274560	growth is built into the system that cannot be sustained. Therefore, there is
274560	280160	not the funding, the manpower, there is not the wherewithal to continue many of
280160	284920	our programs because we do not actually have the ability to continue to simply
284920	290760	grow our way out, at least so far. So what's today's program about? Well, I
290760	296120	thought that what I would do is to let go of something that I've been keeping
296120	310600	pretty close for, I think, about 37 years. When I was around 19, I started, it's hard
310600	316160	to talk about, when I was around 18 or 19, I was at the University of Pennsylvania
316160	321560	and I thought I saw a glimmer of hope. I thought I saw that some new equations
321560	325440	that were being played with might actually provide a solution to some of the
325440	330680	problems that had bedeviled Einstein and others for years in the quest for a
330680	335440	unified field theory. Now, it's an embarrassing thing to say that one is a
335440	340280	unified field theorist. It is effectively equivalent to saying I'm interested in
340280	346600	perpetual motion machines or that I have a private cure for cancer that I'm
346600	351240	trying on rabbits in my backyard. However, I actually think that it's
351280	357960	important to fess up because that's exactly what this is. Now, in my situation,
357960	364320	I have an extremely unusual history and I really don't want to get bogged down in
364320	368440	all of the things that happened while I was a student trying to develop this
368440	373240	theory because it is not a particularly happy story. I believe that this theory
373360	381760	is an incredibly joyous one. Now, in this situation, I want to talk about what it
381760	387520	means to have a theory of everything. We've never seen one and in fact, not
387520	390840	only have we never seen a theory of everything, we've never even seen, I
390840	395000	believe, a candidate for a theory of everything. And because a theory of
395000	398360	everything would have to have different characteristics than I believe every
398360	402520	theory that has gone before, we don't think enough about what the difference is
402680	407880	between what we would normally call in physics an effective theory and a
407880	413200	fundamental one. Now, if you're familiar with the M.C. Escher drawing called
413560	420760	Drawing Hands, it is a lithograph of two hands apparently drawing each other
420760	428480	into existence on some kind of a canvas or piece of paper. That is sometimes
428520	433320	referred to as a strange loop. But it, in fact, is an attempt to answer the
433320	438560	question, what is the fire that lights itself? This is the problem that
438560	442680	bedevils us when we search for a unified theory that doesn't bedevil us, in my
442680	448600	opinion, in any previous effective theory. Now, why is that? Well, many people
448600	453000	confuse a theory of everything as if they imagine that it's a theory in which
453000	456680	you can compute every eventuality. And it is absolutely not that because the
456680	461320	computational power is very different than the question of whether or not the
461320	466600	rules are effectively given. I've analogized it to a game of chess and
467000	471040	knowing all of the rules is equivalent to a theory of everything. Knowing how to
471040	476240	play chess well is an entirely different question. But in the case of a theory of
476240	481080	everything, or a unified field theory, if you will, many people also take it to
481080	486120	be an answer to the question, why is there something rather than nothing? And I
486120	489400	don't think that this is, in fact, what a theory of everything is meant to be
489400	495000	either. Now, why is that? Well, because I believe at some level it is impossible for
495000	500800	most of us to imagine an airtight argument, mathematically speaking, which
500800	507360	coaxes out of an absolute void a something. However, there's a different
507360	512080	question which I think might actually animate us and which is the right
512080	517800	question to ask of a potential candidate. And that is, how does one get
517800	525120	everything from almost nothing? In the MC Escher drawing or lithograph, hands
525120	530320	drawing hands or drawing hands, what we see is that the paper is presupposed.
530880	535000	That is, if you could imagine a theory of everything, it would be like saying, if I
535000	540320	posit the paper, can the paper will the ink into being such that the ink gives
540360	544480	rise to the pens and the pens draw the hands, which in fact, manipulate the
544480	550480	pens to use the ink. That kind of a problem is one which is of a very
550480	554960	different character than everything that has gone before. It is also, in my
554960	559520	opinion, an explanation of why the physics community has been stalled for
559520	565040	nearly 50 years since around 1973, when the standard model was intellectually
565080	571840	in place. Now, consider this. We have never had in modern times a drought where no
571840	577280	person working in pure fundamental theory has taken a trip to Stockholm just as a
577280	583760	rough indicator for contributing to the standard model. No one, in my opinion,
583760	589200	since let's see, Frank Wilczek, who was born in 1951, no one born after that
589200	593400	time has in fact contributed to the standard model in a clear and profound
593440	597720	way. That is not to say that no work has been done, but for the most part, the
597720	602680	current generation of physicists has for more than 40 years and almost 50 years
602680	608160	remain stagnant within the standard paradigm of physics, which is positing
608160	613040	theories that are then verified by experiment. Now, my belief, which is
613040	618920	relatively radical, is that there is no way to get to our final destination
618960	623560	using the tools that have gotten us to where we are now. In other words, what
623560	627800	got you here cannot get you there. And in particular, one of the biggest
627800	632480	problems we have is the political economy of science. We have effectively
632480	638280	starved our scientific enterprise for resources, creating a dire and cutthroat
638280	643400	competition, which has completely deranged the scientific tradition. And so one
643400	646600	of the things that's going to happen in this lecture is that I'm simply going
646600	651640	to announce that I have broken and have broken for many years with just about
651640	656440	every expectation of standard science. That is not to say that the equations or
656440	661160	the style of presentation is going to be foreign, quite the contrary. I have every
661160	666840	intention of writing up some results in standard terminology wherever possible
666840	672200	using popular mathematical type setting programs, but it goes far deeper than
672200	676400	this. My belief is that what we've created is a career structure, a journal
676400	681920	structure, an employment structure, an access structure that cannot possibly
681920	690160	complete the job. And why is that? Well, what if in the last leg, in fact, we had
690160	696960	a situation by which an attempt at the fundamental theory would result almost
696960	701680	certainly in career suicide? Now, if you think of that as an explanation, you would
701720	707760	realize that it has the power to synchronize failure across many seemingly
707760	711720	independent experiments. And I believe that that's exactly what's been going on
711720	716000	through the so-called string theory revolutions one, two, and perhaps three.
717680	725440	Now, in that case, what happened was a theory became fixed in the minds of really
725440	728960	the baby boom generation of physicists because it allowed for infinite
728960	733840	elaboration within a mathematical or, more particularly, a geometric context.
734480	739680	And those supposed physicists spent their time submitting papers to what's called
740760	745920	the high energy section of the so-called preprint archive. But in fact, most of
745920	750400	these papers have nothing to do with high energy physics whatsoever. And if you're
750400	757000	looking for the designation, it's HEPTH, high energy physics-theory. Now, if you
757000	760000	look through those papers, they don't seem to have much to do with particles.
760000	763280	They don't seem to have to do with forces and spacetime. They seem to have to do
763280	769320	with very strange and obscure mathematical issues. And in the years since the
769840	774400	string theory program got particularly reanimated, I guess that would be around
774400	779760	1984 with the anomaly cancellation of Green and Schwartz, what you'll find is
779760	785080	that physics became very active and simultaneously ground to a halt. It
785080	790360	failed to remain a physical subject. It became something like a medieval quest
790360	796520	for the number of angels to dance on the head of a pit. Now, in this circumstance,
796520	800800	I think it's very important to realize that this is not a paper, and we are not
800800	804720	submitting to the archive. In fact, the archive requires people who are not
804720	809680	employed at universities to get permission from some member of the
809680	812680	community, which is called an endorsement, which I find absolutely
812720	817480	insulting, and I refuse to go along with. Furthermore, we are expected to cite
817480	822720	papers, sometimes which are behind paywalls. And I think that it's absolutely
822720	827640	immoral to ask people to pay outside the system to read the papers to cite
827640	832200	other people's work. I could go on about the number of things that are currently
832200	836360	wrong with the system, but instead what I would like to do is to simply joyously
837280	844280	I have every intention of simply sharing this with you and jealously guarding my
844280	849280	right to shepherd this through. Now, what does that mean? In two previous episodes,
849280	853760	we've had interactions with academicians, which I think are interesting and bear
853760	859000	scrutiny. In the first case, in an interview with the economist Tyler Cowan,
859000	863400	I talked to Tyler about the fact that the Boschian Commission was in fact
863640	868920	committing economic malpractice. Now, why was that? It was because they decided
868920	872640	that they needed to transfer a trillion dollars over 10 years and that they had
872640	878320	found a devious way of doing it, which is to adjust the CPI. By backing out the
878320	882760	amount of adjustment needed to get a trillion dollars, they decided that a
882760	889480	1.1% overstatement in the CPI would cause a reduction in entitlements, that is
889520	894440	Medicare and Medicaid payments together with Social Security, as well as an
894440	901440	increase in taxes because tax brackets are also indexed. Now, to my mind, it is
901440	906080	absolutely unconscionable to say that you have a right to transfer wealth
906080	912080	cryptically by adjusting a fundamental barometer. That would be like saying, in
912080	915480	order to meet our global warming targets, we have to recalibrate all the
915480	920040	thermometers to show that, in fact, things have cooled. One simply can't do
920040	925400	that in science, but Tyler's response I found was very interesting. His
925400	929520	perspective was that this was, in fact, not a terrible thing because it was
929520	935640	quote, directionally correct. And in general, he believed that because the CPI
935640	939160	should be considered overstated that this was not the world's most terrible
939160	943680	thing to do as an economist. I respect Tyler a great deal and I enjoy his
943720	948520	company, but I have to say that I am absolutely of a different opinion. My
948520	953400	belief is that one has no rights and no ability as a scientist to fudge the data
953400	959800	to meet social goals in this fashion. Another interesting interaction was the
959800	965920	interaction with Professor Agnes Collard of the University of Chicago. Now, when
965920	971680	she listened to episode 19 about Brett Weinstein, she found that it was a very
971720	976800	compelling episode. But strangely, even though the point of the episode was to
976800	981360	surface Brett's long forgotten theory, because Brett had not been acknowledged
981360	985640	as having predicted that laboratory mice would in particular have radically
985640	990720	elongated telomeres, where it was thought that all mice had radically elongated
990720	998000	telomeres, which has incredible potential implications for drug testing and all of
998040	1004320	the work that is done on laboratory rodents as model organisms. This is an
1004320	1008200	episode you should definitely listen to if you haven't already. But Agnes's
1008200	1013160	perspective was very different than mine. Her feeling was that because we were in
1013160	1018240	a situation in which the work actually surfaced, that the system worked even if
1018240	1021640	it was the case that Brett's name was erased from the history of the
1021640	1027760	development and that his theory was put in a situation in which it was not
1027800	1031440	able to carry the day because, in fact, there was no record of the fact that a
1031440	1036240	prediction had been made. Now, I disagreed with Agnes on that program
1036960	1042040	vociferously. But what I found was that it was very telling. In general, our
1042040	1048640	academic population has given up on the previous and quaint idea of decency,
1048640	1054360	proprietary, truth, fairness, because there simply isn't the resource for
1054360	1060680	everyone. Now, I believe that current science is not necessarily unsalvageable,
1060680	1065040	but it will be unsalvageable if we don't get the very people that I rail against
1065280	1069720	far more money. And I know that's very confusing. But my belief is that the
1069720	1073680	inadequate resources that we have put aside are very similar to the inadequate
1073680	1077560	masks that we have put aside for our doctors. We have asked some of the
1077560	1083480	world's most gifted and smartest people to devote their lives to the study of
1083520	1087760	science and technology. And we have inadequately prepared them. We've put
1087760	1091520	their lives and their families' lives under incredible pressures. And what I
1091520	1095520	wish to do is to, in fact, point to the very people who I have been most angry
1095520	1099480	at for years and say that part of the problem is that we need to take a hard
1099480	1103560	look at how we've invested in science and technology and give the very people
1103560	1108800	that I'm most angry at more money. I will explain more about this later, but I
1108800	1112880	do want to give you an introduction to this episode. What I will be doing is
1112880	1118040	to screen a very unusual and somewhat awkward lecture at the University of
1118040	1124160	Oxford. Now, why is it so awkward? Well, first of all, I had left standard
1124160	1131840	research perhaps 20 years earlier, almost. Further, I'm not a physicist. And I
1131840	1137040	have only taken one or two courses in the physics major sequence. I think I've
1137040	1141800	taken one semester of mechanics. And perhaps I took an advanced general
1141800	1146840	relativity course in college. But in general, no one goes into a theoretical
1146840	1150840	physics department and attempts to lecture physics physicists on physics.
1150840	1154640	And why is that? Well, because physics is incredibly demanding. And this is
1154640	1158440	almost certainly the world's most interesting and most accomplished
1158440	1162840	intellectual community. These are guys who don't miss a trick. There are so
1162840	1166880	many things to know and it is such a difficult field that it is effectively
1166880	1171680	almost impossible to contribute from outside. Chemists don't do it and once
1171760	1174960	in a blue moon, mathematicians will attempt to talk about actual real
1174960	1180480	physics. So one thing that you're seeing is a very unusual circumstance where
1180480	1184320	somebody is trying to figure out how to give their first lecture in a physics
1184320	1189200	department. And it concerns the possibility of a theory which attempts to
1189200	1195960	solve the problem of how does a fire light itself. Another thing that you'll
1195960	1200240	see is that it's relatively difficult to read my handwriting. I'm not going to
1201120	1205000	make any bones about it. I've been very vocal about having learning differences,
1205000	1209680	dysgraphia, dyslexia, all sorts of different issues. Symbols come extremely
1209680	1213360	difficult to me. I don't want to spend this time making excuses. What I do want
1213360	1219000	to say is the following. I will be attempting to record a short PowerPoint
1219000	1223160	presentation for after the lecture to say at least some of what some of the
1223160	1228520	constructions are more clearly. This is not meant to be the actual presentation
1228560	1232440	of the theory. What this is is an introduction, a down payment and above
1232440	1237600	all a historical account of what happened seven years ago at the University
1237600	1242280	of Oxford when I tried to present these ideas. I've talked before about the
1242280	1246920	twin nuclei problem and our need to get off of this planet. And if we have a
1246920	1250640	hope of getting off of this planet, it really comes from fundamental physics.
1252000	1256240	You see 100 years ago or perhaps 105 when Albert Einstein gave us general
1256280	1261760	relativity. He effectively consigned us for life to the solar system. Why is
1261760	1267600	that? Well, his model, his geometric model of space and time, effectively
1267600	1272480	creates a speed limit known as C or the speed of light. Now, there are three
1272480	1276920	rocks that are at least interesting for habitation by humans, although two of
1276920	1281440	them are marginal, the moon and Mars. One of them, of course, is unbelievable,
1281440	1285880	the earth. But I doubt that we're going to be able to steward the earth through
1285880	1289680	our new godlike powers, which I've called the twin nuclei problem of
1289680	1293920	cell and atom. We've unlocked the power of both. And I don't think we have the
1293920	1299480	wisdom to stay all in one place. So the question that I had was, if there is
1299480	1303160	any ability to escape to the cosmos that we can see in the night sky, where
1303160	1307480	would it come from? We are almost positive that Albert Einstein's theory of
1307480	1312160	relativity is in some weird way incomplete. The Schwarzschild singularities
1312160	1317400	which give us black holes and the initial singularities of the Robertson
1317400	1321920	Walker Friedman universe, which are associated with the Big Bang, are some
1321920	1328600	clue that there is some subtle flaw in Einstein's theory. So how to go beyond
1328600	1333160	Einstein? I mean, what Einstein did to Newton was to recover Newton as a
1333160	1338320	special case of a more general theory that is more flexible. And in fact, this
1338360	1341800	is the same problem that we have. Because Albert Einstein's theory is so
1341800	1346480	fundamental, we effectively begin every theoretical physics seminar with a
1346480	1350640	statement about spacetime. In other words, Albert Einstein is locked in at the
1350640	1355320	ground floor. So if we can't get below the ground floor to the foundations, it's
1355320	1358640	very difficult to make progress. This is one of the things that is making it
1358640	1363120	almost impossible for us to go beyond the initial revolutions of the 20th
1363160	1370440	century. Do I know that this new theory, if it works, will allow us to escape? I do
1370440	1375000	not. There's no one who can say that. And I don't think I have the skills to
1375000	1379040	develop the physical consequences of the theory, even if the theory turns out to
1379040	1386520	be mostly right. What I will say is that I think that the theory is the first of
1386520	1392960	its kind that I've seen. I believe that in part what you will see is that at a
1393000	1398560	minimum, it is like fool's gold. It appears to explain why we think we see
1398560	1403200	three generations. But it also says that perhaps they aren't really three
1403200	1407040	generations of matter. Perhaps there are only two, even though physicists tell us
1407040	1411560	that there are at least three or perhaps more. I believe that physics tells us
1411560	1415320	that the universe is chiral, that is left-right asymmetric. But the theory is
1415320	1419720	itself not chiral. Instead, it chooses to present a different idea, which is that
1419720	1425120	perhaps chirality is emergent, much the way our hands are individually left-right
1425120	1429400	asymmetric, as our pinky is not a reflection of our thumb. But the thumb on
1429400	1434920	each hand is a pairing to the other one, as is the pinky. Now, what does that
1434920	1439720	mean? It means that if perhaps there is matter and there is force that is
1439720	1445440	decoupled from our ordinary world, that that matter might restore the parity or
1445440	1451080	the chirality, rather would break the chirality, and restore parity between
1451080	1455960	these two halves, the matter we see and the matter that is missing. There are a
1455960	1460440	good number of other things that happen in the theory. It replaces space-time with
1460440	1465440	what I've termed an observer's. Now, an observer's is an unusual gadget in that
1465440	1469680	it's thought of as two separate places where physics takes place, connected by
1469680	1475320	a map. That means effectively that we are in something like a stadium where there
1476000	1481040	are stands and there is a pitch, and the playing field that we think we see may
1481040	1485680	not, in fact, be where most of the action is taking place. In fact, not all of the
1485680	1490520	fields live on the same space. So when we see waves and particles dancing around,
1490520	1494040	they may have separate origins in each of the two components of the
1494040	1501360	observer's. What I hope to do after this is to gracefully and gradually develop
1501400	1507240	the theory under my leadership. Now, why do I say that? There is a belief in
1507240	1512880	physics and in most fields that the field should behave in a communal fashion,
1512880	1516840	and that people should put forward their ideas and other people should joyously
1516840	1523600	build upon them, and that the community should be allowed to name the various
1523600	1529480	accomplishments for whoever they say accomplished those things. There's not
1530400	1535560	a way in hell that I'm letting that happen. My experience with this community
1535560	1539520	is that it simply can't be trusted to behave equitably given the fact that it
1539520	1544840	is so resource-starved and constrained. People simply do not have the freedom to
1544840	1549520	be generous, kind, and accurate as to who did what. Furthermore, there is an
1549520	1554520	incredible premium on cherry topping. That is, who finished something off is
1554520	1558600	considered bizarrely much more important than who found something to begin with.
1558960	1563680	Imagine you located an island and you named the island after the first person
1563680	1568200	who could plant the flag on the top of the highest peak. This is patently offensive
1568200	1573840	and ridiculous. There's a story years ago about how Hilbert almost scooped
1573840	1578600	Einstein by giving the Hilbert action from which Einstein's equations could be
1578600	1583440	recovered. Really? Not a chance. So, if Hilbert came up with the Hilbert action
1583440	1587400	and recovered Einstein's equations, so what? I mean, the real theory actually
1587400	1591880	takes place in Einstein and Grossman before Albert Einstein even works out a
1591880	1596440	lot of the flaws in the original theory. It's about the ideas. It's not about the
1596440	1601840	formulas and it's not about racing to the final form. Now, I know that the
1601840	1606360	community won't agree with that but think about this. What I'm doing is taking an
1606360	1611000	incredible risk. I'm addressing you here on April Fool's Day and I'm saying that
1611000	1615040	if there is a fool, it is certainly me because I have sat on this theory for
1615080	1621480	almost 40 years. Now, I've never known. Is it true? Is it false? It's impossible to
1621480	1626200	tell when you're only talking to yourself. But in this situation, what I've done
1626200	1630640	is I've taken a tremendous amount of risk and now I'm trying to share it with
1630640	1636080	you. Hopefully, I know that, well, Newton did his greatest work when he was
1636080	1641840	sheltering from a great plague in England and I would like to
1641840	1646200	think that perhaps, whether or not this is correct, simply the act of somebody
1646200	1653440	trying earnestly to share hope and some path forward would be uplifting. Now,
1653440	1658560	under the worst circumstances, if this doesn't work, what do I think? This is a
1658560	1662960	question I'm asked frequently. And there are two things that I'll say. Many years
1662960	1668040	ago, around 1987, I put forward some equations that I thought might become my
1668080	1672640	thesis at the Harvard Department of Mathematics and they were disallowed for
1672640	1679000	a variety of reasons. Those equations were later discovered in, I believe, 1994
1679000	1683840	and I sat in a lecture in which I saw these equations go up on a board at the
1683840	1688520	very end at MIT. And I looked at those equations and I said, huh, those are the
1688520	1693880	exact equations I was told could never work. Why is the leading physicist in the
1693880	1697160	world placing them on the board and saying that these are the equations from
1697200	1703440	which all of something called Donaldson theory can be derived? What I'm giving you,
1703440	1712480	at least at a minimum, had the ability years earlier to provide those equations
1712480	1716240	from a different source. There's something called cyber-witten theory, which I
1716240	1720280	have no claim on. But the actual equations that are called the cyber-witten
1720280	1725360	equations came originally as an outgrowth from investigations of this
1725400	1730760	theory. So at a bare minimum, the cyber-witten revolution should have happened
1730760	1735280	at Harvard rather than Princeton and it should have been recognized that this
1735280	1739520	theory was capable of at least at a minimum giving birth to that as a side
1739520	1743960	project. The other thing that I think is incredibly important is that we've
1743960	1751160	never seen how a universe that looks like ours could possibly emerge from almost
1751160	1755440	no assumptions whatsoever. And I believe that even if this theory were to turn out
1755440	1759520	to be wrong, which I don't think is likely, I believe that it would give us
1759520	1764960	something to go on. We would at least have a first candidate of how a hopeful
1764960	1769120	theory of everything would look and how it would go wrong. So under any
1769120	1772920	circumstance, I think that I'm going to be fine if the theory doesn't work out.
1773360	1777560	I will have at least taken my shot on goal. And I think that that's probably
1777560	1782880	more than almost anyone can ask from a life to attempt to make contact with the
1782880	1787000	deepest question that we've ever had, which is what is this place and what
1787000	1793880	brought it into being? Lastly, I want to just talk about a personal aspect of
1793880	1801120	this, which is what does it mean to come to an end? Whether or not this theory in
1801160	1808520	fact does what I claim, I think it does. I don't know. But I do know that sooner or
1808520	1814560	later in the era of intercontinental land exploration, someone found the last
1814560	1818680	land mass. And that must have been a very strange moment when there was nothing
1818680	1824320	left to do. I think whether or not this theory in fact accomplishes that is one
1824320	1829280	question. But we all have to plan for what it is that we think will happen when
1829280	1834880	man at last learns his own source code. In fact, this was the last edge question
1834880	1839240	that I answered for John Brockman, which is, does something unprecedented happen
1839240	1844920	when man at last learns his own source code? I don't know the answer to this,
1845000	1850480	but I want to return to the same spirit that I started this one. I was 18 or 19,
1850560	1854720	which is that of joyous investigation of brave, open-hearted
1855320	1860720	undertakings. And I also want to bring back a different style of scientific
1860720	1866080	investigation. There's been far too much communalism. In fact, there is a belief
1866080	1869960	that there are no lone researchers and that everything is produced by a
1869960	1876800	community. And pardon my French, but this is absolute horseshit. I have been so
1876800	1883280	long alone with these principles, equations and ideas that I don't even
1883280	1889760	know what my adult life will look like once I discord them. And I begin to talk
1889760	1893120	about them with the community at large. I've talked to many theoretical
1893120	1898320	physicists who've taken some interest in them, but I've never put out enough to
1898320	1903320	absolutely ensure that people are seeing what it is that I'm seeing. So whether
1903320	1907440	or not the April Fool's joke is on me, I cannot tell you, but I can promise you
1907440	1911600	that I'm not trying to play one on you. What I hope to show you is a lecture
1911640	1914920	that was the first of three versions of this lecture that were delivered in
1914920	1920000	Oxford over the course of a week. And one of the things that has held me back
1920000	1924800	is that I have a great number of people who I have to thank for effectively
1924800	1929080	being my underground railroad when my career got into serious trouble to make
1929080	1935720	sure, who made sure that I always had an opportunity to fight another day. And
1935720	1939480	some of the most important of those people, one of whom occurs on this
1939480	1944640	video, is Marcus DeSotois. And Marcus, I just wanted to say thank you for your
1944640	1948200	bravery, your courage, your friendship, and your encouragement. I know I've been
1948200	1952800	absolutely impossible to you. I've made you wait for this and I just want to say
1952800	1958680	how much I love you. I also want to thank Isidore Singer for effectively saving
1958680	1963720	me from not getting a PhD by, I think, putting pressure on the Harvard
1963720	1968400	Department. And for coming to my assistance, making sure that I got a
1968400	1973200	postdoc at MIT, despite not having any publications at all. I'd like to thank
1973200	1977640	Raoul Bot, who's no longer with us, who I should have invited to my wedding. I was
1977640	1980600	very angry at him, but I didn't realize that he was saving me in a very
1980600	1985160	difficult situation against a department that probably just wanted to see me gone.
1985160	1990200	I'd like to thank Peter Thiel, one of my closest friends, who's like a brother to
1990200	1996880	me, for allowing me these seven years since this lecture to lick my wounds, to
1996880	2005360	get strong, to have a 401k, to buy a house, and to begin coming back to regular
2005360	2010520	society after a very difficult and strained career. I'd like to thank Adil
2010520	2015920	Abdullali and Michael Grossberg, the two greatest best friends from college that
2015920	2021640	I could have. I'd like to thank my grandfather, Harry Rubin, who believed
2021640	2026760	in things that couldn't possibly be true and made some of them happen. I'd like
2026760	2030000	to thank my parents, Karen and Les Weinstein, for all the good things that
2030000	2033280	they did. I'd like to thank my brother Bret Weinstein and his family, Heather
2033280	2039880	and the kids, for sticking by me. And I'd like to thank my in-laws in Bombay,
2039880	2046600	India. I hope you guys are well. And lastly, I would very much like to thank my
2046600	2052040	wife and my two kids for putting up with a lot of lost weekends, a lot of lost
2052040	2056520	vacations, and believing that just maybe there was something to this and
2056520	2062560	sticking by me all these years. So I hope everybody really enjoys this. It may
2062560	2067720	not be comprehensible. And after this video finishes, I'll do a short
2067720	2071800	presentation of some of the constructions that took place. Not all of the
2071800	2074600	equations and things, which I think some of them were sort of botched on the
2074600	2079480	board because I became disoriented the night before and rearranged things in a
2079480	2085720	way that probably wasn't optimal. But I'll attempt to clarify these things
2085720	2091480	going forward and to begin to present the theory as I see whether or not I can
2091480	2096880	bring myself to once again work on it somewhat close to full-time as a 54-
2096880	2104320	year-old father of two. So sit back, relax, and coming up next is the first of my
2104360	2110120	three lectures at Oxford University on Geometric Unity. Be well.
2123120	2127920	Well, welcome to this special Simone lecture. My name is Mark Stasotoy. I'm a
2127920	2131560	professor of mathematics here and the Simone Professor for the Public
2131600	2135840	Understanding of Science. And Charles Simone prepared a manifesto when he
2135840	2140000	endowed this chair to guide the holder of the professorship in their mission.
2140000	2144400	And I'd like to read one part of that manifesto to you. It said,
2144400	2149720	scientific speculation when so labelled and when the concept of speculation and
2149720	2153760	its place in the scientific method has been made clear to the audience can be
2153760	2159040	very exciting. It is a very effective communication tool and it is by no
2159080	2163840	means discouraged. And it is in the spirit of this part of my mission as a
2163840	2167960	Simone Professor that I would like to introduce today's Simone special
2167960	2172800	lecture. I first met Eric Weinstein when we were both postdocs at the Hebrew
2172800	2177200	University just over 20 years ago. And I had the feeling then that he was
2177200	2182760	working on something big. But it wasn't until two years ago that Eric met me in
2182760	2186800	a bar in New York and we began he began to explain the mathematics that he'd
2186800	2191800	been working on in private for the last 20 years. As he took me through the
2191800	2196040	equations he had been formulating, I began to see emerging before my eyes
2196040	2200800	potential answers to many of the major problems in physics. It was an
2200800	2206320	extremely exciting, daring proposal and also mathematically so natural that it
2206320	2210560	started to work its magic on me. Over the last two years I have had the
2210560	2214400	privilege of being taken through the twists and turns of Eric's ideas.
2215160	2219280	After our postdocs in Israel, while I went the academic route getting my
2219280	2223680	professorship here in Oxford, Eric went a more independent route working in
2223680	2228200	economics, government and finance. So he comes here today as something of an
2228200	2233720	insider and an outsider. A difficult place from which to propose bold ideas.
2233720	2238920	But having spent time seeing how powerful these ideas appear to be, I felt
2238920	2243320	that it was time that Eric shared his ideas more widely. As I believe his
2243360	2247520	perspective could give the scientific community a new story to explain some of
2247520	2251600	the big questions on the scientific books. I'm therefore very happy to provide
2251600	2256120	a platform here in Oxford for Eric to share his ideas on a new theory he
2256120	2261720	calls geometric unity. The lecture will be approximately 70 minutes after which
2261720	2265120	we will have a period to ask questions. Eric.
2265120	2276480	So it's a great pleasure to be here in Oxford. For those of you who are not
2276480	2282760	aware, it is possible that no other university in the world has kept so
2282760	2289720	tightly and kept the faith for so long with Einstein's great vision of a final
2289760	2294960	theory for physics as a theory of pure geometry. A sort of elegance and
2294960	2298520	simplicity of the highest order. And the names that are associated with Oxford
2298520	2305040	that weigh heavy on me are Atia, Penrose, Siegel, Woodhouse, Hitchin. It's a very
2305040	2311320	long list of people who, even when fashion did not hold those ideas in
2311320	2315680	favor, always kept the faith that there was much to be learned from the
2315720	2320440	geometric perspective on physics. Of course, unified field theory in some
2320440	2324960	sense acquired a stigma with Einstein's failure to find it. And the sense that
2324960	2330320	even someone like Einstein being tempted by the siren song of geometry
2330320	2335880	might lose their footing and go astray. And in the years since, we've had a
2335880	2340960	replacement theory which is that what is really calling our generations is the
2341880	2348280	quest to quantize general relativity and gravity. And I'd like to go back to
2348280	2354000	the sort of earlier perspective that there is no evidence to date, in my
2354000	2361080	mind, that we are being called to quantize general relativity directly. In
2361080	2366320	fact, there's been more effort spent on that quest without very tangible
2366360	2371920	results than Einstein spent as one man searching for years for unified field
2371920	2377280	theory. So we have to, in some sense, begin to undo some of what we think we
2377280	2382240	know in order to truly reconsider and allow me to put some of these ideas
2382240	2391960	before you today. Marcus asked me to begin presenting these ideas here. And
2392000	2398440	hopefully this is a first opportunity, but if the ideas are not good, then
2398440	2403840	lighting on the aisles will lead you to safety and your exits may be behind you.
2403840	2408360	But in the event of a good flight, hopefully this will begin a conversation
2408360	2413200	rather than end one. I feel in some sense that I'm presenting the works of
2413200	2419720	another man, a younger man, someone who came of age right in the middle of the
2419760	2425560	great string theory boom with the anomaly cancellation in 1984. And I
2425560	2430840	look at this work and I see a young person struggling with the idea, why
2430840	2434440	can't I see that string theory is going to answer all of these questions over
2434440	2439240	the next 10 years, as we were told at the time. And making a very dangerous
2439240	2443480	decision, which was, I think I'm not going to follow that particular path and
2443480	2447640	I'm going to follow another. And it's not clear where this path is going to
2447640	2453040	lead us, but we're going to explore it today and see as best we can. So in some
2453040	2456640	sense, I've been able to polish some of that young man's work, but I'm also
2456640	2460680	struggling to reconstruct it because as someone spending full time on that
2460680	2468120	theory, he knew a lot of things that I no longer know. So with that as a
2468120	2471560	beginning, I'm just going to say one disclaimer, which is that this is not a
2471600	2477520	usual talk. And whatever contract a speaker usually has with the audience,
2477520	2483080	right now we're going to break that contract. This is a talk about ideas.
2483080	2487280	Some of these ideas are bold, some of them may offend some people because
2487280	2490680	there's a sense that you don't have a right to be considering those ideas. But
2490680	2494360	I go back to the admonition of Jim Watson that said, if you're going to try to
2494360	2498760	make progress, big progress, you are by definition unqualified to be doing
2498760	2507880	whatever it is that you're doing. So in that spirit, let us begin. What is
2507880	2513200	physics to physicists today? How do they see it different from the way in which
2513200	2518440	we might imagine the layperson sees physics? Ed Whitten was asked this
2518440	2526320	question in a talk he gave on physics and geometry many years ago, and he
2526360	2531600	pointed us to three fundamental insights, which were his big three
2531600	2536680	insights in physics. And they correspond to the three great equations. So the
2536680	2545880	first one is that somehow physics takes place in an arena. And that arena is a
2545880	2555960	manifold X together with some kind of semi-Romanian metric structure. Something
2556000	2560320	that allows us to take length and angle so that we can perform measurements at
2560320	2566680	every point in this spacetime or higher dimensional structure, leaving us a
2566680	2574720	little bit of headroom. The equation most associated with this is the Einstein
2574720	2601040	field equation. And, of course, I've run into the margin. So it says,
2605680	2610760	that a piece of the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, minus an even
2610760	2615440	smaller piece, the scalar curvature multiplied by the metric, is equal, or
2615440	2620920	plus the cosmological constant, is equal to some amount of matter and energy, the
2620920	2627480	stress energy tensor. So it's intrinsically a curvature equation. The
2627480	2633080	second fundamental insight, I'm going to begin to start drawing pictures here as
2633120	2641960	well. So if this is the spacetime manifold, the arena, the second one concerns
2641960	2650560	symmetry groups, which cannot necessarily be deduced from any structure inside of
2650560	2656120	the arena. They are additional data that come to us out of the blue without
2656160	2665560	explanation. And these symmetries form a non-Abelian group, which is currently
2665560	2684360	SU3 color cross SU2 weak isospin cross U1 weak hypercharge, which breaks down to
2684720	2695120	SU3 cross U1, where the broken U1 is the electromagnetic symmetry. This equation
2695120	2701160	is also a curvature equation, the corresponding equation, and it says that
2701160	2711480	this time the curvature of an auxiliary structure known as a gauge potential, when
2711480	2724560	differentiated in a particular way, is equal, again, to the amount of stuff in
2724560	2729440	the system that is not directly involved in the left-hand side of the equation. So
2729440	2733480	it has many similarities to the above equation. Both involve curvature, one
2733480	2737120	involves a projection or a series of projections, the other involves a
2737120	2757920	differential operator. The third point surrounds the matter in the system. And
2757920	2772120	here we have a Dirac equation, again coupled to a connection. But one of the
2772120	2778560	great insights is that the reason for the lightness of matter in the natural mass
2778560	2785240	scale of physics has to do with the fact that this psi really should have two
2785240	2789800	components, and the differential operator should map to one component on the
2789800	2794160	other side of the equation, but the mass operator should map to another. And so if
2794160	2799200	one of the components is missing, if the equation is intrinsically lopsided,
2799200	2804960	chiral, asymmetric, then the mass term and the differential term have
2804960	2810120	difficulty interacting, which is sort of overcompensating for the mass scale of
2810120	2812360	the universe, so you get to a point where you actually have to define a
2812360	2817480	massless equation, but then just like overshooting a putt, it's easier to knock
2817480	2822480	it back by putting in a Higgs field in order to generate an as-if fundamental
2822480	2826240	mass through the Yukawa couplings.
2842920	2849760	So matter is asymmetric, and therefore light.
2854560	2859800	And then interestingly, he went on to say one more thing. He said, of course, these
2859800	2864760	three central observations must be supplemented with the idea that this all
2864800	2874440	takes place, treated in quantum mechanical fashion or quantum field
2874440	2880280	theoretic. So it's a bit of an aftermarket modification rather than, in his
2880280	2888920	opinion at the time, one of the core insights. I actually think that that's in
2888960	2894800	some sense about right. Now, one of my differences with the community in
2894800	2900920	some sense is that I question whether the quantum isn't in good enough shape,
2900920	2904440	that we don't know whether we have a serious quantum mechanical problem or not.
2904440	2907240	We know that we have a quantum mechanical problem, a quantum field
2907240	2911480	theoretic problem, relative to the current formulations of these theories, but we
2911480	2915960	know that in some other cases, the quantum becomes incredibly natural,
2916000	2921000	sometimes sort of almost magically natural. And we don't know whether the
2921000	2926000	true theories that we will need to be generalizing, in some sense, have
2926000	2929480	beautiful quantum mechanical treatments, whereas the effective theories that we're
2929480	2938440	dealing with now may not survive the quantization. So what I want to do is I
2938440	2943840	want to imagine a different sort of incompatibility. So let's take our great
2943880	2954400	three theories and just visually treat them as the vertices of a triangle. So I'm
2954400	2960880	going to put general relativity in Einstein's formulation, and I'm going to
2960880	2965800	put the, I probably won't write this again, Yang-Mills, Maxwell, Anderson-Higgs
2966760	2982120	theory over here, and I'm going to write the Dirac theory. What I want to explore is
2982120	2988080	the incompatibility is not at the quantum level, but the geometric input. All three
2988080	2992480	of these are geometric theories. And the question is, what are the
2992480	2996920	incompatibilities or incompatibilities at the level of geometry before the
2996920	3003880	theory is treated quantum mechanically? Well, in the case of Einstein's general
3003880	3010520	relativity, we can rewrite the Einstein theory by saying that there's a projection
3010520	3016120	map due to Einstein of a curvature tensor, where I'm going to write that
3016120	3024640	curvature tensor as I would in the Yang-Mills theory. That should be an LC for
3024640	3030080	Levy-Chavita. So the Einstein projection of the curvature tensor of the Levy-Chavita
3030080	3036720	connection of the metric on this side, and on this side, I'm going to write down
3036720	3040800	this differential operator, the adjoint of the exterior derivative coupled to a
3040800	3052360	connection. And you begin to see that we're missing an opportunity potentially.
3052360	3057880	What if the FAs were the same in both contexts? Then you're applying two
3057880	3062920	separate operators, one zero-eth order and destructive in the sense that it
3062920	3068960	doesn't see the entire curvature tensor. The other inclusive, but a first order.
3069360	3074200	And so the question is, is there any opportunity to do anything that combines
3074200	3080840	these two? But the problem is, is that the hallmark of the Yang-Mills theory is
3080840	3085560	the freedom to choose the data, the internal quantum numbers that give all
3085560	3091560	the particles their personalities beyond the mass and the spin.
3092560	3098760	In addition to all of that freedom is some means of taking away some of the
3098760	3102800	redundancy that comes with that freedom, which is the action of the gauge group.
3102800	3106920	Now we can allow the gauge group of symmetries to act on both sides of the
3106960	3127960	equation. But the key problem is that if I act on connections on the right and then
3127960	3136880	take the Einstein projection, this is not equal to first taking the projection
3136880	3154880	and then conjugating with the gauge action. So the problem is, is that the projection
3154880	3160360	is based on the fact that you have a relationship between the intrinsic
3160360	3166600	geometry, if this is an ad-valued two-form, the two-form portion of this, and the
3166600	3170840	adjoint portion of this are both associated to the structure group of the
3170840	3175640	tangent bundle. But the gauge rotation is only acting on one of the two factors,
3175640	3180400	yet the projection is making use of both of them. So there is a fundamental
3180400	3184880	incompatibility in the claim that Einstein's theory is a gauge theory
3184880	3191560	relies more on analogy than on an exact mapping between the two theories. What
3191560	3196280	about the incompatibilities between the Einstein theory of general relativity and
3196440	3202880	the Dirac theory of matter? I was very struck that if we're going to try to
3202880	3208000	quantize gravity and we associate gravity with the spin-to-field g mu nu,
3208000	3219120	we actually have a pretty serious problem, which is if you think about spinors,
3219400	3226880	electrons, quarks, as being waves in a medium, and you think about photons as
3226880	3234560	being waves in a different medium, photons medium does not depend on the
3234560	3239760	existence of a metric. One forms are defined whether or not a metric is
3239760	3245680	present. It's spinors or not. So if we are going to take the spin-to g mu nu
3245760	3250000	field to be quantum mechanical, if it blinks out and does whatever the quantum
3250000	3255080	does between observations, in the case of the photon, it's saying that the waves
3255080	3259800	may blink out, but the ocean need not blink out. In the case of the Dirac
3259800	3263920	theory, it is the ocean, the medium in which the waves live that becomes
3263920	3268600	uncertain itself. So even if you're comfortable with the quantum, to me,
3268600	3274120	this becomes a bridge too far. So the question is, how do we liberate the
3274160	3290320	definition? How do we get the metric out from its responsibilities? It's been
3290320	3295240	assigned far too many responsibilities. It's responsible for a volume form, for
3295240	3300640	differential operators, it's responsible for measurement, it's responsible for
3300640	3307400	being a dynamical field, part of the field content of the system. Lastly, we
3307400	3311920	have the compatibilities between Yang-Mills and the Dirac theory. These
3311920	3315560	may be the most mild of the various incompatibilities, but it is an
3315560	3321880	incompatibility of naturality. Where the Dirac field, Einstein's field, and the
3321880	3327400	connection fields are all geometrically well motivated, we push a lot of the
3327400	3331720	artificiality that we do not understand into the potential for the scalar field
3331720	3335920	that gives everything its mass. So we tend to treat it as something of a
3335920	3345320	mysterious fudge factor. So the question is, if we have a Higgs field, why is it
3345320	3354200	here, and why is it geometric? It has long been the most artificial sector of
3354200	3364000	our models. The proposal that I want to put to you today is that one of the
3364000	3369080	reasons that we may be having trouble with unification is, is that the duty, our
3369080	3379400	duty, may be to generalize all three vertices before we can make progress.
3379840	3388600	That's daunting because in each case it would appear that we can make an
3388600	3393960	argument that this, that, and the other vertex are the simplest possible theories
3393960	3400000	that could live at that vertex. We know, for example, the Dirac operator is the
3400000	3403360	most fundamental of all the elliptic operators in Euclidean signature
3403360	3409600	generating all of the Tia-Singer theory. We know that Einstein's theory is in
3409600	3414120	some sense a unique spin to massless field capable of communicating gravity
3414120	3417000	which can be arrived at from field theoretic rather than geometric
3417000	3421280	considerations. In the Yang-Mills case it can be argued that the Yang-Mills theory
3421280	3425440	is the simplest theory that can possibly result. Where we're taking the simplest
3425440	3429040	Lagrangian in the Einstein case looking only at the scalar curvature, in the
3429040	3433120	Yang-Mills case we have no substructure, and so we're doing the most simple-minded
3433120	3436680	thing we can do by taking the norm square of the curvature and saying
3436680	3440800	whatever the field strength is let's measure that size. So if each one of
3440800	3444320	these is simplest possible doesn't Occam's razor tell us that if we wish to
3444320	3448840	remain in geometric field theory that we've already reached bottom and what
3448840	3453440	we're being asked to do is to abandon this as merely an effective theory? That's
3453440	3456840	possible and I would say that that in some sense represents a lot of
3456840	3462680	conventional wisdom. But there are other possibilities. There are other possibilities
3462680	3467320	that while each of these may be simplest in its category they are not
3467320	3481840	simplest in their interaction. For example we know that Dirac famously took the
3481840	3486920	square root of the Klein-Gordon equation to achieve the Dirac equation. He
3486920	3490560	actually took two square roots one of the differential operator and another of
3490560	3496000	the algebra on which it acts. But could not could we not do the same thing by
3496000	3501080	reinterpreting what we saw in Donaldson theory, in Chern-Simon's theory, and
3501080	3504480	finding that there are first-order equations that imply second-order
3504480	3508680	equations that are nonlinear and in the curvature? So let's imagine the
3508680	3517440	following. We replace the standard model with a true second-order theory. We
3517440	3520720	imagine that general relativity is replaced by a true first-order theory
3520720	3525640	and then we find that the true second-order theory admits of a square
3525640	3530760	root and can be linked with the true first-order theory. This would be a
3530760	3541160	program for some kind of unification of Dirac's type but in the force sector. The
3541160	3544680	question is does this really make any sense? Are there any possibilities to do
3544680	3554120	any such thing? So what I'd like to do is I'd like to talk a little bit about
3554120	3575720	what the geometric unity proposal is. So we have a division into intrinsic theories
3575720	3590760	and auxiliary theories between physics and mathematics, more specifically
3590760	3598520	geometry. An intrinsic physical theory would be general relativity. An auxiliary
3598520	3603280	physical theory would be the Yang-Mills theory with the freedom to choose
3603280	3607640	internal quantum numbers. At the mathematical level an intrinsic theory
3607640	3624080	would be, let's be a little fastidious, the older semi-Romanian geometry, a study
3624080	3628880	of manifolds with length and angle. But auxiliary geometry is really what's
3628880	3633120	taken off of late since the revolution partially begun at Oxford when
3633120	3638120	his singer brought insights from Stony Brook to the UK. And so we're going to
3638120	3650000	call this fiber bundle theory or modern gauge theory. Geometric unity is the
3650000	3654080	search for some way to break down the walls between these four boxes. What's
3654080	3660080	natural to one theory is unnatural to another. Semi-Romanian geometry is
3660080	3666880	dominated by these projection operators as well as the ability to use the
3666880	3670440	Levy-Chavita connection. Now some aspects of this are less explored. Torsion
3670440	3674720	tensors are definable in semi-Romanian geometry but they are not used to the
3674720	3679320	extent that you might imagine. In the case of fiber bundle theory the discovery
3679320	3686080	of physicists that the gauge group was fantastically important came as
3686080	3690480	something of a shock to the mathematicians who had missed that structure
3690480	3694960	and have since exploited it to great effect. So what we'd like to do is we'd
3694960	3700240	like to come up with some theory that is intrinsic but allows us to play some of
3700240	3704640	the games that exist in other boxes. How can we try to have our cake
3704680	3714000	eat it and use all the full suite of techniques that are available to us. So
3714000	3717920	our perspective is that it is the quantum that may be the comparatively
3717920	3724000	easy part and that the unification of the geometry which is not occurred may be
3724000	3727280	what we're being asked to do. So let's try to figure out what would a final
3727320	3737320	theory even look like. When I was a bit younger I remember reading this question
3737320	3741240	of Einstein which he said I'm not really interested in some of the details of
3741240	3746000	physics what really concerns me is whether the creator had any choice in
3746000	3750640	how the world was constructed. And some people may have read that as a
3750640	3754160	philosophical statement but I took that as an actual call for a research
3754240	3759000	program. So I'd like to describe that research program and try to unpack what
3759000	3769480	I think he was saying. We talk a lot about unification but we hardly ever
3769480	3777440	actually imagine if we had a unified theory what would it look like. Let us
3777440	3781160	imagine that we cannot figure out the puzzle of why is there something rather
3781160	3784440	than nothing. But if we do have a something that that something has as
3784440	3790720	little structure as possible but still invites us to work mathematically. So to
3790720	3794680	me the two great theories that we have mathematically and in physics are
3794680	3799040	calculus and linear algebra. If we have calculus and linear algebra I'm gonna
3799040	3805640	imagine that we have some manifold at least one of dimension four but it's
3805640	3809200	not a space time it doesn't have a metric it's not broken down into two
3809240	3814240	different kinds of coordinates which then have some bleed into each other but
3814240	3819000	still maintains a distinction it's just some sort of flabby proto space time.
3819000	3827280	And in the end it's got to fill up with stuff and give us some kind of an
3827280	3833600	equation. So let me write an equation.
3833600	3859880	So I have in mind differential operators parameterized by some fields omega which
3859880	3864840	when composed are not of second order if these are first-order operators but of
3864840	3872960	zero-width order and some sort of further differential operator saying that
3872960	3881360	whatever those two operators are in composition is in some sense harmonic. Is
3881360	3889360	such a program even possible. So if the universe is in fact capable of being the
3889360	3894200	fire that lights itself is it capable of managing its own flame as well and
3894200	3901360	closing up. What I'd like to do is to set ourselves an almost impossible task
3901360	3909160	which is to begin with this little data in a sandbox to use the computer science
3909160	3927200	concept. So if here's physical reality standard physics is over here we're
3927240	3940360	going to start with a sandbox and all we're going to put in it is x4 and we're
3940360	3945120	going to set ourselves a straight-jacketed task of seeing how close we can
3945120	3950840	come to dragging out a model that looks like the natural world that follows this
3950920	3959720	trajectory. While it may appear that that is not a particularly smart thing to do I
3959720	3965680	would like to think that we could agree that it is quite possible that if that
3965680	3970080	were to be the case we might say that this is what Einstein meant by a creator
3970080	3975120	which was his anthropomorphic concept for necessity and elegance and design
3975400	3983400	having no choice in the making of the world. So with that let us begin to think
3983400	3989960	about what we mean today by geometric unity. GU comes in four flavors but I'm
3989960	3993240	only getting one shot to do this so I'm going to do the most exciting of them to
3993240	4003400	me. There's a completely exogenous flavor and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
4003480	4009000	take the concept of observation and I'm going to break the world into two pieces.
4009000	4014280	A place where we do our observation and a place where most of the activity takes
4014280	4021920	place and I'm going to try to do this without loss of generality. So in this
4021920	4026320	case we have x4 and it can map into some other space and we're going to call this
4026320	4037720	an Observerse. The idea of an Observerse is a bit like a stadium you have a
4037720	4042080	playing field and you have stands. They aren't distinct entities they're coupled
4042080	4048760	and so fundamentally we're going to replace one space with two. Exogenous
4048760	4052840	model simply means that you is unrestricted although larger than x4 so
4052840	4057360	any manifold of four dimension higher that is capable of admitting x4 as an
4057360	4064840	immersion. The next model we have is the bundle
4064840	4078840	theoretic in which case u sits over x as a fiber bundle. The most exciting which is
4078840	4084520	the one we'll deal with today is the endogenous model. Where x4 actually
4084520	4092320	grows the space u where the activity takes place. So we talk about extra
4092320	4095320	dimensions but these are in some sense not extra dimensions they're implicit
4095320	4101800	dimensions within x4 and last to proceed without loss of generality we have the
4101800	4109520	tautological model. In that case x4 equals u and the immersion is the
4109520	4113360	identity and without loss of generality we simply play our games on one space.
4113360	4130520	Now we need rules. The rules are no choice of fundamental metric so we
4130520	4133960	imagine that Einstein was presented with a fork in the road and it's always
4133960	4141360	disturbing not to follow Einstein's path but we're in fact going to turn
4141360	4145040	Einstein's game on its head and see if we can get anywhere with that right. It's
4145040	4148720	also a possibility that because Einstein's theory is so perfect that if
4148720	4151360	there's anything wrong with it it's very hard to unthink it because
4151360	4156600	everything is built on top of it. So let's make no choice of fundamental metric
4156600	4159400	and in fact let's go more ambitious and let's say we're going to reverse the
4159400	4162560	logic of Einstein. Einstein the metric is fundamental but the Levy-Chavita
4162560	4167560	connection from which we deduce the curvature is emergent. So the
4167560	4174240	fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is that every metric causes
4174240	4177160	a connection to emerge and then the curvature is built on the connection.
4177160	4180560	We turn this around we imagine we're looking for a connection and we wish it
4180560	4184240	to build a metric because connections are amenable to quantization in a way
4184240	4191520	that metrics are not. The next point is that we always want to have a plan to
4191520	4196880	return to finite dimensions without losing sight of the quantum and lastly
4196880	4203360	we want to liberate matter from its dependence on the metric for its very
4203360	4209520	existence. So we now need to build fermions onto our four-dimensional
4209520	4213960	manifold in some way without ever choosing a metric if we're even to have
4213960	4218200	any hope of playing a game involving matter starting from this perspective of
4218200	4225120	no information other than the most bare information. Let's get started. We take
4225120	4231120	x4. We need metrics we have none. We're not allowed to choose one so we do the
4231120	4239960	standard trick is we choose them all. So we allow u14 to equal the space of
4239960	4248320	metrics on x4 point-wise. Therefore if we propagate on top of this, let me call
4248320	4252640	this the projection operator, if we propagate on u14 we are in some sense
4252640	4255920	following a Feynman-like idea of propagating over the space of all
4255920	4263680	metrics but not at a field level at a point-wise, tensorial level. Is there a
4263680	4268040	metric on u14? Well we both want one and don't want one. If we had a metric from
4268040	4271960	the space of all metrics we could define fermions but we would also lock out any
4271960	4276880	ability to do dynamics. We want some choice over what this metric is but we
4276880	4280240	don't want full choice because we want enough to be able to define the matter
4280240	4290000	fields to begin with. It turns out that if this is x4 and this is this
4290000	4297880	particular endogenous choice of u14, we have a ten-dimensional metric along the
4297880	4309760	fibers. So we have a g10 mu nu. Further for every point in the fibers we get a
4309760	4319200	metric downstairs on the base space. So if we pull back the cotangent bundle, we
4319200	4332440	get a metric g4 mu nu on pi star of the cotangent bundle of x. We now define the
4332440	4339720	chimeric bundle. And the chimeric bundle is the direct sum of the vertical
4339720	4343840	tangent bundle along the fibers with the pullback, which we're going to call the
4343840	4353720	horizontal bundle, from the base space. So the chimeric bundle is going to be the
4353720	4363200	vertical tangent space of ten dimensions to u, direct sum, the four-dimensional
4363200	4370160	cotangent space, which we're going to call horizontal to u. And the great thing
4370160	4375080	about the chimeric bundle is that it has an a priori metric. It's got a metrics on
4375080	4377960	the four, a metric on the ten, and we can always decide that the two of them are
4377960	4382320	naturally perpendicular to each other. Furthermore, it is almost canonically
4382320	4386000	isomorphic to the tangent bundle or the cotangent bundle because we either have
4386000	4390840	four out of fourteen or ten out of fourteen dimensions on the nose. So the
4390840	4395240	question is, what are we missing? And the answer is that we're missing exactly the
4395240	4405160	data of a connection. So this bundle, chimeric, c, we have c is equal to the
4405160	4413040	tangent bundle of u up to a choice of a connection theta. And this is exactly what
4413040	4419680	we wanted. We have a situation where we have some field on the manifold x in the
4419680	4424240	form of a connection, which is amenable, more friendly to quantization, which is
4424240	4428160	now determining a metric, turning around the Levy-Chivita game. And the only
4428160	4431680	problem is, is that we've had to buy ourselves into a different space than the
4431680	4439160	one we thought we wanted to work on. But now, as theta changes, the fermions are
4439160	4443840	defined on the chimeric bundle, and it's the isomorphism from the chimeric bundle
4443840	4448920	to the tangent bundle of the space u, which is varying, which means that the
4448920	4453160	fermions no longer depend on the metric, they no longer depend on the theta
4453160	4456840	connection. They are there if things go quantum mechanical. And we've achieved our
4456840	4461480	objective of putting the matter fields and the spin one fields on something of the
4461480	4475120	same footing. But, and I want to emphasize this, one thing most of us, we think a lot
4475120	4480960	about final theories and about unification. But until you actually start
4481400	4487120	daring to try to do it, you don't realize what the process of it feels like. Now,
4487120	4492560	try to imagine conducting your life where you have no children, let's say, and no
4492560	4496640	philanthropic urges. What you want to do is you want to use all of your money for
4496640	4503640	yourself and die penniless, right, like a perfect finish. Assuming that that's what
4503640	4508400	you wanted to do, it would be pretty nerve-wracking at the end, right? How many
4508440	4511680	days left do I have? How many dollars left do I have? This is the process of
4511680	4516200	unification in physics. You start giving away all of your most valuable
4516200	4519840	possessions. And you don't know whether you've given them away too early, whether
4519840	4524760	you've husband them too long. And so in this process, what we've just done is
4524760	4528880	we've started to paint ourselves into a corner. We got something we wanted, but
4528880	4532160	we've given away freedom. We're now dealing with a 14-dimensional world.
4539400	4558720	So let me just sum this up by saying, between fundamental and emergent, standard
4558720	4568880	model and GR. Let's do GR. Fundamental is the metric. Emergent is the
4568880	4577480	connection. Here in GU, it is the connection that's fundamental and the
4577480	4585960	metric that's emergent. In the next unit of GU, so this is sort of the first
4586040	4590680	unit of GU. Are there any quick questions happening to do with confusion or may I
4590680	4599560	proceed to the next unit? Okay. The next unit of GU is the unified field content.
4599560	4610520	What does it mean for our fields to become unified? There are, in fact, only at
4610560	4618240	this moment two fields that know about X. Theta, which is the connection that we've
4618240	4630360	just talked about, and a section, sigma, that takes us back so that we can
4630360	4638640	communicate back and forth between U and X. We now need field content that only
4638640	4652520	knows about U, which now has a metric depending on theta. A particular member
4652520	4656400	of the audience is a hedge fund manager who taught me that there is something of
4656400	4661400	a universal trade, and a universal trade has four components. You have to have a
4661400	4664800	view, you have to have a trade expression, you have to be able to calculate your
4664800	4670040	cost of carry, and you need a catalyst. Our view is going to be that somebody
4670040	4674400	doesn't understand what trade is possible, and we're going to make a trade that
4674400	4678200	looks like one of the worst trades of all time, and hopefully, if we have enough
4678200	4681080	conviction, we're going to have a catalyst to show that we actually got the
4681080	4685960	better part of the deal. What is that trade? What is it that we think has been
4685960	4702000	blocking progress? In GR, the Ramanian geometry, as we've said, we have the
4702000	4710800	projection operators, and we also have the Levy-Chavita connection. In the
4710800	4720400	auxiliary theory, we have freedom to choose our field content, and we have the
4720400	4730120	ability to get rid of much excess through the symmetries of the gauge group. We
4730120	4735280	are going to take particle theory, and we're going to make a bad trade, or what
4735280	4740120	appears to be a bad trade, which is that we are going to give away the freedom to
4740120	4744440	choose our field content, which is already extremely, as I think I said in the
4744440	4750080	abstract, baroque, with all of the different particle properties, and we're
4750080	4753440	going to lose the ability to use the gauge group because we're going to trade it
4753440	4781040	all. You have the family cow, and you have some magic beans. So it's now time to
4781080	4785080	trade the family cow for the magic beans and bring them home and see whether or
4785080	4809400	not we got the better of the deal. Okay. What is it that we get for the Levy-Chavita
4809400	4816280	connection? Well, not much. One thing we get is that normally the space of
4816280	4822280	connections is an affine space, not a vector space, but an affine space, almost a
4822280	4827760	vector space, a vector space up to a choice of origin. But with the Levy-Chavita
4827760	4831160	connection, rather than having an infinite plane with an ability to take
4831160	4836120	differences, but no real ability to have a group structure, you pick out one point
4836120	4843920	which then becomes the origin. That means that any connection A has a torsion
4843920	4851120	tensor A, which is equal to the connection minus the Levy-Chavita connection. So we
4851120	4856480	get a tensor that we don't usually have. Gauge potentials are not usually well
4856480	4860480	defined, they're only defined up to a choice of gauge. So that's one of the
4860480	4863640	things we get for our Levy-Chavita connection, but because the gauge group is
4863680	4868280	going to go missing, this has terrible properties with respect to the gauge
4868280	4872920	group. It almost looks like a representation, but in fact, if we let the
4872920	4882080	gauge group act, there's going to be an affine shift. Furthermore, as we've said
4882080	4887520	before, the ability to use projection operators together with the gauge group
4887520	4891800	is frustrated by virtue of the fact that these two things do not commute with
4891800	4897440	each other. So now the question is, how are we going to prove that we're
4897440	4909920	actually making a good trade? Okay. First thing we need to do is that we still
4909920	4913760	have the right to choose intrinsic field content. We have an intrinsic field
4913760	4922640	theory. So if you consider the structure bundle of the spinners, we built the
4922640	4930080	chimeric bundle, so we can define Dirac spinners on the chimeric bundle. If we're
4930080	4935720	in Euclidean signature, a 14-dimensional manifold has Dirac spinners of dimension
4935720	4942120	2 to the dimension of the space divided by 2. So 2 to the 14 over 2, 2 to the
4942160	4956960	7th is 128. So we have a map into a structure group of U128. At least in
4956960	4963080	Euclidean signature, we can get to mixed signatures later. From that, we can form
4963080	4982160	the associated bundle and sections of this bundle are either, depending upon how
4982160	4996920	you want to think about it, the gauge group H, or C, a space of sigma fields,
4997720	5009280	nonlinear. There's no reason that we can't choose this as field content. Again,
5009880	5015440	we're being led by the nose like a bull. If we want to make use of the symmetries of
5015440	5019240	the theory, we have to promote some symmetry to being part of the theory, and we
5019240	5023880	have to let it be subjected to dynamical laws. We're going to lose control over it.
5023880	5026920	But we're not dead yet, right? We're fighting for our life to make sure that
5026920	5033960	this trade has some hope. So potentially, by including symmetries as field content,
5033960	5039000	we will have some opportunity to make use of the projection. So for those of you
5039120	5051600	who... So when I was thinking about this, I used to be amazed by ships and bottles.
5051600	5055520	I must confess that I never figured out what the trick was for ships and bottles.
5055520	5062560	But once I saw it, I remembered thinking, that's really clever. So if you've never seen it,
5062560	5067840	you have a ship which is like a curvature tensor. And imagine that the mast is the
5067840	5075720	Ricci curvature. If you just try to shove it into the bottle, you're undoubtedly going
5075720	5081560	to snap the mast. So you imagine that you've transformed your gauge fields, you've kept
5081560	5087560	track of where the Ricci curvature was, you try to push it from one space like ad-valued
5087560	5094560	two forms into another space like ad-valued one forms where connections live. That's
5094600	5098480	not a good idea. Instead, what we do is the following. Imagine that you're carrying around
5098480	5103480	group theoretic information. What you do is you do a transformation based on the group
5103480	5110120	theory. So you lower the mast, you push it through the neck, having some string attached
5110120	5119120	to the mast, and then you undo the transformation on the other side. This is exactly what we're
5119120	5124640	going to hope is going to save us in this bad trade that we've made. Because we're going
5124640	5129440	to add field content that has the ability to lower the mast and bring the mast back
5129440	5134920	up, we're going to hope to have a theory which is going to create a commutative situation.
5134920	5141920	But then once we've had this idea, we start to get a little bolder. Let's think about
5142600	5149600	unified content. We know that we want a space of connections, A, for our field theory. But
5155840	5160400	we know because we have a Levy-Chevita connection that this is going to be equal on the nose
5160400	5166440	to ad-valued one forms as a vector space. The gauge group represents an ad-valued one
5166440	5173200	forms. So if we also have the gauge group, but we think of that instead as a space of
5173200	5180200	sigma fields, what if we take the semi-direct product at a group theoretic level between
5180200	5187200	the two and call this our group of interest? Well, by analogy, we've always had a problem
5188820	5195820	with the Poincare group being too intrinsically tied to rigid, flat Minkowski space. What
5196440	5200400	if we wanted to do quantum field theory in some situation, which was more amenable to
5200400	5206160	a curved space situation? It's possible that we should be basing it around something more
5206160	5211720	akin to the gauge group. And in this case, we're mimicking the construction where XC
5211720	5218720	here would be analogous to the Lorenz group, fixing a point in Minkowski space. And ad-valued
5219200	5224960	one forms would be analogous to the four momentums. We take in the semi-direct product to create
5224960	5229000	the inhomogeneous Lorenz group, otherwise known as the Poincare group, or rather it's
5229000	5236000	double cover to allow spin. So we're going to call this the inhomogeneous gauge group
5238540	5245540	or Iggy. And this is going to be a really interesting space because it has a couple of properties.
5246540	5253540	One is it has a very interesting subgroup. Now, of course, H includes into G by just
5258260	5265260	including onto the first factor. But in fact, there's a more interesting homomorphism brought
5267300	5272320	to you by the Levy-Civita connection. So this magic beam trade is going to start to enter
5272320	5277600	more and more into our consciousness. If I take an element H, and I map that in the
5277600	5284600	obvious way into the first factor, but I map it onto the Morro-Cartain form, I think that's
5294640	5301640	what I wish I remembered more of this stuff, into the second factor, it turns out that
5301640	5308640	this is actually a group homomorphism. And so we have a non-trivial embedding, which
5308680	5314680	is in some sense diagonal between the two factors. That subgroup we are going to refer
5314680	5321680	to as the tilted gauge group. And now our field content, at least in the Bosonic sector,
5322720	5327360	is going to be a group manifold, an infinite dimensional function space league group, but
5327360	5334360	a group nonetheless. And we can now look at G mod the tilted gauge group. And if we have
5340560	5347080	any interesting representation of H, we can form homogeneous vector bundles and work with
5347080	5351520	induced representations. And that's what the fermions are going to be. So the fermions
5351520	5357400	in our theories are going to be H modules. And the idea is that we're going to work
5357400	5364400	with vector bundles, curly E, of the form inhomogeneous gauge group, product it over
5372800	5379800	the tilted gauge group. And we're going to work with vector bundles, curly E, of the
5381520	5388520	form inhomogeneous gauge group. Now just as in the finite dimensional case, we have
5389160	5394920	a linear and a nonlinear component. Right? Because at a topological level, this is just
5394920	5401920	a Cartian product. So if we wish to take products of fermions, of spinorial fields,
5402960	5406480	we have a place to accept them. We can't figure out necessarily how to map them into
5406480	5411480	the nonlinear sector, but we don't want to. So just the way when we look at supersymmetry,
5411680	5416960	we can take products of the spin one-half fields and map them into the linear sector.
5416960	5423960	We can do the same thing here. So what we're talking about is something like a supersymmetric
5423960	5429240	extension of the inhomogeneous gauge group analogous to supersymmetric extensions of
5429240	5436240	the double cover of the inhomogeneous Lorentz or Poincare group. Further, because this construction
5437240	5443680	is at the level of groups, we've left a slot on the left-hand side on which to act. So
5443680	5450680	for example, if we want to take regular representations on the group, we can act by the group G on
5451480	5455680	the left-hand side because we're allowing the tilted gauge group to act on the right-hand
5455680	5462680	side. So it's perfectly built for representation theory. And if you think back to Wigner's classification
5462680	5466840	and the concept that a particle should correspond to an irreducible representation of the inhomogeneous
5466840	5473840	Lorentz group, we may be able to play the same games here up to the issue of infinite dimensionality.
5475040	5482040	So right now our field content is looking pretty good. It's looking unified in the sense
5483360	5487240	that it has an algebraic structure that is not usually enjoyed by field content, and
5487240	5492920	field content from different sectors can interact and know about each other, provided
5492920	5499920	we can drag something out of this with meaning. Now, what would it mean to be able to use
5503840	5510840	a gauge group in an intrinsic theory like this? We would be talking about something like
5511400	5518400	an action, let's say a first order action, and it would take the group G, let's say to
5519040	5526040	the real numbers, invariant, not under the full group, but under the tilted gauge subgroup.
5533440	5539940	And now the question is, do we have any such actions that are particularly nice, and could
5539940	5545940	we recognize them the way Einstein did by trying to write down not the action, and Hilbert
5545940	5551500	was the first one to write that down, but I always feel defensive because I think Einstein
5551500	5556060	and Grossman did so much more to begin the theory in that the Lagrangian that got written
5556060	5562540	down was really just an inevitability. So just humor me for this talk and let me call it
5562540	5568300	the Einstein-Grossman Lagrangian. Hilbert has certainly done fantastic things and has
5568300	5575300	a lot of credit elsewhere, and he did do it first. But here what we had was that Einstein
5576220	5582140	thought in terms of the differential of the action, not the action itself. So what we're
5582140	5589140	looking for is equations of motion where some field alpha, where alpha belongs to the one
5589420	5596420	forms on the group. Now in this section of GU, unified field content is only one part
5608660	5615660	of it, but what we really want is unified field content plus a tool kit. So what we
5619660	5626660	want is a tool kit. So we've restricted ourselves to one gauge group. This big unitary group
5627700	5631700	on the spinners using whatever sort of inner product naturally exists on the spinners,
5631700	5638700	and not spinners value in an auxiliary structure, but intrinsic spinners. The tool kit that
5640540	5647540	we have is that the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle
5649140	5656140	bundle, looks like the Clifford algebra at the level of vector spaces, which is just
5668260	5675380	looking like the exterior algebra on the chimeric bundle. That means that it's graded
5675380	5680420	by degrees. Chimeric bundle has dimension 14, so there's a 0 part, a 1 part, a 2 part
5680420	5687420	all the way up to 14. Plus we have forms in the manifold. So the question is, if I want
5688260	5695260	to look at omega i valued in the adjoint bundle, there's going to be some element phi i, which
5695260	5702260	is pure trace, right? Because it's the same representations appearing where in the usually
5713780	5720780	auxiliary directions as well as the geometric directions. So we get an entire suite of
5721620	5728620	invariants together with trivially associated invariants that come from using the hodge star
5731500	5736500	operator on the form. So I'm just going to call them for completeness. I'm not going
5736500	5743500	to deal with them. Now this is a tremendous amount of freedom that we've just gained.
5744500	5748980	Normally we keep losing freedom, but this is the first time we actually begin to see
5749000	5752580	that we have a lot of freedom, and we're going to actually retain some of this freedom to
5752580	5759580	the end of the talk. But the idea being that I can now start to define operators, which
5760340	5767340	correspond to the ship and the bottle problem. I can take field content, epsilon and pi, where
5768820	5775820	epsilon, where these are elements of the inhomogeneous gauge group. In other words,
5776260	5783260	epsilon is a gauge transformation, and pi is a gauge potential. And I can start to define
5788860	5795860	operators. I'm going to use, so in this case I'm going to define operators, and I'm going
5805940	5812940	to define operators. In this case, if I have a phi, which is one of these invariants, in
5812940	5819440	the form piece I can either take a contraction, or I can take a wedge product. In the Lie
5819440	5825940	algebra piece I can either take a Lie product, or because I'm looking at the unitary group
5825940	5829540	there's a second possibility, which is I can multiply everything by i and go from skew
5829540	5834340	her mission to her mission, and take a Jordan product using anti-commutators rather than
5834380	5839060	commutators. So I actually have a fair amount of freedom, and I'm going to use a magic bracket
5839060	5843460	notation, which in whatever situation I'm looking for knows what it wants to be. Does
5843460	5848100	it want to do contraction? Does it want to do wedge product, Lie product, Jordan product?
5848100	5855100	But the point is I now have a suite of ways of moving forms around. So for example, I
5856620	5863620	can define a shear of operator that takes i forms, and I can define a shear of operator
5864820	5871820	valued in the adjoint bundle. To much higher degree forms valued in the adjoint bundle.
5884780	5891780	So in this case, for example, it would take a two form to a d minus three plus two, or
5892060	5899060	a d minus one form. So curvature is an ad-valued two form. And if I had such a she-ab operator,
5903660	5910660	it would take ad-valued two forms to ad-valued d minus one forms, which is exactly the right
5910820	5917820	space to be an alpha coming from the derivative of an action. And this is exactly what Einstein
5918820	5924300	was doing. He took the curvature, which was large, and he bent it back, and he sheared
5924300	5930660	off the vial curvature, and they took that part, and he pushed it back along the space
5930660	5935780	of metrics to give us something which we nowadays call Ricci flow, an ability for the curvature
5935780	5943340	to direct us to the next structure. Well, we're doing the same thing here. We're taking
5943340	5950340	the curvature, and we can now push it back onto the space of connections.
5973340	5980340	So in this case, the idea is that we've actually got something for our magic beans. We have
5991740	5998740	an ability now to get equations of motion, which go along the group in some sense. It's
5999740	6004740	as if it was a gradient vector field, except we're using forms rather than vectors. But
6004740	6011740	now, what are the transformation properties? Well, because the curvature, so you have she-ab,
6011740	6018740	because the curvature of a connection, hit by a gauge transformation, is equal on the
6018740	6025740	nose to the adjoin action on the Lie algebra of the curvature, we know that if we have
6048740	6055740	two possible actions of conjugation under a bracket, and the bracket respects the action
6057940	6062540	of the gauge group, we know that this is going to be well preserved. In other words, we're
6062540	6068300	going to get a form that is gauge invariant relative to the tilted gauge group. And so
6068300	6075940	as a result, we now have the possibility for equations of motion, which are well defined,
6076100	6079660	even though they involve projection operators, because we've built the symmetries into the
6079660	6086660	theory and we're working on a group manifold to begin with. What about the torsion? Can
6087260	6094260	we rescue the torsion? Here again, we have good news. The torsion is problematic, but
6096180	6101100	if I look at a different field, which I'm going to call the augmented torsion, and I
6101140	6108140	define it to be the regular torsion, which would be pi, minus this expression, this turns
6113620	6120620	out to be beautifully invariant again. So neither this term nor this term is gauge
6120660	6126780	invariant, but they fail to be gauge invariant in exactly the same way. So an important principle
6126820	6130980	of life, which I took too long to realize, is that if you have one disease, you're in
6130980	6134420	real trouble. But if you have two diseases, you always have the possibility of having
6134420	6138140	one disease kill the other disease. This is true in renormalization theory, it's true
6138140	6143260	in black-scholes theory, it's true all over the place. So what we have here is we've got
6143260	6147460	more diseases into the theory, but an even number of diseases allow us to have no disease
6147460	6153060	at all. So now we have two great tensors. We've got one tensor coming from the curvature
6153060	6160060	and the Shiav operator, we have another tensor coming from the torsion and it's augmentation.
6173500	6180500	We're doing okay.
6184060	6190060	We're not doing physics yet, we're just building tools. We've built ourselves a little bit
6192740	6196740	of freedom, we have some reprieves, we've still got some very big debts to pay back for this
6196740	6201460	magic beans trade. We're in the wrong dimension, we don't have good field content, we're stuck
6201460	6206260	on this one spinner, we've built ourselves some projection operators, we've picked up
6206420	6213420	some symmetric non-linear sigma field. What can we write down in terms of equations of
6214660	6221660	motion? Let's start with Einstein's concept. If we do Shiav of the curvature tensor of
6226860	6233860	a gauge potential hit with an operator defined by the epsilon sigma field, it's going to
6236660	6243660	be 0, plus the star operator acting on the augmented torsion of the pair. This contains
6249500	6256500	all of the information when pi is 0 in Einstein's tensor. In other words, there is a spinorial
6258020	6262940	analog of the vial curvature, a spinorial analog of the traceless Ricci curvature and
6262940	6269940	a spinorial analog of the scalar curvature. This operator should shear off the analog
6270540	6275020	of the vial curvature just the way Einstein's projection shears off the vial curvature when
6275020	6280380	you're looking at the tangent bundle. This term, which is now gauge invariant, may be
6280380	6287380	considered as containing a piece that looks like lambda times g mu nu, or a cosmological
6287620	6294620	constant. This piece here can be made to contain a piece that looks like Einstein's tensor,
6304420	6311420	and so this looks very much like the vacuum field equation. We have to add in something
6311700	6316700	else. I'm going to be a little bit vague because I'm still giving myself some freedom as we
6316700	6323700	write this up. But we're going to define whatever tensor we need for these terms here. This is
6331500	6338500	gauge invariant, this is gauge invariant, and this is gauge invariant with respect to
6338980	6345980	the tilted gauge group. These two tensors together should be exact, and this tensor on
6348620	6355620	its own should be exact. We're going to call the exact tensor the swerveture. So the particular
6359980	6365300	Chiav operator we call the swerve, so it's swerve curvature plus the adjustment needed
6365300	6372300	for exactness, and another gauge invariant term which is not usually gauge invariant.
6374300	6381300	So that's pretty cool. If that works, we've now taken the Einstein equation, and we've
6385820	6390180	put it not on the space of metrics, but we've put a generalization and an analog on the
6390180	6395780	space of gauge potentials much more amenable to quantization with much more algebraic structure
6395780	6399940	and symmetry in the form of the inhomogeneous gauge group and its homogeneous vector bundles,
6399940	6406940	some of which may be super symmetric. Now the question is, we've integrated so tightly
6408740	6415740	with the matter field, we have to ask ourselves the question, can we see unification here?
6420860	6425940	Let's define matter content in the form of omega zero tensored in the spinners, which
6425940	6432940	is a fancy way of saying spinners. Together with a copy of the one forms tensored in the
6437380	6444380	spinners. And let me come up with two other copies of the same data.
6450180	6457180	So I'll make a d minus one just by duality, so imagine that there's a hodge star operator.
6462980	6468460	And when I was a little kid, I had the soma cube. I don't know if you ever played with
6468460	6472940	one of these things, they're fantastic. And I later found out that this guy who invented
6472940	6477060	the soma cube, which you had to put together pieces, there was one piece that looked like
6477060	6483220	this object. And he was like this amazing guy in the resistance during World War II.
6483220	6489980	So I would like to name this the somatic complex, after I guess his name was Piet Hein, I think.
6489980	6496980	So this complex, I'm going to choose to start filling in some operators. The exterior derivative
6498420	6502020	coupled to a connection, but in the case of spinners, we're going to put a slash through
6503020	6509020	and let's make this the identity. We'd now like to come up with a second operator here.
6510260	6514660	And this second operator here should have the property that the complex should be exact
6514660	6521660	and the obstruction to it being a true complex, to nil potency, should be exactly the generalization
6524060	6531060	of the Einstein equations, thus unifying the spinorial matter with the nil potency.
6532020	6537020	The intrinsic replacement for the curvature equations.
6537020	6544020	Well, we know that DA, composed with itself, is going to be the curvature. And we know
6547460	6554460	that we want that to be hit by a shiav operator. And if shiav is a derivation, you can start
6555140	6562140	to see that that's going to be curvature, so you want something like fA followed by
6562260	6569260	shiav over here to cancel. Then you think, okay, well how am I going to get at getting
6569860	6574460	this augmented torsion? And then you realize that the information in the inhomogeneous
6574460	6579180	gauge group, you actually have information not for one connection, but for two connections.
6579180	6586180	So in one case, I can do plus star to pick up the A sub pi, but I'm also going to have
6599180	6603980	a derivative operator if I just do a star operation. So I need another derivative operator
6603980	6610540	to kill it off here. So I'm going to take minus the derivative with respect to the connection
6610540	6617540	H inverse DA naught H, which defines the connection one form as well as having the same derivative
6622380	6626460	coming from the Levy-Civita connection on U. So in other words, I have two derivative
6626460	6631140	operators here. I have two ad-valued one forms. The difference between them is going to be
6631140	6636100	of zero with order, and it's going to be precisely the augmented torsion. That's the same game
6636100	6643100	I'm going to repeat here. So I'm going to do the same thing here. I'm going to define
6643100	6650100	a bunch of terms where in the numerator I'm going to pick up the pi as well as the derivative
6662620	6669620	in the denominator because I have no derivative here. I'm going to pick up this H inverse
6670060	6677060	DA naught H. I'm going to do that again on the other side. There are going to be plus
6691780	6694980	and minus signs, but it's a magic bracket that knows whether or not it should be a plus
6694980	6701380	sign or a minus sign. I apologize for that, but I'm not able to keep that straight. And
6701380	6708380	then there's going to be one extra term where all these T's have the epsilon and pi. So
6712260	6716660	some crazy series of differential operators on the northern route. So if you take the
6716660	6721820	high road or you take the low road, when you take the composition of the two, the differential
6721820	6727580	operators fall out, and you're left with an obstruction term that looks like the Einstein
6727580	6734580	field equation. That's pretty good, if true. Can you go farther? Well, look at how close
6734580	6741580	this field content is to the picture from deformation theory that we learned about in low-dimensions.
6742500	6749500	The low-dimensional world works by saying that similar to what we learned in the previous
6751500	6758500	lecture, we're going to look at what we learned in the previous lecture. We're going to look
6764580	6771580	atalities mapped to field content, mapped to equations, usually in the curvature. And
6774620	6780620	when you linearize that, if you're in low enough dimensions, you have omega 0, omega
6781820	6787040	1, sometimes omega 0 again, and then something that comes from omega 2. And if you can get
6787040	6792140	that sequence to terminate by looking at something like a half signature theorem or a bent back
6792140	6795300	diram complex in the case of dimension three,
6795300	6796600	you have an Atia-Singer theory.
6796600	6798260	And remember, we need some way to get out
6798260	6800780	of infinite dimensional trouble.
6800780	6803060	You have to have someone to call when things go wrong
6803060	6805460	overseas and you have to be able to get your way home.
6805460	6807420	And in some sense, we call an Atia-Singer
6807420	6809620	and say we're in some infinite dimensional space.
6809620	6812220	Can't you cut out some finite dimensional problem
6812220	6814400	that we can solve even though we start getting ourselves
6814400	6816860	into serious trouble?
6816860	6820500	And so we're going to do the same thing down here.
6820500	6829220	We're going to have omega 0 add, omega 1 add, direct sum,
6829220	6843700	omega 0 add, omega d minus 1 add.
6843700	6845140	And it's almost the same operators.
6846100	6850420	And this is now not just a great guess.
6850420	6853820	It's actually the information for the deformation theory
6853820	6858620	of the linearized replacement of the Einstein field
6858620	6859860	equations.
6859860	6862340	So this is computing the Zyrowski tangent space,
6862340	6865500	just as if you were doing self-dual theory,
6865500	6867220	or churn-Simon's theory.
6867220	6870500	You've got two somatic complexes, right?
6870860	6873300	One of them is Bose.
6873300	6876420	One of them is Fermi.
6876420	6880260	The obstruction to both of them is a common generalization
6880260	6882060	of the Einstein field equations.
6882060	6888540	What's more is if you start to think about this,
6888540	6892660	this is some version of Hodg's theory with funky operators.
6892660	6896140	So you can ask yourself, well, what are the harmonic forms
6896140	6898140	in a fractional spin context?
6898340	6901140	Well, they're different depending upon whether you
6901140	6904580	take the degree 0 piece together with the degree 2 piece,
6904580	6905780	or you take the degree 1 piece.
6905780	6906980	Let's just take the degree 1 piece.
6910580	6913380	You get some kind of equation.
6913380	6916940	So I'm going to decide that I have a zeta field, which is an
6916940	6923860	omega 1 tensor spinors, and a field new, which is a zeta
6924860	6932980	spinors, and a field new, which always strikes me as a
6932980	6947460	Yiddish field, new is omega 0 tensor S. What equation would
6947460	6949780	they solve if we were doing Hodg's theory relative to
6949780	6950780	this complex?
6951780	6956220	The equation would look something like this.
6969940	6973980	There'd be one equation that was very simple, and then
6973980	6975820	there'd be one equation that would be like really hard to
6975820	6976820	guess.
6976820	7006420	I hope I'm not screwing this up.
7006420	7018180	But all these boards, I still feel like I'm
7018180	7019620	managing to run out of room.
7067420	7069460	Now, if you have something like that, that would be a
7069460	7072420	hell of a Dirac equation.
7072420	7075660	You've got differential operators over here.
7075660	7077020	You've got differential operators.
7085460	7088580	I guess I didn't write them in.
7088580	7091020	But you would have two differential operators over
7091020	7093180	here, and you'd have this differential operator coming
7093180	7095020	from this more cartain form.
7095020	7096980	So I apologize on being a little loose here.
7096980	7101300	But the idea is you have two of these terms of 0th order,
7101300	7103540	three of these terms would be first order.
7103540	7106060	And on this side, one term would be first order.
7112180	7113660	And that's not there.
7113660	7114660	That was a mistake.
7117140	7119260	Oh, no, sorry.
7119260	7121820	That was a mistake, calling it a mistake.
7121820	7124300	These are two separate equations.
7124300	7128220	So you have two separate fields, new in zeta.
7128220	7131540	And you have a couple set of differential equations that are
7131540	7133580	playing the role of the Dirac theory.
7133580	7136740	Coming from the Hodge theory of a complex whose
7136740	7139420	obstruction to being a cosmology theory would be the
7139420	7142260	replacement to the Einstein field equations, which would be
7142260	7147100	rendered gauge invariant on a group relative to a tilted
7147100	7148900	subgroup.
7148900	7149820	OK.
7150820	7154380	So now we've dealt with two of the three sectors.
7154380	7158980	Is there any generalization of the Yang-Mills equation?
7158980	7162220	Well, if we were to take the Einstein field equation
7162220	7167500	generalization and take the norm square of it, oh, there's
7167500	7171900	some point I should make here, just one second.
7171900	7175580	I've been treating this as if everything is first order.
7175580	7183540	But what really happens here is that you've got symmetries,
7183540	7193740	you've got symmetric field content, you've got ordinary
7193740	7202980	connections, and we're neglecting to draw the fact
7202980	7205460	that there have to be equations here, too.
7205460	7207100	These equations are first order.
7210020	7212500	So why do we get to call this a first order theory if there
7212500	7216780	are equations here which are of second order?
7216780	7218380	Well, it's not a pure first order theory.
7218380	7221060	But when I say a first order theory in this context, what I
7221060	7224020	really mean is that the second order equations are
7224020	7226740	completely redundant on the first order equations by
7226740	7228620	virtue of the symmetry principle.
7228620	7232260	That is, any solution of the first order equations should
7232260	7236820	automatically imply a solution of the second order equations.
7236820	7241380	So from that perspective, I can pretend that this isn't here
7241380	7243780	because it is sufficient to solve the first order equations.
7248740	7258860	So I can now look, let's call that entire replacement, which
7258860	7260060	we previously called alpha.
7260060	7262100	I'm going to set alpha equal to epsilon because I've actually
7262100	7263940	been using epsilon.
7263940	7267260	The portion that is just the first order equations, and take
7267260	7270660	the normed square of that, that gives me a new Lagrangian.
7270660	7274180	And if I solve that new Lagrangian, it leads to
7274180	7279140	equations of motion that look like exactly what we said before.
7287700	7289660	And it ends up defining an operator that looks
7289660	7291540	something like this.
7291540	7297380	dA star, the adjoint of the Shiav operator.
7297380	7324260	So in other words, this piece gives you some portion that
7324260	7327940	looks like, right, from the Swarovitcher tensor.
7327940	7329860	There's going to be some component that's playing the
7329860	7333100	role of Einstein's field equations directly in the
7333100	7336060	Ricci tensor, but generalized.
7336060	7338500	And then you're going to have some differential operator
7338500	7342340	here so that the replacement for the Yang-Mills term, instead
7342340	7347060	of dA star of fA, you've got these two Shiav and adjoint
7347060	7351460	Shiav together in the center, generalizing the
7351460	7353540	Yang-Mills theory.
7353540	7355540	Then you say, well, how come we don't just see the
7355540	7356540	Yang-Mills theory?
7356540	7359260	Why don't we see general relativity as well?
7359260	7361620	But in the full expansion, there's also a term that's
7361620	7363900	zero at the order that's effectively acting like the
7363900	7366060	identity, which hits this as well.
7366060	7367980	So you have one piece that looks like the Yang-Mills
7367980	7370860	theory, and in these second order equations, you also
7370860	7375460	have a piece that looks like the Einstein theory.
7375460	7379020	And this is in the vacuum equations.
7379020	7385300	So then the question is, how do you see the Dirac theory
7385300	7387060	coming out of this?
7387060	7389220	And so what we're just trying to put together now before we
7389220	7394460	come out with the manuscript for this is putting these two
7394460	7398460	elliptic complexes together, the Dirac terms, go between the
7398460	7401140	two complexes.
7401140	7403540	So the idea is that the stress energy tensor should be the
7403540	7407660	up and back term, and the Dirac equations should come out
7408300	7411020	of the term that goes up and over versus the term that goes
7411020	7413060	over and up.
7413060	7414900	And you need some cancellations to make sure that
7414900	7416580	everything is of zero with order,
7416580	7418980	properly invariant, et cetera.
7418980	7421100	And that's taking a little time, because frankly, I'm not
7421100	7422620	good at keeping track of indices, minus
7422620	7423940	signs, left, right.
7423940	7425620	It's a learning-disabled nightmare.
7438420	7440060	We've got one more unit to go.
7440060	7442060	I mean, there's a fifth unit that has to do with
7442060	7444500	mathematical applications, but this is sort of a physics
7444500	7445780	talk for today.
7445780	7448980	Is there any questions before we go into the last unit and
7448980	7452500	then really handle questions for real?
7452500	7454060	All right, let me show you the next little bit.
7458260	7459660	We've got problems.
7459660	7462340	We're not in four dimensions, we're in 14.
7462340	7464300	We don't have great field content, because we've just
7464300	7466900	got these unadorned spinners, and we're doing gauge
7466900	7471740	transformations effectively on the intrinsic geometric
7471740	7475700	quantities, not on some safe auxiliary data that's
7475700	7480140	tensor-producted with what our spinners are.
7480140	7482380	How is it that we're going to find anything realistic?
7482380	7484500	And then we have to remember, everything we've been doing
7484500	7487220	recently has been done on you.
7487220	7498420	We've forgotten about x.
7498420	7500220	How does all of this look to x?
7504060	7507340	So x is sitting down here, and all the action is
7507340	7509820	happening up here on u14.
7509820	7511500	There's a projection operator.
7511500	7512740	I've used pi twice.
7512740	7515780	It's not here in the field content, it's just projection.
7515780	7519620	And I've got a sigma, which is a section.
7519620	7538780	What does zeta pulled back or nu pulled back look like on
7538780	7566140	x4?
7566220	7570980	Let's try to think about how we would come up with this field
7570980	7573020	content, starting from first principle.
7576140	7578180	Let's imagine that there's nothing to begin with.
7581140	7583980	Then you have one copy of matter, whatever it is that we
7583980	7587180	see in our world, the first generation.
7587180	7592100	In order for that to become interesting, it has to have an
7592100	7598060	equation, so it has to get mapped somewhere.
7598060	7600340	Then we see the muon and all the rest of the matter that
7600340	7603540	comes with it, and we have a second generation.
7603540	7609580	Then in the mid-1970s, Pearl finds the tau particle, and we
7609580	7611220	start to get panicked that we don't
7611220	7614420	understand what's going on.
7614420	7616900	One thing we can do is we can move these equations around
7616900	7622100	a little bit, and move the equation for the first
7622100	7624460	generation back.
7624460	7626700	And then we can start adding particles.
7626700	7628180	Let's imagine that we could guess what
7628180	7629740	particles we'd add.
7629740	7634780	We'd add a pseudo generation of 16 particles, spin three halves
7634780	7638700	never before seen, not necessarily super partners,
7638700	7641940	but we read a Schwinger matter with familiar internal quantum
7641940	7644460	numbers, but potentially so that they're flipped, so that
7644460	7646500	matter looks like anti-matter to this generation.
7649500	7654180	Then we add, just for the heck of it, 144 spin one-half
7654180	7657660	fermions, which contain a bunch of particles with
7657660	7660740	familiar quantum numbers, but also some very exotic looking
7660740	7662580	particles that nobody's ever seen before.
7666100	7669140	Now we start doing something different.
7669140	7671380	We make an accusation.
7671380	7674340	One of our generations isn't a regular generation.
7674380	7675700	It's an imposter.
7675700	7679420	At low energy in a cooled state, potentially it looks just
7679420	7681580	the same as these other generations.
7681580	7685340	But were we somehow able to turn up the energy?
7685340	7688180	Imagine that it would unify differently with this new
7688180	7691980	matter that we've posited, rather than simply unifying
7691980	7693300	onto itself.
7693300	7695940	So two of the generations would unify onto themselves, but
7695940	7699460	this third generation would fuse with the new particles
7699460	7702740	that we've already added.
7702740	7705300	We consolidate geometrically.
7705300	7708860	We can add some zero-eth order terms.
7708860	7712540	And we imagine that there is an elliptic complex that would
7712540	7715940	govern this state of affairs.
7715940	7718980	We then choose to add some stuff that we can't see at all,
7718980	7720140	that's dark.
7722380	7724860	And this matter would be governed by forces that were
7724860	7725700	dark, too.
7725700	7727700	There might be dark electromagnetism, and dark
7727700	7730900	strong, and dark weak.
7730900	7733380	It might be that things break in that sector completely
7733380	7734020	differently.
7734020	7737060	And it doesn't break down to an SU3 cross SU2 cross U1,
7737060	7739780	because these are different SU3s, SU2s, and U1s.
7739780	7744580	And it may be that there would be a high-energy SU5, or
7744580	7748540	some patissalaam model.
7748540	7751740	Imagine then that chirality was not fundamental, but it was
7751740	7754900	emergent, that you had some complex.
7754900	7757300	And as long as there were cross terms, these two halves
7757300	7758340	would talk to each other.
7758340	7761020	But if the cross terms went away, the two terms would
7761020	7762540	become decoupled.
7762540	7764700	And just the way we have a left hand and we have a right
7764700	7768140	hand, and you ask me, imagine you have a neurological
7768140	7771340	condition and an oliver sac, sort of an idiom, and if
7771340	7773340	somebody's only aware of one side of their body, and they
7773340	7774660	say, oh my god, I'm deformed.
7774660	7776940	I'm asymmetric.
7776940	7779060	But we actually have a symmetry between the two
7779060	7780500	things that can't see each other.
7783620	7785700	Then we would still have a chiral world, but the
7785700	7787740	chirality wouldn't be fundamental.
7787740	7790900	There'd be something else keeping the fermions light.
7790900	7793260	And that would be the absence of the cross terms.
7793260	7795940	Now, if you look at what happens in our replacement for
7795940	7799940	the Einstein field equations, the term that would
7799940	7801700	counterbalance the scalar curvature.
7801700	7804540	If you put these equations on a sphere, they wouldn't be
7804540	7809220	satisfied if the t term had a zero expectation value, because
7809220	7811580	there would be non-trivial scalar curvature in the
7811580	7815420	swervature terms, but there'd be nothing to counterbalance it.
7815420	7817860	So it's fundamentally the scalar curvature that would
7817860	7823620	coax the VEV on the augmented torsion out of the vacuum to
7823620	7825060	have a non-zero level.
7825060	7827460	And if you pumped up that sphere and it smeared out the
7827460	7829900	curvature, which you can't get rid of because of topological
7829900	7834980	considerations, let's say from Chernvet theory, you would
7834980	7839540	have a very diffuse, very small term.
7839540	7841620	And that term would be the term that was playing the role of
7841620	7843660	the cosmological constant.
7843660	7846500	So in a large universe, you'd have a curvature that was
7846500	7850020	spread out, and things would be very light, and things would
7850020	7852540	get very dark due to the absence of curvature
7852540	7853980	linking the sectors.
7860380	7862140	And that turns out to be exactly our complex.
7866300	7871140	So in other words, just to recap, starting with nothing
7871140	7877020	other than a four-man fold, we built a bundle U. The bundle
7877020	7879300	U had no metric, but it almost had a metric.
7879300	7882380	It had a metric up to a connection.
7882380	7884580	There was another bundle on top of that bundle called the
7884580	7885420	chimeric bundle.
7885420	7888780	The chimeric bundle had an intrinsic metric.
7888780	7890700	We built our spinners on that.
7890700	7893620	We restricted ourselves to those spinners.
7893620	7899020	We moved most of our attention to the emergent metric on U14,
7899020	7903380	which gave us a map between the chimeric bundle and the
7903380	7905620	tangent bundle of U14.
7905620	7911420	We built a toolkit allowing us to choose symmetric field
7911420	7916340	content, to define equations of motion on the cotangent space
7916340	7920100	of that field content, to form a homogeneous vector bundle
7920100	7925660	with the fermions, to come up with unifications of the
7925660	7928380	Einstein field equations, Yang-Mills equations, and
7928380	7930020	Dirac equations.
7930020	7933420	We then broke those things apart under decomposition,
7933420	7937260	pulling things back from U14, and we found a three-generation
7937260	7940700	model where nothing has been put in by hand.
7940700	7945860	And we have a 10-dimensional normal component, which looks
7945860	7947140	like the spin-10 theory.
7953860	7957220	I can tell you where there are problems in this story.
7957260	7960100	I can tell you that when we moved from Euclidean metric
7960100	7963300	to Minkowski metric, we seemed to be off by a sign somewhere,
7963300	7965740	or I could be mistaken.
7965740	7969060	I could tell you that the propagation in 14 dimensions
7969060	7971620	has to be worked out so that we would be fooled into thinking
7971620	7973100	we were in a four-dimensional world.
7973100	7977100	There are lots of things to ask about this theory.
7977100	7982060	But I find it remarkable that tying our hands, we find
7982060	7984980	ourselves with new equations, unifications, and three
7984980	7989860	generations, in a way that seems surprisingly rich,
7989860	7997140	certainly unexpected, and I think I'll stop there.
7997140	7998700	Thank you very much for your time.
7998700	8008300	So thanks for watching that video.
8008300	8011340	What I thought I would do, since that was the first time I'd
8011340	8014900	really presented the theory at all in public.
8014900	8018220	And I'd gotten somewhat turned around on my trip to England
8018220	8022020	and trying probably stupidly to do last minute corrections,
8022020	8024300	got me a bit confused in a few places,
8024300	8026180	and I wrote some things on the board I probably
8026180	8031020	shouldn't have, I thought I would try a partial explainer
8031020	8033780	for technically-oriented people so that they're not
8033780	8036540	mystified by the video.
8036540	8040100	And any errors here are my own.
8040100	8044140	I'm known to make many, so hopefully they
8044140	8046620	won't be too serious, but we'll find out.
8046620	8051100	So this is a supplementary explainer for the geometric unity
8051100	8054540	talk at Oxford that you just saw.
8054540	8057300	First of all, I think the most important thing to begin with
8057300	8060900	is to ask what new hard problems arise when you're
8060900	8063100	trying to think about a fundamental theory that
8063100	8066100	aren't found in any earlier theory.
8066100	8068500	Now, every time you have an effective theory, which
8068500	8072100	is a partial theory, there is always the idea
8072140	8076260	that you can have recourse to a lower-level strata.
8076260	8079460	So you don't have to explain, in some sense, everything
8079460	8082580	coming from very little or nothing.
8082580	8085740	I think that the really difficult issue that people
8085740	8089580	don't talk enough about is the problem of the fire that
8089580	8090580	lights itself.
8090580	8092380	And I think this was beautifully demonstrated
8092380	8095220	by M.C. Escher in his famous lithograph,
8095220	8100100	Drawing Hands, where he takes the idea of the canvas
8100100	8103580	or the paper as a given, but somehow he
8103580	8107860	imagines that the canvas could wheel into existence
8107860	8112100	the ink needed to draw the hands that move the pen
8112100	8114740	to draw the hands.
8114740	8118060	That concept is actually the super tricky part,
8118060	8120700	in my opinion, about going from effective theories
8120700	8123380	to any attempt at a fundamental theory.
8123380	8126460	So with that said, what I want to think about
8126500	8132300	is what antecedents does this concept have in physics?
8132300	8134020	And I find that there really aren't
8134020	8137020	any candidate theories of everything
8137020	8139140	or unified field theories that I can find
8139140	8144140	that plausibly give us an idea of how a canvas would
8144140	8148020	wheel an entire universe into being.
8148020	8151300	And so that really, to me, is the conceptual problem
8151300	8153860	that I think bedoubles this and makes
8153860	8155980	this step quite a bit more difficult
8155980	8159700	than some of the previous technical steps.
8159700	8161420	If you ask for antecedents, however,
8161420	8163580	there is one that, at least within physics,
8163580	8164900	is relatively famous.
8164900	8168180	And that is by John Archibald Wheeler.
8168180	8169860	And it is a picture, in some sense,
8169860	8172540	of the universe contemplating itself.
8172540	8175660	And so this idea that somehow the universe would contemplate
8175660	8179020	itself into existence, maybe the letter U
8179020	8182140	is, in some sense, analogous to the paper
8182180	8186060	and somehow the I, rather than the hand,
8186060	8189980	is drawn across to look at a different part of the U.
8189980	8192100	And whether or not that has meaning
8192100	8194340	is intrinsically always a question.
8194340	8196660	People are animated by it, but I don't know
8196660	8198820	that people have actually worked on it.
8198820	8201420	The quote of Einstein's, I think,
8201420	8204180	that really speaks to me often the most,
8204180	8206380	and maybe even was my thesis problem,
8206380	8211340	was he asked whether the creator had any choice
8211420	8213500	in how the universe was constructed.
8213500	8216780	And so I think if you believe that the canvas is itself,
8222420	8225860	that which generates all of the content
8225860	8229100	and all of the action, you're left with a puzzle
8229100	8231660	as to how would you move forward from this?
8231660	8235220	It might be easier, in a mathematical sense,
8235220	8238380	to temporarily put the U on its back,
8238380	8241660	to put it more in line with a standard picture
8241660	8243620	that many mathematicians and physicists
8243620	8244780	will be familiar with.
8247420	8252420	In sector one of the geometric unity theory,
8252700	8255740	space time is replaced and recovered
8255740	8259020	by the observers contemplating itself.
8259020	8261580	And so there are several sectors of GU,
8261580	8264620	and I wanted to go through at least four of them.
8265620	8270380	In Einstein's space time, we have not only four degrees
8270380	8272780	of freedom, but also a space time metric
8272780	8275580	representing rulers and protractors.
8275580	8278100	If we're going to replace that, it's very tricky
8278100	8279940	because it's almost impossible to think
8279940	8283500	about what would be underneath Einstein's theory.
8283500	8286220	Now there's a huge problem in the spinorial sector,
8286220	8288940	which I don't know why more people don't worry about,
8288940	8291220	which is that spinners aren't defined
8291260	8295860	for representations of the double cover of GL4R,
8295860	8300100	the general linear groups effective spin analog.
8300100	8302660	And as such, if we imagine that we will one day
8302660	8306300	quantize gravity, we will lose our definition,
8306300	8310220	not of the electrons, but let's say of the medium
8310220	8312100	in which the electrons operate.
8312100	8314940	That is, there will be no spinorial bundle
8314940	8317500	until we have an observation of a metric.
8317500	8322500	So one thing we can do is to take a manifold xd
8322820	8325860	as the starting point and see if we can create
8325860	8328140	an entire universe from no other data,
8328140	8329820	not even with a metric.
8329820	8333900	So since we don't choose a metric, what we instead do
8333900	8337740	is to work over the space of all possible point-wise metrics.
8337740	8339580	So not quite in the Feynman sense,
8339580	8344580	but in the sense that we will work over a bundle
8345060	8350060	that is of a quite a bit larger dimension.
8350060	8353660	So for example, if x was a four-dimensional,
8353660	8357060	therefore d equals four, then y in this case
8357060	8359780	would be d squared, which would be 16,
8359780	8362820	plus 3d, which would be 12, making 28,
8362820	8365220	divided by two, which would be 14.
8365220	8367700	So in other words, a four-dimensional universe,
8367700	8370500	or sorry, a four-dimensional proto-spacetime,
8370500	8373220	not a spacetime, but a proto-spacetime with no metric,
8373220	8375900	would give rise to a 14-dimensional
8378020	8380620	observer's portion called y.
8380620	8385220	Now I believe that in the lecture in Oxford,
8385220	8388140	I called that u, so I'm sorry for the confusion,
8388140	8389420	but of course this shifts around
8389420	8391300	every time I take it out of the garage,
8391300	8393740	and that's one of the problems with working on a theory
8393740	8395640	in solitude for many years.
8397660	8399540	So we have two separate spaces,
8399540	8401540	and we have fields on the two spaces.
8401540	8404220	Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer
8404220	8408340	to fields on the xd space by Hebrew letters.
8408340	8410500	So instead of g mu nu for a metric,
8410500	8415060	I just wrote gimel mem nun,
8415060	8418300	and the idea being that I want to separate Latin
8418300	8423300	and Greek fields on the y space from the rather rarer field
8424260	8426640	that actually live directly on x.
8426640	8428220	So this is a little bit confusing.
8428220	8430500	One way of thinking about it is to think
8430540	8435540	of the observer's as the stands plus the pitch in a stadium.
8437100	8439480	I think I may have said that in the lecture,
8439480	8443180	but this is what replaces the questions of where and when
8443180	8446700	in the newspaper's story that is a fundamental theory.
8446700	8448900	Where and when correspond to space and time?
8448900	8452860	Who and what correspond to bosons and fermions?
8452860	8456860	And how and why correspond to equations
8458080	8459700	and the Lagrangian that generates them?
8459740	8461980	So if you think about those six quantities,
8461980	8463740	you'll realize that that's really what the content
8463740	8465500	of a fundamental theory is assuming
8465500	8467100	that it can be quantized properly.
8468100	8470500	Most fields, and in this case,
8470500	8475500	we're going to call the collection of two tuples, omega.
8475620	8478860	So inside of omega, that will be in the first tuple,
8478860	8481580	we'll have epsilon and pi written,
8481580	8483900	sort of a non-traditional variation
8483900	8486100	of how we write this symbol for pi.
8486140	8491140	In the second tuple, we'll have the letters new and zeta,
8491180	8492520	and I would like them not to move
8492520	8495620	because they honor particular people who are important.
8495620	8497820	So most fields, in this case, omega,
8498940	8501700	are dancing on y, which was called u
8501700	8503300	in the lecture, unfortunately.
8503300	8505820	But they're observed via pullback
8505820	8507140	as if they lived on x.
8507140	8508740	In other words, if you're sitting in the stands,
8508740	8511700	you might feel that you're actually literally on the pitch,
8511700	8513220	even though that's not true.
8513220	8515980	So what we've done is we've taken the u of Wheeler,
8515980	8519220	we've put it on its back, and created a w structure.
8519220	8521060	And the w structure is meant to say
8521060	8523100	that there's a bundle on top of a bundle.
8523100	8526620	Again, geometric unity is more flexible than this,
8526620	8529260	but I wanted to make the most concrete approach
8529260	8531880	to this possible for at least this introduction.
8533100	8537220	And sometimes we don't need to state
8537220	8539900	that y would in fact be a bundle.
8539900	8543340	You could be an immersion of x into any old manifold,
8543340	8545780	but I'd like to go with the most ambitious version
8545780	8547500	of gu first.
8547500	8550820	So the two projection maps are pi two and pi one.
8550820	8553860	And what we're going to say up top is that we're gonna have
8554940	8559940	a symbol z and an action of a group row on z,
8561460	8564180	standing in for any bundle associated
8564180	8566460	to the principal bundle, which is generated
8566460	8570140	as the unitary bundle of the spinners
8570140	8573300	on the chimeric tangent bundle to y.
8573300	8574380	That's a bit of a mouthful,
8574380	8578100	but the key issue was that on the manifold y,
8578100	8579740	there happens to be a bundle,
8579740	8582580	which is isomorphic non-canonically
8582580	8584420	to the tangent bundle of y,
8584420	8588820	which has a definite and canonical metric.
8588820	8592260	And in fact, that carries the spinners.
8592260	8594220	So this is the way in which we get spinners
8594220	8596300	without ever having to choose a metric,
8596300	8598020	but we pick up some technical debt
8598020	8600220	to use the computer science concept
8600220	8603460	by actually having to now work on two different spaces,
8603460	8606900	x and y, and we're not merely working on x anymore.
8610100	8611940	This leads to the mark of Zorro.
8611940	8614460	That is, we know that whenever we have a metric
8614460	8616780	by the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry,
8616780	8618180	we always get a connection.
8618180	8621100	It happens, however, that what is missing
8621100	8625820	to turn the canonical chimeric bundle on y
8625820	8628180	into the tangent bundle of y,
8628180	8631460	is in fact a connection on the space x.
8631460	8634500	So there is one way in which we've reversed
8634500	8636500	the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry,
8636500	8639660	where a connection on x leads to a metric on y.
8639660	8642980	So if we do the full transmission mechanism out,
8642980	8645740	Gimel on x leads to alpha sub-Gimel
8645740	8649260	for the Levy-Civita connection on x.
8649260	8654260	Alpha sub-Gimel leads to G sub-alpha, which is,
8654900	8659900	sorry, G sub-alpha, I'm not used to using Hebrew in math,
8662420	8667420	so G sub-alpha then is a metric on y
8668500	8672340	and that creates a Levy-Civita connection
8672340	8674860	of the metric on the space y as well,
8674860	8677860	which then induces one on the spinorial bundles.
8679140	8683420	In sector two, the inhomogeneous gauge group on y
8683420	8685620	replaces the Poincare group
8685620	8689260	and the internal symmetries that are found on x.
8689260	8691740	And in fact, you use a fermionic extension
8691740	8693700	of the inhomogeneous gauge group
8693700	8696220	to replace the supersymmetric Poincare group.
8696220	8698580	And that would be, with the field content,
8698580	8702700	zero forms tensored with spinors
8702700	8705740	directs some one forms tensored with spinors
8705740	8709640	all up on y as the fermionic field content.
8710540	8713060	So that gets rid of the biggest problem
8713060	8715180	because the internal symmetry group
8715180	8717180	is what causes the failure, I think,
8717180	8720100	of supersymmetric particles to be seen in nature,
8720100	8723060	which is we have two different origin stories,
8723060	8727340	which is a little bit like Lilith and Genesis.
8728540	8731580	We can't easily say we have a unified theory
8731580	8735980	if spacetime and the SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 group
8735980	8738580	that lives on spacetime have different origins
8738580	8739860	and cannot be related.
8739860	8742020	In this situation, we tie our hands
8742020	8745500	and we have no choice over the group content.
8746500	8748700	So just to fix bundle notation,
8748700	8753420	we let H be the structure group of a bundle,
8753420	8755940	P sub H over a base space B.
8755940	8759340	We use pi for the projection map.
8759340	8764340	We've reserved the variation in the pi orthography
8764340	8766420	for the field content,
8766420	8768780	and we try to use right principle actions.
8768780	8771580	I'm terrible with left and right, but we do our best.
8772820	8774860	We use H here, not G,
8774860	8778900	because we wanna reserve G for the inhomogeneous extension
8778900	8781500	of H once we move to function spaces.
8783060	8784460	So with function spaces,
8784460	8788460	we can take the bundle of groups
8788460	8792740	using the adjoint action of H on itself
8792740	8794780	and form the associated bundle
8794780	8797580	and then move to C infinity sections
8797580	8801700	to get the so-called gauge group of automorphisms.
8801740	8805180	We have a space of connections, typically denoted by A,
8805180	8809140	and we're going to promote omega one
8809140	8814140	tensored in the adjoint bundle to notation of script N
8815980	8817380	as the affine group,
8817380	8822380	which acts directly on the space of connections.
8827580	8829580	Now, the inhomogeneous gauge group
8829580	8832020	is formed as the semi-direct product
8832020	8835020	of the gauge group of automorphisms together
8835020	8837780	with the affine group of translations
8837780	8840140	of the space of connections.
8840140	8843580	And you can see here is a version
8843580	8845420	of an explicit group multiplication rule.
8845420	8846820	I hope I got that one right.
8847820	8849860	And then we have an action of G
8849860	8851700	that is the inhomogeneous gauge group
8851700	8853140	on the space of connections
8853140	8856500	because we have two different ways to act on connections.
8856500	8859300	We can either act by gauge transformations
8859300	8861700	or we can act by affine translations.
8861700	8864660	So putting them together gives us something
8864660	8866660	for the inhomogeneous gauge group to do.
8867780	8869660	We then get a by connection.
8869660	8871500	In other words, because we have two different ways
8871500	8873260	of pushing a connection around,
8873260	8875620	if we have a choice of a base connection,
8875620	8877940	we can push the base connection around
8877940	8880660	in two different ways according to the portion of it
8880660	8885660	that is coming from the gauge transformations, curly H,
8886060	8889700	or the affine translations coming from curly N.
8892060	8895540	We can call this map the by connection,
8895540	8898860	which gives us two separate connections
8898860	8901820	for any point in the inhomogeneous gauge group.
8901820	8905260	And we can notice that it can be viewed
8906380	8911380	as a section of a bundle over the base space to come
8912260	8915100	when we find an interesting embedding of the gauge group
8915100	8918300	that is not the standard one in the inhomogeneous gauge group.
8919300	8922100	So our summary diagram looks something like this.
8923460	8925500	Take a look at the tau sub A naught.
8925500	8928820	We will find a homomorphism of the gauge group
8928820	8930620	into its inhomogeneous extension
8930620	8933860	that isn't simply inclusion under the first factor.
8937300	8939740	And I'm realizing that I have the wrong pi
8940740	8945300	that should just be a simple pi projecting down.
8945300	8948060	We have a map from the inhomogeneous gauge group
8949300	8952100	via the by connection to A cross A,
8952100	8953580	connections cross connections,
8953580	8956420	and that that behaves well according
8956420	8958180	to the difference operator delta
8958180	8959900	that takes the difference of two connections
8959900	8961920	and gives an honest ad-valued one form.
8962980	8963820	Okay.
8963820	8968300	The infinitesimal action of a gauge transformation
8968340	8969860	or at least an infinitesimal one
8969860	8972220	on a point inside of the group
8972220	8976540	is given by a somewhat almost familiar expression
8976540	8979700	which should remind us of how the first term
8979700	8981860	in the gauge deformation complex
8983380	8986860	for self-dual Yang-Mills actually gets started.
8986860	8991860	And so by acting via this interesting embedding
8993700	8997920	of the inhomogeneous gauge group on, sorry,
8997920	8999720	the embedding of the gauge group
8999720	9001760	inside its inhomogeneous extension,
9001760	9003200	but the non-trivial one,
9003200	9006560	we get something very close to the original first step
9006560	9009400	of the two-step deformation complex.
9009400	9010960	Now, in sector three,
9011800	9013880	there are payoffs to the magic beans trade.
9013880	9017520	The big issue here is that we've foregone the privilege
9017520	9020800	of being able to choose and dial in our own field content
9020800	9023320	and we've decided to remain restricted
9023320	9025960	to anything we can generate only from XD,
9025960	9027560	in this case, X4.
9027560	9031320	So we generated Y14 from X4
9031320	9034280	and then we generated chimeric tangent bundles
9034280	9035320	on top of that.
9035320	9038720	We built spinners off of the chimeric tangent bundle
9038720	9041240	and we have not made any other choices.
9041240	9044120	So we're dealing with, I think it's U128,
9046520	9048040	U2 to the seventh.
9049480	9052320	That is our structure group
9052320	9056520	and it's fixed by the choice of X4,
9056560	9057800	not anything else.
9058680	9059960	So what do we get?
9059960	9064080	Well, as promised, there is a tilted homomorphism
9064080	9068680	which takes the gauge group into its inhomogeneous extension.
9068680	9071120	It acts as inclusion on the first factor
9071120	9073160	but it uses the Levy-Tevita connection
9073160	9076680	to create a second sort of more cartan form.
9076680	9078800	I hope I remember the terminology right.
9078800	9079840	It's been a long time.
9081320	9083120	The map is injective because it's injective
9083120	9084280	under the first factor,
9084320	9087160	but it actually gives us a non-trivial embedding
9087160	9091080	of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous extension
9091080	9093360	which makes the whole theory work.
9094480	9096720	We then get to Shiav operators.
9096720	9099960	Now, a Shiav operator is a map
9099960	9103720	from the group across the ad-valued I-forms.
9103720	9106080	In this case, the particular Shiav operators
9106080	9108960	we're interested in is mapping I-forms
9108960	9112680	to D minus three plus I-forms.
9112720	9116080	So for example, you would map a two-form
9117080	9122080	to D minus three plus I.
9122120	9127120	So if D, for example, were 14,
9127320	9131920	then an I were equal to two,
9131920	9135800	then 14 minus three is equal to 11,
9137080	9139560	plus two is equal to 13.
9139560	9144560	So that would be an ad-valued 14 minus one form,
9146240	9148400	which is exactly the right place
9148400	9151120	for something to form a current
9151120	9154420	that is the differential of a Lagrangian on the space.
9157680	9159080	Now, the augmented torsion.
9159080	9160880	The torsion is a very strange object.
9160880	9162860	It's introduced sort of right at the beginning
9162860	9165880	of learning differential geometry,
9165880	9167320	but it really doesn't get used very much.
9167320	9169600	One of the reasons it doesn't get used in gauge theory
9169600	9171360	is that it's not gauge invariant.
9171360	9173080	It has a gauge invariant piece to it,
9173080	9176160	but then a piece that spoils the gauge invariant.
9176160	9177920	But because we have two connections,
9177920	9182720	one of the ideas was to introduce two diseases
9182720	9184080	and then to take a difference.
9184080	9186560	And as long as the disease is the same in both,
9187760	9189880	the difference will not have the disease
9189880	9191800	because both diseases are included,
9191800	9193920	but with a minus sign between them.
9193920	9197440	So the augmented torsion is relatively well-behaved
9197440	9202440	relative to this particular slanted or tilted embedding
9202440	9205760	of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous extension,
9207360	9208520	which this is very nice
9208520	9212240	because now we actually have a use for the torsion.
9212240	9214640	We have an understanding of why it may never have figured,
9214640	9215960	particularly into geometry,
9215960	9217760	is that you need two of two connections
9217760	9220840	rather than one to see the advantages of torsion at all.
9220840	9225840	So here's an example of one ship and a bottle operator.
9226560	9228080	I think this would be sort of analogous
9228080	9232400	if I'm not mistaken to trying to take the Ricci curvature
9232400	9236120	from the entire Riemann curvature.
9236120	9237680	But if you think about what Einstein did,
9237680	9239960	Einstein had to go further
9239960	9243480	and reduce the Ricci curvature to the scalar curvature
9243480	9247400	and then sort of dial the components of the traceless Ricci
9247400	9250760	and the scalar curvature to get the right proportions.
9250760	9253760	So there are many Schiave operators
9253760	9256960	and you have to be very careful about which one you want.
9256960	9259400	And once you know exactly what it is you're trying to hit,
9259400	9262520	you can choose the Schiave operator to be bespoke
9263480	9266560	and get the contractions that you need.
9269200	9272600	Now, I've made you guys sit through a lot.
9272600	9275640	So I wanted to give you sort of humorously
9275640	9280640	a feeling of positivity for the exhaustion.
9281200	9283600	So the years of anxious searching in the dark
9283600	9285360	with their intense longing,
9285360	9287800	their intense alternations of confidence and exhaustion
9287800	9289720	and the final emergence into the light,
9289720	9292840	only those who have experienced it can understand it.
9292840	9294480	I've just always thought this was like
9294480	9296280	the most sensitive and beautiful quote
9296280	9299560	and I wish it were one of his better known quotes,
9299560	9303720	but I think it's so singular that it's hard to feel
9303720	9305320	what it was that he was talking about
9305320	9308520	because in fact, he sort of explains this in the last line.
9309520	9311680	So given that you've been on a long journey,
9311680	9315840	here is something of what geometric unity equations
9315840	9317160	might look like.
9317160	9320440	So in the first place, you have the swerved curvature,
9320440	9323160	the Schiave applied to the curvature tensor.
9323160	9326240	That in general does not work out to be exact.
9326240	9330280	So you can't have it as the differential of a Lagrangian.
9330280	9335280	And in fact, we talk about swirls, swerves, twirls, eddies,
9336160	9338720	there has to be a quadratic eddy tensor
9338720	9341680	that I occasionally forget when I pull this thing
9341680	9343040	out of moth balls.
9343040	9345360	And the two of those together make up
9345360	9347680	what I call the total swerved curvature.
9347680	9349440	And on the other side of the equation,
9349440	9351720	you have the displaced torsion,
9351720	9353520	which I've called the dysplasian.
9354560	9357160	And to get rid of the pesky sort of minus sign
9357160	9358800	and hodge star operator,
9360160	9363240	this would be the replacement for the Einstein equation,
9363240	9366200	not on x where we would perceive it,
9366200	9371200	but on y before being pulled back onto the manifold x.
9371960	9375400	So a condensation of that would be very simple.
9375400	9377840	In simplest terms, we would be saying
9377840	9381520	that the swerved curvature is equal to the dysplasian.
9381520	9384280	And at least in this sector of the four main equations
9384280	9385920	of theoretical physics,
9385920	9388280	this would be the replacement for the Einstein equations,
9388280	9391120	again on y before being pulled back to x.
9392040	9396640	Next is the sketch of the fermionic field content.
9397640	9400000	I'm not sure whether that should have been sector four,
9400000	9402320	sector three, but it's gonna be very brief.
9402320	9405560	I showed some pictures during the lecture
9405560	9407360	and I'm not gonna go back through them,
9407360	9409280	but I wanted to just give you an idea
9409280	9412640	of where this mysterious third generation,
9412640	9413880	I think, comes from.
9415160	9420160	So if we review the three identities here,
9420960	9424160	we see that if we have a space V,
9424160	9425880	thought of like as a tangent bundle,
9425880	9428440	and then you have spinners built on the tangent bundle.
9428440	9430840	When you product, tensor product,
9430840	9434240	the tangent bundle with its own spinners,
9434240	9435960	it breaks up into two pieces.
9435960	9439440	One piece is the so-called cartin product,
9439440	9441640	which is sort of the sum of the highest weights.
9441640	9445120	And the other is a second copy of the spinners
9445120	9447640	gotten through the Clifford contraction.
9447640	9449040	So that's well known.
9449040	9452040	But now what I think fewer people know,
9452040	9454760	many people know that the spinners
9454760	9456720	have a sort of an exponential property.
9456720	9459440	That is the spinners of a direct sum
9459440	9462280	are the tensor product of the spinners
9462280	9465120	of the two summands of the direct sum.
9465120	9468480	So that's a very nice sort of version of an exponential.
9468480	9470040	An exponential would take a sum
9470040	9471440	and turn it into a product.
9472440	9474960	What happens when you're trying to think
9474960	9479960	about a tangent space in Y is being broken up
9480320	9483880	into a tangent space along an immersed X
9483880	9485480	together with its normal bundle.
9485480	9489280	So imagine that X and Y are the tangent space to X
9489280	9491520	and a normal bundle.
9491520	9494040	So the Rarita-Schwinger piece,
9494040	9496520	that is the spin three halves piece,
9496520	9501520	has a funny kind of an almost exponential property.
9501520	9505080	That is the Rarita-Schwinger content
9505080	9507480	of a direct sum of vector spaces
9507480	9512360	is equal to the Rarita-Schwinger of the first tensor
9512360	9514680	producted with the ordinary spinners in the second,
9514680	9517520	direct sum with the ordinary spinners in the first,
9517520	9522160	tensor producted with the Rarita-Schwinger content
9522160	9523680	of the second sum and.
9523680	9526360	But then there's this extra interesting term,
9526360	9530320	which is the spinners on the first sum and tensor
9530320	9532920	producted with the spinners on the second sum and.
9532920	9537120	Now recalling that when I started my career,
9537120	9539000	we did not know that neutrinos were massive
9539000	9541520	and I figured that they probably had to be massive
9541520	9544880	because I desperately wanted a 16 dimensional space
9544880	9546880	of internal quantum numbers, not 15,
9546880	9550760	because my ideas only work if the space
9550760	9553600	of internal quantum numbers is of dimension two to the N
9553600	9556360	and one of my favorite equations at the time
9556360	9558960	was 15 equals two to the fourth.
9559000	9561240	Not literally true, but almost true.
9561240	9564160	And thankfully in the late 1990s,
9564160	9568280	the case for 16 particles in a generation
9568280	9571440	was strengthened when neutrinos were found to have mass.
9571440	9577440	But that remaining term in the southeast corner,
9577440	9580560	the spinners on X, tensor spinners on Y,
9580560	9585560	looks like the term above it in line 2.15.
9586560	9590560	And that in fact is the third generation of matter
9590560	9595560	in my opinion, that is it is not a true generation.
9596280	9599720	It is broken off and would unify very differently
9599720	9601600	if we were able to heat the universe
9601600	9602840	to the proper temperature.
9604240	9607400	So starting to sum up, this is not the full theory.
9607400	9610880	I'm just presenting this in part to dip my toe back
9610880	9611720	into the water.
9611720	9614280	It's a daunting task to try to address people
9614280	9616160	about something you've been thinking about for a long time
9616160	9619840	and have no idea whether it's even remotely correct.
9619840	9622000	This is the Einsteinian replacement
9622000	9623560	and it must be pulled back to X.
9623560	9624560	That's the first thing.
9624560	9627800	The Yang-Mills Maxwell piece comes from a direct square
9627800	9629040	of the Einstein replacement.
9629040	9631880	That is, I don't believe that we're really looking
9631880	9633360	for a unifying equation.
9633360	9636440	I think we're looking for a unifying direct square.
9636440	9638040	Dirac famously took the square root
9638040	9639920	of the Klein-Gordon equation
9639920	9643280	and he gave us the Dirac equation.
9643280	9646560	And in fact, I believe that the Dirac equation
9646560	9650360	and the Einstein equation are to be augmented
9650360	9654760	and fit into the square root part of a Dirac square.
9654760	9657680	And I believe that the Yang-Mills content
9657680	9661920	and Higgs version of the Klein-Gordon equation
9661920	9665480	would go in the square part of the Dirac square.
9665480	9668800	So two of these equations unify differently than two others
9668880	9672160	and the two pairs are unified
9672160	9674080	in the content of a Dirac square.
9676840	9679520	The Dirac piece will be done separately elsewhere
9679520	9680960	when we get around to it
9681920	9684600	and contains the Ririta-Schwinger field content
9684600	9686240	which is fundamental and new.
9687360	9689600	There are only two generations in this model.
9689600	9693000	I think people have accepted that there are three
9693000	9694280	but I don't believe that there are three.
9694280	9695120	I think that there are two
9695120	9696520	and that the third unifies
9696640	9698880	other matter at higher energies.
9698880	9701080	The Cortic-Higgs piece comes
9701080	9703280	from the Dirac squaring of a quadratic.
9703280	9705560	Remember, there's an eddy tensor
9705560	9708920	which is quadratic in the augmented torsion.
9708920	9711800	The metric does multiple duties here
9711800	9716040	is it's the main field in this version of GU
9716040	9718120	with the sort of strongest assumptions
9718120	9721760	as field content that is originally on X
9722920	9725760	where as most of the rest of the field content is on Y
9725760	9727840	but it also acts as the observer
9727840	9730120	pulling back the full content of Y
9731640	9735920	onto X to be interpreted as if it came from X all along
9735920	9738880	generating the sort of illusion
9738880	9740680	of internal quantum numbers.
9740680	9742840	And I should say that the Petit-Salem theory
9742840	9746480	which is usually advertised as I think SU4
9746480	9748560	cross SU2 cross SU2
9748560	9752000	is really much more naturally spin six cross spin four
9752840	9757840	when the trace portion of the space of metrics
9757840	9759760	is put in with the proper sign
9759760	9762360	if you're trying to generate the sector
9762360	9765160	that begins as X1 comma three.
9765160	9769000	Remember, XD where D equals four
9770080	9772240	is the generic situation
9772240	9773760	but you have all these different sectors.
9773760	9775080	I believe that these sectors
9775080	9777840	probably exist if this model is correct
9777840	9779760	but we are trapped in the one three sector
9779760	9781840	so you have to figure out what the implications are
9781840	9785080	for pushing that indefinite signature up
9785080	9788400	into an indefinite signature on the Y manifold
9788400	9791680	and there are signatures that make it look
9791680	9794640	like the Petit-Salem rather than directly
9794640	9797780	in the spin 10 SU5 line of thinking.
9798880	9802120	So we will attempt to present the full theory shortly
9802120	9804400	and shortly keep in mind this took seven years
9804400	9808120	to just bring me to want to come back to this
9808120	9810720	but it must be reassembled from decades of notes
9810720	9813080	and that's part of the problem when you're working alone
9813080	9816280	and you're not really expecting to talk to anybody.
9816280	9819480	So I want to thank you for your patience and your time
9819480	9820760	and I just want to read a bunch of names
9820760	9822080	of people who mattered to me
9822080	9824680	and if I've done anything wrong,
9824680	9826400	this is not no reflection on them.

9859320	9862480	Errors and omissions because I have too many people to thank
9862480	9866680	are all my own as for the claims
9866760	9870600	that should reflect badly on no one else other than myself.
9870600	9872640	And most especially, I just want to say
9872640	9875360	that I've asked a tremendous amount from my family
9875360	9878680	to stick with me on this quixotic quest.
9879680	9880960	And I want to thank Pia Milani,
9880960	9883200	Nyla Weinstein and Zev Weinstein.
9883200	9884440	I love you all very much
9884440	9886440	and thank you for making this possible.
9888160	9890360	I do want to leave you with one thought.
9890360	9893440	I really think that we've gotten completely bent out of shape
9893440	9897880	about trying to formalize and routinize science
9897880	9899160	and it doesn't work.
9899160	9902040	You cannot mandate science as social engineering.
9902040	9904640	You can't decide that science is always
9904640	9907160	in the zeitgeist and done by committee.
9907160	9910040	In fact, it is essential to understand
9910040	9912880	that science will not conform to what you want.
9912880	9915240	One of the things that I'm very proud of
9915240	9916640	and I think is quite true
9918080	9920680	is the saying that great science
9920960	9925440	has the scientific method as it's radio edit.
9925440	9927280	I don't think that great science
9927280	9929240	is actually done the way we say it's done.
9929240	9933080	And I think that directs 1963 Scientific American article
9933080	9936280	should be read by absolutely everyone.
9936280	9938720	Every time major theories have come out,
9938720	9940800	they've almost always been wrong,
9941760	9944040	but they're not wrong in an important way.
9944040	9947120	And I think that we have to fix the political economy
9947120	9949960	of people racing to correct theories
9949960	9953320	or point out that there's no agreement with the experiment.
9954240	9956840	We are killing many of our best ideas
9956840	9960320	by creating a terrible and combative environment
9960320	9962920	which already attempts to apportion credit
9962920	9966200	for work and more importantly risk
9967480	9969840	undertaken by individuals.
9969840	9974240	And I just think that I want people to understand
9974240	9976720	that I've always wanted to share this,
9976720	9981560	but I detest the culture that I saw that cropped up
9981560	9982960	around what has now become known
9982960	9985280	as the cyber-witten equations.
9985280	9986640	When they were put forward,
9986640	9989840	there was a period of time where I watched people
9989840	9992000	as if it a feeding trough,
9992000	9993480	trying to stay up around the clock
9993480	9996640	to use a new machine tool that had been given to them
9996640	9998680	to claim credit.
9998680	10002240	And it profoundly pushed me away from the community.
10003640	10005320	We have to become more ethical
10005320	10007440	and we have to honor the people
10007440	10011280	who are trying to speak and act imaginatively.
10011280	10014040	Now, if this doesn't work, if it's silly,
10014040	10017480	I'll have egg on my face and I'll go on, I'll be fine.
10017480	10021880	But I'm very worried that maybe some of the best ideas
10021880	10025440	are between the ears of people without the confidence
10025440	10030440	in the Hutzpah and just the sort of almost psychotic drive
10031040	10033640	to push things across the finishing line.
10033640	10036600	We've got to be kinder and nicer and more decent
10036600	10039360	and stop stealing people's lives, their credit,
10039360	10042640	their future and their ability to have families
10042640	10045880	and make a living and that's absolutely essential to me.
10045880	10048880	And I look forward to finding out whether this theory
10048880	10051520	has merit to it or is without merit,
10051520	10054160	but I guarantee that if I'm going to go down with the ship,
10054160	10056520	I'm also not going to be knocked off the ship
10056520	10060080	as I was many years ago, completely unfairly.
10060080	10061560	And I won't dwell on it,
10061560	10064600	but the amount of power you professors have
10064600	10068840	is absolutely almost without parallel
10068840	10070680	because nobody really understands enough
10070680	10073540	to adjudicate disputes that happen in academics.
10073540	10077120	I'm going to insist that we fund you better
10077120	10081480	and that you are nicer to the people who depend upon you
10081480	10083480	in this beautiful chain that we call
10085160	10088880	science, scientific method and most particularly
10088920	10091120	American science, which I think is still
10091120	10092600	the envy of the world.
10092600	10094160	So you've been through the portal.
10094160	10095520	I know it was a long slog.
10095520	10097640	I hope you found it interesting and enjoyable
10097640	10099680	and we'll see you again soon.
10099680	10101240	Be well everybody, stay safe.
