00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host Eric Weinstein and I think that

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,560
today's must be the most unusual episode yet of a podcast that has been

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,040
marked by almost regular unusual episodes. Now this is the first podcast that

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm recording at home. I don't really have a home recording studio so we're

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,840
really doing this from chicken wire and masking tape. But I am sheltering in

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,440
place because of the worldwide COVID pandemic and what we've been asked by

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,720
the state of California and by the federal government is to shelter in

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,560
place for an upcoming month because today is April 1st. Now during a pandemic I

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,160
can assure you that no one is interested in April Fool's jokes. So the question is

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,560
what to do with the April Fool's tradition in a situation in which nobody

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,880
wants a prank. I thought that this was probably the best time to launch an idea

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,640
that I've been playing with for years and that idea is that it is dangerous to

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,520
have a world in which we are afraid to talk about what we think is true. When I

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
think about what happened during the beginning of the COVID pandemic I find

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,200
that we were in general intimidated from sharing our fears about the virus. We

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,040
were told that if we wore masks that we were acting in a peculiar fashion. If we

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,480
refused to shake hands that we were behaving in a strange and unpleasant

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,040
social way. We did not want to be alarmist. We did not want to be seen as

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,640
chicken little and in fact it was extremely important that we not be seen

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,160
as xenophobic given that the outbreak was originating in Wuhan China. In fact

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,080
perhaps the most dangerous idea was that this outbreak might have been

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,120
connected to some research being done in a lab perhaps a bio weapons lab. We

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,680
really don't know where this epidemic began. What is the etiology of something

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,480
that is causing the entire world economy to effectively shut down? What I

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,280
believe is that that silence has been deadly. We have many people who have now

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,360
lost their lives because we did not feel free to exchange ideas to think and to

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,360
talk and in fact many of the people who warned us first were the freest members

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,640
of society having been previously cancelled by standard mainstream

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,400
institutions and their associated media. So what I thought would be important

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,480
for in April Fool's Day that no one wants to actually participate in was to deal

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,720
with an idea that maybe one day a year we should all be free to share crazy

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,240
ideas that are going around between our ears and in our head. We're having

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,120
conversations with ourselves wondering is anyone else seeing the same thing that

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm seeing. But we are too afraid because the social stigma for actually

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,200
believing in things that maybe things are possible or perhaps there's a

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,200
conspiracy somewhere. Perhaps we are ill-prepared. For example, I believe that

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,160
our current pandemic is exacerbated because our government and our readiness

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,600
is ours failed to stock adequate supplies and that these supplies were

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,200
called for in the academic literature for years. There was absolutely no excuse

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,080
not to have personal protective equipment stocked for doctors and

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,920
nurses and hospitals to say nothing of all of the people who were in the front

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,680
lines of treating patients sick with COVID. Now currently I don't believe that

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
you can trust the World Health Organization. Absolutely not. I don't think

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,880
you can trust the Surgeon General of the United States and I absolutely don't

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,040
think you can trust the CDC because they are all covering for our inadequacy. This

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,520
was a problem that we always knew was coming and we at one point had stocks

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,040
which apparently were depleted under a previous administration and not restocked

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,120
under this administration. In fact, our fear of dealing with a pervasive

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,480
institutional incompetence has blinded us to the degradation in our society

50
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,560
across all major institutions. As I've discussed before on the program, I believe

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,920
that this has a singular etiology. That is, that because of embedded growth

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,840
obligations coming from the previous era of unsustainable post-war growth from

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,160
about 1945 to 1971-73 something like that, we built in expectations to our

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,160
system that cannot currently be met. We will not have technology that follows

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,840
the same breakneck pace of innovation. As a result, we have a system whereby the

56
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,360
heads of our organizations are forced to cover for their inadequacies because

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,560
growth is built into the system that cannot be sustained. Therefore, there is

58
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,160
not the funding, the manpower, there is not the wherewithal to continue many of

59
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,920
our programs because we do not actually have the ability to continue to simply

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,760
grow our way out, at least so far. So what's today's program about? Well, I

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,120
thought that what I would do is to let go of something that I've been keeping

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:10,600
pretty close for, I think, about 37 years. When I was around 19, I started, it's hard

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,160
to talk about, when I was around 18 or 19, I was at the University of Pennsylvania

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,560
and I thought I saw a glimmer of hope. I thought I saw that some new equations

65
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,440
that were being played with might actually provide a solution to some of the

66
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,680
problems that had bedeviled Einstein and others for years in the quest for a

67
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,440
unified field theory. Now, it's an embarrassing thing to say that one is a

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,280
unified field theorist. It is effectively equivalent to saying I'm interested in

69
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,600
perpetual motion machines or that I have a private cure for cancer that I'm

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,240
trying on rabbits in my backyard. However, I actually think that it's

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,960
important to fess up because that's exactly what this is. Now, in my situation,

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,320
I have an extremely unusual history and I really don't want to get bogged down in

73
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,440
all of the things that happened while I was a student trying to develop this

74
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,240
theory because it is not a particularly happy story. I believe that this theory

75
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,760
is an incredibly joyous one. Now, in this situation, I want to talk about what it

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,520
means to have a theory of everything. We've never seen one and in fact, not

77
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,840
only have we never seen a theory of everything, we've never even seen, I

78
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,000
believe, a candidate for a theory of everything. And because a theory of

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,360
everything would have to have different characteristics than I believe every

80
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,520
theory that has gone before, we don't think enough about what the difference is

81
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,880
between what we would normally call in physics an effective theory and a

82
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,200
fundamental one. Now, if you're familiar with the M.C. Escher drawing called

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,760
Drawing Hands, it is a lithograph of two hands apparently drawing each other

84
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,480
into existence on some kind of a canvas or piece of paper. That is sometimes

85
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,320
referred to as a strange loop. But it, in fact, is an attempt to answer the

86
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,560
question, what is the fire that lights itself? This is the problem that

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,680
bedevils us when we search for a unified theory that doesn't bedevil us, in my

88
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,600
opinion, in any previous effective theory. Now, why is that? Well, many people

89
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,000
confuse a theory of everything as if they imagine that it's a theory in which

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,680
you can compute every eventuality. And it is absolutely not that because the

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,320
computational power is very different than the question of whether or not the

92
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,600
rules are effectively given. I've analogized it to a game of chess and

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,040
knowing all of the rules is equivalent to a theory of everything. Knowing how to

94
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,240
play chess well is an entirely different question. But in the case of a theory of

95
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,080
everything, or a unified field theory, if you will, many people also take it to

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,120
be an answer to the question, why is there something rather than nothing? And I

97
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,400
don't think that this is, in fact, what a theory of everything is meant to be

98
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,000
either. Now, why is that? Well, because I believe at some level it is impossible for

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,800
most of us to imagine an airtight argument, mathematically speaking, which

100
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,360
coaxes out of an absolute void a something. However, there's a different

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,080
question which I think might actually animate us and which is the right

102
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,800
question to ask of a potential candidate. And that is, how does one get

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,120
everything from almost nothing? In the MC Escher drawing or lithograph, hands

104
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,320
drawing hands or drawing hands, what we see is that the paper is presupposed.

105
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,000
That is, if you could imagine a theory of everything, it would be like saying, if I

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,320
posit the paper, can the paper will the ink into being such that the ink gives

107
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,480
rise to the pens and the pens draw the hands, which in fact, manipulate the

108
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,480
pens to use the ink. That kind of a problem is one which is of a very

109
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,960
different character than everything that has gone before. It is also, in my

110
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,520
opinion, an explanation of why the physics community has been stalled for

111
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,040
nearly 50 years since around 1973, when the standard model was intellectually

112
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,840
in place. Now, consider this. We have never had in modern times a drought where no

113
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,280
person working in pure fundamental theory has taken a trip to Stockholm just as a

114
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,760
rough indicator for contributing to the standard model. No one, in my opinion,

115
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,200
since let's see, Frank Wilczek, who was born in 1951, no one born after that

116
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,400
time has in fact contributed to the standard model in a clear and profound

117
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,720
way. That is not to say that no work has been done, but for the most part, the

118
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,680
current generation of physicists has for more than 40 years and almost 50 years

119
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,160
remain stagnant within the standard paradigm of physics, which is positing

120
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,040
theories that are then verified by experiment. Now, my belief, which is

121
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,920
relatively radical, is that there is no way to get to our final destination

122
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,560
using the tools that have gotten us to where we are now. In other words, what

123
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,800
got you here cannot get you there. And in particular, one of the biggest

124
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,480
problems we have is the political economy of science. We have effectively

125
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,280
starved our scientific enterprise for resources, creating a dire and cutthroat

126
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,400
competition, which has completely deranged the scientific tradition. And so one

127
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,600
of the things that's going to happen in this lecture is that I'm simply going

128
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,640
to announce that I have broken and have broken for many years with just about

129
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,440
every expectation of standard science. That is not to say that the equations or

130
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,160
the style of presentation is going to be foreign, quite the contrary. I have every

131
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,840
intention of writing up some results in standard terminology wherever possible

132
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,200
using popular mathematical type setting programs, but it goes far deeper than

133
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,400
this. My belief is that what we've created is a career structure, a journal

134
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,920
structure, an employment structure, an access structure that cannot possibly

135
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:30,160
complete the job. And why is that? Well, what if in the last leg, in fact, we had

136
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,960
a situation by which an attempt at the fundamental theory would result almost

137
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,680
certainly in career suicide? Now, if you think of that as an explanation, you would

138
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,760
realize that it has the power to synchronize failure across many seemingly

139
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,720
independent experiments. And I believe that that's exactly what's been going on

140
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,000
through the so-called string theory revolutions one, two, and perhaps three.

141
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,440
Now, in that case, what happened was a theory became fixed in the minds of really

142
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,960
the baby boom generation of physicists because it allowed for infinite

143
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,840
elaboration within a mathematical or, more particularly, a geometric context.

144
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,680
And those supposed physicists spent their time submitting papers to what's called

145
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,920
the high energy section of the so-called preprint archive. But in fact, most of

146
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,400
these papers have nothing to do with high energy physics whatsoever. And if you're

147
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,000
looking for the designation, it's HEPTH, high energy physics-theory. Now, if you

148
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
look through those papers, they don't seem to have much to do with particles.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,280
They don't seem to have to do with forces and spacetime. They seem to have to do

150
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,320
with very strange and obscure mathematical issues. And in the years since the

151
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,400
string theory program got particularly reanimated, I guess that would be around

152
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,760
1984 with the anomaly cancellation of Green and Schwartz, what you'll find is

153
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,080
that physics became very active and simultaneously ground to a halt. It

154
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,360
failed to remain a physical subject. It became something like a medieval quest

155
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,520
for the number of angels to dance on the head of a pit. Now, in this circumstance,

156
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,800
I think it's very important to realize that this is not a paper, and we are not

157
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,720
submitting to the archive. In fact, the archive requires people who are not

158
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,680
employed at universities to get permission from some member of the

159
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,680
community, which is called an endorsement, which I find absolutely

160
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,480
insulting, and I refuse to go along with. Furthermore, we are expected to cite

161
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,720
papers, sometimes which are behind paywalls. And I think that it's absolutely

162
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,640
immoral to ask people to pay outside the system to read the papers to cite

163
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,200
other people's work. I could go on about the number of things that are currently

164
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,360
wrong with the system, but instead what I would like to do is to simply joyously

165
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,280
I have every intention of simply sharing this with you and jealously guarding my

166
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,280
right to shepherd this through. Now, what does that mean? In two previous episodes,

167
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,760
we've had interactions with academicians, which I think are interesting and bear

168
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,000
scrutiny. In the first case, in an interview with the economist Tyler Cowan,

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,400
I talked to Tyler about the fact that the Boschian Commission was in fact

170
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,920
committing economic malpractice. Now, why was that? It was because they decided

171
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,640
that they needed to transfer a trillion dollars over 10 years and that they had

172
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,320
found a devious way of doing it, which is to adjust the CPI. By backing out the

173
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,760
amount of adjustment needed to get a trillion dollars, they decided that a

174
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,480
1.1% overstatement in the CPI would cause a reduction in entitlements, that is

175
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,440
Medicare and Medicaid payments together with Social Security, as well as an

176
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,440
increase in taxes because tax brackets are also indexed. Now, to my mind, it is

177
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,080
absolutely unconscionable to say that you have a right to transfer wealth

178
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,080
cryptically by adjusting a fundamental barometer. That would be like saying, in

179
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,480
order to meet our global warming targets, we have to recalibrate all the

180
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,040
thermometers to show that, in fact, things have cooled. One simply can't do

181
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,400
that in science, but Tyler's response I found was very interesting. His

182
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,520
perspective was that this was, in fact, not a terrible thing because it was

183
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,640
quote, directionally correct. And in general, he believed that because the CPI

184
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,160
should be considered overstated that this was not the world's most terrible

185
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,680
thing to do as an economist. I respect Tyler a great deal and I enjoy his

186
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,520
company, but I have to say that I am absolutely of a different opinion. My

187
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,400
belief is that one has no rights and no ability as a scientist to fudge the data

188
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,800
to meet social goals in this fashion. Another interesting interaction was the

189
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,920
interaction with Professor Agnes Collard of the University of Chicago. Now, when

190
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,680
she listened to episode 19 about Brett Weinstein, she found that it was a very

191
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,800
compelling episode. But strangely, even though the point of the episode was to

192
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,360
surface Brett's long forgotten theory, because Brett had not been acknowledged

193
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,640
as having predicted that laboratory mice would in particular have radically

194
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,720
elongated telomeres, where it was thought that all mice had radically elongated

195
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,000
telomeres, which has incredible potential implications for drug testing and all of

196
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,320
the work that is done on laboratory rodents as model organisms. This is an

197
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,200
episode you should definitely listen to if you haven't already. But Agnes's

198
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,160
perspective was very different than mine. Her feeling was that because we were in

199
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,240
a situation in which the work actually surfaced, that the system worked even if

200
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,640
it was the case that Brett's name was erased from the history of the

201
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,760
development and that his theory was put in a situation in which it was not

202
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,440
able to carry the day because, in fact, there was no record of the fact that a

203
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,240
prediction had been made. Now, I disagreed with Agnes on that program

204
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,040
vociferously. But what I found was that it was very telling. In general, our

205
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,640
academic population has given up on the previous and quaint idea of decency,

206
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,360
proprietary, truth, fairness, because there simply isn't the resource for

207
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,680
everyone. Now, I believe that current science is not necessarily unsalvageable,

208
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,040
but it will be unsalvageable if we don't get the very people that I rail against

209
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,720
far more money. And I know that's very confusing. But my belief is that the

210
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,680
inadequate resources that we have put aside are very similar to the inadequate

211
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,560
masks that we have put aside for our doctors. We have asked some of the

212
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,480
world's most gifted and smartest people to devote their lives to the study of

213
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,760
science and technology. And we have inadequately prepared them. We've put

214
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,520
their lives and their families' lives under incredible pressures. And what I

215
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,520
wish to do is to, in fact, point to the very people who I have been most angry

216
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,480
at for years and say that part of the problem is that we need to take a hard

217
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,560
look at how we've invested in science and technology and give the very people

218
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,800
that I'm most angry at more money. I will explain more about this later, but I

219
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,880
do want to give you an introduction to this episode. What I will be doing is

220
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,040
to screen a very unusual and somewhat awkward lecture at the University of

221
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,160
Oxford. Now, why is it so awkward? Well, first of all, I had left standard

222
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,840
research perhaps 20 years earlier, almost. Further, I'm not a physicist. And I

223
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,040
have only taken one or two courses in the physics major sequence. I think I've

224
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,800
taken one semester of mechanics. And perhaps I took an advanced general

225
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,840
relativity course in college. But in general, no one goes into a theoretical

226
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,840
physics department and attempts to lecture physics physicists on physics.

227
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,640
And why is that? Well, because physics is incredibly demanding. And this is

228
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,440
almost certainly the world's most interesting and most accomplished

229
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,840
intellectual community. These are guys who don't miss a trick. There are so

230
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,880
many things to know and it is such a difficult field that it is effectively

231
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,680
almost impossible to contribute from outside. Chemists don't do it and once

232
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
in a blue moon, mathematicians will attempt to talk about actual real

233
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
physics. So one thing that you're seeing is a very unusual circumstance where

234
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,320
somebody is trying to figure out how to give their first lecture in a physics

235
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,200
department. And it concerns the possibility of a theory which attempts to

236
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,960
solve the problem of how does a fire light itself. Another thing that you'll

237
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,240
see is that it's relatively difficult to read my handwriting. I'm not going to

238
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,000
make any bones about it. I've been very vocal about having learning differences,

239
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,680
dysgraphia, dyslexia, all sorts of different issues. Symbols come extremely

240
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,360
difficult to me. I don't want to spend this time making excuses. What I do want

241
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,000
to say is the following. I will be attempting to record a short PowerPoint

242
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,160
presentation for after the lecture to say at least some of what some of the

243
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,520
constructions are more clearly. This is not meant to be the actual presentation

244
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,440
of the theory. What this is is an introduction, a down payment and above

245
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,600
all a historical account of what happened seven years ago at the University

246
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,280
of Oxford when I tried to present these ideas. I've talked before about the

247
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,920
twin nuclei problem and our need to get off of this planet. And if we have a

248
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,640
hope of getting off of this planet, it really comes from fundamental physics.

249
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,240
You see 100 years ago or perhaps 105 when Albert Einstein gave us general

250
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,760
relativity. He effectively consigned us for life to the solar system. Why is

251
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,600
that? Well, his model, his geometric model of space and time, effectively

252
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,480
creates a speed limit known as C or the speed of light. Now, there are three

253
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,920
rocks that are at least interesting for habitation by humans, although two of

254
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,440
them are marginal, the moon and Mars. One of them, of course, is unbelievable,

255
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,880
the earth. But I doubt that we're going to be able to steward the earth through

256
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,680
our new godlike powers, which I've called the twin nuclei problem of

257
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,920
cell and atom. We've unlocked the power of both. And I don't think we have the

258
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,480
wisdom to stay all in one place. So the question that I had was, if there is

259
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,160
any ability to escape to the cosmos that we can see in the night sky, where

260
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,480
would it come from? We are almost positive that Albert Einstein's theory of

261
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,160
relativity is in some weird way incomplete. The Schwarzschild singularities

262
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,400
which give us black holes and the initial singularities of the Robertson

263
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,920
Walker Friedman universe, which are associated with the Big Bang, are some

264
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,600
clue that there is some subtle flaw in Einstein's theory. So how to go beyond

265
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Einstein? I mean, what Einstein did to Newton was to recover Newton as a

266
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,320
special case of a more general theory that is more flexible. And in fact, this

267
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,800
is the same problem that we have. Because Albert Einstein's theory is so

268
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,480
fundamental, we effectively begin every theoretical physics seminar with a

269
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,640
statement about spacetime. In other words, Albert Einstein is locked in at the

270
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,320
ground floor. So if we can't get below the ground floor to the foundations, it's

271
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,640
very difficult to make progress. This is one of the things that is making it

272
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,120
almost impossible for us to go beyond the initial revolutions of the 20th

273
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:50,440
century. Do I know that this new theory, if it works, will allow us to escape? I do

274
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,000
not. There's no one who can say that. And I don't think I have the skills to

275
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,040
develop the physical consequences of the theory, even if the theory turns out to

276
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:06,520
be mostly right. What I will say is that I think that the theory is the first of

277
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,960
its kind that I've seen. I believe that in part what you will see is that at a

278
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,560
minimum, it is like fool's gold. It appears to explain why we think we see

279
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,200
three generations. But it also says that perhaps they aren't really three

280
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,040
generations of matter. Perhaps there are only two, even though physicists tell us

281
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,560
that there are at least three or perhaps more. I believe that physics tells us

282
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,320
that the universe is chiral, that is left-right asymmetric. But the theory is

283
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,720
itself not chiral. Instead, it chooses to present a different idea, which is that

284
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,120
perhaps chirality is emergent, much the way our hands are individually left-right

285
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,400
asymmetric, as our pinky is not a reflection of our thumb. But the thumb on

286
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,920
each hand is a pairing to the other one, as is the pinky. Now, what does that

287
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,720
mean? It means that if perhaps there is matter and there is force that is

288
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,440
decoupled from our ordinary world, that that matter might restore the parity or

289
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,080
the chirality, rather would break the chirality, and restore parity between

290
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,960
these two halves, the matter we see and the matter that is missing. There are a

291
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,440
good number of other things that happen in the theory. It replaces space-time with

292
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,440
what I've termed an observer's. Now, an observer's is an unusual gadget in that

293
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,680
it's thought of as two separate places where physics takes place, connected by

294
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,320
a map. That means effectively that we are in something like a stadium where there

295
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,040
are stands and there is a pitch, and the playing field that we think we see may

296
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,680
not, in fact, be where most of the action is taking place. In fact, not all of the

297
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,520
fields live on the same space. So when we see waves and particles dancing around,

298
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,040
they may have separate origins in each of the two components of the

299
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:01,360
observer's. What I hope to do after this is to gracefully and gradually develop

300
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:07,240
the theory under my leadership. Now, why do I say that? There is a belief in

301
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,880
physics and in most fields that the field should behave in a communal fashion,

302
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,840
and that people should put forward their ideas and other people should joyously

303
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,600
build upon them, and that the community should be allowed to name the various

304
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,480
accomplishments for whoever they say accomplished those things. There's not

305
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,560
a way in hell that I'm letting that happen. My experience with this community

306
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,520
is that it simply can't be trusted to behave equitably given the fact that it

307
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,840
is so resource-starved and constrained. People simply do not have the freedom to

308
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,520
be generous, kind, and accurate as to who did what. Furthermore, there is an

309
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,520
incredible premium on cherry topping. That is, who finished something off is

310
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,600
considered bizarrely much more important than who found something to begin with.

311
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,680
Imagine you located an island and you named the island after the first person

312
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,200
who could plant the flag on the top of the highest peak. This is patently offensive

313
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,840
and ridiculous. There's a story years ago about how Hilbert almost scooped

314
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,600
Einstein by giving the Hilbert action from which Einstein's equations could be

315
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,440
recovered. Really? Not a chance. So, if Hilbert came up with the Hilbert action

316
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,400
and recovered Einstein's equations, so what? I mean, the real theory actually

317
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,880
takes place in Einstein and Grossman before Albert Einstein even works out a

318
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,440
lot of the flaws in the original theory. It's about the ideas. It's not about the

319
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,840
formulas and it's not about racing to the final form. Now, I know that the

320
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,360
community won't agree with that but think about this. What I'm doing is taking an

321
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,000
incredible risk. I'm addressing you here on April Fool's Day and I'm saying that

322
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,040
if there is a fool, it is certainly me because I have sat on this theory for

323
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,480
almost 40 years. Now, I've never known. Is it true? Is it false? It's impossible to

324
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,200
tell when you're only talking to yourself. But in this situation, what I've done

325
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,640
is I've taken a tremendous amount of risk and now I'm trying to share it with

326
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,080
you. Hopefully, I know that, well, Newton did his greatest work when he was

327
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,840
sheltering from a great plague in England and I would like to

328
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,200
think that perhaps, whether or not this is correct, simply the act of somebody

329
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:33,440
trying earnestly to share hope and some path forward would be uplifting. Now,

330
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,560
under the worst circumstances, if this doesn't work, what do I think? This is a

331
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,960
question I'm asked frequently. And there are two things that I'll say. Many years

332
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,040
ago, around 1987, I put forward some equations that I thought might become my

333
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,640
thesis at the Harvard Department of Mathematics and they were disallowed for

334
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,000
a variety of reasons. Those equations were later discovered in, I believe, 1994

335
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,840
and I sat in a lecture in which I saw these equations go up on a board at the

336
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,520
very end at MIT. And I looked at those equations and I said, huh, those are the

337
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,880
exact equations I was told could never work. Why is the leading physicist in the

338
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,160
world placing them on the board and saying that these are the equations from

339
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,440
which all of something called Donaldson theory can be derived? What I'm giving you,

340
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:32,480
at least at a minimum, had the ability years earlier to provide those equations

341
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,240
from a different source. There's something called cyber-witten theory, which I

342
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,280
have no claim on. But the actual equations that are called the cyber-witten

343
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,360
equations came originally as an outgrowth from investigations of this

344
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,760
theory. So at a bare minimum, the cyber-witten revolution should have happened

345
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,280
at Harvard rather than Princeton and it should have been recognized that this

346
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,520
theory was capable of at least at a minimum giving birth to that as a side

347
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,960
project. The other thing that I think is incredibly important is that we've

348
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,160
never seen how a universe that looks like ours could possibly emerge from almost

349
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,440
no assumptions whatsoever. And I believe that even if this theory were to turn out

350
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,520
to be wrong, which I don't think is likely, I believe that it would give us

351
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,960
something to go on. We would at least have a first candidate of how a hopeful

352
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,120
theory of everything would look and how it would go wrong. So under any

353
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,920
circumstance, I think that I'm going to be fine if the theory doesn't work out.

354
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,560
I will have at least taken my shot on goal. And I think that that's probably

355
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,880
more than almost anyone can ask from a life to attempt to make contact with the

356
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,000
deepest question that we've ever had, which is what is this place and what

357
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,880
brought it into being? Lastly, I want to just talk about a personal aspect of

358
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,120
this, which is what does it mean to come to an end? Whether or not this theory in

359
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,520
fact does what I claim, I think it does. I don't know. But I do know that sooner or

360
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,560
later in the era of intercontinental land exploration, someone found the last

361
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,680
land mass. And that must have been a very strange moment when there was nothing

362
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,320
left to do. I think whether or not this theory in fact accomplishes that is one

363
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,280
question. But we all have to plan for what it is that we think will happen when

364
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,880
man at last learns his own source code. In fact, this was the last edge question

365
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,240
that I answered for John Brockman, which is, does something unprecedented happen

366
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,920
when man at last learns his own source code? I don't know the answer to this,

367
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,480
but I want to return to the same spirit that I started this one. I was 18 or 19,

368
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,720
which is that of joyous investigation of brave, open-hearted

369
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,720
undertakings. And I also want to bring back a different style of scientific

370
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,080
investigation. There's been far too much communalism. In fact, there is a belief

371
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,960
that there are no lone researchers and that everything is produced by a

372
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,800
community. And pardon my French, but this is absolute horseshit. I have been so

373
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,280
long alone with these principles, equations and ideas that I don't even

374
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,760
know what my adult life will look like once I discord them. And I begin to talk

375
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,120
about them with the community at large. I've talked to many theoretical

376
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,320
physicists who've taken some interest in them, but I've never put out enough to

377
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,320
absolutely ensure that people are seeing what it is that I'm seeing. So whether

378
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,440
or not the April Fool's joke is on me, I cannot tell you, but I can promise you

379
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,600
that I'm not trying to play one on you. What I hope to show you is a lecture

380
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,920
that was the first of three versions of this lecture that were delivered in

381
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,000
Oxford over the course of a week. And one of the things that has held me back

382
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,800
is that I have a great number of people who I have to thank for effectively

383
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,080
being my underground railroad when my career got into serious trouble to make

384
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,720
sure, who made sure that I always had an opportunity to fight another day. And

385
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,480
some of the most important of those people, one of whom occurs on this

386
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,640
video, is Marcus DeSotois. And Marcus, I just wanted to say thank you for your

387
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,200
bravery, your courage, your friendship, and your encouragement. I know I've been

388
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,800
absolutely impossible to you. I've made you wait for this and I just want to say

389
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,680
how much I love you. I also want to thank Isidore Singer for effectively saving

390
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,720
me from not getting a PhD by, I think, putting pressure on the Harvard

391
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,400
Department. And for coming to my assistance, making sure that I got a

392
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,200
postdoc at MIT, despite not having any publications at all. I'd like to thank

393
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,640
Raoul Bot, who's no longer with us, who I should have invited to my wedding. I was

394
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,600
very angry at him, but I didn't realize that he was saving me in a very

395
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,160
difficult situation against a department that probably just wanted to see me gone.

396
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,200
I'd like to thank Peter Thiel, one of my closest friends, who's like a brother to

397
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,880
me, for allowing me these seven years since this lecture to lick my wounds, to

398
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:25,360
get strong, to have a 401k, to buy a house, and to begin coming back to regular

399
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,520
society after a very difficult and strained career. I'd like to thank Adil

400
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,920
Abdullali and Michael Grossberg, the two greatest best friends from college that

401
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,640
I could have. I'd like to thank my grandfather, Harry Rubin, who believed

402
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,760
in things that couldn't possibly be true and made some of them happen. I'd like

403
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,000
to thank my parents, Karen and Les Weinstein, for all the good things that

404
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,280
they did. I'd like to thank my brother Bret Weinstein and his family, Heather

405
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,880
and the kids, for sticking by me. And I'd like to thank my in-laws in Bombay,

406
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,600
India. I hope you guys are well. And lastly, I would very much like to thank my

407
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,040
wife and my two kids for putting up with a lot of lost weekends, a lot of lost

408
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,520
vacations, and believing that just maybe there was something to this and

409
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,560
sticking by me all these years. So I hope everybody really enjoys this. It may

410
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,720
not be comprehensible. And after this video finishes, I'll do a short

411
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,800
presentation of some of the constructions that took place. Not all of the

412
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,600
equations and things, which I think some of them were sort of botched on the

413
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,480
board because I became disoriented the night before and rearranged things in a

414
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,720
way that probably wasn't optimal. But I'll attempt to clarify these things

415
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,480
going forward and to begin to present the theory as I see whether or not I can

416
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,880
bring myself to once again work on it somewhat close to full-time as a 54-

417
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:04,320
year-old father of two. So sit back, relax, and coming up next is the first of my

418
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,120
three lectures at Oxford University on Geometric Unity. Be well.

419
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,920
Well, welcome to this special Simone lecture. My name is Mark Stasotoy. I'm a

420
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,560
professor of mathematics here and the Simone Professor for the Public

421
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,840
Understanding of Science. And Charles Simone prepared a manifesto when he

422
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,000
endowed this chair to guide the holder of the professorship in their mission.

423
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,400
And I'd like to read one part of that manifesto to you. It said,

424
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,720
scientific speculation when so labelled and when the concept of speculation and

425
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,760
its place in the scientific method has been made clear to the audience can be

426
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,040
very exciting. It is a very effective communication tool and it is by no

427
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,840
means discouraged. And it is in the spirit of this part of my mission as a

428
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,960
Simone Professor that I would like to introduce today's Simone special

429
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,800
lecture. I first met Eric Weinstein when we were both postdocs at the Hebrew

430
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,200
University just over 20 years ago. And I had the feeling then that he was

431
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,760
working on something big. But it wasn't until two years ago that Eric met me in

432
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,800
a bar in New York and we began he began to explain the mathematics that he'd

433
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
been working on in private for the last 20 years. As he took me through the

434
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,040
equations he had been formulating, I began to see emerging before my eyes

435
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,800
potential answers to many of the major problems in physics. It was an

436
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,320
extremely exciting, daring proposal and also mathematically so natural that it

437
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,560
started to work its magic on me. Over the last two years I have had the

438
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
privilege of being taken through the twists and turns of Eric's ideas.

439
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,280
After our postdocs in Israel, while I went the academic route getting my

440
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,680
professorship here in Oxford, Eric went a more independent route working in

441
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,200
economics, government and finance. So he comes here today as something of an

442
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,720
insider and an outsider. A difficult place from which to propose bold ideas.

443
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,920
But having spent time seeing how powerful these ideas appear to be, I felt

444
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,320
that it was time that Eric shared his ideas more widely. As I believe his

445
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,520
perspective could give the scientific community a new story to explain some of

446
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,600
the big questions on the scientific books. I'm therefore very happy to provide

447
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,120
a platform here in Oxford for Eric to share his ideas on a new theory he

448
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,720
calls geometric unity. The lecture will be approximately 70 minutes after which

449
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,120
we will have a period to ask questions. Eric.

450
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:56,480
So it's a great pleasure to be here in Oxford. For those of you who are not

451
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,760
aware, it is possible that no other university in the world has kept so

452
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,720
tightly and kept the faith for so long with Einstein's great vision of a final

453
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,960
theory for physics as a theory of pure geometry. A sort of elegance and

454
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,520
simplicity of the highest order. And the names that are associated with Oxford

455
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,040
that weigh heavy on me are Atia, Penrose, Siegel, Woodhouse, Hitchin. It's a very

456
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,320
long list of people who, even when fashion did not hold those ideas in

457
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,680
favor, always kept the faith that there was much to be learned from the

458
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,440
geometric perspective on physics. Of course, unified field theory in some

459
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,960
sense acquired a stigma with Einstein's failure to find it. And the sense that

460
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,320
even someone like Einstein being tempted by the siren song of geometry

461
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,880
might lose their footing and go astray. And in the years since, we've had a

462
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,960
replacement theory which is that what is really calling our generations is the

463
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,280
quest to quantize general relativity and gravity. And I'd like to go back to

464
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,000
the sort of earlier perspective that there is no evidence to date, in my

465
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,080
mind, that we are being called to quantize general relativity directly. In

466
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,320
fact, there's been more effort spent on that quest without very tangible

467
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,920
results than Einstein spent as one man searching for years for unified field

468
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,280
theory. So we have to, in some sense, begin to undo some of what we think we

469
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,240
know in order to truly reconsider and allow me to put some of these ideas

470
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:51,960
before you today. Marcus asked me to begin presenting these ideas here. And

471
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,440
hopefully this is a first opportunity, but if the ideas are not good, then

472
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,840
lighting on the aisles will lead you to safety and your exits may be behind you.

473
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,360
But in the event of a good flight, hopefully this will begin a conversation

474
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,200
rather than end one. I feel in some sense that I'm presenting the works of

475
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,720
another man, a younger man, someone who came of age right in the middle of the

476
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,560
great string theory boom with the anomaly cancellation in 1984. And I

477
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,840
look at this work and I see a young person struggling with the idea, why

478
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,440
can't I see that string theory is going to answer all of these questions over

479
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,240
the next 10 years, as we were told at the time. And making a very dangerous

480
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,480
decision, which was, I think I'm not going to follow that particular path and

481
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,640
I'm going to follow another. And it's not clear where this path is going to

482
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,040
lead us, but we're going to explore it today and see as best we can. So in some

483
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,640
sense, I've been able to polish some of that young man's work, but I'm also

484
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,680
struggling to reconstruct it because as someone spending full time on that

485
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:08,120
theory, he knew a lot of things that I no longer know. So with that as a

486
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,560
beginning, I'm just going to say one disclaimer, which is that this is not a

487
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,520
usual talk. And whatever contract a speaker usually has with the audience,

488
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,080
right now we're going to break that contract. This is a talk about ideas.

489
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,280
Some of these ideas are bold, some of them may offend some people because

490
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,680
there's a sense that you don't have a right to be considering those ideas. But

491
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,360
I go back to the admonition of Jim Watson that said, if you're going to try to

492
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,760
make progress, big progress, you are by definition unqualified to be doing

493
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:47,880
whatever it is that you're doing. So in that spirit, let us begin. What is

494
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,200
physics to physicists today? How do they see it different from the way in which

495
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,440
we might imagine the layperson sees physics? Ed Whitten was asked this

496
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:06,320
question in a talk he gave on physics and geometry many years ago, and he

497
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,600
pointed us to three fundamental insights, which were his big three

498
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,680
insights in physics. And they correspond to the three great equations. So the

499
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:25,880
first one is that somehow physics takes place in an arena. And that arena is a

500
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:35,960
manifold X together with some kind of semi-Romanian metric structure. Something

501
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,320
that allows us to take length and angle so that we can perform measurements at

502
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,680
every point in this spacetime or higher dimensional structure, leaving us a

503
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:54,720
little bit of headroom. The equation most associated with this is the Einstein

504
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:21,040
field equation. And, of course, I've run into the margin. So it says,

505
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,760
that a piece of the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, minus an even

506
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,440
smaller piece, the scalar curvature multiplied by the metric, is equal, or

507
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,920
plus the cosmological constant, is equal to some amount of matter and energy, the

508
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,480
stress energy tensor. So it's intrinsically a curvature equation. The

509
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,080
second fundamental insight, I'm going to begin to start drawing pictures here as

510
00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:01,960
well. So if this is the spacetime manifold, the arena, the second one concerns

511
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:10,560
symmetry groups, which cannot necessarily be deduced from any structure inside of

512
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,120
the arena. They are additional data that come to us out of the blue without

513
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:25,560
explanation. And these symmetries form a non-Abelian group, which is currently

514
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:44,360
SU3 color cross SU2 weak isospin cross U1 weak hypercharge, which breaks down to

515
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:55,120
SU3 cross U1, where the broken U1 is the electromagnetic symmetry. This equation

516
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,160
is also a curvature equation, the corresponding equation, and it says that

517
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:11,480
this time the curvature of an auxiliary structure known as a gauge potential, when

518
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:24,560
differentiated in a particular way, is equal, again, to the amount of stuff in

519
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,440
the system that is not directly involved in the left-hand side of the equation. So

520
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,480
it has many similarities to the above equation. Both involve curvature, one

521
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,120
involves a projection or a series of projections, the other involves a

522
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:57,920
differential operator. The third point surrounds the matter in the system. And

523
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:12,120
here we have a Dirac equation, again coupled to a connection. But one of the

524
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:18,560
great insights is that the reason for the lightness of matter in the natural mass

525
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,240
scale of physics has to do with the fact that this psi really should have two

526
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,800
components, and the differential operator should map to one component on the

527
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,160
other side of the equation, but the mass operator should map to another. And so if

528
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,200
one of the components is missing, if the equation is intrinsically lopsided,

529
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,960
chiral, asymmetric, then the mass term and the differential term have

530
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,120
difficulty interacting, which is sort of overcompensating for the mass scale of

531
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,360
the universe, so you get to a point where you actually have to define a

532
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,480
massless equation, but then just like overshooting a putt, it's easier to knock

533
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,480
it back by putting in a Higgs field in order to generate an as-if fundamental

534
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,240
mass through the Yukawa couplings.

535
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,760
So matter is asymmetric, and therefore light.

536
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,800
And then interestingly, he went on to say one more thing. He said, of course, these

537
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,760
three central observations must be supplemented with the idea that this all

538
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:54,440
takes place, treated in quantum mechanical fashion or quantum field

539
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,280
theoretic. So it's a bit of an aftermarket modification rather than, in his

540
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:08,920
opinion at the time, one of the core insights. I actually think that that's in

541
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,800
some sense about right. Now, one of my differences with the community in

542
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,920
some sense is that I question whether the quantum isn't in good enough shape,

543
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,440
that we don't know whether we have a serious quantum mechanical problem or not.

544
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,240
We know that we have a quantum mechanical problem, a quantum field

545
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,480
theoretic problem, relative to the current formulations of these theories, but we

546
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,960
know that in some other cases, the quantum becomes incredibly natural,

547
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
sometimes sort of almost magically natural. And we don't know whether the

548
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
true theories that we will need to be generalizing, in some sense, have

549
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,480
beautiful quantum mechanical treatments, whereas the effective theories that we're

550
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:58,440
dealing with now may not survive the quantization. So what I want to do is I

551
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,840
want to imagine a different sort of incompatibility. So let's take our great

552
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:14,400
three theories and just visually treat them as the vertices of a triangle. So I'm

553
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,880
going to put general relativity in Einstein's formulation, and I'm going to

554
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,800
put the, I probably won't write this again, Yang-Mills, Maxwell, Anderson-Higgs

555
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:42,120
theory over here, and I'm going to write the Dirac theory. What I want to explore is

556
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:48,080
the incompatibility is not at the quantum level, but the geometric input. All three

557
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,480
of these are geometric theories. And the question is, what are the

558
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,920
incompatibilities or incompatibilities at the level of geometry before the

559
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:03,880
theory is treated quantum mechanically? Well, in the case of Einstein's general

560
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:10,520
relativity, we can rewrite the Einstein theory by saying that there's a projection

561
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,120
map due to Einstein of a curvature tensor, where I'm going to write that

562
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:24,640
curvature tensor as I would in the Yang-Mills theory. That should be an LC for

563
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,080
Levy-Chavita. So the Einstein projection of the curvature tensor of the Levy-Chavita

564
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,720
connection of the metric on this side, and on this side, I'm going to write down

565
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,800
this differential operator, the adjoint of the exterior derivative coupled to a

566
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:52,360
connection. And you begin to see that we're missing an opportunity potentially.

567
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,880
What if the FAs were the same in both contexts? Then you're applying two

568
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,920
separate operators, one zero-eth order and destructive in the sense that it

569
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,960
doesn't see the entire curvature tensor. The other inclusive, but a first order.

570
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,200
And so the question is, is there any opportunity to do anything that combines

571
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:20,840
these two? But the problem is, is that the hallmark of the Yang-Mills theory is

572
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,560
the freedom to choose the data, the internal quantum numbers that give all

573
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:31,560
the particles their personalities beyond the mass and the spin.

574
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,760
In addition to all of that freedom is some means of taking away some of the

575
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,800
redundancy that comes with that freedom, which is the action of the gauge group.

576
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,920
Now we can allow the gauge group of symmetries to act on both sides of the

577
00:51:46,960 --> 00:52:07,960
equation. But the key problem is that if I act on connections on the right and then

578
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:16,880
take the Einstein projection, this is not equal to first taking the projection

579
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:34,880
and then conjugating with the gauge action. So the problem is, is that the projection

580
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,360
is based on the fact that you have a relationship between the intrinsic

581
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:46,600
geometry, if this is an ad-valued two-form, the two-form portion of this, and the

582
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,840
adjoint portion of this are both associated to the structure group of the

583
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,640
tangent bundle. But the gauge rotation is only acting on one of the two factors,

584
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,400
yet the projection is making use of both of them. So there is a fundamental

585
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,880
incompatibility in the claim that Einstein's theory is a gauge theory

586
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,560
relies more on analogy than on an exact mapping between the two theories. What

587
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,280
about the incompatibilities between the Einstein theory of general relativity and

588
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,880
the Dirac theory of matter? I was very struck that if we're going to try to

589
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,000
quantize gravity and we associate gravity with the spin-to-field g mu nu,

590
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:39,120
we actually have a pretty serious problem, which is if you think about spinors,

591
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:46,880
electrons, quarks, as being waves in a medium, and you think about photons as

592
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:54,560
being waves in a different medium, photons medium does not depend on the

593
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,760
existence of a metric. One forms are defined whether or not a metric is

594
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,680
present. It's spinors or not. So if we are going to take the spin-to g mu nu

595
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,000
field to be quantum mechanical, if it blinks out and does whatever the quantum

596
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,080
does between observations, in the case of the photon, it's saying that the waves

597
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,800
may blink out, but the ocean need not blink out. In the case of the Dirac

598
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,920
theory, it is the ocean, the medium in which the waves live that becomes

599
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,600
uncertain itself. So even if you're comfortable with the quantum, to me,

600
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,120
this becomes a bridge too far. So the question is, how do we liberate the

601
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:50,320
definition? How do we get the metric out from its responsibilities? It's been

602
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:55,240
assigned far too many responsibilities. It's responsible for a volume form, for

603
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,640
differential operators, it's responsible for measurement, it's responsible for

604
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,400
being a dynamical field, part of the field content of the system. Lastly, we

605
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,920
have the compatibilities between Yang-Mills and the Dirac theory. These

606
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,560
may be the most mild of the various incompatibilities, but it is an

607
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:21,880
incompatibility of naturality. Where the Dirac field, Einstein's field, and the

608
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,400
connection fields are all geometrically well motivated, we push a lot of the

609
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,720
artificiality that we do not understand into the potential for the scalar field

610
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,920
that gives everything its mass. So we tend to treat it as something of a

611
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:45,320
mysterious fudge factor. So the question is, if we have a Higgs field, why is it

612
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:54,200
here, and why is it geometric? It has long been the most artificial sector of

613
00:55:54,200 --> 00:56:04,000
our models. The proposal that I want to put to you today is that one of the

614
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,080
reasons that we may be having trouble with unification is, is that the duty, our

615
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:19,400
duty, may be to generalize all three vertices before we can make progress.

616
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:28,600
That's daunting because in each case it would appear that we can make an

617
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,960
argument that this, that, and the other vertex are the simplest possible theories

618
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,000
that could live at that vertex. We know, for example, the Dirac operator is the

619
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,360
most fundamental of all the elliptic operators in Euclidean signature

620
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:49,600
generating all of the Tia-Singer theory. We know that Einstein's theory is in

621
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,120
some sense a unique spin to massless field capable of communicating gravity

622
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,000
which can be arrived at from field theoretic rather than geometric

623
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,280
considerations. In the Yang-Mills case it can be argued that the Yang-Mills theory

624
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,440
is the simplest theory that can possibly result. Where we're taking the simplest

625
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,040
Lagrangian in the Einstein case looking only at the scalar curvature, in the

626
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,120
Yang-Mills case we have no substructure, and so we're doing the most simple-minded

627
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,680
thing we can do by taking the norm square of the curvature and saying

628
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,800
whatever the field strength is let's measure that size. So if each one of

629
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,320
these is simplest possible doesn't Occam's razor tell us that if we wish to

630
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,840
remain in geometric field theory that we've already reached bottom and what

631
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,440
we're being asked to do is to abandon this as merely an effective theory? That's

632
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,840
possible and I would say that that in some sense represents a lot of

633
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:42,680
conventional wisdom. But there are other possibilities. There are other possibilities

634
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,320
that while each of these may be simplest in its category they are not

635
00:57:47,320 --> 00:58:01,840
simplest in their interaction. For example we know that Dirac famously took the

636
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,920
square root of the Klein-Gordon equation to achieve the Dirac equation. He

637
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,560
actually took two square roots one of the differential operator and another of

638
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:16,000
the algebra on which it acts. But could not could we not do the same thing by

639
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,080
reinterpreting what we saw in Donaldson theory, in Chern-Simon's theory, and

640
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,480
finding that there are first-order equations that imply second-order

641
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,680
equations that are nonlinear and in the curvature? So let's imagine the

642
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:37,440
following. We replace the standard model with a true second-order theory. We

643
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,720
imagine that general relativity is replaced by a true first-order theory

644
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,640
and then we find that the true second-order theory admits of a square

645
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,760
root and can be linked with the true first-order theory. This would be a

646
00:58:50,760 --> 00:59:01,160
program for some kind of unification of Dirac's type but in the force sector. The

647
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,680
question is does this really make any sense? Are there any possibilities to do

648
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:14,120
any such thing? So what I'd like to do is I'd like to talk a little bit about

649
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:35,720
what the geometric unity proposal is. So we have a division into intrinsic theories

650
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:50,760
and auxiliary theories between physics and mathematics, more specifically

651
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:58,520
geometry. An intrinsic physical theory would be general relativity. An auxiliary

652
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,280
physical theory would be the Yang-Mills theory with the freedom to choose

653
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,640
internal quantum numbers. At the mathematical level an intrinsic theory

654
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:24,080
would be, let's be a little fastidious, the older semi-Romanian geometry, a study

655
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,880
of manifolds with length and angle. But auxiliary geometry is really what's

656
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,120
taken off of late since the revolution partially begun at Oxford when

657
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,120
his singer brought insights from Stony Brook to the UK. And so we're going to

658
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:50,000
call this fiber bundle theory or modern gauge theory. Geometric unity is the

659
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,080
search for some way to break down the walls between these four boxes. What's

660
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:00,080
natural to one theory is unnatural to another. Semi-Romanian geometry is

661
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:06,880
dominated by these projection operators as well as the ability to use the

662
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,440
Levy-Chavita connection. Now some aspects of this are less explored. Torsion

663
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,720
tensors are definable in semi-Romanian geometry but they are not used to the

664
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,320
extent that you might imagine. In the case of fiber bundle theory the discovery

665
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:26,080
of physicists that the gauge group was fantastically important came as

666
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,480
something of a shock to the mathematicians who had missed that structure

667
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,960
and have since exploited it to great effect. So what we'd like to do is we'd

668
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,240
like to come up with some theory that is intrinsic but allows us to play some of

669
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,640
the games that exist in other boxes. How can we try to have our cake

670
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:54,000
eat it and use all the full suite of techniques that are available to us. So

671
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,920
our perspective is that it is the quantum that may be the comparatively

672
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,000
easy part and that the unification of the geometry which is not occurred may be

673
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,280
what we're being asked to do. So let's try to figure out what would a final

674
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:17,320
theory even look like. When I was a bit younger I remember reading this question

675
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,240
of Einstein which he said I'm not really interested in some of the details of

676
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,000
physics what really concerns me is whether the creator had any choice in

677
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,640
how the world was constructed. And some people may have read that as a

678
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,160
philosophical statement but I took that as an actual call for a research

679
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,000
program. So I'd like to describe that research program and try to unpack what

680
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:49,480
I think he was saying. We talk a lot about unification but we hardly ever

681
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:57,440
actually imagine if we had a unified theory what would it look like. Let us

682
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,160
imagine that we cannot figure out the puzzle of why is there something rather

683
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,440
than nothing. But if we do have a something that that something has as

684
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,720
little structure as possible but still invites us to work mathematically. So to

685
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,680
me the two great theories that we have mathematically and in physics are

686
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:19,040
calculus and linear algebra. If we have calculus and linear algebra I'm gonna

687
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:25,640
imagine that we have some manifold at least one of dimension four but it's

688
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,200
not a space time it doesn't have a metric it's not broken down into two

689
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:34,240
different kinds of coordinates which then have some bleed into each other but

690
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,000
still maintains a distinction it's just some sort of flabby proto space time.

691
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,280
And in the end it's got to fill up with stuff and give us some kind of an

692
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,600
equation. So let me write an equation.

693
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:19,880
So I have in mind differential operators parameterized by some fields omega which

694
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,840
when composed are not of second order if these are first-order operators but of

695
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:32,960
zero-width order and some sort of further differential operator saying that

696
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:41,360
whatever those two operators are in composition is in some sense harmonic. Is

697
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:49,360
such a program even possible. So if the universe is in fact capable of being the

698
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,200
fire that lights itself is it capable of managing its own flame as well and

699
01:04:54,200 --> 01:05:01,360
closing up. What I'd like to do is to set ourselves an almost impossible task

700
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:09,160
which is to begin with this little data in a sandbox to use the computer science

701
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:27,200
concept. So if here's physical reality standard physics is over here we're

702
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:40,360
going to start with a sandbox and all we're going to put in it is x4 and we're

703
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,120
going to set ourselves a straight-jacketed task of seeing how close we can

704
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,840
come to dragging out a model that looks like the natural world that follows this

705
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:59,720
trajectory. While it may appear that that is not a particularly smart thing to do I

706
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:05,680
would like to think that we could agree that it is quite possible that if that

707
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,080
were to be the case we might say that this is what Einstein meant by a creator

708
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:15,120
which was his anthropomorphic concept for necessity and elegance and design

709
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:23,400
having no choice in the making of the world. So with that let us begin to think

710
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:29,960
about what we mean today by geometric unity. GU comes in four flavors but I'm

711
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,240
only getting one shot to do this so I'm going to do the most exciting of them to

712
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:43,400
me. There's a completely exogenous flavor and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

713
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:49,000
take the concept of observation and I'm going to break the world into two pieces.

714
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,280
A place where we do our observation and a place where most of the activity takes

715
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:01,920
place and I'm going to try to do this without loss of generality. So in this

716
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,320
case we have x4 and it can map into some other space and we're going to call this

717
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:17,720
an Observerse. The idea of an Observerse is a bit like a stadium you have a

718
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,080
playing field and you have stands. They aren't distinct entities they're coupled

719
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:28,760
and so fundamentally we're going to replace one space with two. Exogenous

720
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,840
model simply means that you is unrestricted although larger than x4 so

721
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:37,360
any manifold of four dimension higher that is capable of admitting x4 as an

722
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:44,840
immersion. The next model we have is the bundle

723
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:58,840
theoretic in which case u sits over x as a fiber bundle. The most exciting which is

724
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:04,520
the one we'll deal with today is the endogenous model. Where x4 actually

725
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:12,320
grows the space u where the activity takes place. So we talk about extra

726
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,320
dimensions but these are in some sense not extra dimensions they're implicit

727
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:21,800
dimensions within x4 and last to proceed without loss of generality we have the

728
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:29,520
tautological model. In that case x4 equals u and the immersion is the

729
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,360
identity and without loss of generality we simply play our games on one space.

730
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:50,520
Now we need rules. The rules are no choice of fundamental metric so we

731
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,960
imagine that Einstein was presented with a fork in the road and it's always

732
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:01,360
disturbing not to follow Einstein's path but we're in fact going to turn

733
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,040
Einstein's game on its head and see if we can get anywhere with that right. It's

734
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,720
also a possibility that because Einstein's theory is so perfect that if

735
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,360
there's anything wrong with it it's very hard to unthink it because

736
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:16,600
everything is built on top of it. So let's make no choice of fundamental metric

737
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,400
and in fact let's go more ambitious and let's say we're going to reverse the

738
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,560
logic of Einstein. Einstein the metric is fundamental but the Levy-Chavita

739
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,560
connection from which we deduce the curvature is emergent. So the

740
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:34,240
fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is that every metric causes

741
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,160
a connection to emerge and then the curvature is built on the connection.

742
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,560
We turn this around we imagine we're looking for a connection and we wish it

743
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,240
to build a metric because connections are amenable to quantization in a way

744
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:51,520
that metrics are not. The next point is that we always want to have a plan to

745
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,880
return to finite dimensions without losing sight of the quantum and lastly

746
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:03,360
we want to liberate matter from its dependence on the metric for its very

747
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,520
existence. So we now need to build fermions onto our four-dimensional

748
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,960
manifold in some way without ever choosing a metric if we're even to have

749
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,200
any hope of playing a game involving matter starting from this perspective of

750
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:25,120
no information other than the most bare information. Let's get started. We take

751
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:31,120
x4. We need metrics we have none. We're not allowed to choose one so we do the

752
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:39,960
standard trick is we choose them all. So we allow u14 to equal the space of

753
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:48,320
metrics on x4 point-wise. Therefore if we propagate on top of this, let me call

754
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,640
this the projection operator, if we propagate on u14 we are in some sense

755
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,920
following a Feynman-like idea of propagating over the space of all

756
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:03,680
metrics but not at a field level at a point-wise, tensorial level. Is there a

757
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:08,040
metric on u14? Well we both want one and don't want one. If we had a metric from

758
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,960
the space of all metrics we could define fermions but we would also lock out any

759
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,880
ability to do dynamics. We want some choice over what this metric is but we

760
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,240
don't want full choice because we want enough to be able to define the matter

761
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:30,000
fields to begin with. It turns out that if this is x4 and this is this

762
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:37,880
particular endogenous choice of u14, we have a ten-dimensional metric along the

763
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:49,760
fibers. So we have a g10 mu nu. Further for every point in the fibers we get a

764
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:59,200
metric downstairs on the base space. So if we pull back the cotangent bundle, we

765
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:12,440
get a metric g4 mu nu on pi star of the cotangent bundle of x. We now define the

766
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:19,720
chimeric bundle. And the chimeric bundle is the direct sum of the vertical

767
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,840
tangent bundle along the fibers with the pullback, which we're going to call the

768
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:33,720
horizontal bundle, from the base space. So the chimeric bundle is going to be the

769
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:43,200
vertical tangent space of ten dimensions to u, direct sum, the four-dimensional

770
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:50,160
cotangent space, which we're going to call horizontal to u. And the great thing

771
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,080
about the chimeric bundle is that it has an a priori metric. It's got a metrics on

772
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,960
the four, a metric on the ten, and we can always decide that the two of them are

773
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,320
naturally perpendicular to each other. Furthermore, it is almost canonically

774
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,000
isomorphic to the tangent bundle or the cotangent bundle because we either have

775
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,840
four out of fourteen or ten out of fourteen dimensions on the nose. So the

776
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,240
question is, what are we missing? And the answer is that we're missing exactly the

777
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:25,160
data of a connection. So this bundle, chimeric, c, we have c is equal to the

778
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:33,040
tangent bundle of u up to a choice of a connection theta. And this is exactly what

779
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:39,680
we wanted. We have a situation where we have some field on the manifold x in the

780
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,240
form of a connection, which is amenable, more friendly to quantization, which is

781
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:48,160
now determining a metric, turning around the Levy-Chivita game. And the only

782
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,680
problem is, is that we've had to buy ourselves into a different space than the

783
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:59,160
one we thought we wanted to work on. But now, as theta changes, the fermions are

784
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,840
defined on the chimeric bundle, and it's the isomorphism from the chimeric bundle

785
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,920
to the tangent bundle of the space u, which is varying, which means that the

786
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,160
fermions no longer depend on the metric, they no longer depend on the theta

787
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,840
connection. They are there if things go quantum mechanical. And we've achieved our

788
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:21,480
objective of putting the matter fields and the spin one fields on something of the

789
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:35,120
same footing. But, and I want to emphasize this, one thing most of us, we think a lot

790
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,960
about final theories and about unification. But until you actually start

791
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:47,120
daring to try to do it, you don't realize what the process of it feels like. Now,

792
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,560
try to imagine conducting your life where you have no children, let's say, and no

793
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,640
philanthropic urges. What you want to do is you want to use all of your money for

794
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:03,640
yourself and die penniless, right, like a perfect finish. Assuming that that's what

795
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,400
you wanted to do, it would be pretty nerve-wracking at the end, right? How many

796
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,680
days left do I have? How many dollars left do I have? This is the process of

797
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,200
unification in physics. You start giving away all of your most valuable

798
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,840
possessions. And you don't know whether you've given them away too early, whether

799
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,760
you've husband them too long. And so in this process, what we've just done is

800
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,880
we've started to paint ourselves into a corner. We got something we wanted, but

801
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,160
we've given away freedom. We're now dealing with a 14-dimensional world.

802
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:58,720
So let me just sum this up by saying, between fundamental and emergent, standard

803
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:08,880
model and GR. Let's do GR. Fundamental is the metric. Emergent is the

804
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:17,480
connection. Here in GU, it is the connection that's fundamental and the

805
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:25,960
metric that's emergent. In the next unit of GU, so this is sort of the first

806
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,680
unit of GU. Are there any quick questions happening to do with confusion or may I

807
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:39,560
proceed to the next unit? Okay. The next unit of GU is the unified field content.

808
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:50,520
What does it mean for our fields to become unified? There are, in fact, only at

809
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:58,240
this moment two fields that know about X. Theta, which is the connection that we've

810
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:10,360
just talked about, and a section, sigma, that takes us back so that we can

811
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:18,640
communicate back and forth between U and X. We now need field content that only

812
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:32,520
knows about U, which now has a metric depending on theta. A particular member

813
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,400
of the audience is a hedge fund manager who taught me that there is something of

814
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,400
a universal trade, and a universal trade has four components. You have to have a

815
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,800
view, you have to have a trade expression, you have to be able to calculate your

816
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:50,040
cost of carry, and you need a catalyst. Our view is going to be that somebody

817
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:54,400
doesn't understand what trade is possible, and we're going to make a trade that

818
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,200
looks like one of the worst trades of all time, and hopefully, if we have enough

819
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,080
conviction, we're going to have a catalyst to show that we actually got the

820
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,960
better part of the deal. What is that trade? What is it that we think has been

821
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:22,000
blocking progress? In GR, the Ramanian geometry, as we've said, we have the

822
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:30,800
projection operators, and we also have the Levy-Chavita connection. In the

823
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:40,400
auxiliary theory, we have freedom to choose our field content, and we have the

824
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:50,120
ability to get rid of much excess through the symmetries of the gauge group. We

825
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:55,280
are going to take particle theory, and we're going to make a bad trade, or what

826
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:00,120
appears to be a bad trade, which is that we are going to give away the freedom to

827
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,440
choose our field content, which is already extremely, as I think I said in the

828
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:10,080
abstract, baroque, with all of the different particle properties, and we're

829
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,440
going to lose the ability to use the gauge group because we're going to trade it

830
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:41,040
all. You have the family cow, and you have some magic beans. So it's now time to

831
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,080
trade the family cow for the magic beans and bring them home and see whether or

832
01:19:45,080 --> 01:20:09,400
not we got the better of the deal. Okay. What is it that we get for the Levy-Chavita

833
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:16,280
connection? Well, not much. One thing we get is that normally the space of

834
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:22,280
connections is an affine space, not a vector space, but an affine space, almost a

835
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:27,760
vector space, a vector space up to a choice of origin. But with the Levy-Chavita

836
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,160
connection, rather than having an infinite plane with an ability to take

837
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:36,120
differences, but no real ability to have a group structure, you pick out one point

838
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:43,920
which then becomes the origin. That means that any connection A has a torsion

839
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:51,120
tensor A, which is equal to the connection minus the Levy-Chavita connection. So we

840
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:56,480
get a tensor that we don't usually have. Gauge potentials are not usually well

841
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,480
defined, they're only defined up to a choice of gauge. So that's one of the

842
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,640
things we get for our Levy-Chavita connection, but because the gauge group is

843
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,280
going to go missing, this has terrible properties with respect to the gauge

844
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,920
group. It almost looks like a representation, but in fact, if we let the

845
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:22,080
gauge group act, there's going to be an affine shift. Furthermore, as we've said

846
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:27,520
before, the ability to use projection operators together with the gauge group

847
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,800
is frustrated by virtue of the fact that these two things do not commute with

848
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:37,440
each other. So now the question is, how are we going to prove that we're

849
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:49,920
actually making a good trade? Okay. First thing we need to do is that we still

850
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,760
have the right to choose intrinsic field content. We have an intrinsic field

851
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:02,640
theory. So if you consider the structure bundle of the spinners, we built the

852
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:10,080
chimeric bundle, so we can define Dirac spinners on the chimeric bundle. If we're

853
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:15,720
in Euclidean signature, a 14-dimensional manifold has Dirac spinners of dimension

854
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:22,120
2 to the dimension of the space divided by 2. So 2 to the 14 over 2, 2 to the

855
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:36,960
7th is 128. So we have a map into a structure group of U128. At least in

856
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:43,080
Euclidean signature, we can get to mixed signatures later. From that, we can form

857
01:22:43,080 --> 01:23:02,160
the associated bundle and sections of this bundle are either, depending upon how

858
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:16,920
you want to think about it, the gauge group H, or C, a space of sigma fields,

859
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:29,280
nonlinear. There's no reason that we can't choose this as field content. Again,

860
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:35,440
we're being led by the nose like a bull. If we want to make use of the symmetries of

861
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,240
the theory, we have to promote some symmetry to being part of the theory, and we

862
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:43,880
have to let it be subjected to dynamical laws. We're going to lose control over it.

863
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,920
But we're not dead yet, right? We're fighting for our life to make sure that

864
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:53,960
this trade has some hope. So potentially, by including symmetries as field content,

865
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:59,000
we will have some opportunity to make use of the projection. So for those of you

866
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:11,600
who... So when I was thinking about this, I used to be amazed by ships and bottles.

867
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,520
I must confess that I never figured out what the trick was for ships and bottles.

868
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:22,560
But once I saw it, I remembered thinking, that's really clever. So if you've never seen it,

869
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,840
you have a ship which is like a curvature tensor. And imagine that the mast is the

870
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:35,720
Ricci curvature. If you just try to shove it into the bottle, you're undoubtedly going

871
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:41,560
to snap the mast. So you imagine that you've transformed your gauge fields, you've kept

872
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:47,560
track of where the Ricci curvature was, you try to push it from one space like ad-valued

873
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:54,560
two forms into another space like ad-valued one forms where connections live. That's

874
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,480
not a good idea. Instead, what we do is the following. Imagine that you're carrying around

875
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,480
group theoretic information. What you do is you do a transformation based on the group

876
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:10,120
theory. So you lower the mast, you push it through the neck, having some string attached

877
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:19,120
to the mast, and then you undo the transformation on the other side. This is exactly what we're

878
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,640
going to hope is going to save us in this bad trade that we've made. Because we're going

879
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:29,440
to add field content that has the ability to lower the mast and bring the mast back

880
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,920
up, we're going to hope to have a theory which is going to create a commutative situation.

881
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,920
But then once we've had this idea, we start to get a little bolder. Let's think about

882
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:49,600
unified content. We know that we want a space of connections, A, for our field theory. But

883
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,400
we know because we have a Levy-Chevita connection that this is going to be equal on the nose

884
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:06,440
to ad-valued one forms as a vector space. The gauge group represents an ad-valued one

885
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:13,200
forms. So if we also have the gauge group, but we think of that instead as a space of

886
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:20,200
sigma fields, what if we take the semi-direct product at a group theoretic level between

887
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:27,200
the two and call this our group of interest? Well, by analogy, we've always had a problem

888
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:35,820
with the Poincare group being too intrinsically tied to rigid, flat Minkowski space. What

889
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,400
if we wanted to do quantum field theory in some situation, which was more amenable to

890
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:46,160
a curved space situation? It's possible that we should be basing it around something more

891
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:51,720
akin to the gauge group. And in this case, we're mimicking the construction where XC

892
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:58,720
here would be analogous to the Lorenz group, fixing a point in Minkowski space. And ad-valued

893
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:04,960
one forms would be analogous to the four momentums. We take in the semi-direct product to create

894
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,000
the inhomogeneous Lorenz group, otherwise known as the Poincare group, or rather it's

895
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:16,000
double cover to allow spin. So we're going to call this the inhomogeneous gauge group

896
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:25,540
or Iggy. And this is going to be a really interesting space because it has a couple of properties.

897
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:33,540
One is it has a very interesting subgroup. Now, of course, H includes into G by just

898
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:45,260
including onto the first factor. But in fact, there's a more interesting homomorphism brought

899
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:52,320
to you by the Levy-Civita connection. So this magic beam trade is going to start to enter

900
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:57,600
more and more into our consciousness. If I take an element H, and I map that in the

901
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:04,600
obvious way into the first factor, but I map it onto the Morro-Cartain form, I think that's

902
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:21,640
what I wish I remembered more of this stuff, into the second factor, it turns out that

903
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:28,640
this is actually a group homomorphism. And so we have a non-trivial embedding, which

904
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:34,680
is in some sense diagonal between the two factors. That subgroup we are going to refer

905
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:41,680
to as the tilted gauge group. And now our field content, at least in the Bosonic sector,

906
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:47,360
is going to be a group manifold, an infinite dimensional function space league group, but

907
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:54,360
a group nonetheless. And we can now look at G mod the tilted gauge group. And if we have

908
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:07,080
any interesting representation of H, we can form homogeneous vector bundles and work with

909
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:11,520
induced representations. And that's what the fermions are going to be. So the fermions

910
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:17,400
in our theories are going to be H modules. And the idea is that we're going to work

911
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:24,400
with vector bundles, curly E, of the form inhomogeneous gauge group, product it over

912
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:39,800
the tilted gauge group. And we're going to work with vector bundles, curly E, of the

913
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:48,520
form inhomogeneous gauge group. Now just as in the finite dimensional case, we have

914
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:54,920
a linear and a nonlinear component. Right? Because at a topological level, this is just

915
01:29:54,920 --> 01:30:01,920
a Cartian product. So if we wish to take products of fermions, of spinorial fields,

916
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,480
we have a place to accept them. We can't figure out necessarily how to map them into

917
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:11,480
the nonlinear sector, but we don't want to. So just the way when we look at supersymmetry,

918
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:16,960
we can take products of the spin one-half fields and map them into the linear sector.

919
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:23,960
We can do the same thing here. So what we're talking about is something like a supersymmetric

920
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:29,240
extension of the inhomogeneous gauge group analogous to supersymmetric extensions of

921
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:36,240
the double cover of the inhomogeneous Lorentz or Poincare group. Further, because this construction

922
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:43,680
is at the level of groups, we've left a slot on the left-hand side on which to act. So

923
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:50,680
for example, if we want to take regular representations on the group, we can act by the group G on

924
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:55,680
the left-hand side because we're allowing the tilted gauge group to act on the right-hand

925
01:30:55,680 --> 01:31:02,680
side. So it's perfectly built for representation theory. And if you think back to Wigner's classification

926
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:06,840
and the concept that a particle should correspond to an irreducible representation of the inhomogeneous

927
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:13,840
Lorentz group, we may be able to play the same games here up to the issue of infinite dimensionality.

928
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:22,040
So right now our field content is looking pretty good. It's looking unified in the sense

929
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:27,240
that it has an algebraic structure that is not usually enjoyed by field content, and

930
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:32,920
field content from different sectors can interact and know about each other, provided

931
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:39,920
we can drag something out of this with meaning. Now, what would it mean to be able to use

932
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:50,840
a gauge group in an intrinsic theory like this? We would be talking about something like

933
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:58,400
an action, let's say a first order action, and it would take the group G, let's say to

934
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:06,040
the real numbers, invariant, not under the full group, but under the tilted gauge subgroup.

935
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:19,940
And now the question is, do we have any such actions that are particularly nice, and could

936
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:25,940
we recognize them the way Einstein did by trying to write down not the action, and Hilbert

937
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:31,500
was the first one to write that down, but I always feel defensive because I think Einstein

938
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:36,060
and Grossman did so much more to begin the theory in that the Lagrangian that got written

939
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:42,540
down was really just an inevitability. So just humor me for this talk and let me call it

940
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:48,300
the Einstein-Grossman Lagrangian. Hilbert has certainly done fantastic things and has

941
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:55,300
a lot of credit elsewhere, and he did do it first. But here what we had was that Einstein

942
01:32:56,220 --> 01:33:02,140
thought in terms of the differential of the action, not the action itself. So what we're

943
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:09,140
looking for is equations of motion where some field alpha, where alpha belongs to the one

944
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:16,420
forms on the group. Now in this section of GU, unified field content is only one part

945
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:35,660
of it, but what we really want is unified field content plus a tool kit. So what we

946
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:46,660
want is a tool kit. So we've restricted ourselves to one gauge group. This big unitary group

947
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:51,700
on the spinners using whatever sort of inner product naturally exists on the spinners,

948
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:58,700
and not spinners value in an auxiliary structure, but intrinsic spinners. The tool kit that

949
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:07,540
we have is that the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle, the adjoint bundle

950
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:16,140
bundle, looks like the Clifford algebra at the level of vector spaces, which is just

951
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:35,380
looking like the exterior algebra on the chimeric bundle. That means that it's graded

952
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:40,420
by degrees. Chimeric bundle has dimension 14, so there's a 0 part, a 1 part, a 2 part

953
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:47,420
all the way up to 14. Plus we have forms in the manifold. So the question is, if I want

954
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:55,260
to look at omega i valued in the adjoint bundle, there's going to be some element phi i, which

955
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:02,260
is pure trace, right? Because it's the same representations appearing where in the usually

956
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:20,780
auxiliary directions as well as the geometric directions. So we get an entire suite of

957
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:28,620
invariants together with trivially associated invariants that come from using the hodge star

958
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:36,500
operator on the form. So I'm just going to call them for completeness. I'm not going

959
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:43,500
to deal with them. Now this is a tremendous amount of freedom that we've just gained.

960
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:48,980
Normally we keep losing freedom, but this is the first time we actually begin to see

961
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,580
that we have a lot of freedom, and we're going to actually retain some of this freedom to

962
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:59,580
the end of the talk. But the idea being that I can now start to define operators, which

963
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:07,340
correspond to the ship and the bottle problem. I can take field content, epsilon and pi, where

964
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:15,820
epsilon, where these are elements of the inhomogeneous gauge group. In other words,

965
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:23,260
epsilon is a gauge transformation, and pi is a gauge potential. And I can start to define

966
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:35,860
operators. I'm going to use, so in this case I'm going to define operators, and I'm going

967
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:52,940
to define operators. In this case, if I have a phi, which is one of these invariants, in

968
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:59,440
the form piece I can either take a contraction, or I can take a wedge product. In the Lie

969
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:05,940
algebra piece I can either take a Lie product, or because I'm looking at the unitary group

970
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:09,540
there's a second possibility, which is I can multiply everything by i and go from skew

971
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:14,340
her mission to her mission, and take a Jordan product using anti-commutators rather than

972
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:19,060
commutators. So I actually have a fair amount of freedom, and I'm going to use a magic bracket

973
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:23,460
notation, which in whatever situation I'm looking for knows what it wants to be. Does

974
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:28,100
it want to do contraction? Does it want to do wedge product, Lie product, Jordan product?

975
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:35,100
But the point is I now have a suite of ways of moving forms around. So for example, I

976
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:43,620
can define a shear of operator that takes i forms, and I can define a shear of operator

977
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:51,820
valued in the adjoint bundle. To much higher degree forms valued in the adjoint bundle.

978
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:11,780
So in this case, for example, it would take a two form to a d minus three plus two, or

979
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:19,060
a d minus one form. So curvature is an ad-valued two form. And if I had such a she-ab operator,

980
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:30,660
it would take ad-valued two forms to ad-valued d minus one forms, which is exactly the right

981
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:37,820
space to be an alpha coming from the derivative of an action. And this is exactly what Einstein

982
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:44,300
was doing. He took the curvature, which was large, and he bent it back, and he sheared

983
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:50,660
off the vial curvature, and they took that part, and he pushed it back along the space

984
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:55,780
of metrics to give us something which we nowadays call Ricci flow, an ability for the curvature

985
01:38:55,780 --> 01:39:03,340
to direct us to the next structure. Well, we're doing the same thing here. We're taking

986
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:10,340
the curvature, and we can now push it back onto the space of connections.

987
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:40,340
So in this case, the idea is that we've actually got something for our magic beans. We have

988
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:58,740
an ability now to get equations of motion, which go along the group in some sense. It's

989
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:04,740
as if it was a gradient vector field, except we're using forms rather than vectors. But

990
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:11,740
now, what are the transformation properties? Well, because the curvature, so you have she-ab,

991
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:18,740
because the curvature of a connection, hit by a gauge transformation, is equal on the

992
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:25,740
nose to the adjoin action on the Lie algebra of the curvature, we know that if we have

993
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:55,740
two possible actions of conjugation under a bracket, and the bracket respects the action

994
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,540
of the gauge group, we know that this is going to be well preserved. In other words, we're

995
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:08,300
going to get a form that is gauge invariant relative to the tilted gauge group. And so

996
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:15,940
as a result, we now have the possibility for equations of motion, which are well defined,

997
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:19,660
even though they involve projection operators, because we've built the symmetries into the

998
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:26,660
theory and we're working on a group manifold to begin with. What about the torsion? Can

999
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:34,260
we rescue the torsion? Here again, we have good news. The torsion is problematic, but

1000
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:41,100
if I look at a different field, which I'm going to call the augmented torsion, and I

1001
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:48,140
define it to be the regular torsion, which would be pi, minus this expression, this turns

1002
01:41:53,620 --> 01:42:00,620
out to be beautifully invariant again. So neither this term nor this term is gauge

1003
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:06,780
invariant, but they fail to be gauge invariant in exactly the same way. So an important principle

1004
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,980
of life, which I took too long to realize, is that if you have one disease, you're in

1005
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:14,420
real trouble. But if you have two diseases, you always have the possibility of having

1006
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:18,140
one disease kill the other disease. This is true in renormalization theory, it's true

1007
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:23,260
in black-scholes theory, it's true all over the place. So what we have here is we've got

1008
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:27,460
more diseases into the theory, but an even number of diseases allow us to have no disease

1009
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:33,060
at all. So now we have two great tensors. We've got one tensor coming from the curvature

1010
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:40,060
and the Shiav operator, we have another tensor coming from the torsion and it's augmentation.

1011
01:42:53,500 --> 01:43:00,500
We're doing okay.

1012
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:10,060
We're not doing physics yet, we're just building tools. We've built ourselves a little bit

1013
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:16,740
of freedom, we have some reprieves, we've still got some very big debts to pay back for this

1014
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:21,460
magic beans trade. We're in the wrong dimension, we don't have good field content, we're stuck

1015
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:26,260
on this one spinner, we've built ourselves some projection operators, we've picked up

1016
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:33,420
some symmetric non-linear sigma field. What can we write down in terms of equations of

1017
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:41,660
motion? Let's start with Einstein's concept. If we do Shiav of the curvature tensor of

1018
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:53,860
a gauge potential hit with an operator defined by the epsilon sigma field, it's going to

1019
01:43:56,660 --> 01:44:03,660
be 0, plus the star operator acting on the augmented torsion of the pair. This contains

1020
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:16,500
all of the information when pi is 0 in Einstein's tensor. In other words, there is a spinorial

1021
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:22,940
analog of the vial curvature, a spinorial analog of the traceless Ricci curvature and

1022
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:29,940
a spinorial analog of the scalar curvature. This operator should shear off the analog

1023
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:35,020
of the vial curvature just the way Einstein's projection shears off the vial curvature when

1024
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:40,380
you're looking at the tangent bundle. This term, which is now gauge invariant, may be

1025
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:47,380
considered as containing a piece that looks like lambda times g mu nu, or a cosmological

1026
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:54,620
constant. This piece here can be made to contain a piece that looks like Einstein's tensor,

1027
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:11,420
and so this looks very much like the vacuum field equation. We have to add in something

1028
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:16,700
else. I'm going to be a little bit vague because I'm still giving myself some freedom as we

1029
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:23,700
write this up. But we're going to define whatever tensor we need for these terms here. This is

1030
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:38,500
gauge invariant, this is gauge invariant, and this is gauge invariant with respect to

1031
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:45,980
the tilted gauge group. These two tensors together should be exact, and this tensor on

1032
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:55,620
its own should be exact. We're going to call the exact tensor the swerveture. So the particular

1033
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:05,300
Chiav operator we call the swerve, so it's swerve curvature plus the adjustment needed

1034
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:12,300
for exactness, and another gauge invariant term which is not usually gauge invariant.

1035
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:21,300
So that's pretty cool. If that works, we've now taken the Einstein equation, and we've

1036
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:30,180
put it not on the space of metrics, but we've put a generalization and an analog on the

1037
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:35,780
space of gauge potentials much more amenable to quantization with much more algebraic structure

1038
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:39,940
and symmetry in the form of the inhomogeneous gauge group and its homogeneous vector bundles,

1039
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:46,940
some of which may be super symmetric. Now the question is, we've integrated so tightly

1040
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:55,740
with the matter field, we have to ask ourselves the question, can we see unification here?

1041
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:05,940
Let's define matter content in the form of omega zero tensored in the spinners, which

1042
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:12,940
is a fancy way of saying spinners. Together with a copy of the one forms tensored in the

1043
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:24,380
spinners. And let me come up with two other copies of the same data.

1044
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:37,180
So I'll make a d minus one just by duality, so imagine that there's a hodge star operator.

1045
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:48,460
And when I was a little kid, I had the soma cube. I don't know if you ever played with

1046
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:52,940
one of these things, they're fantastic. And I later found out that this guy who invented

1047
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:57,060
the soma cube, which you had to put together pieces, there was one piece that looked like

1048
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:03,220
this object. And he was like this amazing guy in the resistance during World War II.

1049
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:09,980
So I would like to name this the somatic complex, after I guess his name was Piet Hein, I think.

1050
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:16,980
So this complex, I'm going to choose to start filling in some operators. The exterior derivative

1051
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:22,020
coupled to a connection, but in the case of spinners, we're going to put a slash through

1052
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:29,020
and let's make this the identity. We'd now like to come up with a second operator here.

1053
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:34,660
And this second operator here should have the property that the complex should be exact

1054
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:41,660
and the obstruction to it being a true complex, to nil potency, should be exactly the generalization

1055
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:51,060
of the Einstein equations, thus unifying the spinorial matter with the nil potency.

1056
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:57,020
The intrinsic replacement for the curvature equations.

1057
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:04,020
Well, we know that DA, composed with itself, is going to be the curvature. And we know

1058
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:14,460
that we want that to be hit by a shiav operator. And if shiav is a derivation, you can start

1059
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:22,140
to see that that's going to be curvature, so you want something like fA followed by

1060
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:29,260
shiav over here to cancel. Then you think, okay, well how am I going to get at getting

1061
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:34,460
this augmented torsion? And then you realize that the information in the inhomogeneous

1062
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:39,180
gauge group, you actually have information not for one connection, but for two connections.

1063
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:46,180
So in one case, I can do plus star to pick up the A sub pi, but I'm also going to have

1064
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:03,980
a derivative operator if I just do a star operation. So I need another derivative operator

1065
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:10,540
to kill it off here. So I'm going to take minus the derivative with respect to the connection

1066
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:17,540
H inverse DA naught H, which defines the connection one form as well as having the same derivative

1067
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:26,460
coming from the Levy-Civita connection on U. So in other words, I have two derivative

1068
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:31,140
operators here. I have two ad-valued one forms. The difference between them is going to be

1069
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:36,100
of zero with order, and it's going to be precisely the augmented torsion. That's the same game

1070
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:43,100
I'm going to repeat here. So I'm going to do the same thing here. I'm going to define

1071
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:50,100
a bunch of terms where in the numerator I'm going to pick up the pi as well as the derivative

1072
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:09,620
in the denominator because I have no derivative here. I'm going to pick up this H inverse

1073
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:17,060
DA naught H. I'm going to do that again on the other side. There are going to be plus

1074
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:34,980
and minus signs, but it's a magic bracket that knows whether or not it should be a plus

1075
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:41,380
sign or a minus sign. I apologize for that, but I'm not able to keep that straight. And

1076
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:48,380
then there's going to be one extra term where all these T's have the epsilon and pi. So

1077
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:56,660
some crazy series of differential operators on the northern route. So if you take the

1078
01:51:56,660 --> 01:52:01,820
high road or you take the low road, when you take the composition of the two, the differential

1079
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:07,580
operators fall out, and you're left with an obstruction term that looks like the Einstein

1080
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:14,580
field equation. That's pretty good, if true. Can you go farther? Well, look at how close

1081
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:21,580
this field content is to the picture from deformation theory that we learned about in low-dimensions.

1082
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:29,500
The low-dimensional world works by saying that similar to what we learned in the previous

1083
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:38,500
lecture, we're going to look at what we learned in the previous lecture. We're going to look

1084
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:51,580
atalities mapped to field content, mapped to equations, usually in the curvature. And

1085
01:52:54,620 --> 01:53:00,620
when you linearize that, if you're in low enough dimensions, you have omega 0, omega

1086
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:07,040
1, sometimes omega 0 again, and then something that comes from omega 2. And if you can get

1087
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:12,140
that sequence to terminate by looking at something like a half signature theorem or a bent back

1088
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:15,300
diram complex in the case of dimension three,

1089
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:16,600
you have an Atia-Singer theory.

1090
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:18,260
And remember, we need some way to get out

1091
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:20,780
of infinite dimensional trouble.

1092
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:23,060
You have to have someone to call when things go wrong

1093
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:25,460
overseas and you have to be able to get your way home.

1094
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:27,420
And in some sense, we call an Atia-Singer

1095
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,620
and say we're in some infinite dimensional space.

1096
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:32,220
Can't you cut out some finite dimensional problem

1097
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,400
that we can solve even though we start getting ourselves

1098
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,860
into serious trouble?

1099
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:40,500
And so we're going to do the same thing down here.

1100
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:49,220
We're going to have omega 0 add, omega 1 add, direct sum,

1101
01:53:49,220 --> 01:54:03,700
omega 0 add, omega d minus 1 add.

1102
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:05,140
And it's almost the same operators.

1103
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:10,420
And this is now not just a great guess.

1104
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:13,820
It's actually the information for the deformation theory

1105
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:18,620
of the linearized replacement of the Einstein field

1106
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:19,860
equations.

1107
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:22,340
So this is computing the Zyrowski tangent space,

1108
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:25,500
just as if you were doing self-dual theory,

1109
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,220
or churn-Simon's theory.

1110
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:30,500
You've got two somatic complexes, right?

1111
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:33,300
One of them is Bose.

1112
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,420
One of them is Fermi.

1113
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:40,260
The obstruction to both of them is a common generalization

1114
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:42,060
of the Einstein field equations.

1115
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:48,540
What's more is if you start to think about this,

1116
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:52,660
this is some version of Hodg's theory with funky operators.

1117
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:56,140
So you can ask yourself, well, what are the harmonic forms

1118
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,140
in a fractional spin context?

1119
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:01,140
Well, they're different depending upon whether you

1120
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:04,580
take the degree 0 piece together with the degree 2 piece,

1121
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:05,780
or you take the degree 1 piece.

1122
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,980
Let's just take the degree 1 piece.

1123
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:13,380
You get some kind of equation.

1124
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:16,940
So I'm going to decide that I have a zeta field, which is an

1125
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:23,860
omega 1 tensor spinors, and a field new, which is a zeta

1126
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:32,980
spinors, and a field new, which always strikes me as a

1127
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:47,460
Yiddish field, new is omega 0 tensor S. What equation would

1128
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,780
they solve if we were doing Hodg's theory relative to

1129
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,780
this complex?

1130
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:56,220
The equation would look something like this.

1131
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:13,980
There'd be one equation that was very simple, and then

1132
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,820
there'd be one equation that would be like really hard to

1133
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:16,820
guess.

1134
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:46,420
I hope I'm not screwing this up.

1135
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:58,180
But all these boards, I still feel like I'm

1136
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,620
managing to run out of room.

1137
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:49,460
Now, if you have something like that, that would be a

1138
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:52,420
hell of a Dirac equation.

1139
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:55,660
You've got differential operators over here.

1140
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:57,020
You've got differential operators.

1141
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:08,580
I guess I didn't write them in.

1142
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,020
But you would have two differential operators over

1143
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:13,180
here, and you'd have this differential operator coming

1144
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:15,020
from this more cartain form.

1145
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:16,980
So I apologize on being a little loose here.

1146
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:21,300
But the idea is you have two of these terms of 0th order,

1147
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:23,540
three of these terms would be first order.

1148
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:26,060
And on this side, one term would be first order.

1149
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:33,660
And that's not there.

1150
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,660
That was a mistake.

1151
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:39,260
Oh, no, sorry.

1152
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:41,820
That was a mistake, calling it a mistake.

1153
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:44,300
These are two separate equations.

1154
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:48,220
So you have two separate fields, new in zeta.

1155
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:51,540
And you have a couple set of differential equations that are

1156
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:53,580
playing the role of the Dirac theory.

1157
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:56,740
Coming from the Hodge theory of a complex whose

1158
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:59,420
obstruction to being a cosmology theory would be the

1159
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:02,260
replacement to the Einstein field equations, which would be

1160
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:07,100
rendered gauge invariant on a group relative to a tilted

1161
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:08,900
subgroup.

1162
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:09,820
OK.

1163
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:14,380
So now we've dealt with two of the three sectors.

1164
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:18,980
Is there any generalization of the Yang-Mills equation?

1165
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:22,220
Well, if we were to take the Einstein field equation

1166
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:27,500
generalization and take the norm square of it, oh, there's

1167
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:31,900
some point I should make here, just one second.

1168
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:35,580
I've been treating this as if everything is first order.

1169
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:43,540
But what really happens here is that you've got symmetries,

1170
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:53,740
you've got symmetric field content, you've got ordinary

1171
01:59:53,740 --> 02:00:02,980
connections, and we're neglecting to draw the fact

1172
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,460
that there have to be equations here, too.

1173
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:07,100
These equations are first order.

1174
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:12,500
So why do we get to call this a first order theory if there

1175
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:16,780
are equations here which are of second order?

1176
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,380
Well, it's not a pure first order theory.

1177
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:21,060
But when I say a first order theory in this context, what I

1178
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:24,020
really mean is that the second order equations are

1179
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:26,740
completely redundant on the first order equations by

1180
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:28,620
virtue of the symmetry principle.

1181
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,260
That is, any solution of the first order equations should

1182
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:36,820
automatically imply a solution of the second order equations.

1183
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:41,380
So from that perspective, I can pretend that this isn't here

1184
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:43,780
because it is sufficient to solve the first order equations.

1185
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:58,860
So I can now look, let's call that entire replacement, which

1186
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:00,060
we previously called alpha.

1187
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:02,100
I'm going to set alpha equal to epsilon because I've actually

1188
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,940
been using epsilon.

1189
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:07,260
The portion that is just the first order equations, and take

1190
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:10,660
the normed square of that, that gives me a new Lagrangian.

1191
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:14,180
And if I solve that new Lagrangian, it leads to

1192
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:19,140
equations of motion that look like exactly what we said before.

1193
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:29,660
And it ends up defining an operator that looks

1194
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,540
something like this.

1195
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:37,380
dA star, the adjoint of the Shiav operator.

1196
02:01:37,380 --> 02:02:04,260
So in other words, this piece gives you some portion that

1197
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:07,940
looks like, right, from the Swarovitcher tensor.

1198
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:09,860
There's going to be some component that's playing the

1199
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:13,100
role of Einstein's field equations directly in the

1200
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:16,060
Ricci tensor, but generalized.

1201
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:18,500
And then you're going to have some differential operator

1202
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:22,340
here so that the replacement for the Yang-Mills term, instead

1203
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:27,060
of dA star of fA, you've got these two Shiav and adjoint

1204
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:31,460
Shiav together in the center, generalizing the

1205
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:33,540
Yang-Mills theory.

1206
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,540
Then you say, well, how come we don't just see the

1207
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,540
Yang-Mills theory?

1208
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:39,260
Why don't we see general relativity as well?

1209
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,620
But in the full expansion, there's also a term that's

1210
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,900
zero at the order that's effectively acting like the

1211
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:46,060
identity, which hits this as well.

1212
02:02:46,060 --> 02:02:47,980
So you have one piece that looks like the Yang-Mills

1213
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:50,860
theory, and in these second order equations, you also

1214
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:55,460
have a piece that looks like the Einstein theory.

1215
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:59,020
And this is in the vacuum equations.

1216
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:05,300
So then the question is, how do you see the Dirac theory

1217
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:07,060
coming out of this?

1218
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:09,220
And so what we're just trying to put together now before we

1219
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:14,460
come out with the manuscript for this is putting these two

1220
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:18,460
elliptic complexes together, the Dirac terms, go between the

1221
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:21,140
two complexes.

1222
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:23,540
So the idea is that the stress energy tensor should be the

1223
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:27,660
up and back term, and the Dirac equations should come out

1224
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:31,020
of the term that goes up and over versus the term that goes

1225
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:33,060
over and up.

1226
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:34,900
And you need some cancellations to make sure that

1227
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,580
everything is of zero with order,

1228
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:38,980
properly invariant, et cetera.

1229
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:41,100
And that's taking a little time, because frankly, I'm not

1230
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,620
good at keeping track of indices, minus

1231
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:43,940
signs, left, right.

1232
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:45,620
It's a learning-disabled nightmare.

1233
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:00,060
We've got one more unit to go.

1234
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:02,060
I mean, there's a fifth unit that has to do with

1235
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,500
mathematical applications, but this is sort of a physics

1236
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:05,780
talk for today.

1237
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:08,980
Is there any questions before we go into the last unit and

1238
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:12,500
then really handle questions for real?

1239
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,060
All right, let me show you the next little bit.

1240
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,660
We've got problems.

1241
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:22,340
We're not in four dimensions, we're in 14.

1242
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:24,300
We don't have great field content, because we've just

1243
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,900
got these unadorned spinners, and we're doing gauge

1244
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:31,740
transformations effectively on the intrinsic geometric

1245
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:35,700
quantities, not on some safe auxiliary data that's

1246
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:40,140
tensor-producted with what our spinners are.

1247
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:42,380
How is it that we're going to find anything realistic?

1248
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,500
And then we have to remember, everything we've been doing

1249
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:47,220
recently has been done on you.

1250
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:58,420
We've forgotten about x.

1251
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,220
How does all of this look to x?

1252
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:07,340
So x is sitting down here, and all the action is

1253
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,820
happening up here on u14.

1254
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:11,500
There's a projection operator.

1255
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:12,740
I've used pi twice.

1256
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:15,780
It's not here in the field content, it's just projection.

1257
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:19,620
And I've got a sigma, which is a section.

1258
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:38,780
What does zeta pulled back or nu pulled back look like on

1259
02:05:38,780 --> 02:06:06,140
x4?

1260
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:10,980
Let's try to think about how we would come up with this field

1261
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,020
content, starting from first principle.

1262
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:18,180
Let's imagine that there's nothing to begin with.

1263
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,980
Then you have one copy of matter, whatever it is that we

1264
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:27,180
see in our world, the first generation.

1265
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:32,100
In order for that to become interesting, it has to have an

1266
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:38,060
equation, so it has to get mapped somewhere.

1267
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:40,340
Then we see the muon and all the rest of the matter that

1268
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:43,540
comes with it, and we have a second generation.

1269
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:49,580
Then in the mid-1970s, Pearl finds the tau particle, and we

1270
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:51,220
start to get panicked that we don't

1271
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:54,420
understand what's going on.

1272
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:56,900
One thing we can do is we can move these equations around

1273
02:06:56,900 --> 02:07:02,100
a little bit, and move the equation for the first

1274
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:04,460
generation back.

1275
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:06,700
And then we can start adding particles.

1276
02:07:06,700 --> 02:07:08,180
Let's imagine that we could guess what

1277
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:09,740
particles we'd add.

1278
02:07:09,740 --> 02:07:14,780
We'd add a pseudo generation of 16 particles, spin three halves

1279
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:18,700
never before seen, not necessarily super partners,

1280
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:21,940
but we read a Schwinger matter with familiar internal quantum

1281
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:24,460
numbers, but potentially so that they're flipped, so that

1282
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,500
matter looks like anti-matter to this generation.

1283
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:34,180
Then we add, just for the heck of it, 144 spin one-half

1284
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:37,660
fermions, which contain a bunch of particles with

1285
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:40,740
familiar quantum numbers, but also some very exotic looking

1286
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:42,580
particles that nobody's ever seen before.

1287
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:49,140
Now we start doing something different.

1288
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:51,380
We make an accusation.

1289
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:54,340
One of our generations isn't a regular generation.

1290
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:55,700
It's an imposter.

1291
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:59,420
At low energy in a cooled state, potentially it looks just

1292
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:01,580
the same as these other generations.

1293
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:05,340
But were we somehow able to turn up the energy?

1294
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:08,180
Imagine that it would unify differently with this new

1295
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:11,980
matter that we've posited, rather than simply unifying

1296
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,300
onto itself.

1297
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:15,940
So two of the generations would unify onto themselves, but

1298
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:19,460
this third generation would fuse with the new particles

1299
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:22,740
that we've already added.

1300
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:25,300
We consolidate geometrically.

1301
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:28,860
We can add some zero-eth order terms.

1302
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:32,540
And we imagine that there is an elliptic complex that would

1303
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:35,940
govern this state of affairs.

1304
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:38,980
We then choose to add some stuff that we can't see at all,

1305
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:40,140
that's dark.

1306
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:44,860
And this matter would be governed by forces that were

1307
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:45,700
dark, too.

1308
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:47,700
There might be dark electromagnetism, and dark

1309
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:50,900
strong, and dark weak.

1310
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:53,380
It might be that things break in that sector completely

1311
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:54,020
differently.

1312
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:57,060
And it doesn't break down to an SU3 cross SU2 cross U1,

1313
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:59,780
because these are different SU3s, SU2s, and U1s.

1314
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:04,580
And it may be that there would be a high-energy SU5, or

1315
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:08,540
some patissalaam model.

1316
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:11,740
Imagine then that chirality was not fundamental, but it was

1317
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:14,900
emergent, that you had some complex.

1318
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:17,300
And as long as there were cross terms, these two halves

1319
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:18,340
would talk to each other.

1320
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:21,020
But if the cross terms went away, the two terms would

1321
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:22,540
become decoupled.

1322
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:24,700
And just the way we have a left hand and we have a right

1323
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:28,140
hand, and you ask me, imagine you have a neurological

1324
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:31,340
condition and an oliver sac, sort of an idiom, and if

1325
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:33,340
somebody's only aware of one side of their body, and they

1326
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:34,660
say, oh my god, I'm deformed.

1327
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:36,940
I'm asymmetric.

1328
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:39,060
But we actually have a symmetry between the two

1329
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:40,500
things that can't see each other.

1330
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:45,700
Then we would still have a chiral world, but the

1331
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:47,740
chirality wouldn't be fundamental.

1332
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:50,900
There'd be something else keeping the fermions light.

1333
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:53,260
And that would be the absence of the cross terms.

1334
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:55,940
Now, if you look at what happens in our replacement for

1335
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:59,940
the Einstein field equations, the term that would

1336
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:01,700
counterbalance the scalar curvature.

1337
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:04,540
If you put these equations on a sphere, they wouldn't be

1338
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:09,220
satisfied if the t term had a zero expectation value, because

1339
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:11,580
there would be non-trivial scalar curvature in the

1340
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:15,420
swervature terms, but there'd be nothing to counterbalance it.

1341
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:17,860
So it's fundamentally the scalar curvature that would

1342
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:23,620
coax the VEV on the augmented torsion out of the vacuum to

1343
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:25,060
have a non-zero level.

1344
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:27,460
And if you pumped up that sphere and it smeared out the

1345
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:29,900
curvature, which you can't get rid of because of topological

1346
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:34,980
considerations, let's say from Chernvet theory, you would

1347
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:39,540
have a very diffuse, very small term.

1348
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:41,620
And that term would be the term that was playing the role of

1349
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:43,660
the cosmological constant.

1350
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,500
So in a large universe, you'd have a curvature that was

1351
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:50,020
spread out, and things would be very light, and things would

1352
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:52,540
get very dark due to the absence of curvature

1353
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:53,980
linking the sectors.

1354
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:02,140
And that turns out to be exactly our complex.

1355
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:11,140
So in other words, just to recap, starting with nothing

1356
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:17,020
other than a four-man fold, we built a bundle U. The bundle

1357
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:19,300
U had no metric, but it almost had a metric.

1358
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:22,380
It had a metric up to a connection.

1359
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:24,580
There was another bundle on top of that bundle called the

1360
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:25,420
chimeric bundle.

1361
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:28,780
The chimeric bundle had an intrinsic metric.

1362
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:30,700
We built our spinners on that.

1363
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:33,620
We restricted ourselves to those spinners.

1364
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:39,020
We moved most of our attention to the emergent metric on U14,

1365
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:43,380
which gave us a map between the chimeric bundle and the

1366
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:45,620
tangent bundle of U14.

1367
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:51,420
We built a toolkit allowing us to choose symmetric field

1368
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:56,340
content, to define equations of motion on the cotangent space

1369
02:11:56,340 --> 02:12:00,100
of that field content, to form a homogeneous vector bundle

1370
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:05,660
with the fermions, to come up with unifications of the

1371
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:08,380
Einstein field equations, Yang-Mills equations, and

1372
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:10,020
Dirac equations.

1373
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:13,420
We then broke those things apart under decomposition,

1374
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:17,260
pulling things back from U14, and we found a three-generation

1375
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:20,700
model where nothing has been put in by hand.

1376
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:25,860
And we have a 10-dimensional normal component, which looks

1377
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:27,140
like the spin-10 theory.

1378
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:37,220
I can tell you where there are problems in this story.

1379
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:40,100
I can tell you that when we moved from Euclidean metric

1380
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:43,300
to Minkowski metric, we seemed to be off by a sign somewhere,

1381
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:45,740
or I could be mistaken.

1382
02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:49,060
I could tell you that the propagation in 14 dimensions

1383
02:12:49,060 --> 02:12:51,620
has to be worked out so that we would be fooled into thinking

1384
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:53,100
we were in a four-dimensional world.

1385
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:57,100
There are lots of things to ask about this theory.

1386
02:12:57,100 --> 02:13:02,060
But I find it remarkable that tying our hands, we find

1387
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:04,980
ourselves with new equations, unifications, and three

1388
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:09,860
generations, in a way that seems surprisingly rich,

1389
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:17,140
certainly unexpected, and I think I'll stop there.

1390
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:18,700
Thank you very much for your time.

1391
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:28,300
So thanks for watching that video.

1392
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:31,340
What I thought I would do, since that was the first time I'd

1393
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:34,900
really presented the theory at all in public.

1394
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:38,220
And I'd gotten somewhat turned around on my trip to England

1395
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:42,020
and trying probably stupidly to do last minute corrections,

1396
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:44,300
got me a bit confused in a few places,

1397
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:46,180
and I wrote some things on the board I probably

1398
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:51,020
shouldn't have, I thought I would try a partial explainer

1399
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:53,780
for technically-oriented people so that they're not

1400
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:56,540
mystified by the video.

1401
02:13:56,540 --> 02:14:00,100
And any errors here are my own.

1402
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:04,140
I'm known to make many, so hopefully they

1403
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:06,620
won't be too serious, but we'll find out.

1404
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:11,100
So this is a supplementary explainer for the geometric unity

1405
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:14,540
talk at Oxford that you just saw.

1406
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:17,300
First of all, I think the most important thing to begin with

1407
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:20,900
is to ask what new hard problems arise when you're

1408
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:23,100
trying to think about a fundamental theory that

1409
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:26,100
aren't found in any earlier theory.

1410
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,500
Now, every time you have an effective theory, which

1411
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:32,100
is a partial theory, there is always the idea

1412
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:36,260
that you can have recourse to a lower-level strata.

1413
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:39,460
So you don't have to explain, in some sense, everything

1414
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:42,580
coming from very little or nothing.

1415
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:45,740
I think that the really difficult issue that people

1416
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:49,580
don't talk enough about is the problem of the fire that

1417
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:50,580
lights itself.

1418
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:52,380
And I think this was beautifully demonstrated

1419
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:55,220
by M.C. Escher in his famous lithograph,

1420
02:14:55,220 --> 02:15:00,100
Drawing Hands, where he takes the idea of the canvas

1421
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:03,580
or the paper as a given, but somehow he

1422
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:07,860
imagines that the canvas could wheel into existence

1423
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:12,100
the ink needed to draw the hands that move the pen

1424
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:14,740
to draw the hands.

1425
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:18,060
That concept is actually the super tricky part,

1426
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:20,700
in my opinion, about going from effective theories

1427
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:23,380
to any attempt at a fundamental theory.

1428
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:26,460
So with that said, what I want to think about

1429
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:32,300
is what antecedents does this concept have in physics?

1430
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:34,020
And I find that there really aren't

1431
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:37,020
any candidate theories of everything

1432
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:39,140
or unified field theories that I can find

1433
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:44,140
that plausibly give us an idea of how a canvas would

1434
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:48,020
wheel an entire universe into being.

1435
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:51,300
And so that really, to me, is the conceptual problem

1436
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:53,860
that I think bedoubles this and makes

1437
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:55,980
this step quite a bit more difficult

1438
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:59,700
than some of the previous technical steps.

1439
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:01,420
If you ask for antecedents, however,

1440
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:03,580
there is one that, at least within physics,

1441
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:04,900
is relatively famous.

1442
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:08,180
And that is by John Archibald Wheeler.

1443
02:16:08,180 --> 02:16:09,860
And it is a picture, in some sense,

1444
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:12,540
of the universe contemplating itself.

1445
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:15,660
And so this idea that somehow the universe would contemplate

1446
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:19,020
itself into existence, maybe the letter U

1447
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:22,140
is, in some sense, analogous to the paper

1448
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:26,060
and somehow the I, rather than the hand,

1449
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:29,980
is drawn across to look at a different part of the U.

1450
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,100
And whether or not that has meaning

1451
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,340
is intrinsically always a question.

1452
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:36,660
People are animated by it, but I don't know

1453
02:16:36,660 --> 02:16:38,820
that people have actually worked on it.

1454
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:41,420
The quote of Einstein's, I think,

1455
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:44,180
that really speaks to me often the most,

1456
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:46,380
and maybe even was my thesis problem,

1457
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:51,340
was he asked whether the creator had any choice

1458
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:53,500
in how the universe was constructed.

1459
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:56,780
And so I think if you believe that the canvas is itself,

1460
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:05,860
that which generates all of the content

1461
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:09,100
and all of the action, you're left with a puzzle

1462
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,660
as to how would you move forward from this?

1463
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:15,220
It might be easier, in a mathematical sense,

1464
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:18,380
to temporarily put the U on its back,

1465
02:17:18,380 --> 02:17:21,660
to put it more in line with a standard picture

1466
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,620
that many mathematicians and physicists

1467
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:24,780
will be familiar with.

1468
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:32,420
In sector one of the geometric unity theory,

1469
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:35,740
space time is replaced and recovered

1470
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:39,020
by the observers contemplating itself.

1471
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:41,580
And so there are several sectors of GU,

1472
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:44,620
and I wanted to go through at least four of them.

1473
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:50,380
In Einstein's space time, we have not only four degrees

1474
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:52,780
of freedom, but also a space time metric

1475
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:55,580
representing rulers and protractors.

1476
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:58,100
If we're going to replace that, it's very tricky

1477
02:17:58,100 --> 02:17:59,940
because it's almost impossible to think

1478
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:03,500
about what would be underneath Einstein's theory.

1479
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:06,220
Now there's a huge problem in the spinorial sector,

1480
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:08,940
which I don't know why more people don't worry about,

1481
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:11,220
which is that spinners aren't defined

1482
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:15,860
for representations of the double cover of GL4R,

1483
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:20,100
the general linear groups effective spin analog.

1484
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:22,660
And as such, if we imagine that we will one day

1485
02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:26,300
quantize gravity, we will lose our definition,

1486
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:30,220
not of the electrons, but let's say of the medium

1487
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:32,100
in which the electrons operate.

1488
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:34,940
That is, there will be no spinorial bundle

1489
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:37,500
until we have an observation of a metric.

1490
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:42,500
So one thing we can do is to take a manifold xd

1491
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:45,860
as the starting point and see if we can create

1492
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:48,140
an entire universe from no other data,

1493
02:18:48,140 --> 02:18:49,820
not even with a metric.

1494
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:53,900
So since we don't choose a metric, what we instead do

1495
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:57,740
is to work over the space of all possible point-wise metrics.

1496
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:59,580
So not quite in the Feynman sense,

1497
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:04,580
but in the sense that we will work over a bundle

1498
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:10,060
that is of a quite a bit larger dimension.

1499
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:13,660
So for example, if x was a four-dimensional,

1500
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:17,060
therefore d equals four, then y in this case

1501
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:19,780
would be d squared, which would be 16,

1502
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:22,820
plus 3d, which would be 12, making 28,

1503
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:25,220
divided by two, which would be 14.

1504
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:27,700
So in other words, a four-dimensional universe,

1505
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:30,500
or sorry, a four-dimensional proto-spacetime,

1506
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,220
not a spacetime, but a proto-spacetime with no metric,

1507
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:35,900
would give rise to a 14-dimensional

1508
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:40,620
observer's portion called y.

1509
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:45,220
Now I believe that in the lecture in Oxford,

1510
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:48,140
I called that u, so I'm sorry for the confusion,

1511
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:49,420
but of course this shifts around

1512
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:51,300
every time I take it out of the garage,

1513
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,740
and that's one of the problems with working on a theory

1514
02:19:53,740 --> 02:19:55,640
in solitude for many years.

1515
02:19:57,660 --> 02:19:59,540
So we have two separate spaces,

1516
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:01,540
and we have fields on the two spaces.

1517
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:04,220
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer

1518
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:08,340
to fields on the xd space by Hebrew letters.

1519
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:10,500
So instead of g mu nu for a metric,

1520
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:15,060
I just wrote gimel mem nun,

1521
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:18,300
and the idea being that I want to separate Latin

1522
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:23,300
and Greek fields on the y space from the rather rarer field

1523
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:26,640
that actually live directly on x.

1524
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,220
So this is a little bit confusing.

1525
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:30,500
One way of thinking about it is to think

1526
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:35,540
of the observer's as the stands plus the pitch in a stadium.

1527
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:39,480
I think I may have said that in the lecture,

1528
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:43,180
but this is what replaces the questions of where and when

1529
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:46,700
in the newspaper's story that is a fundamental theory.

1530
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:48,900
Where and when correspond to space and time?

1531
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:52,860
Who and what correspond to bosons and fermions?

1532
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:56,860
And how and why correspond to equations

1533
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,700
and the Lagrangian that generates them?

1534
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:01,980
So if you think about those six quantities,

1535
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:03,740
you'll realize that that's really what the content

1536
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:05,500
of a fundamental theory is assuming

1537
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:07,100
that it can be quantized properly.

1538
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:10,500
Most fields, and in this case,

1539
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:15,500
we're going to call the collection of two tuples, omega.

1540
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:18,860
So inside of omega, that will be in the first tuple,

1541
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:21,580
we'll have epsilon and pi written,

1542
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:23,900
sort of a non-traditional variation

1543
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,100
of how we write this symbol for pi.

1544
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:31,140
In the second tuple, we'll have the letters new and zeta,

1545
02:21:31,180 --> 02:21:32,520
and I would like them not to move

1546
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:35,620
because they honor particular people who are important.

1547
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,820
So most fields, in this case, omega,

1548
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:41,700
are dancing on y, which was called u

1549
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:43,300
in the lecture, unfortunately.

1550
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:45,820
But they're observed via pullback

1551
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:47,140
as if they lived on x.

1552
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,740
In other words, if you're sitting in the stands,

1553
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:51,700
you might feel that you're actually literally on the pitch,

1554
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:53,220
even though that's not true.

1555
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:55,980
So what we've done is we've taken the u of Wheeler,

1556
02:21:55,980 --> 02:21:59,220
we've put it on its back, and created a w structure.

1557
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:01,060
And the w structure is meant to say

1558
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:03,100
that there's a bundle on top of a bundle.

1559
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:06,620
Again, geometric unity is more flexible than this,

1560
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:09,260
but I wanted to make the most concrete approach

1561
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:11,880
to this possible for at least this introduction.

1562
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:17,220
And sometimes we don't need to state

1563
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:19,900
that y would in fact be a bundle.

1564
02:22:19,900 --> 02:22:23,340
You could be an immersion of x into any old manifold,

1565
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:25,780
but I'd like to go with the most ambitious version

1566
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:27,500
of gu first.

1567
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:30,820
So the two projection maps are pi two and pi one.

1568
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:33,860
And what we're going to say up top is that we're gonna have

1569
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:39,940
a symbol z and an action of a group row on z,

1570
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:44,180
standing in for any bundle associated

1571
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:46,460
to the principal bundle, which is generated

1572
02:22:46,460 --> 02:22:50,140
as the unitary bundle of the spinners

1573
02:22:50,140 --> 02:22:53,300
on the chimeric tangent bundle to y.

1574
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:54,380
That's a bit of a mouthful,

1575
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:58,100
but the key issue was that on the manifold y,

1576
02:22:58,100 --> 02:22:59,740
there happens to be a bundle,

1577
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:02,580
which is isomorphic non-canonically

1578
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:04,420
to the tangent bundle of y,

1579
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:08,820
which has a definite and canonical metric.

1580
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:12,260
And in fact, that carries the spinners.

1581
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:14,220
So this is the way in which we get spinners

1582
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:16,300
without ever having to choose a metric,

1583
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:18,020
but we pick up some technical debt

1584
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:20,220
to use the computer science concept

1585
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:23,460
by actually having to now work on two different spaces,

1586
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:26,900
x and y, and we're not merely working on x anymore.

1587
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:31,940
This leads to the mark of Zorro.

1588
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:34,460
That is, we know that whenever we have a metric

1589
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:36,780
by the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry,

1590
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:38,180
we always get a connection.

1591
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:41,100
It happens, however, that what is missing

1592
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:45,820
to turn the canonical chimeric bundle on y

1593
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:48,180
into the tangent bundle of y,

1594
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:51,460
is in fact a connection on the space x.

1595
02:23:51,460 --> 02:23:54,500
So there is one way in which we've reversed

1596
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:56,500
the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry,

1597
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:59,660
where a connection on x leads to a metric on y.

1598
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:02,980
So if we do the full transmission mechanism out,

1599
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:05,740
Gimel on x leads to alpha sub-Gimel

1600
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:09,260
for the Levy-Civita connection on x.

1601
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:14,260
Alpha sub-Gimel leads to G sub-alpha, which is,

1602
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:19,900
sorry, G sub-alpha, I'm not used to using Hebrew in math,

1603
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:27,420
so G sub-alpha then is a metric on y

1604
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:32,340
and that creates a Levy-Civita connection

1605
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:34,860
of the metric on the space y as well,

1606
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:37,860
which then induces one on the spinorial bundles.

1607
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:43,420
In sector two, the inhomogeneous gauge group on y

1608
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:45,620
replaces the Poincare group

1609
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:49,260
and the internal symmetries that are found on x.

1610
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:51,740
And in fact, you use a fermionic extension

1611
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:53,700
of the inhomogeneous gauge group

1612
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:56,220
to replace the supersymmetric Poincare group.

1613
02:24:56,220 --> 02:24:58,580
And that would be, with the field content,

1614
02:24:58,580 --> 02:25:02,700
zero forms tensored with spinors

1615
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:05,740
directs some one forms tensored with spinors

1616
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:09,640
all up on y as the fermionic field content.

1617
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:13,060
So that gets rid of the biggest problem

1618
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:15,180
because the internal symmetry group

1619
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:17,180
is what causes the failure, I think,

1620
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:20,100
of supersymmetric particles to be seen in nature,

1621
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:23,060
which is we have two different origin stories,

1622
02:25:23,060 --> 02:25:27,340
which is a little bit like Lilith and Genesis.

1623
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:31,580
We can't easily say we have a unified theory

1624
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:35,980
if spacetime and the SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 group

1625
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:38,580
that lives on spacetime have different origins

1626
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:39,860
and cannot be related.

1627
02:25:39,860 --> 02:25:42,020
In this situation, we tie our hands

1628
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:45,500
and we have no choice over the group content.

1629
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:48,700
So just to fix bundle notation,

1630
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:53,420
we let H be the structure group of a bundle,

1631
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:55,940
P sub H over a base space B.

1632
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:59,340
We use pi for the projection map.

1633
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:04,340
We've reserved the variation in the pi orthography

1634
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:06,420
for the field content,

1635
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:08,780
and we try to use right principle actions.

1636
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:11,580
I'm terrible with left and right, but we do our best.

1637
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:14,860
We use H here, not G,

1638
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:18,900
because we wanna reserve G for the inhomogeneous extension

1639
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:21,500
of H once we move to function spaces.

1640
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:24,460
So with function spaces,

1641
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:28,460
we can take the bundle of groups

1642
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:32,740
using the adjoint action of H on itself

1643
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:34,780
and form the associated bundle

1644
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:37,580
and then move to C infinity sections

1645
02:26:37,580 --> 02:26:41,700
to get the so-called gauge group of automorphisms.

1646
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:45,180
We have a space of connections, typically denoted by A,

1647
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:49,140
and we're going to promote omega one

1648
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:54,140
tensored in the adjoint bundle to notation of script N

1649
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:57,380
as the affine group,

1650
02:26:57,380 --> 02:27:02,380
which acts directly on the space of connections.

1651
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:09,580
Now, the inhomogeneous gauge group

1652
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:12,020
is formed as the semi-direct product

1653
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:15,020
of the gauge group of automorphisms together

1654
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:17,780
with the affine group of translations

1655
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:20,140
of the space of connections.

1656
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:23,580
And you can see here is a version

1657
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,420
of an explicit group multiplication rule.

1658
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:26,820
I hope I got that one right.

1659
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:29,860
And then we have an action of G

1660
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:31,700
that is the inhomogeneous gauge group

1661
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:33,140
on the space of connections

1662
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:36,500
because we have two different ways to act on connections.

1663
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:39,300
We can either act by gauge transformations

1664
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:41,700
or we can act by affine translations.

1665
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:44,660
So putting them together gives us something

1666
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:46,660
for the inhomogeneous gauge group to do.

1667
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:49,660
We then get a by connection.

1668
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,500
In other words, because we have two different ways

1669
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:53,260
of pushing a connection around,

1670
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:55,620
if we have a choice of a base connection,

1671
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:57,940
we can push the base connection around

1672
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:00,660
in two different ways according to the portion of it

1673
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:05,660
that is coming from the gauge transformations, curly H,

1674
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:09,700
or the affine translations coming from curly N.

1675
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:15,540
We can call this map the by connection,

1676
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:18,860
which gives us two separate connections

1677
02:28:18,860 --> 02:28:21,820
for any point in the inhomogeneous gauge group.

1678
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:25,260
And we can notice that it can be viewed

1679
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:31,380
as a section of a bundle over the base space to come

1680
02:28:32,260 --> 02:28:35,100
when we find an interesting embedding of the gauge group

1681
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:38,300
that is not the standard one in the inhomogeneous gauge group.

1682
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:42,100
So our summary diagram looks something like this.

1683
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:45,500
Take a look at the tau sub A naught.

1684
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:48,820
We will find a homomorphism of the gauge group

1685
02:28:48,820 --> 02:28:50,620
into its inhomogeneous extension

1686
02:28:50,620 --> 02:28:53,860
that isn't simply inclusion under the first factor.

1687
02:28:57,300 --> 02:28:59,740
And I'm realizing that I have the wrong pi

1688
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:05,300
that should just be a simple pi projecting down.

1689
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:08,060
We have a map from the inhomogeneous gauge group

1690
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:12,100
via the by connection to A cross A,

1691
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:13,580
connections cross connections,

1692
02:29:13,580 --> 02:29:16,420
and that that behaves well according

1693
02:29:16,420 --> 02:29:18,180
to the difference operator delta

1694
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:19,900
that takes the difference of two connections

1695
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:21,920
and gives an honest ad-valued one form.

1696
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:23,820
Okay.

1697
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:28,300
The infinitesimal action of a gauge transformation

1698
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:29,860
or at least an infinitesimal one

1699
02:29:29,860 --> 02:29:32,220
on a point inside of the group

1700
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:36,540
is given by a somewhat almost familiar expression

1701
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:39,700
which should remind us of how the first term

1702
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:41,860
in the gauge deformation complex

1703
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:46,860
for self-dual Yang-Mills actually gets started.

1704
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:51,860
And so by acting via this interesting embedding

1705
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:57,920
of the inhomogeneous gauge group on, sorry,

1706
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:59,720
the embedding of the gauge group

1707
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:01,760
inside its inhomogeneous extension,

1708
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,200
but the non-trivial one,

1709
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,560
we get something very close to the original first step

1710
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:09,400
of the two-step deformation complex.

1711
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:10,960
Now, in sector three,

1712
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,880
there are payoffs to the magic beans trade.

1713
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:17,520
The big issue here is that we've foregone the privilege

1714
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:20,800
of being able to choose and dial in our own field content

1715
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:23,320
and we've decided to remain restricted

1716
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,960
to anything we can generate only from XD,

1717
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:27,560
in this case, X4.

1718
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:31,320
So we generated Y14 from X4

1719
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:34,280
and then we generated chimeric tangent bundles

1720
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:35,320
on top of that.

1721
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:38,720
We built spinners off of the chimeric tangent bundle

1722
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:41,240
and we have not made any other choices.

1723
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:44,120
So we're dealing with, I think it's U128,

1724
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:48,040
U2 to the seventh.

1725
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:52,320
That is our structure group

1726
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:56,520
and it's fixed by the choice of X4,

1727
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:57,800
not anything else.

1728
02:30:58,680 --> 02:30:59,960
So what do we get?

1729
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:04,080
Well, as promised, there is a tilted homomorphism

1730
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:08,680
which takes the gauge group into its inhomogeneous extension.

1731
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:11,120
It acts as inclusion on the first factor

1732
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:13,160
but it uses the Levy-Tevita connection

1733
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:16,680
to create a second sort of more cartan form.

1734
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:18,800
I hope I remember the terminology right.

1735
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:19,840
It's been a long time.

1736
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:23,120
The map is injective because it's injective

1737
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:24,280
under the first factor,

1738
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:27,160
but it actually gives us a non-trivial embedding

1739
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:31,080
of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous extension

1740
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:33,360
which makes the whole theory work.

1741
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:36,720
We then get to Shiav operators.

1742
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:39,960
Now, a Shiav operator is a map

1743
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:43,720
from the group across the ad-valued I-forms.

1744
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:46,080
In this case, the particular Shiav operators

1745
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:48,960
we're interested in is mapping I-forms

1746
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:52,680
to D minus three plus I-forms.

1747
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:56,080
So for example, you would map a two-form

1748
02:31:57,080 --> 02:32:02,080
to D minus three plus I.

1749
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:07,120
So if D, for example, were 14,

1750
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:11,920
then an I were equal to two,

1751
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:15,800
then 14 minus three is equal to 11,

1752
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:19,560
plus two is equal to 13.

1753
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:24,560
So that would be an ad-valued 14 minus one form,

1754
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:28,400
which is exactly the right place

1755
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:31,120
for something to form a current

1756
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:34,420
that is the differential of a Lagrangian on the space.

1757
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:39,080
Now, the augmented torsion.

1758
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:40,880
The torsion is a very strange object.

1759
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:42,860
It's introduced sort of right at the beginning

1760
02:32:42,860 --> 02:32:45,880
of learning differential geometry,

1761
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:47,320
but it really doesn't get used very much.

1762
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:49,600
One of the reasons it doesn't get used in gauge theory

1763
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:51,360
is that it's not gauge invariant.

1764
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:53,080
It has a gauge invariant piece to it,

1765
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:56,160
but then a piece that spoils the gauge invariant.

1766
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,920
But because we have two connections,

1767
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:02,720
one of the ideas was to introduce two diseases

1768
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,080
and then to take a difference.

1769
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:06,560
And as long as the disease is the same in both,

1770
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:09,880
the difference will not have the disease

1771
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,800
because both diseases are included,

1772
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:13,920
but with a minus sign between them.

1773
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:17,440
So the augmented torsion is relatively well-behaved

1774
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:22,440
relative to this particular slanted or tilted embedding

1775
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:25,760
of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous extension,

1776
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:28,520
which this is very nice

1777
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:32,240
because now we actually have a use for the torsion.

1778
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:34,640
We have an understanding of why it may never have figured,

1779
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:35,960
particularly into geometry,

1780
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:37,760
is that you need two of two connections

1781
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:40,840
rather than one to see the advantages of torsion at all.

1782
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:45,840
So here's an example of one ship and a bottle operator.

1783
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:48,080
I think this would be sort of analogous

1784
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:52,400
if I'm not mistaken to trying to take the Ricci curvature

1785
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:56,120
from the entire Riemann curvature.

1786
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:57,680
But if you think about what Einstein did,

1787
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:59,960
Einstein had to go further

1788
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:03,480
and reduce the Ricci curvature to the scalar curvature

1789
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:07,400
and then sort of dial the components of the traceless Ricci

1790
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:10,760
and the scalar curvature to get the right proportions.

1791
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:13,760
So there are many Schiave operators

1792
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:16,960
and you have to be very careful about which one you want.

1793
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,400
And once you know exactly what it is you're trying to hit,

1794
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:22,520
you can choose the Schiave operator to be bespoke

1795
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:26,560
and get the contractions that you need.

1796
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:32,600
Now, I've made you guys sit through a lot.

1797
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:35,640
So I wanted to give you sort of humorously

1798
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:40,640
a feeling of positivity for the exhaustion.

1799
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,600
So the years of anxious searching in the dark

1800
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:45,360
with their intense longing,

1801
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:47,800
their intense alternations of confidence and exhaustion

1802
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:49,720
and the final emergence into the light,

1803
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:52,840
only those who have experienced it can understand it.

1804
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:54,480
I've just always thought this was like

1805
02:34:54,480 --> 02:34:56,280
the most sensitive and beautiful quote

1806
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:59,560
and I wish it were one of his better known quotes,

1807
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:03,720
but I think it's so singular that it's hard to feel

1808
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:05,320
what it was that he was talking about

1809
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:08,520
because in fact, he sort of explains this in the last line.

1810
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:11,680
So given that you've been on a long journey,

1811
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:15,840
here is something of what geometric unity equations

1812
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,160
might look like.

1813
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:20,440
So in the first place, you have the swerved curvature,

1814
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:23,160
the Schiave applied to the curvature tensor.

1815
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:26,240
That in general does not work out to be exact.

1816
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:30,280
So you can't have it as the differential of a Lagrangian.

1817
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:35,280
And in fact, we talk about swirls, swerves, twirls, eddies,

1818
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,720
there has to be a quadratic eddy tensor

1819
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:41,680
that I occasionally forget when I pull this thing

1820
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:43,040
out of moth balls.

1821
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,360
And the two of those together make up

1822
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:47,680
what I call the total swerved curvature.

1823
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:49,440
And on the other side of the equation,

1824
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:51,720
you have the displaced torsion,

1825
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,520
which I've called the dysplasian.

1826
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:57,160
And to get rid of the pesky sort of minus sign

1827
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:58,800
and hodge star operator,

1828
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:03,240
this would be the replacement for the Einstein equation,

1829
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:06,200
not on x where we would perceive it,

1830
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:11,200
but on y before being pulled back onto the manifold x.

1831
02:36:11,960 --> 02:36:15,400
So a condensation of that would be very simple.

1832
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:17,840
In simplest terms, we would be saying

1833
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:21,520
that the swerved curvature is equal to the dysplasian.

1834
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:24,280
And at least in this sector of the four main equations

1835
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:25,920
of theoretical physics,

1836
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:28,280
this would be the replacement for the Einstein equations,

1837
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:31,120
again on y before being pulled back to x.

1838
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:36,640
Next is the sketch of the fermionic field content.

1839
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:40,000
I'm not sure whether that should have been sector four,

1840
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,320
sector three, but it's gonna be very brief.

1841
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:45,560
I showed some pictures during the lecture

1842
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:47,360
and I'm not gonna go back through them,

1843
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,280
but I wanted to just give you an idea

1844
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,640
of where this mysterious third generation,

1845
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:53,880
I think, comes from.

1846
02:36:55,160 --> 02:37:00,160
So if we review the three identities here,

1847
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:04,160
we see that if we have a space V,

1848
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:05,880
thought of like as a tangent bundle,

1849
02:37:05,880 --> 02:37:08,440
and then you have spinners built on the tangent bundle.

1850
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:10,840
When you product, tensor product,

1851
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:14,240
the tangent bundle with its own spinners,

1852
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:15,960
it breaks up into two pieces.

1853
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:19,440
One piece is the so-called cartin product,

1854
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:21,640
which is sort of the sum of the highest weights.

1855
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:25,120
And the other is a second copy of the spinners

1856
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,640
gotten through the Clifford contraction.

1857
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:29,040
So that's well known.

1858
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:32,040
But now what I think fewer people know,

1859
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:34,760
many people know that the spinners

1860
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:36,720
have a sort of an exponential property.

1861
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:39,440
That is the spinners of a direct sum

1862
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:42,280
are the tensor product of the spinners

1863
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,120
of the two summands of the direct sum.

1864
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:48,480
So that's a very nice sort of version of an exponential.

1865
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:50,040
An exponential would take a sum

1866
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:51,440
and turn it into a product.

1867
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:54,960
What happens when you're trying to think

1868
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:59,960
about a tangent space in Y is being broken up

1869
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:03,880
into a tangent space along an immersed X

1870
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:05,480
together with its normal bundle.

1871
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:09,280
So imagine that X and Y are the tangent space to X

1872
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:11,520
and a normal bundle.

1873
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:14,040
So the Rarita-Schwinger piece,

1874
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:16,520
that is the spin three halves piece,

1875
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:21,520
has a funny kind of an almost exponential property.

1876
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:25,080
That is the Rarita-Schwinger content

1877
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:27,480
of a direct sum of vector spaces

1878
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:32,360
is equal to the Rarita-Schwinger of the first tensor

1879
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,680
producted with the ordinary spinners in the second,

1880
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:37,520
direct sum with the ordinary spinners in the first,

1881
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:42,160
tensor producted with the Rarita-Schwinger content

1882
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:43,680
of the second sum and.

1883
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:46,360
But then there's this extra interesting term,

1884
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:50,320
which is the spinners on the first sum and tensor

1885
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:52,920
producted with the spinners on the second sum and.

1886
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:57,120
Now recalling that when I started my career,

1887
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:59,000
we did not know that neutrinos were massive

1888
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,520
and I figured that they probably had to be massive

1889
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:04,880
because I desperately wanted a 16 dimensional space

1890
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:06,880
of internal quantum numbers, not 15,

1891
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:10,760
because my ideas only work if the space

1892
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:13,600
of internal quantum numbers is of dimension two to the N

1893
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:16,360
and one of my favorite equations at the time

1894
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:18,960
was 15 equals two to the fourth.

1895
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,240
Not literally true, but almost true.

1896
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:24,160
And thankfully in the late 1990s,

1897
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:28,280
the case for 16 particles in a generation

1898
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:31,440
was strengthened when neutrinos were found to have mass.

1899
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:37,440
But that remaining term in the southeast corner,

1900
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:40,560
the spinners on X, tensor spinners on Y,

1901
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:45,560
looks like the term above it in line 2.15.

1902
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:50,560
And that in fact is the third generation of matter

1903
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:55,560
in my opinion, that is it is not a true generation.

1904
02:39:56,280 --> 02:39:59,720
It is broken off and would unify very differently

1905
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:01,600
if we were able to heat the universe

1906
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:02,840
to the proper temperature.

1907
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:07,400
So starting to sum up, this is not the full theory.

1908
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:10,880
I'm just presenting this in part to dip my toe back

1909
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:11,720
into the water.

1910
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:14,280
It's a daunting task to try to address people

1911
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:16,160
about something you've been thinking about for a long time

1912
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:19,840
and have no idea whether it's even remotely correct.

1913
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:22,000
This is the Einsteinian replacement

1914
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,560
and it must be pulled back to X.

1915
02:40:23,560 --> 02:40:24,560
That's the first thing.

1916
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:27,800
The Yang-Mills Maxwell piece comes from a direct square

1917
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:29,040
of the Einstein replacement.

1918
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,880
That is, I don't believe that we're really looking

1919
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:33,360
for a unifying equation.

1920
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:36,440
I think we're looking for a unifying direct square.

1921
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:38,040
Dirac famously took the square root

1922
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:39,920
of the Klein-Gordon equation

1923
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:43,280
and he gave us the Dirac equation.

1924
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:46,560
And in fact, I believe that the Dirac equation

1925
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:50,360
and the Einstein equation are to be augmented

1926
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:54,760
and fit into the square root part of a Dirac square.

1927
02:40:54,760 --> 02:40:57,680
And I believe that the Yang-Mills content

1928
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:01,920
and Higgs version of the Klein-Gordon equation

1929
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:05,480
would go in the square part of the Dirac square.

1930
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:08,800
So two of these equations unify differently than two others

1931
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:12,160
and the two pairs are unified

1932
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:14,080
in the content of a Dirac square.

1933
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:19,520
The Dirac piece will be done separately elsewhere

1934
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:20,960
when we get around to it

1935
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,600
and contains the Ririta-Schwinger field content

1936
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:26,240
which is fundamental and new.

1937
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:29,600
There are only two generations in this model.

1938
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:33,000
I think people have accepted that there are three

1939
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,280
but I don't believe that there are three.

1940
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:35,120
I think that there are two

1941
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:36,520
and that the third unifies

1942
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,880
other matter at higher energies.

1943
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:41,080
The Cortic-Higgs piece comes

1944
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:43,280
from the Dirac squaring of a quadratic.

1945
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:45,560
Remember, there's an eddy tensor

1946
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:48,920
which is quadratic in the augmented torsion.

1947
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:51,800
The metric does multiple duties here

1948
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:56,040
is it's the main field in this version of GU

1949
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:58,120
with the sort of strongest assumptions

1950
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:01,760
as field content that is originally on X

1951
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:05,760
where as most of the rest of the field content is on Y

1952
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:07,840
but it also acts as the observer

1953
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:10,120
pulling back the full content of Y

1954
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:15,920
onto X to be interpreted as if it came from X all along

1955
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:18,880
generating the sort of illusion

1956
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:20,680
of internal quantum numbers.

1957
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:22,840
And I should say that the Petit-Salem theory

1958
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:26,480
which is usually advertised as I think SU4

1959
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:28,560
cross SU2 cross SU2

1960
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:32,000
is really much more naturally spin six cross spin four

1961
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:37,840
when the trace portion of the space of metrics

1962
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,760
is put in with the proper sign

1963
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:42,360
if you're trying to generate the sector

1964
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:45,160
that begins as X1 comma three.

1965
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:49,000
Remember, XD where D equals four

1966
02:42:50,080 --> 02:42:52,240
is the generic situation

1967
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:53,760
but you have all these different sectors.

1968
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:55,080
I believe that these sectors

1969
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:57,840
probably exist if this model is correct

1970
02:42:57,840 --> 02:42:59,760
but we are trapped in the one three sector

1971
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:01,840
so you have to figure out what the implications are

1972
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:05,080
for pushing that indefinite signature up

1973
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:08,400
into an indefinite signature on the Y manifold

1974
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:11,680
and there are signatures that make it look

1975
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:14,640
like the Petit-Salem rather than directly

1976
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:17,780
in the spin 10 SU5 line of thinking.

1977
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:22,120
So we will attempt to present the full theory shortly

1978
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:24,400
and shortly keep in mind this took seven years

1979
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:28,120
to just bring me to want to come back to this

1980
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:30,720
but it must be reassembled from decades of notes

1981
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:33,080
and that's part of the problem when you're working alone

1982
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:36,280
and you're not really expecting to talk to anybody.

1983
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:39,480
So I want to thank you for your patience and your time

1984
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:40,760
and I just want to read a bunch of names

1985
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:42,080
of people who mattered to me

1986
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:44,680
and if I've done anything wrong,

1987
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:46,400
this is not no reflection on them.

1988
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:48,760
Marcus DeSotois, Peter Thiel,

1989
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:51,560
Isidore Singer, Raoul Botte, Michael Grossberg,

1990
02:43:51,560 --> 02:43:54,320
Adil Abdullali, Harry and Sophie Rubin,

1991
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:56,200
Brett Weinstein and family,

1992
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:58,480
Heather Hying and Zach and Toby,

1993
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:00,600
Peter Fried, Scott Axelrod,

1994
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:04,560
Nima Arkani-Hamed, Louise Alvarez-Game,

Edward Frankel, Dora Bar-Natan,

1996

Shlomo Sternberg, David Kajdan, Daniel Barquet,

1997
02:44:10,360 --> 02:44:12,760
Karen and Les Weinstein, Haynes Miller,

Ralph Gomery, John Tate, Sydney Coleman,

1999

Graham Siegel, Robert Herman and here in Esther Milani.

2000
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:22,480
Errors and omissions because I have too many people to thank

2001
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:26,680
are all my own as for the claims

2002
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:30,600
that should reflect badly on no one else other than myself.

2003
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:32,640
And most especially, I just want to say

2004
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:35,360
that I've asked a tremendous amount from my family

2005
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:38,680
to stick with me on this quixotic quest.

2006
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:40,960
And I want to thank Pia Milani,

2007
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,200
Nyla Weinstein and Zev Weinstein.

2008
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,440
I love you all very much

2009
02:44:44,440 --> 02:44:46,440
and thank you for making this possible.

2010
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:50,360
I do want to leave you with one thought.

2011
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:53,440
I really think that we've gotten completely bent out of shape

2012
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:57,880
about trying to formalize and routinize science

2013
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:59,160
and it doesn't work.

2014
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:02,040
You cannot mandate science as social engineering.

2015
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:04,640
You can't decide that science is always

2016
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:07,160
in the zeitgeist and done by committee.

2017
02:45:07,160 --> 02:45:10,040
In fact, it is essential to understand

2018
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:12,880
that science will not conform to what you want.

2019
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:15,240
One of the things that I'm very proud of

2020
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:16,640
and I think is quite true

2021
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:20,680
is the saying that great science

2022
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:25,440
has the scientific method as it's radio edit.

2023
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:27,280
I don't think that great science

2024
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:29,240
is actually done the way we say it's done.

2025
02:45:29,240 --> 02:45:33,080
And I think that directs 1963 Scientific American article

2026
02:45:33,080 --> 02:45:36,280
should be read by absolutely everyone.

2027
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:38,720
Every time major theories have come out,

2028
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:40,800
they've almost always been wrong,

2029
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:44,040
but they're not wrong in an important way.

2030
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:47,120
And I think that we have to fix the political economy

2031
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:49,960
of people racing to correct theories

2032
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:53,320
or point out that there's no agreement with the experiment.

2033
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:56,840
We are killing many of our best ideas

2034
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:00,320
by creating a terrible and combative environment

2035
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:02,920
which already attempts to apportion credit

2036
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:06,200
for work and more importantly risk

2037
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:09,840
undertaken by individuals.

2038
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:14,240
And I just think that I want people to understand

2039
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:16,720
that I've always wanted to share this,

2040
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:21,560
but I detest the culture that I saw that cropped up

2041
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:22,960
around what has now become known

2042
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:25,280
as the cyber-witten equations.

2043
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:26,640
When they were put forward,

2044
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:29,840
there was a period of time where I watched people

2045
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:32,000
as if it a feeding trough,

2046
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,480
trying to stay up around the clock

2047
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:36,640
to use a new machine tool that had been given to them

2048
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:38,680
to claim credit.

2049
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:42,240
And it profoundly pushed me away from the community.

2050
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:45,320
We have to become more ethical

2051
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:47,440
and we have to honor the people

2052
02:46:47,440 --> 02:46:51,280
who are trying to speak and act imaginatively.

2053
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:54,040
Now, if this doesn't work, if it's silly,

2054
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:57,480
I'll have egg on my face and I'll go on, I'll be fine.

2055
02:46:57,480 --> 02:47:01,880
But I'm very worried that maybe some of the best ideas

2056
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:05,440
are between the ears of people without the confidence

2057
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:10,440
in the Hutzpah and just the sort of almost psychotic drive

2058
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,640
to push things across the finishing line.

2059
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:16,600
We've got to be kinder and nicer and more decent

2060
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,360
and stop stealing people's lives, their credit,

2061
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:22,640
their future and their ability to have families

2062
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:25,880
and make a living and that's absolutely essential to me.

2063
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:28,880
And I look forward to finding out whether this theory

2064
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:31,520
has merit to it or is without merit,

2065
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:34,160
but I guarantee that if I'm going to go down with the ship,

2066
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:36,520
I'm also not going to be knocked off the ship

2067
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:40,080
as I was many years ago, completely unfairly.

2068
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:41,560
And I won't dwell on it,

2069
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:44,600
but the amount of power you professors have

2070
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:48,840
is absolutely almost without parallel

2071
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:50,680
because nobody really understands enough

2072
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:53,540
to adjudicate disputes that happen in academics.

2073
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:57,120
I'm going to insist that we fund you better

2074
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:01,480
and that you are nicer to the people who depend upon you

2075
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:03,480
in this beautiful chain that we call

2076
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:08,880
science, scientific method and most particularly

2077
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:11,120
American science, which I think is still

2078
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:12,600
the envy of the world.

2079
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:14,160
So you've been through the portal.
