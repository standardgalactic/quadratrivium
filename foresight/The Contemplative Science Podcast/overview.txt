Checking The Contemplative Science Podcast/Surviving Tomorrow： AI and the Human Spirit w⧸ John Vervaeke and Shawn Coyne.txt
 In this episode of the Contemplative Science Podcast, Mark and his guests Sean Kelly and John Vervaeke delve into the importance of wisdom in our current era, particularly with the advent of emerging technologies. They discuss how cultivating insight through storytelling and mindfulness can help us regain attentional autonomy and prepare us for the ethical responsibilities that come with mentoring both each other and potentially synthetic intelligent systems.

The conversation highlights the need for individuals to understand the threshold humanity is moving through, as we stand on the cusp of a significant transformation brought about by technology. The guests emphasize that to guide these technologies wisely, we must first know what it means to be good ourselves. They touch upon virtues like Karuna (compassion) and agape (selfless love), and how embodying these virtues is crucial for our collective future.

Mark invites listeners to engage with Sean and John's projects further, as their work is integral to understanding how contemplative practices can inform our interactions with the world and the technologies that are shaping it. The podcast aims to explore the science of contemplative programs, and this episode serves as a call to arms for listeners to take wisdom seriously in the context of the emerging digital landscape.

The episode concludes with gratitude and a commitment to continue the conversation on the importance of wisdom and ethical considerations in our increasingly technologically advanced world.
