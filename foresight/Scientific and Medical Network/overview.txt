Checking Scientific and Medical Network/Dr Trevor Griffiths â€“ Between the Seconds of Your Mind.txt
1. The discussion touched upon the idea of the universe as a living, dynamic organism with continuous creation happening at every scale, from cosmological to quantum levels. This is in line with the principles of complexity and chaos theory, which suggest that local dynamics can scale up to influence larger systems.

2. Bernard asked whether we should consider forming a special interest group within the Galileo Commission to explore these ideas further. The consensus was that this would be a valuable approach, and Vasilio and Trevor agreed to put each other in touch to develop this concept.

3. The conversation highlighted the importance of considering systems as open and interconnected rather than closed and isolated, as experiments on closed systems do not necessarily reflect the truth of the larger universe.

4. Gregory Bateson's "pattern which connects" was mentioned as a valuable reference for understanding complex systems and their interrelations.

5. The relationship between the implicate/implicit and explicate/explicit order, as described by David Bohm, was discussed. This idea of enfolding and unfolding is seen as incredibly fertile for exploring the nature of reality and consciousness.

6. The group agreed that further exploration of these concepts would be beneficial and encouraged the formation of a working group within the Galileo Commission to delve deeper into these ideas, potentially integrating insights from Ian McGilchrist, Rick Tarnas, and others who have expanded our understanding of Western thought and logic.

7. Jerome was thanked for organizing the webinar and handling the technical aspects, which are crucial for the success of such events.

8. The webinar concluded with expressions of gratitude to all participants for their engaging questions and contributions to a rich and stimulating discussion.
