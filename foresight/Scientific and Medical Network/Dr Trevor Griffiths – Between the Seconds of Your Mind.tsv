0	16560	And a very warm welcome to everybody from a really barmy evening here in southwest France
17600	24000	to a very interesting talk by Trevor Griffiths, who's got an extremely interesting background
24000	30000	as you'll see because he he studied medicine neuroscience and immunology and then was in
30000	38240	medicine for a long time and he then developed this emotional literacy and emotional logic
39200	44640	and so he's become a coach full-time and and we're going to find out more about that
45520	51200	this this evening and you'll see that he's using some of the David Bohm terminology
51200	55840	implicate order whole hollow movement at the end of human heart and I'm really looking forward
55840	63760	to finding out what that means and also his key question do brains filter out our connection
63760	69520	into life I think that's a very very interesting question as well and coming from a sort of
69520	79200	neuro psychological point of view and while you're on I will put a link to a spectator article
79200	85840	on consciousness by Kit Wilson this week which is extremely interesting because it finishes up
85840	92720	questioning materialism which is almost unheard of in a kind of mainstream publication so maybe
92720	97600	we're making some progress after all so Trevor it's a great pleasure to have you with us this
97600	102960	evening and we're looking forward to what you have to share with us thank you very much
104320	107760	yes thank you very much for the for the welcome for the invitation it's great to
107760	113440	spend a bit of time with you to be sharing a range of thoughts that have developed have I
113440	122720	frozen by the way or not no just on mine it seems to have done anyway so I've got a power
122720	128400	point to share I'll take you through so if I can share screens on this now
128560	135040	and how does that look is that coming through for everybody
135040	142080	yeah that's good so thank you so the theme between the seconds of your mind and this is
142080	147440	as you mentioned thanks David the base and David Bowen's concept of the intricate order
148240	154080	behind the explicate order that we we live amongst where he is describing it all being
154080	159440	hollow movement that there's movement and this talk as you see from the title is about how we
159440	162000	perhaps connect into that through our inner hearts
165440	173360	so I'm my main focus in this talk is around the human mind we sit in the middle of two enormous
173360	178800	scales the telescopic of the universe and the microscopic scale and these both meet in the way
178800	184720	our minds work and one of the things that really struck me as I looked at both of these these
184720	191600	scales of interest as a scientist is how everything rotates or vibrates everything's in movement
192720	200560	and as I through my studies got more involved in the way the brain works I came to realize that
200560	205680	there is a particular feature of the way our brains help us get organized in space and in
205680	211760	time and in the sense of substance that we're part of that actually screens out
212560	218240	some of the awareness of our relatedness in life and converts it into static objects
219360	227040	and that's going to be the main theme of this talk is what is going on that our brains construct
227040	231280	certain ideas that where everything is moving everything's in turmoil
232240	238240	somehow we've developed through our brains the idea that there is static matter
241760	247920	now I went to Oxford to study medicine I was a bit of an unusual student in that I didn't have
247920	252240	the traditional push by to get around I had a motorbike and quite enjoyed sort of
252960	259200	driving it around a bit a bit faster times and so on but I had a wide range of interests there
259200	265440	not just medicine but immunology macromolecular studies of the cell membranes and so on
266640	271200	but also I was what I call a seeker after truth I had a number of religious experiences
271840	278480	things that didn't quite make sense I had explored churches but couldn't quite get on with
278480	285840	traditional religion that explored through Zen of course originally starting with that
285840	290560	iconic book Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance of course taking a little bit from there
291840	299280	and into eaching and the idea of divination and but then realizing why not do we need sticks or
299280	305600	stones to engage with this world through divination if actually our inner hearts are
305600	311040	connected in there as well if we are connected in there as well so I moved on from that into
311760	316800	more an intuitive sort of prayerful search but without any formal structure to that
317680	323600	and in the midst of this search I was also writing a poetry you know as students do
324240	329840	and one day in this frame out came this particular poem which I'd like to read to you and tell you
329840	336880	a bit of a story behind this Angle's Turn and Lines Forgive Chris Crossing of the Mind
337840	344880	for here in the world there is beauty such as always found between the seconds of your mind
346400	350240	so that poem came out when I was there I wrote it down and I suddenly got this feeling
350800	355440	that I needed to get on my motorbike and drive and then I was going to have to give that poem to
355440	361440	somebody so just intuitively I just did that I put it's a bit cool at the time so I put a
361440	366880	jumper on a jacket and put the poem on the inside pocket and then put my outer jacket on to go on
366880	373280	the bike and set off and drove out from the center of Oxford got out to a semi-industrial area on
373280	378800	the edge and then suddenly thought that's it I've arrived so I pulled off the road got off the bike
378800	382800	and I was expecting somebody to come by and that I'd know they ought to give this poem to them
382800	388560	and nobody came so I started exploring around reached inside couldn't find the poem
388560	394480	search everywhere went back to the flat couldn't find the poem anywhere it had disappeared
395040	401040	and because of the sort of experiences that I've been having I was just going to say right well
401040	405440	that's a mystery you know of course I could have just dropped it somewhere of course but actually
405440	412880	it was very securely wrapped up under two secure levels of clothing on the way out and I just was
412880	419200	willing to hold that I think as you see as we go along this poem actually becomes quite relevant
420160	425440	so that was what I would call a sigh event but then something more significant happened
426720	433520	while there I had a dream one night and it was a dream that foretold the future so accurately
433520	439840	that it saved my life I dreamt I saw my death on the motorbike I won't go to the details of the
439840	446080	dream but there were two sages to it one of which alerted me to the next scene in which I was knocked
446080	453040	off sideways and and so I started driving a bit more sensibly and carefully but it was a month or
453040	458160	so went by and nothing happened and of course I went back my old ways which were you know a little
458160	466480	bit getting out around the cars and enjoy what you're doing and so on but a situation arose then
466480	472160	where something really strange started to happen and I thought this is it and at that moment I was
472160	476720	about to do something I'll come back and tell a bit more about this later I chose to do the exact
476720	480880	opposite of my natural thing which would have been to accelerate and overtake three cars at the same
480880	487040	time and instead I jammed on the brakes pulled back behind the last car and something remarkable
487040	493680	happened the car at the front the first one did a most unusual maneuver spun 180 degrees in the
493680	498960	middle of the road and zoomed off in the opposite direction and it undoubtedly would have knocked
498960	507040	me off and killed me so I was alerted to a situation by that dream and as far as I'm concerned
507040	512960	because I you know I am sort of a scientist in my way of approaching things that was a dream that
512960	520560	broke the traditional scientific laws of time the science is based in the view of the arrow of time
520560	528160	from past to the future causal effects causal chains and this was something that broke that
528160	535120	causal chain so to be honest every day that I live I'm this this event is still as fresh in my mind
535120	541760	as ever I'm alive because of an event that broke these the rules of space and time and that set
541760	547680	me off on a search saying science is definitely delving into something but it's not the whole
547680	557760	story there's a lot more that we need to explore so I I was a part of neuroscience studies studying
558640	564880	the cats sort of visual cortex and taking part in experiments with you know single nerve
566240	571280	microelectrope recordings and so on so I'm quite used to the idea of the brain working with patterns
571280	578800	of activity but the problem was that I felt sorry for the cat I'm not I just said I wasn't
578800	584720	really a lab researcher and eventually left a PhD and go back into medical studies again
585360	592720	because I wanted to be a researcher in life and I was keen on immunology and the immune
593440	600160	diseases and so on and realized that both neuroscience and immunology they're both
600160	606560	pattern recognizing systems that we as an organism are detecting patterns with distant
606560	611840	senses in the neuroscience and the immunologies with chemical patterns with recognizing what's
611840	618480	self and what's other and that is all part of our identity as a person it's at a physical level
618480	625360	and at a social and wider environmental level but in all of that that I was studying I knew
625360	629440	something was missing from science and it was to do with relatedness to do with relationship
630080	634480	I was looking at communication patterns between cell populations and health and disease
635520	639200	but decided to leave in the end to go into medicine but I had I took a particular interest
639200	644720	in family medicine and systemic work because the patterns of communication amongst people
645440	652080	I found were reflected in the patterns that the brain was detecting in the environment and
652240	656480	understanding how the immune system worked on pattern recognition and responsiveness
656480	660560	the same thing was going on in families and in communities neighborhoods workplaces
661680	666720	so I was forming this idea of identical principles of organization principles of
666720	671200	organization that's a core thing that I'm going to be talking with you about because
671200	677200	it's about this area that I believe I'll be able to give an explanation of these two side events
677200	683520	that broke the rules of space and time getting into the level of communication patterns and
683520	690240	relational patterns now I also put the picture here of shredding his cat and what I just like
690240	696000	to say is that this thought experiment about the quantum level of life I believe is completely
696000	701280	fallacious the reason is that it's not the cat or any of the things here it's in a box
702160	708000	and the thought experiment relies on that box being screened off until somebody opens the
708000	714240	lid and looks at it and then that is the input of energy into this closed system that determines
714240	724800	what happens the problem is that science has recently shown that the universe is not a closed
724800	730000	system which is the picture that what I call enlightenment science for the last 300 years
730000	735440	has all been based on the idea that the universe is a closed system bounded by space and time
736080	739920	and the matter moves with momentum and bounces around inside this box
740560	747280	and so on but in 2011 three physicists and primitive Schmidt and Rice got the Nobel prize
747280	754480	for physics for proving that the universe is not only still expanding but the rate of expansion
754480	760480	is accelerating right so we are part of a universe that is expanding at an ever increasing rate
761120	767440	but that means the universe of which we belong is an open system it has to be an open system
768160	773680	and I'm sorry to disappoint people but all the rules of thermodynamics to do with entropy and
773680	780800	energy preservation and so on are all framed within the concepts of closed systems they do
780800	787360	apply in closed systems but at a universal scale in which we human beings are embedded
788000	792880	it's an open system and those rules may not apply and that's what I'm going to be saying to
792880	799920	they actually do not apply at the level of the human heart Karen Barad of course has done a lot of
801120	808880	work on the concept of intraaction we human beings are interactive in this universal scale
809440	816080	also in local systems and it's up to us by our choice of action whether we create closed systems
816640	821280	and believe in them or whether we live as if we are part of an open system
823600	827520	so I came up with this thing there's a lot of neuroscientists are keen on the idea that the
827520	833360	brain is actually a social brain it isn't there just to give us a sense of who we are and for us
833360	839120	to generate feelings internally it's not an individualistic thing the brain is there to map
839120	844240	our relatedness and to map our relationships and I found from my developing interest in
844880	851280	Christian in Celtic Christianity because it's very earth it's very rooted in the community in the
851280	860320	community in hospitality in the rhythms of nature to me that this is where the life of things are
860320	867440	generated and the Celts had already had this image called a triquetra three corners a state that is
867440	874080	three points but not a triangle or triquetra three corners and it's an icon of never-ending
874080	880240	movement of continuous dynamic if you follow the lines along you know it just goes round and round
880240	885840	and when you fit two together you just the relatedness goes backwards and forwards between them
886640	892960	and this is eternal movement and this is how I'm going to be displaying what I believe
892960	901760	is David Bohm's concept of hollow movement now these two icons of movement the triquetra
901760	907360	are icons that can be scaled to lots of different levels it's a prince the principles of organization
907360	914720	of movement movement is the changing relatedness of forms changing relatedness of forms
915520	921440	so this could represent two adults talking together a conversation it could be in Celtic
921440	927600	Christianity god and humanity in a conversation it could be a mother and child but also I'm going
927600	933440	to be putting to you that this could be an icon that represents quantal change this could be the
933440	938560	gardener in the earth that you know you can have a relationship with your garden to cultivate and
938560	944640	bring forth fruitfulness from the land and the idea of having two of the self-organizing
945360	951520	elements that meet together into a conversational relationship is that one becomes an ecology
951520	957840	for the other this is an ecological picture of the human being an ecological picture in which
957840	964160	the environment scale from the quantal to the universal and to the social and the inner world
964640	969760	and in this I'm going to introduce the word information and the core thing in this is because
969760	976880	I'm proposing that everything is in movement information is a verb it's not a noun it is
976880	985600	the forming and following this along the change that's going on in this in this person here
986880	992560	is transferred relatedness over to here to it transforms the other person and this is
993520	1001200	information it's a dynamic it's not a noun and this is and what I'm proposing is that
1001200	1010640	this type of iconic relationship or relatedness is synergy this is a vibration one movement
1010640	1018400	happening here induces movement here and that workflows back and here we have synergic movement
1018400	1022080	backwards and forwards this is an image an icon of relatedness
1024320	1030320	so there's mutual repatterning which is synergy now this is actually the core slide the talk and
1030320	1036560	I'm going to come back to this slide right at the end of it just to to pull it all together at the end
1037520	1047760	and now in that a mutuality of repatterning there is bi-directional informational flow
1048720	1056800	and a lot of science is based in a linear concept of energy transfer or information transfer from a
1056800	1061840	transmitter to a receiver we're coming back to that a little bit later
1061840	1070000	but in systemic family therapy the the network of relationships and the communications that go
1070000	1076960	back and forth a group of people form a state of action going on within the family and that state
1076960	1082400	can either bring on helpful behavior or it can become chaotic or turbulent that's where the
1082400	1088400	social brain is connecting with it and the core principles of organization I believe are shaping
1088400	1093120	what goes on in the brain to engage with this conversational reality and that is what's called
1093120	1099200	the explicate order this is the the level we live in in our social setting setting environments
1099200	1105840	and that picture on the right of the lady looking at that artwork on a piece of on a UK postbox it
1105840	1111840	just shows the explicate order can get into a bit of a knot and get all tied up when when things get
1111840	1117360	a bit stressed but underneath that David Bowman is saying that there is an implicate order of
1117360	1126080	wholeness a hollow movement and I believe that the inner human heart connects into that at an
1126080	1131920	informational level where one is transforming the other through this synergistic connection
1131920	1138400	and that this synergistic connection lies behind what we describe as energy matter in the explicate
1138400	1146960	order right so movement emerges from the implicate order out into an explicate order where our
1146960	1155280	brains organize it into a concept so when I was studying neuroscience this is absolutely basic
1155280	1161520	neuroscience you know well established that there are what are called sensory association
1161520	1169680	areas in the brain where particularly the distance senses are all brought together to to to construct
1169680	1174880	certain impressions I'm not going to go into this in any detail at the moment but I just want to say
1174880	1180640	that it is well known that this parietal cortex area here generates a concept of space
1181280	1185680	and if there are lesions or illnesses that affect this area it'll be affecting our spatial awareness
1187040	1192800	this area of the frontal lobe underneath and in the middle is involved in sensing time
1194080	1198480	and this is the one that I really want to draw your attention to this temporal lobe sensory
1199200	1206160	association area living together you know your visual balance auditory touch sensations body
1206160	1212480	or a body images on all integrate here they pull together memories as well and so we get meaningful
1212480	1218480	association with our ongoing sensory experience is generated in these three different areas
1219520	1222720	now the point about the temporal lobe one is this is where there are some
1223520	1228800	unusual effects that come from epilepsy affecting this area or any other illnesses
1229440	1234000	and they can make life seem unreal what is what's going on here is something called
1234000	1240480	object recognition which is easiest described by for example talking about a bicycle the bicycle
1240480	1245360	looked at from different angles looks totally different and yet we somehow develop an idea
1245360	1249520	that this is a bicycle there's something solid there called a bike and it looks like this from
1249520	1254560	different angles right and that is what's being pulled together in this area of the brain
1255600	1262400	so it gives a sense of real present object recognition now when I started to apply the
1262400	1272000	triquetral image of what's happening here these change and form and relatedness are features of
1272000	1281520	our sensory input which are coming into this dynamic where the brain is constructing an organized
1282400	1288560	sense of the world out of chaotic neural experience of sensors coming in from all angles
1288560	1294880	and memories coming in together and it's happening here and these three areas these three points
1295840	1305040	coordinate by pairing their inputs in these different areas so if we if we were just to
1305040	1311840	look a little bit more at forms you know shapes of things and the relationship of forms if those
1311840	1319360	two things come together it creates a sense of space and if forms are changing a pendulum
1319440	1327120	swinging gives you a sense that there is time on the move and this is the one that I want to
1327120	1331520	draw your attention if this theory is true and this is a hypothesis I'm putting it to you as a
1331520	1339040	hypothesis that could be tested then if these three sensory inputs can be integrated in these
1339040	1346240	sensory association areas to generate a sense of space and of time and of real presence then the
1346240	1351760	other pairing is that the change of relatedness and what I mean by that is let's imagine you're
1351760	1355520	walking along suddenly you bang your hand against the edge of the table you haven't particularly
1355520	1361200	noticed right you will think there's a solid table there right but actually what's happened is that
1361200	1366960	your hand has had a change of relatedness and that that had got converted through your object
1366960	1371600	recognition temple sensory association area into the center there's a solid optic there
1372320	1377920	if you if somebody walks into a room if there's a change of relatedness you might get the sense
1377920	1384960	that there's a real presence of someone in the room so out of changes of relatedness we develop
1384960	1391840	a concept of substance there's a substantial person come in if someone says feel the quality
1391840	1395680	of this cloth you don't just put a fingertip against it and say you're feeling the quality
1396400	1402480	you move your hand over it and you get a pat changing array of sensory input that
1402480	1406880	you associate with your memories and gives you a sense of the substance of this material
1406880	1413280	that you're touching so this is object recognition any sense of objects that we have around us is
1413280	1420080	actually constructed from a whole history memorized of our changing relatedness with
1420080	1424800	our environment from the time when we were babies gumming things that we put in our mouths
1426240	1430960	right the way through we're accumulating a sense of textures and qualities that we
1430960	1435600	change our relatedness with and we shape this idea that things are real objects so this is a
1435600	1442640	fairly complicated idea but I just want to put it to you as a theory I'm put this icon up here
1442640	1451680	the core icon just to emphasize that this process going on in the brain is part of the social brain
1452240	1457520	all of these three are inputs from our environment that the brain is organizing
1457520	1464320	in order to make a response and these three are project forward to the motor areas here
1464960	1470400	that's what's going on in this central space and it's in the motor areas where we prepare our
1470400	1479280	responses that these three sense of spacetime and objects of substance and become properly
1479360	1485840	integrated into a sense of me myself in this environment so I spent a bit of time explaining
1485840	1492480	that but you know this is a core to it so this is just sort of restating what I said David
1492480	1499440	Bohm's implicate order of movement is the changing relatedness of patterned forms the changing
1499440	1508800	relatedness of patterned forms and that sense of space and time and of substantial reality
1508800	1518320	around us is what we mean by the explicate order that is it we have what I call an orientation
1518320	1524480	horizon a lot of our experience are placed in this sense of orientation in space and time and
1524480	1529840	substance but if you think about it there's an awful lot of our experience which is below
1529840	1535920	the orientation horizon which is not orientated and the simplest most obvious one to say is the
1535920	1543120	sense of smell that activates you that alerts you but it actually alerts you to search with your
1543120	1549520	distant senses for what the source of that smell is yeah so the sense of smell is not actually
1550240	1557440	orientated right but it it drives us to seek orientation to bring in this explicate order
1557440	1562800	to a set of experiences that are below that orientation horizon and this is what I'd like
1562800	1569760	to be proposing to you that this is what I mean by the inner human heart it's a whole range of
1569760	1576400	awareness and sensitivities that is below the orientation horizon and a lot of it is to do
1576400	1582720	with emotion with emotion a lot of it the emotion comes from our values and how we interact with
1582720	1590960	the world around our values emotion is energy in motion and emotion is values in from energy
1591680	1597040	entering our awareness this is where I'm proposing to you that our inner human hearts
1597760	1605520	are actually connected into an implicate order way beyond what we are aware of in our
1605520	1610880	conscious minds as being above the orientation horizon as an explicate order
1614400	1619600	now these informational movements that are shown in the double tri-creature can scale up
1620320	1628240	and I'm not going to spend too long on this but when they connect together what was the
1628240	1634560	synergic vibration just between two of them can start to become a progressive wave of movement
1634560	1640960	through networks of movement changes remember all of these tri-creature are not solid objects
1640960	1647680	they are icons of movement the changing relatedness of patterned forms and here we're beginning to see
1647680	1657920	patterned forms whoops you know that was um good on but um so the I'll just take um take that back
1657920	1663440	oh sorry and here we go this is going to be a bit unusual now anyway so just sorry about the
1663440	1670240	interaction there but the point I wanted to make from that previous slide is that um the
1670240	1676080	synergic movement can translate into progressive movements through that implicate order which
1676080	1683040	we'll come back to in a moment but this is what science measures science is measuring the movements
1683040	1688160	through the linear movements through what I'm going to be describing is what I believe is the
1688160	1693440	implicate order and describing it in terms of these networks of tri-creature tri-creature movement
1694240	1702080	now this this lovely sculpture here is just um a beautiful picture um of the types of conversational
1702080	1710080	orientation uh that I'd like to sort of capture for you um the the the iconic representations
1710080	1714960	can be true in networks of people or at the level in the implicate order even of quantum
1714960	1722640	gravity it's the same principles of movement that are on the go now in quantum theory there's
1722640	1729120	something called um you know quantum field quantum field theory which is running to problems because
1729120	1736400	it's based on particles and it says that around particles there's a quantum field of energetic
1736400	1742800	activity and it's it's running to one or two problems and I want to mention at this stage
1742800	1751520	because what I'm proposing about tri-creature um implicate order is that it's actually much more
1751520	1756640	pervasive than related to the particles the particles emerge out of it and I'm also going
1756640	1763680	to be proposing that waves in fact emerge out of this implicate order so the idea of quantum fields
1763680	1771360	around particles is approaching it in the wrong direction now I believe that looking at this level
1771360	1778960	of uh an extensive implicate order out of which emerge particles and waves and eventually emerge
1778960	1784880	all of the dynamics that we call explicit order which our brains have evolved to detect to engage
1784880	1792000	with to construct an impression of this world so that we can talk to each other sensibly and cooperate
1792000	1798080	to to to manage life and manage our environments together and all of that going on over incredibly
1798160	1805200	long time frames and so on but I believe that this implicate order relatedness can provide a
1805200	1811040	cosmological explanation for the disappearing poem and for the dream that broke linear time
1811920	1816960	and that's where we're going to be going with all of this and I'd like to be proposing that the
1816960	1822560	concept of infamy energy in this implicate order that the movements that are set up through it
1822560	1827600	there are harmonics that are running through it I believe the vibrations extend into uh sort of a
1827600	1836640	harmonic um hole um and but it gets diversity is inherent to the way these tri-creature connect
1836640	1841920	together we'll be looking at that a little bit more um and because there is diversity within
1841920	1848080	this implicate order there is information one part informs the other of the movements that are going
1848080	1855600	on within this implicate order and that emerges into our experience of life we're connected into it
1855600	1862960	but we try to make sense of it in our explicate order but our brains unfortunately have a weak spot
1862960	1868960	and that what is relatedness at the level of the implicate order and change of relatedness
1869600	1877680	in unusual patterns there our brains convert into the idea of solid objects so of course
1877680	1882640	my motorbike existed of course the car existed of course the poem existed it was a solid object
1882640	1888960	wasn't it but actually what might be happening in the implicate order at that level is that there
1888960	1895360	were much more pervasive dynamics on move which we could not be aware of because we were insensitive
1895360	1900960	to them and that's the relationship between the implicates and the explicate uh that we is part of
1900960	1907760	life so the ecological systemic view of the social person is in the explicate order and an
1907840	1914960	informational view of energy and matter is in the implicate order now just coming back to this
1914960	1921120	sculpture of the three women um this is a conversation about the three people can you see the expressions
1921120	1926400	on their faces they each have different angles on this conversation one blade is pouring out
1926400	1931040	a heart about the story the one on the right is taking it all in and just absorb with it
1931040	1934720	I don't know about you but the one in the middle looks to me just a little bit skeptical saying
1934720	1940000	yeah maybe so maybe so you know but it's a little bit sitting back and you know so they've got three
1940000	1945360	different minds that are forming different concepts of one dynamic that's going on between them
1945920	1949120	what I'd like to point out to you I don't know whether you've noticed it yourself
1949120	1956640	but have a look at their bodies and their legs they're touching a lot of contact going on between
1956640	1962880	them there's a lot of very subtle communication going on between them at a different level to
1962880	1969920	what's going on in their minds yeah that is a picture to me of the implicate order out of which
1969920	1975920	emerges our own individual perceptions of the explicate order we then converse to try and
1975920	1980880	team up and make sense and see it from your angle and see it from mine and we very quickly forget
1980880	1987360	they were all part of something bigger and we're all connected already in it so this is a picture
1987520	1993680	three analytical perspectives that people can construct on a single dynamic amongst them all
1995120	2000880	and that these analytic perspectives like the one in the middle can make somebody take a mental
2000880	2007200	step back from involvement in the conversation just to try and analyze hey what's going on here
2007200	2011760	if you do I really believe this you know rather than being absorbed in it as the two ladies on
2011760	2017120	the outside are absorbed in the exchange of information between them so to me this is a
2017120	2027600	lovely picture of conversations now I'm going to say just a little bit more about the the actual
2027600	2033600	event of the dream so I mentioned before that there was pulling up some traffic lights I didn't
2033600	2038000	say that but three cars were stopped and the traffic lights were red but then as I approached
2038080	2042400	from behind they changed the red amber which in England means hey get ready we're going to be
2042400	2048560	going soon and on a motorbike that's an absolute gift you just you know accelerate away overtake
2048560	2053200	all three cars at the same time and zoom on ahead of the lot saying hey this is you know great life
2053200	2059520	and so but actually alerted by the dream I was just about to start accelerating and I know I stood
2059520	2066560	on that brake and pulled back behind the last car and then that front car did a spin in the road
2067280	2071920	roared off in the opposite direction and what I didn't say before is that the car had black
2071920	2078080	tinted windows it was covered in dust it just looked nasty it wasn't a standard make of car it
2078080	2085600	had been worked on it looked dangerous and it looked evil there was intentional movement about it
2085600	2093680	that's the key term there was intentional movement and it was evil now that's what I've reflected on
2093680	2100560	for years and years and years and this I would like to say is very significant in why I moved from
2100560	2107120	exploring wider spiritualities to feeling really comfortable with a Celtic approach to
2107120	2112320	Christianity not to the other formalized religions which I believe have pushed things off to an extreme
2113520	2120560	but this earthed area of hospitality of community of relatedness now that's where the true spirituality
2120560	2128720	lies but the point about that encounter on the road right was that there were two personalities there
2131680	2142960	and the movements the action that happened arose out of our personal values my value was to take
2142960	2148160	note of that dream my value was to enhance life my values to explore what was going on
2148880	2154720	I don't know exactly what the values were the driver of that car had but they were not life
2154720	2159680	enhancing there was there was it was something that I would say is an attitude of deafness
2159680	2164800	about it and I think this is what convinced me that when we're looking at the implicate order
2165360	2171840	and relatedness that goes beyond space and time as our explicate order brains construct
2172400	2178800	and can emerge as a dream one month in advance of that that alerts me in two stages of the dream
2179360	2185120	to the fact that something dangerous is going to happen in that implicate order
2185920	2192480	there are human values there the human values are embedded and this is the point I really want to be
2192480	2198720	making to you that I'm not convinced that the best way of thinking about this implicate order
2198720	2205840	is to try and call it consciousness or order the I think once we understand that human values
2205840	2211600	are based in our hearts and move direct our movements direct our thoughts direct the quality
2211600	2217040	of our relationships and our reactions to each other we're beginning to get ourselves
2217040	2223040	earthed in the implicate order not the explicate order that's pre-orientation
2223600	2231280	and our hearts a month before that were somehow discerning something that there's a direction
2231280	2237760	that my life was going in and this event could have ruined it and whoever was driving that car
2237760	2247680	was sensitive to the opposite move so I have to say that this this sense of personal value
2247680	2253840	in the implicate order brings a life for me the conversational nature of reality
2254800	2261920	and we can we hide it we lose it because of the way our brains orientate us in an explicate order
2261920	2272320	of matter and substance so hollow movement is the emerging as systemic personal identity
2272800	2279120	with it now I just to say I'm very fortunate that John Hunt publishers have recently agreed to
2279680	2286240	publish a book on this subject so what I'm going to be going into explain how I believe space and
2286240	2293360	time can be conceived in a new way coming out of this implicate order is much explained in much
2293360	2299600	more detail in this book the title is clearing away unveiling the mental tricks that hide reality
2300480	2304800	now I'm going to be giving you a very quick overview of what's in that book but really there
2304800	2309920	would be too much information here for you to try and take it in and really work on it so I'm
2309920	2314800	going to ask you just to sit back and take it a little bit like going to the cinema where you're
2314800	2319920	just sort of watching the story unfold and then maybe at the end of it you try and tie it all
2319920	2326880	together and be critical do I mean this is this is as I say it's hypothesis it's exploring what
2326880	2332080	could be now I've got a colour coding in the next set of slides that are coming up the black
2332080	2337840	headings are when I'm talking about tri-critical cosmology itself into the diversifying unity of
2337840	2346160	life that we're part of that dynamic the red headings are about the concept of time and there
2346160	2351040	are three perspectives like those three women three perspectives can be struck constructed on
2351040	2357120	timing the on time that construct an idea of timing the blue headings go into the idea of
2357120	2362400	space and substance as tri-critical hollow movement so that's the structure of what's coming up
2363040	2370880	and it's all about synergy as conversational orientation when we enter into this communications
2370880	2378960	feedback at whatever level we want to consider things synergic life starts to move within us
2381200	2386800	so there is too much for you to take on board here so I really ask you not to try and take it on too
2386800	2394400	much but the point is that here I've shown the standard tri-critra of you know of what's how the
2394400	2403360	brain gets organised and here it is in this analytical direction when somebody takes a mental
2403360	2409680	step back from the conversation to think about the forms and objects something strange happens
2409760	2414720	inside the brain the way things are orientated and I go into this in much greater detail in
2414720	2418000	the book to explain how it all happens in neurological terms as well for those who are
2418000	2426560	interested but space and time become projected out of the observer identity people become an
2426560	2432400	observer of life when they look at the forms and objects and the forms and objects take out with
2432400	2439520	them the space and time leaving inside this sense of personal identity my thought experience
2440880	2449120	and so an observer of life considers themselves to be a presence of mind I am a presence of mind
2449120	2458320	observing reality and I retain within me how I change my relatedness to that external reality
2458400	2465360	which is the origin of the empirical frame of mind the scientific empiricism I can act on this
2465360	2470960	objective world in any way I choose to without any sense of moral obligation as being part of it
2470960	2477520	because I'm acting on it now part of what comes with this is that the time frame here is an arrow
2477520	2485520	of time as I previously said a linear cause effect sequence of causality things move from
2485520	2491680	the past to the future in the arrow of time and so eternity in this view seems like an endless
2491680	2496160	string of pictures like an old cinema reel and the present moment is one of these pictures in the
2496160	2504880	middle and it's slowly moving along this line and spatial dimensions become the real context for life
2504880	2512320	not a product of life so this is turned inside out what is really the conversational experience
2512320	2519840	that the movement of relatedness generates space and time and a sense of reality but when you take
2519840	2526560	an analytical step back from the conversation it looks as if I'm in a boat
2530160	2533200	are you hearing what I'm hearing it's a very pleasant music in the background
2533920	2541440	um so um so so that's the one particular analytical perspective and have worked
2541440	2546960	linear time time sequence becomes formed this is what I call the structuralist perspective
2547520	2554000	when pushed to an extreme it's the materialist perspective this becomes material but it doesn't
2554000	2560080	have to be pushed to that extreme but the structuralist perspective will tend to say that the dimensions
2560080	2567840	of space and time are part of the objective reality now if you take a mental step back to
2567840	2573120	look at the conversation looking at the changes that are going on there the changes can be
2573120	2579200	projected out is to my perceived reality and that becomes like a whole chaos of processes
2579200	2583760	and living souls are making different choices and I really don't know what's going on but in
2584320	2589440	here the human identity the personal identity becomes my own space my personal bubble in my
2589440	2595600	personal space I create information that I can push out into this chaos to bring order
2596400	2603040	and this what I'm calling an informationist view of life and in the last 50 years with
2603040	2609040	information technology this has become like the dominant way of looking at the world
2609040	2615040	that information is more important than matter but it can be pushed to an extreme where the
2615120	2621200	information is given an objectivity which it doesn't belong the information if you see it as a
2621200	2628000	verb is a dynamic that's going on between two things so people in this view believe they have
2628000	2635280	to construct information as a noun that they transmit into the chaos to all to the movement
2635280	2642080	that's going on there now in this one time seems like a time frame it's the story what's the
2642080	2646800	you could go have a beginning and a middle and an end and I put stuff in that changes the story
2646800	2655600	or makes the story and so that's a totally different way but it is still measurable just like
2655600	2662240	linear time is measurable but these are actually different features in terms of the way the brain
2662240	2668400	can construct a sense of time not spending too long on this now but the third view if one takes
2668400	2673200	a mental step back from a conversation to start looking at the qualities of relatedness that are
2673200	2681040	going on in this conversation something totally different happens in the brain and if relatedness
2681040	2688480	in an extreme can get pushed out to become an objective reality itself as a life force a vitalist
2688480	2696240	force a spirit a town and that the common thing about all concepts of life forces from any
2696240	2703520	culture around the world is that they all course through space and they are like a higher power
2703520	2709680	they are in a presence of a higher power to which individual people feel they must submit
2709680	2717040	in order to come into a harmony with it for their health and their longevity or or whatever now
2717040	2723120	what I want to say here is that what is retained in the sense of personal identity looking on this
2723840	2729840	is that I become a participator in a life that is beyond me yeah and there's a lot in this this is
2729840	2736800	a vitally important analytical perspective and I need to say very clearly at this point by identifying
2736800	2743280	these three perspectives I'm not saying any of them is right or wrong they are all equally
2743280	2750480	justifiable in logical terms but the difficulty is if they get pushed to an extreme extreme
2750480	2755680	there are logical deductions that don't compare are not compatible with each other and the one
2755680	2763520	here is that because the personal identity has changed of form retained as part of its identity
2764880	2772480	this is this concept of my own time and I can return to eternity and come back again in a changed
2772480	2780320	form and this is logically consistent with this particular view on life this perspective on life
2781120	2787200	so reincarnation is logical in this perspective but in the materialist perspective it's totally
2787200	2794240	illogical and in the individualist perspective the informationist it's an interesting idea but
2794240	2799600	it's neither here nor there whether whether it happens or not so these perspectives give very
2799600	2805440	different pictures of what's going on in life and I'm going to say this again in any one of
2805440	2811600	these analytical perspectives you can get a view into the whole of life and see the whole of life
2811600	2817840	in that perspective and make sense of it as far as it'll go but as soon as you try to integrate it
2817840	2822480	with the way that it looks from another perspective you're going into problems and people then
2822480	2828080	sadly end up criticizing each other and blaming each other and and running each other down saying
2828080	2834800	you're wrong rather than you've got an interesting perspective can we compare those and see if we
2834800	2841600	can match them to find common ground and that is what this tri-cletal model is all about it's about
2841600	2847280	being able to recognize the different analytical perspectives but then to bring them together
2847280	2854880	to explore how to integrate them into a way that we can delve into the implicate order of life
2854880	2861280	to understand it better to really connect better into it so I want to emphasize I'm not saying that
2861280	2868320	any one of these is wrong they're all equally justifiable but they each can only be right
2868320	2872800	as far as they go they can't be the whole truth without trying to match metric with the other
2872800	2880320	match it with the others and here we sit on the red heading and I just like to for a moment ask
2880320	2884320	you to think back again to that incident with the driver in the car and myself on the motorbike
2885840	2892160	just think about the dream and the event I just described three different approaches to time
2892160	2898240	one is the eternal now throughout life and that we can move from eternity into the now
2899600	2906320	and and get a very big picture of who I am in the whole picture the other is of time frames
2907040	2913040	there's a story going on here how extensive is that time frame how extensive is the story
2913840	2917920	and then there's time sequence was there a time sequence yes there certainly was
2917920	2924880	there were time sequences going on through that story all three of them are relevant as we reflect
2924880	2932240	on that unusual event so a triquet for relational balance can avoid dualisms because all those
2932240	2937920	three perspectives construct a sort of dualism and avoiding dualisms can be found by reflecting
2937920	2945040	in what I call a gap in time between the seconds of your mind we're now connecting with that poem
2946000	2949680	between the seconds of the mind there is beauty such as always found
2952240	2958880	it in the world it can be beautiful but also personal values can create chaos or turmoil
2959440	2966960	that can actually create danger difficulty and the implicated order is basically a life enhancing
2966960	2973760	order that generates life and can bring healing and restoration even when people's values
2974320	2976240	cause destruction and brokenness
2979120	2983920	so this is the last slide on time and timing so we talked about three different perspectives
2984480	2991200	the timing of decisions some of you may know the zen art and arrow paradox that the art and the
2991200	2999040	arrow are all one concept if you now think about the three analyses this is how we get into
2999040	3005360	interaction the aiming of that why is somebody tensioning if they have a purpose in mind the
3005360	3012560	tension is both in the person and in the bow the release of that arrow is a decision in linear time
3012560	3019040	that the time is right there's a story about the whole context in which this action is being
3019040	3029040	tensioned and aligned this is Karen Barad's interaction and in this tri-creatural concept
3029040	3035440	of movement if you're in a what's called a positivist view that there are little bits of
3035440	3040560	battle like atoms and so on that actually has their own reality that's the positive view of
3040560	3048480	the world people talk about well what sets these things in movement and this movement of what these
3048480	3055120	bits exist but what brings the movement but on a tri-creatural cosmology is turning that upside
3055120	3061680	down and saying that what the things matter emerges out of movement it's emergent order
3061680	3066800	from implicated order and this is process philosophy it's the emergence and dispersal
3066800	3072800	of pattern forms among infamenity movement reshaping and releasing continuously as that
3073360	3077920	archer and arrow is doing which means that when we start looking at quantum
3079520	3085600	quantum physics or mechanics or whatever you want to call it we're not looking at quantum
3085600	3091600	a quantum of energy as if energy is something that is pre-existent we're looking at quantum
3091600	3098000	change a small package of change right which can scale up by further entanglements to create
3098000	3105520	movement out of which particles and waves emerge and the whole explicated order eventually
3105520	3116240	emerges in which we are intraactive so there's a few slides now looking at what is the concept of
3116240	3123520	space and of substance into which this movement is in which we're in which we're part of the
3123520	3131360	movement now the tri-creature actually has two forms the knot theory shows that it has a left
3131360	3136800	spin in the right spin clockwise or anti-clockwise and here you can see the one here this line comes
3136800	3143280	down in front of that one and here it comes down behind it this is knot theory and they have different
3143280	3150800	dynamics they're each equal in terms of movement but there's a different structure to us so
3154000	3163040	just moving on there when they pair up this is again the core icon is a double tri-creature
3163760	3170160	this is where a single tri-creature actually gains existence a single quantum change has no
3170160	3178160	existence on its own but when that change starts to communicate with another in a conversational
3178160	3184640	reality it becomes a vibration one becomes an ecology for the other this is the core element
3184640	3191120	of existence now when i started making 3d printed models of these i discovered the most remarkable
3191120	3200800	thing that the left and the levone dextro l and d resonant quanta when they when diverse quanta
3201600	3208960	quanta fit together the four ligands that remain on the outside of it lie in a horizontal two
3208960	3217360	dimensional plane but if you get an ll and a dd so this this here is an l form that one is going
3217360	3224000	behind that one and that one is an l form that one's going behind that one so this is ll and
3224000	3230880	this one the ligand has to twist in order to allow bi-directional informational flow which means
3230880	3236880	that the four ligands that come off from it orientate in different directions and here
3237520	3242160	i'm going to make the bold claim we are seeing the origin of the three dimensions of space
3242800	3249360	it is the movement of these entanglements that has to twist in order to preserve a harmonic
3249360	3256080	vibration if that could not twist there would be no harmonic it would stop vibrating each
3256080	3262400	triquid will change would separate and break up and disperse process philosophy but as it is
3262400	3269600	when there is harmonic it becomes some this core of existence now in quantum computing
3269600	3275760	they need three core states called plus minus and zero and i would without going into this i'd
3275760	3282800	like to propose that these three core double tri-quitra are probably what these core quantum
3282800	3290320	states are called qubits and qubits of information so i actually call them informational qubits to
3290320	3294960	try and emphasize that its movement and not a substance and not an object in itself
3295600	3302240	their synergic resonant movements vibrations at the plank length that really small length of
3302240	3308320	quantum change now here we are not going to spend long on this but when these scale up
3308320	3314080	further and entangle into long strings we end up with three different types of wave you can
3314080	3322320	you see the side ligands from this all of these are blue i'm really have no time to explain this
3322320	3330720	but the book will in greater detail all i can say is that these waves can develop a fourth dimension
3331680	3338320	movement along the way backwards and forwards like a slinky going a long way and that fourth
3338320	3343840	dimension movement can add time into the three dimensions of space and in fact there can be
3343840	3350880	lots more spins and twists and curls and so on of these sort of things which add extra dimensions
3350880	3356240	of movement and i would like to be proposing to you that the various dimensions of m theory and
3356240	3362160	string theory are actually different types of movement at different scales scaling up
3362160	3368000	in a spin foam of these waves that are connecting with each other i'm not going to go into the
3368000	3377360	details here but when you get the ld diverse stable qubits they make a horizontal flat plane
3377360	3386640	and it turns into a hexagon i've made models of these a flat hexagon and these waves of gravity
3386640	3393120	and light and heat are running through this as a standing wave rather than progressing from it
3393120	3399680	i'm going to have to move on but here this picture shows how you can get a progressive wave of any
3399680	3405520	sort and stable domains can come off the edge of it and i'd like to propose to you that these
3405520	3410640	stable domains as i call them are the seeds of particles we'll go on to the next slide to see
3410640	3416480	that but a single stable domain can have several different waves coming off it and the waves can
3416480	3423200	crisscross with each other making a spin foam and all of this is movement all of this is movement
3423920	3429600	informational movement making a spin foam of the implicate order out of which one area becomes
3429600	3435520	diverse from another so you get informational transfer between them but one area knows what's
3435520	3442400	going on somewhere else in a synergic network informational quantum movement because of the
3442400	3449920	utter interrelated interrelatedness of implicate order behind patterned matter that is in constant
3449920	3459360	change it's the bidirectionality of movement now the single hexagon can extend into a high cone
3460000	3466080	of stable domains all mixing together and the standing waves of heat and light and gravity
3466080	3473600	can move through this this is the closest picture that i can get to of the implicate order but it
3473600	3478320	gets more complex than this now imagine that this is a flat thing i've made a model of this
3478960	3484640	but this extended stable domain there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't curl topologically
3484640	3490640	in on itself in which case you can get these waves that might span internally
3490640	3496560	within that topological pattern and those become the internal forces of a particle
3496560	3502400	or whatever scale of particle you want to come to so those waves those three basic
3502400	3506880	preqiful waves can either become progressive waves spanning the whole cosmos in terms of
3506880	3513120	light waves and gravity or they can become the internal strong forces and weak forces that
3513120	3520320	make particles and matter hold together but then also if these stable domain extended stable domains
3520320	3524880	are curling around to make particles some of them will be very stable and some could be unstable
3525440	3529760	and that is what i believe are particles are emerging out of this implicate order
3529760	3535280	and scaling up into atoms scaling up into molecules scaling up into macromolecules
3535280	3540160	which form into cell membranes and these components of cells which form the microtubules
3540160	3545760	which help to move the amoeba to move through the environment and respond to its environment
3545760	3552000	more widely which which help mitochondria bacteria to find a home inside cells and generate energy
3552560	3557360	that all of this is going on in a cell which scales up into a higher order organism
3557360	3562160	which tend to relate and they breed and create more and create families that communicate
3562160	3569280	all around identical principles of movement movement is the changing relatedness of
3569280	3574400	patterned forms at every level emergent from the implicate order
3577680	3582560	now in current quantum theory i don't think there's any theory around that actually adequately
3582560	3587920	explains how gravity and light can interact but this particular model shows that this is
3587920	3592560	quite a complicated one to understand but i ran pipe cleaners through this this model of two
3592560	3599280	waves interacting the orange one is a gravitational wave the green one is a light wave and both of
3599280	3607600	them share a relatedness ligand now this looks as if one wave is passing through another but
3607600	3615840	that's the wrong picture of the implicate order the implicate order is a harmonic it's a spin
3615840	3623280	from network in which the there's or i would actually claim synchronicity between two ends
3623280	3631920	of a wave what becomes linear time is the movement of the fourth dimensional wave along these
3632000	3638160	tri-critical waves as i call them the tri-critical waves are forming a spin from network the implicate
3638160	3645120	order and through that implicate order can move linear waves and those are what science measures
3645760	3653040	science can compare one fourth dimension wave with another but it has no way of delving into
3653040	3660320	the true nature of the implicate order we can only discern this by scaling our human experience of
3660320	3666560	being together in groups in conversations where there's informational transfer in a brain that
3666560	3673360	is designed to interpret it using these three principles that's what i'm proposing so this
3673360	3678640	is an informational model of movement in quantum gravity it's happening in every cell in every
3678640	3685280	cell membrane of your body including every nerve cell every synapse in your brain is moving according
3685280	3692080	to these principles the microtubules also move brain neurotransmitters to the synapse and release
3692080	3699520	them at the synapse it's the same chemistry that moves an amoeba and that is moving atoms and
3699520	3705760	molecules that are on movement everywhere above absolute zero is in movement so this universe
3705760	3713680	is a cosmos because it births life in its diverse ecologies and we belong in this concept of ecology
3713680	3720080	with others we are not here on our own the the conversational nature of life is something that
3720080	3729680	we really need to to appreciate that when you look at an object you are seeing a brain construct
3729680	3735200	of changing relatedness a whole history of changing relatedness that we're interpreting as an object
3735200	3740720	so we can talk about it and manipulate it but actually it's evidence of the fact that we belong
3741360	3747440	in this cosmos we're in it we're interactive within it try to reach for quantum cosmology
3747440	3751680	the inner human heart is deeply synergic with life's movements and a much wider
3752240	3757840	concept than our explicate all the brains can take in the conscious mental experience of
3757840	3763840	orientation adds dimensional space and time right but we have a meaningful engagement
3764400	3769920	with relational life beyond space and time that's the input order in our inner hearts
3770960	3777600	in from energy is life moving in the background that we connect into and we try to make sense of
3777600	3781040	it like those three women in the conversation try to make sense of it from our different
3781040	3787920	perspectives but there is life on the go and and we we need the conversations to try and
3787920	3796480	really grasp what is actually going on now the final thing before I just close is that that
3796560	3801040	image that I gave you of the intricate order I haven't gone into this the book will go into
3801040	3808480	this in much greater detail so to properly explain it but imagine a group of people imagine that
3808480	3813280	those three women talking but imagine you're in a group of people having a conversation about
3813280	3819120	the day's events or planning where you want to go on holiday and so on and the exchanges that
3819120	3826960	are going on between you there's a whole raft of communications at an implicates a pre-orientation
3826960	3832000	level below the orientation horizons hold all those communications are going on passing
3832000	3838000	things back and forth about our values we then construct this impression or try to make sense
3838000	3845360	of what's going on now I'm not going to spend long on gravitational waves gravity holds together
3846320	3852480	at diverse places of the universe there's an enduring connection between every mass in the
3852480	3858880	universe now that to me is in the human experience could emerge as the equivalent of love love is
3858880	3865040	enduring connection between people an enduring ability to be responsive to each other even
3865040	3869760	though there might be fairly traumatic changes going on or fairly disturbing changes or maybe
3869760	3877120	anticipating very pleasant changes but that enduring sense of connection could be an equivalent
3877120	3884560	of gravitational attraction the warmth the thermodynamics of responsiveness the warmth
3884560	3891120	could be the equivalent of human kindness that as we respond to each other we're going with you know
3891120	3895680	as we're in this group together we maybe discern our differences but there can still be a warmth
3895760	3900800	of responsiveness of kindness that says well I can respond to you and you know keep this connection
3900800	3907280	worn alive but also the there is the sense of presence we can be present for each other or
3907280	3911600	you know when somebody's distracted and isn't really involved in the conversation you know it
3912880	3917360	and people sometimes take themselves away they hide themselves away they don't allow themselves
3917360	3922800	to be a presence in a social network and this is rather equivalent to the electromagnetic
3922800	3929360	type waves where where the electromagnetic magnetism causes two polarities I haven't been
3929360	3937120	able to go into that at all I'm afraid in this talk but the D and the L waves can run through
3937120	3943280	this network parallel to each other and will have opposite effects so you can have attraction or
3943280	3949440	repulsion between positive and negative charges and magnetism north and south poles and so on
3950000	3955920	but why why should all that matter be dualistic separated from our hearts from our inner hearts
3955920	3961040	we're embedded in it we're intuiting it we're communicating about it we're trying to understand
3961040	3965840	it by talking with people who see it differently and trying to edge towards a better understanding
3965840	3973520	of it and we need to be the presence of loving kindness for each other and that is a substantial
3973520	3981520	reality of a human being in this world that is the core substantial reality of a human being in
3981520	3989200	this world to be the presence of loving kindness for others in social settings or with the earth or
3989200	3997360	with god or whatever the spirituality is that is alive for you at that time and of course the love
3998320	4005120	unfortunately does not always feel like that comfortable warm cuddly joy of love when things
4005120	4010480	are going together love also is made known as grief where there's brokenness where there's separation
4010480	4016080	where there's misunderstanding or doubt or there's been offense taken or hurt that love turns into
4016080	4021280	a grief mode which you know we teach about in other areas that it actually has a positive purpose
4021280	4027760	a constructive purpose to help people to explore how to reconnect into that enduring connection
4027760	4033680	when change has pushed people out of a comfort zone but nevertheless that that grief can move
4033680	4038160	people to explore and if we have the warmth of kindness and we recognize someone is grieving
4038160	4044960	and we can be present for them then we can contribute to the healing of this world the
4044960	4052160	explicate order can get tied up in knots and we can help to untangle that we can be the presence
4052160	4058400	of loving kindness and we will be connecting into this implicated order discerning intuitively what
4058400	4063600	the movements of that order are what the values are that we need to bring alive in our relationships
4063600	4072960	now so this is the conclusion of what the the the triquetral cosmology brings us to a concept
4072960	4082000	that the human heart is much more formative of our lives than our conscious minds which we need
4082000	4087680	to connect with others in conversations in order to discern and delve deeper into what's happening
4087680	4092720	in our human hearts in terms of values and interactions so I'll just come back to that
4092720	4101520	original slide the iconic slide of triquetral cosmology two self-organizing units that are
4101520	4108960	in communication with each other there is a mutual transformation that is synergic that is
4108960	4117360	life emerging and that synergy can we become an ecology for each other and that can bring
4117360	4123600	forth fruitfulness in life after that so this I believe I'm going to come back now to the final
4123600	4132240	slide is the implicated order within which mysterious things can happen things beyond
4132240	4138800	space and time things in which substance disappears but I'd like to say to you that that
4138800	4145600	inspiration that I had to write that poem and just think this is now 50 years ago
4146160	4151920	angle's turn and lines forgive criss-crossing of the mind I hadn't even didn't know about
4152000	4159440	triquetra but I wrote that angle's turn and lines forgive criss-crossing of the mind for here
4159440	4166160	in the world there is beauty such as always found between the seconds of your mind
4167760	4173520	so thank you that's what I'd like to be sharing with you very much indeed
4174480	4180080	Trevor that was fascinating and and I think it'll take us a little bit of time to get our heads
4180080	4185440	around your new concepts but I find them very very beautiful and especially as they relate to
4186160	4192800	to David Bohm and I just a couple of remarks before you know we have a five-minute break
4192800	4199120	and then we'll come back to the question announcements and questions and one form of pattern
4199120	4206320	recognition that I would associate with David Bohm would be meaning and and maybe we can come back
4206400	4210880	to that in the in the thought because he was meaning and being he talked about
4211440	4218080	and he he didn't like the mind matter idea he he he put everything into into into a different form
4218960	4224640	so that was one observation and the second the other two observations related to Ian the Gilchrist
4226160	4231920	because I think the brain that makes matter in substance is affected by left hemisphere left
4231920	4239200	hemisphere cognition and the right hemisphere is what enables us to understand betweenness
4239840	4246160	yes betweenness is is crucial to your model it's also crucial to his and I'd just like you to tell
4246160	4254400	us I'll clarify for us how exactly you would define the inner human heart I didn't quite get that
4254400	4261840	clear use the term a lot yes is it in is it the intuition is it the what what is it exactly
4262480	4268960	do you have a definition for it well I I think it is going to need clarification in a fairly
4268960	4277600	extended way but the one way is to distinguish what in our human experience is not actually
4277600	4283040	orientated in space and time so below the orientation horizon if you think how much
4283040	4290160	for you imagine you are embedded in this explicate order world right around you that's above the
4290160	4295360	orientation horizon but there's a lot of experience to do with intuition sensing
4296720	4304080	that is is not framed in that way yeah it's very subtle it's very subtle yeah it's
4304080	4309040	nuanced it's dynamic and it's movement and and it is exactly as David Bohm is saying it's about
4309040	4315840	meaning it's I'm aware that there's some dynamic going on inside me but I cannot believe that I am
4315840	4322560	isolated in this this world this cosmos right what is this mentor of connection where do I belong
4323120	4329600	in it because what I see with my senses what is constructed into the simplified order
4329600	4337760	is not the whole story you know Ian's perspective as well that you have to think that we emerge from
4337840	4345760	within something and we're not apart from it absolutely and that's that in his whole his whole
4345760	4351440	chapter on the sense of the sacred you know makes this point anyway I'm we're going to have a break
4351440	4357760	now so back at 50 and then we'll have some brief announcements and then I'm sure there'll be a lot
4357920	4369920	questions thank you
4371440	4378880	um I think what popped in my mind when when I was reading a lot of you know the what if
4378880	4386960	questions it certainly is true that I believe the explicate order that our brains construct
4388240	4392560	everybody knows about the blind spot you know how our brain sort of fills in consciously
4392560	4398800	where there is no sensory input to the retina and we have all sorts of anticipations in life
4399520	4405680	that make us focus our attention in various ways and screen out other things and that's more the way
4405680	4412240	I look on this informational processing is because of our focus of attention we screen certain things
4412240	4419920	out and I believe that the whole brain works on feedback loops and we can we end up a little bit
4419920	4425360	like that film the matrix you know making our own reality in a way so so that's what those three
4425360	4431440	analytical perspectives are that the more you push yourself down that line of maintaining your focus
4431440	4438960	on certain areas of life the more you become separated from the ongoing in implicate order
4438960	4444960	conversational reality yeah you go off into your own mental world and you can talk with talk
4444960	4448800	with like-minded people and it'll sound as if everything's sensible and you're seeing it all
4448800	4454240	together but there will always be a limit to that one perspective just as a Galileo project
4454240	4459440	has said there's a definite limit to materialism but what what can we explore alternatively
4460320	4465280	that's the same is true if you if you if you take the vitalist view to an extreme
4466080	4472640	I'm afraid to say while I am a great believer in that participatory view of life
4473920	4480000	I'm I'm you know I don't believe I can just think it all into existence I'm not sure that
4480000	4485200	you know I think there is a material reality out there that that implicate order actually is
4485200	4491040	making particles and waves and the particles scale up into things that do behave deterministically
4491760	4498400	now we can work with that at different levels but the idea that just with our conscious minds
4499280	4504640	we can sort of dissolve it I just feel that's maybe going to a step too far there's sort of a
4504640	4510000	middle ground of paradox that we need to be living in where we're that's why we need the
4510000	4515840	conversations to explore that middle ground very good I mean what what you're saying also
4516720	4521200	we're doing a Bergson because the Bergson said the brain is the organ of attention to life
4522080	4528320	and and part of part of that attention is exclusion yes and if we if we took in all the
4528320	4534160	information that that we potentially could we'd be completely overloaded and we're already overloaded
4534800	4542160	and but we'd be completely swamped absolutely absolutely and and thank you
4543120	4547280	so what I'd like to do if I could just sort of build on this point a bit more I've said the
4547280	4553680	brain works on feedback loops now I personally believe that and you're asking for my concept
4553680	4562560	within a human heart I think many people are aware that decisions choices are made emotionally
4563680	4569200	yeah they're made through the limbic brain and the core brain which is pulling together all
4569280	4575600	sorts of associations and sales psychology of course is expert at this they know how to influence
4575600	4584960	the emotions to influence the government right yes thank you and and so decisions are formed by
4584960	4590480	feedback loops between the core brain and the limbic brain and the cerebral cortex but also
4590480	4598000	coming into the core brain is all of our sensory input and there are filters in the core brain
4598000	4604560	that filter the sensory input on its way up and the outgoing motor in outputs
4605360	4611600	feed those filters they put a priority and that's part of the attention-focusing mechanism
4612320	4618160	yeah which of course a neuro neuro linguistic program is very strong on all of that sort of
4618160	4625600	filtering of information now that's what I believe the values are they're actually the priming of
4625680	4631520	filters in the core brain and the limbic brain that allow through certain things that we're
4631520	4638720	anticipating or magnify things that don't fit with it mismatches so that our attention focuses
4638720	4645040	on what is not going right so we can target our activity towards that purpose the purpose that
4645040	4650560	we have in mind the problem is the purpose we have in mind is our purpose not the bigger
4650560	4658720	purpose of the universe yes well there may be some sort of alignment there but we can't tell
4658720	4663840	yeah absolutely let's move on to the next question it's Julie Henshelwood does the
4663840	4672240	implicate order imply potential this is 2105 that's your question I think an absolutely
4672240	4678480	core thing that's going on for me is that discover all the the the Nobel Prize in 2011
4679200	4684160	which they had proved that the universe is still expanding at an ever-increasing rate
4684160	4691600	the universe is an open system and again in the book I would go into how I believe the open the
4691600	4700480	the tri-critical model allows the open generation of of new areas new new substance even you know
4700480	4707680	that my experience of life and I have had these personal experiences is that substance can
4707680	4714000	transform miraculously I simply have to say that is my experience that does not fit with
4714000	4722320	the laws of science and the laws of thermodynamics and so there is something about open system
4722320	4728720	thinking which as Julie is saying is all about growth and opportunity and potential
4729840	4735120	and the potential can grow but through conversational interaction it can stabilize
4735760	4743360	those stable domains are absolutely the core of what makes life sustainable right so there's a
4743360	4749200	constant movement but and those stable domains can form and they can disrupt and they can split
4749200	4755760	but nevertheless the fact that they stabilize movement and change and that that can scale up
4755760	4762240	to a level of predictability and determinism you know also allows because it's rooted in movement
4762960	4768560	it allows the miraculous and unusual transformation of those stability I think that's the key point
4768560	4777920	really and when I said we're David Bohm you're starting from the dynamic hollow movement and I
4777920	4784880	was just bowled over when I read The Implicit Order in about 1983 he spoke at the Mystics and
4784880	4792480	Scientists conference that year in fact with the Sheldrake and I'm also thinking that the closed
4795360	4802960	system is associated with linear thinking and a linear idea of time so I think this is as it
4802960	4808720	were systemic if I'm understanding you properly because once you've got an open system you're also
4808800	4816160	open into well we are consciousnesses there is our access means for the whole of what we're talking
4816160	4822480	about and but but once you're open you're open outwards and inwards if one can even make that
4822480	4830240	distinction I'm just totally with that but it all depends on our sensitivities and our willingness
4830240	4837760	to create gaps in time so that we can just step back from all of our constructs and just engage
4838320	4844800	with new sensitivities but then we need to affirm that through conversations with others who see
4844800	4849680	life differently because otherwise we just go off into our own you know our own imaginary worlds
4850400	4855840	if we do that we need this conversational interaction to find our own stabilities
4856880	4862080	then we are coming on to Peter from Scotland where it's still light it's totally sharp
4862400	4868960	yes indeed it's light but I'd like some light cast on my problems I might
4870240	4878240	I'm going to I can't formulate it properly for you so I ask you to be very tolerant of what I'm
4878240	4885440	saying because I haven't come to the a full understanding of what we're doing a number of us
4885440	4895760	in Bacillus is one of them are looking at random number generators and we're looking at the way
4895760	4902800	they go out of randomness now what is interesting about this is that we're looking at it what happens
4902800	4909440	when people die and we have reason to think that this will be a point at which the random numbers
4909440	4917360	will go out of randomness and also and this is much more interesting much more important
4918080	4928160	is that you link random number generators to specific people and specific events by forming
4928160	4936960	a relationship with them and the event so that's three three events there's a generator
4936960	4946000	there's the event and there is you who is doing it and it seems to me that there is going to
4946960	4958960	as time moves on the relationship between the random number generators and people and events
4958960	4964720	are going to increase enormously you'll have one in your pocket and you will to some extent see
4964720	4972400	the intensity of what somebody is thinking also time is a material and space is a material
4973280	4977920	now with that rather poorly formulated question can you can you help
4979520	4988400	um I'm really not sure what a random number generator physically is it's a presumably a
4988400	4996160	mini computer correct and what is the actual product you know what and what form does the
4996160	5003280	number remember so my model about whole movement at the input order is that it's the changing
5004000	5013680	relatedness of formed patterns but the formed patterns um it are of movement there there are
5013680	5020320	cyclical synergic you know spins or vibrations or progressions of energy
5021280	5029120	through this spin foam so what does the now random number generator do it produces streams of
5029120	5038320	noughts and ones and noughts and ones and these are either totally random as the pattern you get
5038320	5046000	or in fact they're less random they have structure in them and the structure it seems to be given
5046000	5057520	a remotely uh and there is a space is is not counted and uh um okay the thing the thing so
5058400	5063760	as you were telling you know your story describing the situation what popped into my mind
5064560	5068960	was the time when I was using the Qing and thinking about divination and there are the
5068960	5074400	settings and religious settings in which people try to divine um what is the dynamic that's going
5074400	5080960	on in hollow movement uh or in the implicate order uh and I came to think that there really
5080960	5087840	there's no need to use sticks and stones to do that um you know if our hearts are open to a
5087840	5094320	relationship with the implicate order we should be able to increase our sensitivities enough to be
5094320	5100320	able to discern intuitively you know wise courses of action now I'm just wondering whether you're
5100320	5106560	describing the opposite you know which is that if I have made a relationship with uh an electronic
5106560	5116080	random number generator right that that relationship uh with it actually brings my heart level values
5116080	5120560	and here I would say rather my thoughts I'm repeatedly going to come back to my values
5121120	5128480	we bring my values into a dynamic relationship with whatever the um the quantum level
5128480	5133840	substance of your random number generator is I can't really be more precise I wonder whether
5133840	5138400	there's a form there's a form of entangled one going on here yes thank you that's probably a
5138400	5145680	helpful word there yeah um yes because in other words you you become somehow related
5145680	5151920	to the dynamics of the system which you aren't initially um but you become so through interacting
5152480	5157040	yes it's a little bit like the biofeedback system but if you if you have a belief that
5157040	5162560	this random number generator is something you can have a relationship with then perhaps you can
5163680	5169120	that I think is an interesting premise because and in fact I think I think I write in saying Peter
5169920	5176160	the the skeptics trying to do this often have um negative correlations
5178720	5184000	yes there we go we create our own realities yeah you see that's really interesting okay Peter
5184000	5188720	thanks so much let's go on to actually before I go on to Bernard that's what I want to ask
5188720	5197440	this question from Craig Hayengar about um the comparison of your triquetras with trefoil knots
5197440	5202800	yes and he did a bit about that so maybe you could just say a little bit about that
5202800	5209280	yes we looked at that the first um computer assisted design um models that we were making
5210240	5214640	the guy who was doing it uh it assumed that I was talking about a trefoil
5215360	5219600	and the the mathematics of a trefoil has been extremely well worked out they know all the
5219600	5223920	formula of the different curves um obvious and so he thought oh this is simple we just
5223920	5229520	string trefoils together and it just didn't work at all but the reason being that a trefoil
5229520	5237440	the what is a point on a triquetra is an angle that turns internally or becomes a ligand that
5237440	5244560	extends into the neighboring uh triquetra right it's a movement that either angles in on itself
5244560	5251920	and reflects internally or it becomes part of a synergy with an entangled one now trefoil that
5251920	5259280	angle is actually a curve now it's more like a ribbon that called curves around and goes back in
5259280	5263760	and it definitely is the same sort of eternal movement there's no question of that you know
5264800	5270560	they're both describing eternal movement but the trefoil doesn't include within it a model by which
5270560	5275920	it can entangle and we proved that because we tried and failed good okay I think we'll just
5275920	5279600	leave it at that because we're going to have 10 minutes or so and there's still people in the queue
5280160	5285120	thank you and it's our president burnard car next right hello bernard hello trevor
5285760	5290800	trevor thank you i enjoyed your talk very much um but there was quite a lot to take in and i don't
5290800	5297760	understand all of it so um but and so i was particularly interested of course in in the
5297760	5303840	emphasis you put on the triquetra and all these beautiful diagrams um i've really of course i'm
5303840	5310080	aware of triquetra in as a sort of Celtic symbol but i hadn't seen it applied in all these ways
5310080	5314800	and i really like the way you're applying it in all these different contexts both in
5316000	5321360	representation of particle physics the representation of the brain a representation of
5321360	5328320	relationships it's also reminding me a bit of dna and i was wondering why if you could apply it to
5328320	5334080	life in some sense you know but that's that could be a big question but the the more specific
5334080	5339120	question was being a physicist because i was particularly interested in what you said in
5339120	5345840	terms of its relationship to string theory really and quantum gravity and you made references to
5345840	5352640	spin foam but i couldn't quite work out to what extent you've really worked this out as a physical
5352640	5359200	theory um and to what extent it's just sort of um a qualitative discussion have you have you had
5359200	5365200	any feedback from string theorists on this sort of a right no you put your finger on the issue here
5365200	5371200	because uh remember i'm starting from a neurophysiological angle yeah i'm starting from the
5371200	5376480	level of human dynamics of systems of people and the way they communicate and how they get into
5376480	5382000	habits and routines and so on how you can break those habits and i've described in that
5382000	5388480	principles of organization that's the key term and then realize that those principles scale up
5388480	5394080	and scale down and of course my studies have taken me scaling down into cellular chemistry
5394080	5399760	macromolecular chemistry atomic and quantum i am new to everybody's new to it really aren't we
5399760	5404320	we're all guessing our way through it but what i'm saying my theory but my hypothesis
5404960	5413360	is that these principles of organization the brain has evolved to engage with so that we can have
5413360	5419760	consistent social relationships yeah that's the theory that same set of principles can scale
5419760	5426080	right down into an implicate order with entanglements that is a an order of movement
5427040	5435600	which comes below the level of any it's itty bitty you know building block you know that
5435600	5442480	it is the movement this primary that as those entangle because of the sine wave
5443120	5450480	ligands that form between them it generates the three dimensions of space yeah it actually
5450480	5456960	generates those but then where you get it stringing out into a long what i call a triquetral wave
5456960	5464560	just like a slinky you can get a fourth dimension wave moving along it yeah that's the that's so
5465440	5472160	if the stable domain curls into a particle which is held together by internal waves you can get a
5472160	5477760	vibration of that particle that's a fifth dimension you can get vibrations between
5477760	5483440	particles that's a sixth dimension any ligand can spin that's a seventh dimension i don't know
5483440	5490320	no here i'm guessing so you're absolutely right this is a qualitative model at the moment and my
5490320	5495280	i set off once i was working on it i set off on a search to find a quantum physicist who
5495280	5501040	would help me to apply their mathematics to this model to see that if it if it does match
5501040	5506240	experimental findings uh and so we can then modify it according to experimental findings
5506960	5513040	and i will simply say over a year's search i have not found a single uh quantum physicist who's
5513040	5519360	willing to talk to me so maybe about celios we'll talk to you well yeah i'd love to i
5519360	5526240	i want to search for one but but it needs to you know this is very much angular um angular mechanics
5526240	5531280	and so on it's the whole lot is curving all the time yeah well of course i'm i'm very fascinated
5531280	5535280	also with with what you just said about the link with dimensions and indeed the links with
5535280	5540080	hard dimensions which is one of my own interests i just one one little point you made the beginning
5540080	5545520	which i sort of disagree with which i'll just say very quickly um when you talked about the link
5545520	5550800	between open systems and the acceleration of the universe i wasn't really convinced by that because
5550800	5555920	it is true of course that the universe is accelerating but i mean even if the universe
5555920	5563360	wasn't accelerating um you still have this concept that you can violate the second or a thermodynamics
5563360	5569280	because of you know chaos there in things nonlinear effects because you can you can locally form
5569920	5575840	ever-increasing levels of complexity simply because you're not violating the second law
5575840	5581040	of thermodynamics globally because you know it's just a small fraction of the universe involved
5581040	5586000	in these this increasing structure so i wasn't really convinced by that argument in other words
5586000	5591920	even if the universe hadn't been accelerating i reckon your your argument would still go through
5592560	5599680	well that's helpful thank you learned because that would fit with the way um i again we're not
5599680	5605360	going to have time to go into this now but again in the book i do but uh but it's i actually believe
5605360	5613760	that an extending tri-critical wave moving into nothingness can actually induce movement
5613760	5618720	in nothingness right can you can actually and we actually could look at the process of continuous
5618720	5624560	creation uh through that sort of dynamic that's changing never mind the details of that it comes
5624560	5630640	back down to another couple of zen paradoxes in the way that that all works um but what you're
5630640	5639360	saying is that yes at any locality yeah at at any locality that same dynamic could be happening
5639360	5644800	and that is why the universe would be expanding at an ever-increasing rate because it is also
5644880	5650640	happening in micro-localities yeah that's that's how the expansion is happening at an
5650640	5656400	increasing rate because it's happening everywhere so i totally in agreement with you that yes that
5656400	5664240	the the chaos the complexity principles um can scale up in in any locality and the problem is when
5664240	5670160	mentally we make closed systems and believe we can experiment on it right and that that experiment
5670160	5674320	tells us the truth it doesn't it tells us what goes on in the closed system that we've created
5675280	5682000	yes i i think we've we've only got five minutes left um i think that it would be well worth trying
5682000	5686880	to develop this in in within the context of a working group within the Galileo Commission
5687760	5692640	and Vasilio you know can be in touch about this because i think there's there's a lot of
5692640	5698800	very interesting detail um to be worked out here and which really needs a much more extended
5698800	5704320	conversation than than we're able to have in in this context of some kind of questions and answers
5704400	5709680	well David thank you very much yes yeah so i mean uh Jerome sent a message to me saying does it need
5709680	5713920	a um a special interest group but i think it's probably more within the Galileo Commission
5714480	5719840	and and so i'll put you and Vasilio in touch um to talk about that Bernard thank you very much
5719840	5723920	indeed yes thank you Bernard uh Trevor thank you very much it's been incredibly rich
5724480	5732880	even and also from the the questions um a couple of points one i'm i'm put in mind of um
5735040	5740960	Gregory Bateson pattern that connects oh yes yes i mean his it's always worth going back to
5740960	5747600	Gregory Bateson because his he has actually incredibly fertile so amazing absolutely and
5747600	5752720	so i'm sure you will find new new connections there and then the other the other observation is
5752720	5760960	is a relationship between the implicate and the implicit and and the tacit um um sorry
5761040	5768160	Sheila we we haven't got time for any further questions um the the as as with David Bohm
5768160	5775120	the the implicate or the implicit is what's enfolded or tacit and i'm using tacit in the sense of
5775120	5782080	the microplan use um know the tacit dimension the tacit and the explicit and and so when we
5782640	5788160	David Bohm talks about this when we explain something we unfold it into the explicate order
5788160	5795120	because to explain literally means to unfold explicory and and i i i think this whole metaphor
5795120	5803520	of implicit explicit implicate explicate is extraordinarily fruitful and what you've done
5803520	5813520	is to multiply its dimensions and put it into a variety of contexts um which i think is extremely
5813520	5820320	fertile and and uh what i also very much like which is something we all need to do and again
5820320	5827200	Ian McGilchrist does this in his new book primacy of process primacy of relationship primacy of
5827200	5834480	betweenness and we got so used to our sort of subject predicate um their distinction our dualistic
5834480	5840720	in a in a mind matter um that way even our language and logic is structured um so that you've
5840720	5847280	got subject and predicate and Bohm kept on saying what about the verb yes the verb the
5848240	5854640	dynamism of the verb is in fact the most important element in a defining relationship between the
5854640	5862560	subject and the predicate and and rick tarnas is very good on explaining the origins of this it is
5862560	5871680	book um they they um make the passion the western mind um the background Aristotle and Aristotle
5871680	5876640	codified Greek logics absolutely fascinating i haven't read it for years but it just sort of
5876640	5885840	came to mind um so as i say i think let's let's get a group going um within um the Galileo commission
5885840	5890080	i think you've sent some resources i know there are some people who will very much want to be
5890080	5896240	in touch with you personally and and uh we'll take it forward from there so thank you very much
5896240	5901920	again thank you all for coming thank you for the questions uh thank you Jerome for the backup
5901920	5914880	and all the all that goes on behind the scenes to make these webinars possible and thank you again
