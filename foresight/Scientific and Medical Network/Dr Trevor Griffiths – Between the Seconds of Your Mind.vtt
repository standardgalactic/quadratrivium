WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
And a very warm welcome to everybody from a really barmy evening here in southwest France

00:17.600 --> 00:24.000
to a very interesting talk by Trevor Griffiths, who's got an extremely interesting background

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
as you'll see because he he studied medicine neuroscience and immunology and then was in

00:30.000 --> 00:38.240
medicine for a long time and he then developed this emotional literacy and emotional logic

00:39.200 --> 00:44.640
and so he's become a coach full-time and and we're going to find out more about that

00:45.520 --> 00:51.200
this this evening and you'll see that he's using some of the David Bohm terminology

00:51.200 --> 00:55.840
implicate order whole hollow movement at the end of human heart and I'm really looking forward

00:55.840 --> 01:03.760
to finding out what that means and also his key question do brains filter out our connection

01:03.760 --> 01:09.520
into life I think that's a very very interesting question as well and coming from a sort of

01:09.520 --> 01:19.200
neuro psychological point of view and while you're on I will put a link to a spectator article

01:19.200 --> 01:25.840
on consciousness by Kit Wilson this week which is extremely interesting because it finishes up

01:25.840 --> 01:32.720
questioning materialism which is almost unheard of in a kind of mainstream publication so maybe

01:32.720 --> 01:37.600
we're making some progress after all so Trevor it's a great pleasure to have you with us this

01:37.600 --> 01:42.960
evening and we're looking forward to what you have to share with us thank you very much

01:44.320 --> 01:47.760
yes thank you very much for the for the welcome for the invitation it's great to

01:47.760 --> 01:53.440
spend a bit of time with you to be sharing a range of thoughts that have developed have I

01:53.440 --> 02:02.720
frozen by the way or not no just on mine it seems to have done anyway so I've got a power

02:02.720 --> 02:08.400
point to share I'll take you through so if I can share screens on this now

02:08.560 --> 02:15.040
and how does that look is that coming through for everybody

02:15.040 --> 02:22.080
yeah that's good so thank you so the theme between the seconds of your mind and this is

02:22.080 --> 02:27.440
as you mentioned thanks David the base and David Bowen's concept of the intricate order

02:28.240 --> 02:34.080
behind the explicate order that we we live amongst where he is describing it all being

02:34.080 --> 02:39.440
hollow movement that there's movement and this talk as you see from the title is about how we

02:39.440 --> 02:42.000
perhaps connect into that through our inner hearts

02:45.440 --> 02:53.360
so I'm my main focus in this talk is around the human mind we sit in the middle of two enormous

02:53.360 --> 02:58.800
scales the telescopic of the universe and the microscopic scale and these both meet in the way

02:58.800 --> 03:04.720
our minds work and one of the things that really struck me as I looked at both of these these

03:04.720 --> 03:11.600
scales of interest as a scientist is how everything rotates or vibrates everything's in movement

03:12.720 --> 03:20.560
and as I through my studies got more involved in the way the brain works I came to realize that

03:20.560 --> 03:25.680
there is a particular feature of the way our brains help us get organized in space and in

03:25.680 --> 03:31.760
time and in the sense of substance that we're part of that actually screens out

03:32.560 --> 03:38.240
some of the awareness of our relatedness in life and converts it into static objects

03:39.360 --> 03:47.040
and that's going to be the main theme of this talk is what is going on that our brains construct

03:47.040 --> 03:51.280
certain ideas that where everything is moving everything's in turmoil

03:52.240 --> 03:58.240
somehow we've developed through our brains the idea that there is static matter

04:01.760 --> 04:07.920
now I went to Oxford to study medicine I was a bit of an unusual student in that I didn't have

04:07.920 --> 04:12.240
the traditional push by to get around I had a motorbike and quite enjoyed sort of

04:12.960 --> 04:19.200
driving it around a bit a bit faster times and so on but I had a wide range of interests there

04:19.200 --> 04:25.440
not just medicine but immunology macromolecular studies of the cell membranes and so on

04:26.640 --> 04:31.200
but also I was what I call a seeker after truth I had a number of religious experiences

04:31.840 --> 04:38.480
things that didn't quite make sense I had explored churches but couldn't quite get on with

04:38.480 --> 04:45.840
traditional religion that explored through Zen of course originally starting with that

04:45.840 --> 04:50.560
iconic book Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance of course taking a little bit from there

04:51.840 --> 04:59.280
and into eaching and the idea of divination and but then realizing why not do we need sticks or

04:59.280 --> 05:05.600
stones to engage with this world through divination if actually our inner hearts are

05:05.600 --> 05:11.040
connected in there as well if we are connected in there as well so I moved on from that into

05:11.760 --> 05:16.800
more an intuitive sort of prayerful search but without any formal structure to that

05:17.680 --> 05:23.600
and in the midst of this search I was also writing a poetry you know as students do

05:24.240 --> 05:29.840
and one day in this frame out came this particular poem which I'd like to read to you and tell you

05:29.840 --> 05:36.880
a bit of a story behind this Angle's Turn and Lines Forgive Chris Crossing of the Mind

05:37.840 --> 05:44.880
for here in the world there is beauty such as always found between the seconds of your mind

05:46.400 --> 05:50.240
so that poem came out when I was there I wrote it down and I suddenly got this feeling

05:50.800 --> 05:55.440
that I needed to get on my motorbike and drive and then I was going to have to give that poem to

05:55.440 --> 06:01.440
somebody so just intuitively I just did that I put it's a bit cool at the time so I put a

06:01.440 --> 06:06.880
jumper on a jacket and put the poem on the inside pocket and then put my outer jacket on to go on

06:06.880 --> 06:13.280
the bike and set off and drove out from the center of Oxford got out to a semi-industrial area on

06:13.280 --> 06:18.800
the edge and then suddenly thought that's it I've arrived so I pulled off the road got off the bike

06:18.800 --> 06:22.800
and I was expecting somebody to come by and that I'd know they ought to give this poem to them

06:22.800 --> 06:28.560
and nobody came so I started exploring around reached inside couldn't find the poem

06:28.560 --> 06:34.480
search everywhere went back to the flat couldn't find the poem anywhere it had disappeared

06:35.040 --> 06:41.040
and because of the sort of experiences that I've been having I was just going to say right well

06:41.040 --> 06:45.440
that's a mystery you know of course I could have just dropped it somewhere of course but actually

06:45.440 --> 06:52.880
it was very securely wrapped up under two secure levels of clothing on the way out and I just was

06:52.880 --> 06:59.200
willing to hold that I think as you see as we go along this poem actually becomes quite relevant

07:00.160 --> 07:05.440
so that was what I would call a sigh event but then something more significant happened

07:06.720 --> 07:13.520
while there I had a dream one night and it was a dream that foretold the future so accurately

07:13.520 --> 07:19.840
that it saved my life I dreamt I saw my death on the motorbike I won't go to the details of the

07:19.840 --> 07:26.080
dream but there were two sages to it one of which alerted me to the next scene in which I was knocked

07:26.080 --> 07:33.040
off sideways and and so I started driving a bit more sensibly and carefully but it was a month or

07:33.040 --> 07:38.160
so went by and nothing happened and of course I went back my old ways which were you know a little

07:38.160 --> 07:46.480
bit getting out around the cars and enjoy what you're doing and so on but a situation arose then

07:46.480 --> 07:52.160
where something really strange started to happen and I thought this is it and at that moment I was

07:52.160 --> 07:56.720
about to do something I'll come back and tell a bit more about this later I chose to do the exact

07:56.720 --> 08:00.880
opposite of my natural thing which would have been to accelerate and overtake three cars at the same

08:00.880 --> 08:07.040
time and instead I jammed on the brakes pulled back behind the last car and something remarkable

08:07.040 --> 08:13.680
happened the car at the front the first one did a most unusual maneuver spun 180 degrees in the

08:13.680 --> 08:18.960
middle of the road and zoomed off in the opposite direction and it undoubtedly would have knocked

08:18.960 --> 08:27.040
me off and killed me so I was alerted to a situation by that dream and as far as I'm concerned

08:27.040 --> 08:32.960
because I you know I am sort of a scientist in my way of approaching things that was a dream that

08:32.960 --> 08:40.560
broke the traditional scientific laws of time the science is based in the view of the arrow of time

08:40.560 --> 08:48.160
from past to the future causal effects causal chains and this was something that broke that

08:48.160 --> 08:55.120
causal chain so to be honest every day that I live I'm this this event is still as fresh in my mind

08:55.120 --> 09:01.760
as ever I'm alive because of an event that broke these the rules of space and time and that set

09:01.760 --> 09:07.680
me off on a search saying science is definitely delving into something but it's not the whole

09:07.680 --> 09:17.760
story there's a lot more that we need to explore so I I was a part of neuroscience studies studying

09:18.640 --> 09:24.880
the cats sort of visual cortex and taking part in experiments with you know single nerve

09:26.240 --> 09:31.280
microelectrope recordings and so on so I'm quite used to the idea of the brain working with patterns

09:31.280 --> 09:38.800
of activity but the problem was that I felt sorry for the cat I'm not I just said I wasn't

09:38.800 --> 09:44.720
really a lab researcher and eventually left a PhD and go back into medical studies again

09:45.360 --> 09:52.720
because I wanted to be a researcher in life and I was keen on immunology and the immune

09:53.440 --> 10:00.160
diseases and so on and realized that both neuroscience and immunology they're both

10:00.160 --> 10:06.560
pattern recognizing systems that we as an organism are detecting patterns with distant

10:06.560 --> 10:11.840
senses in the neuroscience and the immunologies with chemical patterns with recognizing what's

10:11.840 --> 10:18.480
self and what's other and that is all part of our identity as a person it's at a physical level

10:18.480 --> 10:25.360
and at a social and wider environmental level but in all of that that I was studying I knew

10:25.360 --> 10:29.440
something was missing from science and it was to do with relatedness to do with relationship

10:30.080 --> 10:34.480
I was looking at communication patterns between cell populations and health and disease

10:35.520 --> 10:39.200
but decided to leave in the end to go into medicine but I had I took a particular interest

10:39.200 --> 10:44.720
in family medicine and systemic work because the patterns of communication amongst people

10:45.440 --> 10:52.080
I found were reflected in the patterns that the brain was detecting in the environment and

10:52.240 --> 10:56.480
understanding how the immune system worked on pattern recognition and responsiveness

10:56.480 --> 11:00.560
the same thing was going on in families and in communities neighborhoods workplaces

11:01.680 --> 11:06.720
so I was forming this idea of identical principles of organization principles of

11:06.720 --> 11:11.200
organization that's a core thing that I'm going to be talking with you about because

11:11.200 --> 11:17.200
it's about this area that I believe I'll be able to give an explanation of these two side events

11:17.200 --> 11:23.520
that broke the rules of space and time getting into the level of communication patterns and

11:23.520 --> 11:30.240
relational patterns now I also put the picture here of shredding his cat and what I just like

11:30.240 --> 11:36.000
to say is that this thought experiment about the quantum level of life I believe is completely

11:36.000 --> 11:41.280
fallacious the reason is that it's not the cat or any of the things here it's in a box

11:42.160 --> 11:48.000
and the thought experiment relies on that box being screened off until somebody opens the

11:48.000 --> 11:54.240
lid and looks at it and then that is the input of energy into this closed system that determines

11:54.240 --> 12:04.800
what happens the problem is that science has recently shown that the universe is not a closed

12:04.800 --> 12:10.000
system which is the picture that what I call enlightenment science for the last 300 years

12:10.000 --> 12:15.440
has all been based on the idea that the universe is a closed system bounded by space and time

12:16.080 --> 12:19.920
and the matter moves with momentum and bounces around inside this box

12:20.560 --> 12:27.280
and so on but in 2011 three physicists and primitive Schmidt and Rice got the Nobel prize

12:27.280 --> 12:34.480
for physics for proving that the universe is not only still expanding but the rate of expansion

12:34.480 --> 12:40.480
is accelerating right so we are part of a universe that is expanding at an ever increasing rate

12:41.120 --> 12:47.440
but that means the universe of which we belong is an open system it has to be an open system

12:48.160 --> 12:53.680
and I'm sorry to disappoint people but all the rules of thermodynamics to do with entropy and

12:53.680 --> 13:00.800
energy preservation and so on are all framed within the concepts of closed systems they do

13:00.800 --> 13:07.360
apply in closed systems but at a universal scale in which we human beings are embedded

13:08.000 --> 13:12.880
it's an open system and those rules may not apply and that's what I'm going to be saying to

13:12.880 --> 13:19.920
they actually do not apply at the level of the human heart Karen Barad of course has done a lot of

13:21.120 --> 13:28.880
work on the concept of intraaction we human beings are interactive in this universal scale

13:29.440 --> 13:36.080
also in local systems and it's up to us by our choice of action whether we create closed systems

13:36.640 --> 13:41.280
and believe in them or whether we live as if we are part of an open system

13:43.600 --> 13:47.520
so I came up with this thing there's a lot of neuroscientists are keen on the idea that the

13:47.520 --> 13:53.360
brain is actually a social brain it isn't there just to give us a sense of who we are and for us

13:53.360 --> 13:59.120
to generate feelings internally it's not an individualistic thing the brain is there to map

13:59.120 --> 14:04.240
our relatedness and to map our relationships and I found from my developing interest in

14:04.880 --> 14:11.280
Christian in Celtic Christianity because it's very earth it's very rooted in the community in the

14:11.280 --> 14:20.320
community in hospitality in the rhythms of nature to me that this is where the life of things are

14:20.320 --> 14:27.440
generated and the Celts had already had this image called a triquetra three corners a state that is

14:27.440 --> 14:34.080
three points but not a triangle or triquetra three corners and it's an icon of never-ending

14:34.080 --> 14:40.240
movement of continuous dynamic if you follow the lines along you know it just goes round and round

14:40.240 --> 14:45.840
and when you fit two together you just the relatedness goes backwards and forwards between them

14:46.640 --> 14:52.960
and this is eternal movement and this is how I'm going to be displaying what I believe

14:52.960 --> 15:01.760
is David Bohm's concept of hollow movement now these two icons of movement the triquetra

15:01.760 --> 15:07.360
are icons that can be scaled to lots of different levels it's a prince the principles of organization

15:07.360 --> 15:14.720
of movement movement is the changing relatedness of forms changing relatedness of forms

15:15.520 --> 15:21.440
so this could represent two adults talking together a conversation it could be in Celtic

15:21.440 --> 15:27.600
Christianity god and humanity in a conversation it could be a mother and child but also I'm going

15:27.600 --> 15:33.440
to be putting to you that this could be an icon that represents quantal change this could be the

15:33.440 --> 15:38.560
gardener in the earth that you know you can have a relationship with your garden to cultivate and

15:38.560 --> 15:44.640
bring forth fruitfulness from the land and the idea of having two of the self-organizing

15:45.360 --> 15:51.520
elements that meet together into a conversational relationship is that one becomes an ecology

15:51.520 --> 15:57.840
for the other this is an ecological picture of the human being an ecological picture in which

15:57.840 --> 16:04.160
the environment scale from the quantal to the universal and to the social and the inner world

16:04.640 --> 16:09.760
and in this I'm going to introduce the word information and the core thing in this is because

16:09.760 --> 16:16.880
I'm proposing that everything is in movement information is a verb it's not a noun it is

16:16.880 --> 16:25.600
the forming and following this along the change that's going on in this in this person here

16:26.880 --> 16:32.560
is transferred relatedness over to here to it transforms the other person and this is

16:33.520 --> 16:41.200
information it's a dynamic it's not a noun and this is and what I'm proposing is that

16:41.200 --> 16:50.640
this type of iconic relationship or relatedness is synergy this is a vibration one movement

16:50.640 --> 16:58.400
happening here induces movement here and that workflows back and here we have synergic movement

16:58.400 --> 17:02.080
backwards and forwards this is an image an icon of relatedness

17:04.320 --> 17:10.320
so there's mutual repatterning which is synergy now this is actually the core slide the talk and

17:10.320 --> 17:16.560
I'm going to come back to this slide right at the end of it just to to pull it all together at the end

17:17.520 --> 17:27.760
and now in that a mutuality of repatterning there is bi-directional informational flow

17:28.720 --> 17:36.800
and a lot of science is based in a linear concept of energy transfer or information transfer from a

17:36.800 --> 17:41.840
transmitter to a receiver we're coming back to that a little bit later

17:41.840 --> 17:50.000
but in systemic family therapy the the network of relationships and the communications that go

17:50.000 --> 17:56.960
back and forth a group of people form a state of action going on within the family and that state

17:56.960 --> 18:02.400
can either bring on helpful behavior or it can become chaotic or turbulent that's where the

18:02.400 --> 18:08.400
social brain is connecting with it and the core principles of organization I believe are shaping

18:08.400 --> 18:13.120
what goes on in the brain to engage with this conversational reality and that is what's called

18:13.120 --> 18:19.200
the explicate order this is the the level we live in in our social setting setting environments

18:19.200 --> 18:25.840
and that picture on the right of the lady looking at that artwork on a piece of on a UK postbox it

18:25.840 --> 18:31.840
just shows the explicate order can get into a bit of a knot and get all tied up when when things get

18:31.840 --> 18:37.360
a bit stressed but underneath that David Bowman is saying that there is an implicate order of

18:37.360 --> 18:46.080
wholeness a hollow movement and I believe that the inner human heart connects into that at an

18:46.080 --> 18:51.920
informational level where one is transforming the other through this synergistic connection

18:51.920 --> 18:58.400
and that this synergistic connection lies behind what we describe as energy matter in the explicate

18:58.400 --> 19:06.960
order right so movement emerges from the implicate order out into an explicate order where our

19:06.960 --> 19:15.280
brains organize it into a concept so when I was studying neuroscience this is absolutely basic

19:15.280 --> 19:21.520
neuroscience you know well established that there are what are called sensory association

19:21.520 --> 19:29.680
areas in the brain where particularly the distance senses are all brought together to to to construct

19:29.680 --> 19:34.880
certain impressions I'm not going to go into this in any detail at the moment but I just want to say

19:34.880 --> 19:40.640
that it is well known that this parietal cortex area here generates a concept of space

19:41.280 --> 19:45.680
and if there are lesions or illnesses that affect this area it'll be affecting our spatial awareness

19:47.040 --> 19:52.800
this area of the frontal lobe underneath and in the middle is involved in sensing time

19:54.080 --> 19:58.480
and this is the one that I really want to draw your attention to this temporal lobe sensory

19:59.200 --> 20:06.160
association area living together you know your visual balance auditory touch sensations body

20:06.160 --> 20:12.480
or a body images on all integrate here they pull together memories as well and so we get meaningful

20:12.480 --> 20:18.480
association with our ongoing sensory experience is generated in these three different areas

20:19.520 --> 20:22.720
now the point about the temporal lobe one is this is where there are some

20:23.520 --> 20:28.800
unusual effects that come from epilepsy affecting this area or any other illnesses

20:29.440 --> 20:34.000
and they can make life seem unreal what is what's going on here is something called

20:34.000 --> 20:40.480
object recognition which is easiest described by for example talking about a bicycle the bicycle

20:40.480 --> 20:45.360
looked at from different angles looks totally different and yet we somehow develop an idea

20:45.360 --> 20:49.520
that this is a bicycle there's something solid there called a bike and it looks like this from

20:49.520 --> 20:54.560
different angles right and that is what's being pulled together in this area of the brain

20:55.600 --> 21:02.400
so it gives a sense of real present object recognition now when I started to apply the

21:02.400 --> 21:12.000
triquetral image of what's happening here these change and form and relatedness are features of

21:12.000 --> 21:21.520
our sensory input which are coming into this dynamic where the brain is constructing an organized

21:22.400 --> 21:28.560
sense of the world out of chaotic neural experience of sensors coming in from all angles

21:28.560 --> 21:34.880
and memories coming in together and it's happening here and these three areas these three points

21:35.840 --> 21:45.040
coordinate by pairing their inputs in these different areas so if we if we were just to

21:45.040 --> 21:51.840
look a little bit more at forms you know shapes of things and the relationship of forms if those

21:51.840 --> 21:59.360
two things come together it creates a sense of space and if forms are changing a pendulum

21:59.440 --> 22:07.120
swinging gives you a sense that there is time on the move and this is the one that I want to

22:07.120 --> 22:11.520
draw your attention if this theory is true and this is a hypothesis I'm putting it to you as a

22:11.520 --> 22:19.040
hypothesis that could be tested then if these three sensory inputs can be integrated in these

22:19.040 --> 22:26.240
sensory association areas to generate a sense of space and of time and of real presence then the

22:26.240 --> 22:31.760
other pairing is that the change of relatedness and what I mean by that is let's imagine you're

22:31.760 --> 22:35.520
walking along suddenly you bang your hand against the edge of the table you haven't particularly

22:35.520 --> 22:41.200
noticed right you will think there's a solid table there right but actually what's happened is that

22:41.200 --> 22:46.960
your hand has had a change of relatedness and that that had got converted through your object

22:46.960 --> 22:51.600
recognition temple sensory association area into the center there's a solid optic there

22:52.320 --> 22:57.920
if you if somebody walks into a room if there's a change of relatedness you might get the sense

22:57.920 --> 23:04.960
that there's a real presence of someone in the room so out of changes of relatedness we develop

23:04.960 --> 23:11.840
a concept of substance there's a substantial person come in if someone says feel the quality

23:11.840 --> 23:15.680
of this cloth you don't just put a fingertip against it and say you're feeling the quality

23:16.400 --> 23:22.480
you move your hand over it and you get a pat changing array of sensory input that

23:22.480 --> 23:26.880
you associate with your memories and gives you a sense of the substance of this material

23:26.880 --> 23:33.280
that you're touching so this is object recognition any sense of objects that we have around us is

23:33.280 --> 23:40.080
actually constructed from a whole history memorized of our changing relatedness with

23:40.080 --> 23:44.800
our environment from the time when we were babies gumming things that we put in our mouths

23:46.240 --> 23:50.960
right the way through we're accumulating a sense of textures and qualities that we

23:50.960 --> 23:55.600
change our relatedness with and we shape this idea that things are real objects so this is a

23:55.600 --> 24:02.640
fairly complicated idea but I just want to put it to you as a theory I'm put this icon up here

24:02.640 --> 24:11.680
the core icon just to emphasize that this process going on in the brain is part of the social brain

24:12.240 --> 24:17.520
all of these three are inputs from our environment that the brain is organizing

24:17.520 --> 24:24.320
in order to make a response and these three are project forward to the motor areas here

24:24.960 --> 24:30.400
that's what's going on in this central space and it's in the motor areas where we prepare our

24:30.400 --> 24:39.280
responses that these three sense of spacetime and objects of substance and become properly

24:39.360 --> 24:45.840
integrated into a sense of me myself in this environment so I spent a bit of time explaining

24:45.840 --> 24:52.480
that but you know this is a core to it so this is just sort of restating what I said David

24:52.480 --> 24:59.440
Bohm's implicate order of movement is the changing relatedness of patterned forms the changing

24:59.440 --> 25:08.800
relatedness of patterned forms and that sense of space and time and of substantial reality

25:08.800 --> 25:18.320
around us is what we mean by the explicate order that is it we have what I call an orientation

25:18.320 --> 25:24.480
horizon a lot of our experience are placed in this sense of orientation in space and time and

25:24.480 --> 25:29.840
substance but if you think about it there's an awful lot of our experience which is below

25:29.840 --> 25:35.920
the orientation horizon which is not orientated and the simplest most obvious one to say is the

25:35.920 --> 25:43.120
sense of smell that activates you that alerts you but it actually alerts you to search with your

25:43.120 --> 25:49.520
distant senses for what the source of that smell is yeah so the sense of smell is not actually

25:50.240 --> 25:57.440
orientated right but it it drives us to seek orientation to bring in this explicate order

25:57.440 --> 26:02.800
to a set of experiences that are below that orientation horizon and this is what I'd like

26:02.800 --> 26:09.760
to be proposing to you that this is what I mean by the inner human heart it's a whole range of

26:09.760 --> 26:16.400
awareness and sensitivities that is below the orientation horizon and a lot of it is to do

26:16.400 --> 26:22.720
with emotion with emotion a lot of it the emotion comes from our values and how we interact with

26:22.720 --> 26:30.960
the world around our values emotion is energy in motion and emotion is values in from energy

26:31.680 --> 26:37.040
entering our awareness this is where I'm proposing to you that our inner human hearts

26:37.760 --> 26:45.520
are actually connected into an implicate order way beyond what we are aware of in our

26:45.520 --> 26:50.880
conscious minds as being above the orientation horizon as an explicate order

26:54.400 --> 26:59.600
now these informational movements that are shown in the double tri-creature can scale up

27:00.320 --> 27:08.240
and I'm not going to spend too long on this but when they connect together what was the

27:08.240 --> 27:14.560
synergic vibration just between two of them can start to become a progressive wave of movement

27:14.560 --> 27:20.960
through networks of movement changes remember all of these tri-creature are not solid objects

27:20.960 --> 27:27.680
they are icons of movement the changing relatedness of patterned forms and here we're beginning to see

27:27.680 --> 27:37.920
patterned forms whoops you know that was um good on but um so the I'll just take um take that back

27:37.920 --> 27:43.440
oh sorry and here we go this is going to be a bit unusual now anyway so just sorry about the

27:43.440 --> 27:50.240
interaction there but the point I wanted to make from that previous slide is that um the

27:50.240 --> 27:56.080
synergic movement can translate into progressive movements through that implicate order which

27:56.080 --> 28:03.040
we'll come back to in a moment but this is what science measures science is measuring the movements

28:03.040 --> 28:08.160
through the linear movements through what I'm going to be describing is what I believe is the

28:08.160 --> 28:13.440
implicate order and describing it in terms of these networks of tri-creature tri-creature movement

28:14.240 --> 28:22.080
now this this lovely sculpture here is just um a beautiful picture um of the types of conversational

28:22.080 --> 28:30.080
orientation uh that I'd like to sort of capture for you um the the the iconic representations

28:30.080 --> 28:34.960
can be true in networks of people or at the level in the implicate order even of quantum

28:34.960 --> 28:42.640
gravity it's the same principles of movement that are on the go now in quantum theory there's

28:42.640 --> 28:49.120
something called um you know quantum field quantum field theory which is running to problems because

28:49.120 --> 28:56.400
it's based on particles and it says that around particles there's a quantum field of energetic

28:56.400 --> 29:02.800
activity and it's it's running to one or two problems and I want to mention at this stage

29:02.800 --> 29:11.520
because what I'm proposing about tri-creature um implicate order is that it's actually much more

29:11.520 --> 29:16.640
pervasive than related to the particles the particles emerge out of it and I'm also going

29:16.640 --> 29:23.680
to be proposing that waves in fact emerge out of this implicate order so the idea of quantum fields

29:23.680 --> 29:31.360
around particles is approaching it in the wrong direction now I believe that looking at this level

29:31.360 --> 29:38.960
of uh an extensive implicate order out of which emerge particles and waves and eventually emerge

29:38.960 --> 29:44.880
all of the dynamics that we call explicit order which our brains have evolved to detect to engage

29:44.880 --> 29:52.000
with to construct an impression of this world so that we can talk to each other sensibly and cooperate

29:52.000 --> 29:58.080
to to to manage life and manage our environments together and all of that going on over incredibly

29:58.160 --> 30:05.200
long time frames and so on but I believe that this implicate order relatedness can provide a

30:05.200 --> 30:11.040
cosmological explanation for the disappearing poem and for the dream that broke linear time

30:11.920 --> 30:16.960
and that's where we're going to be going with all of this and I'd like to be proposing that the

30:16.960 --> 30:22.560
concept of infamy energy in this implicate order that the movements that are set up through it

30:22.560 --> 30:27.600
there are harmonics that are running through it I believe the vibrations extend into uh sort of a

30:27.600 --> 30:36.640
harmonic um hole um and but it gets diversity is inherent to the way these tri-creature connect

30:36.640 --> 30:41.920
together we'll be looking at that a little bit more um and because there is diversity within

30:41.920 --> 30:48.080
this implicate order there is information one part informs the other of the movements that are going

30:48.080 --> 30:55.600
on within this implicate order and that emerges into our experience of life we're connected into it

30:55.600 --> 31:02.960
but we try to make sense of it in our explicate order but our brains unfortunately have a weak spot

31:02.960 --> 31:08.960
and that what is relatedness at the level of the implicate order and change of relatedness

31:09.600 --> 31:17.680
in unusual patterns there our brains convert into the idea of solid objects so of course

31:17.680 --> 31:22.640
my motorbike existed of course the car existed of course the poem existed it was a solid object

31:22.640 --> 31:28.960
wasn't it but actually what might be happening in the implicate order at that level is that there

31:28.960 --> 31:35.360
were much more pervasive dynamics on move which we could not be aware of because we were insensitive

31:35.360 --> 31:40.960
to them and that's the relationship between the implicates and the explicate uh that we is part of

31:40.960 --> 31:47.760
life so the ecological systemic view of the social person is in the explicate order and an

31:47.840 --> 31:54.960
informational view of energy and matter is in the implicate order now just coming back to this

31:54.960 --> 32:01.120
sculpture of the three women um this is a conversation about the three people can you see the expressions

32:01.120 --> 32:06.400
on their faces they each have different angles on this conversation one blade is pouring out

32:06.400 --> 32:11.040
a heart about the story the one on the right is taking it all in and just absorb with it

32:11.040 --> 32:14.720
I don't know about you but the one in the middle looks to me just a little bit skeptical saying

32:14.720 --> 32:20.000
yeah maybe so maybe so you know but it's a little bit sitting back and you know so they've got three

32:20.000 --> 32:25.360
different minds that are forming different concepts of one dynamic that's going on between them

32:25.920 --> 32:29.120
what I'd like to point out to you I don't know whether you've noticed it yourself

32:29.120 --> 32:36.640
but have a look at their bodies and their legs they're touching a lot of contact going on between

32:36.640 --> 32:42.880
them there's a lot of very subtle communication going on between them at a different level to

32:42.880 --> 32:49.920
what's going on in their minds yeah that is a picture to me of the implicate order out of which

32:49.920 --> 32:55.920
emerges our own individual perceptions of the explicate order we then converse to try and

32:55.920 --> 33:00.880
team up and make sense and see it from your angle and see it from mine and we very quickly forget

33:00.880 --> 33:07.360
they were all part of something bigger and we're all connected already in it so this is a picture

33:07.520 --> 33:13.680
three analytical perspectives that people can construct on a single dynamic amongst them all

33:15.120 --> 33:20.880
and that these analytic perspectives like the one in the middle can make somebody take a mental

33:20.880 --> 33:27.200
step back from involvement in the conversation just to try and analyze hey what's going on here

33:27.200 --> 33:31.760
if you do I really believe this you know rather than being absorbed in it as the two ladies on

33:31.760 --> 33:37.120
the outside are absorbed in the exchange of information between them so to me this is a

33:37.120 --> 33:47.600
lovely picture of conversations now I'm going to say just a little bit more about the the actual

33:47.600 --> 33:53.600
event of the dream so I mentioned before that there was pulling up some traffic lights I didn't

33:53.600 --> 33:58.000
say that but three cars were stopped and the traffic lights were red but then as I approached

33:58.080 --> 34:02.400
from behind they changed the red amber which in England means hey get ready we're going to be

34:02.400 --> 34:08.560
going soon and on a motorbike that's an absolute gift you just you know accelerate away overtake

34:08.560 --> 34:13.200
all three cars at the same time and zoom on ahead of the lot saying hey this is you know great life

34:13.200 --> 34:19.520
and so but actually alerted by the dream I was just about to start accelerating and I know I stood

34:19.520 --> 34:26.560
on that brake and pulled back behind the last car and then that front car did a spin in the road

34:27.280 --> 34:31.920
roared off in the opposite direction and what I didn't say before is that the car had black

34:31.920 --> 34:38.080
tinted windows it was covered in dust it just looked nasty it wasn't a standard make of car it

34:38.080 --> 34:45.600
had been worked on it looked dangerous and it looked evil there was intentional movement about it

34:45.600 --> 34:53.680
that's the key term there was intentional movement and it was evil now that's what I've reflected on

34:53.680 --> 35:00.560
for years and years and years and this I would like to say is very significant in why I moved from

35:00.560 --> 35:07.120
exploring wider spiritualities to feeling really comfortable with a Celtic approach to

35:07.120 --> 35:12.320
Christianity not to the other formalized religions which I believe have pushed things off to an extreme

35:13.520 --> 35:20.560
but this earthed area of hospitality of community of relatedness now that's where the true spirituality

35:20.560 --> 35:28.720
lies but the point about that encounter on the road right was that there were two personalities there

35:31.680 --> 35:42.960
and the movements the action that happened arose out of our personal values my value was to take

35:42.960 --> 35:48.160
note of that dream my value was to enhance life my values to explore what was going on

35:48.880 --> 35:54.720
I don't know exactly what the values were the driver of that car had but they were not life

35:54.720 --> 35:59.680
enhancing there was there was it was something that I would say is an attitude of deafness

35:59.680 --> 36:04.800
about it and I think this is what convinced me that when we're looking at the implicate order

36:05.360 --> 36:11.840
and relatedness that goes beyond space and time as our explicate order brains construct

36:12.400 --> 36:18.800
and can emerge as a dream one month in advance of that that alerts me in two stages of the dream

36:19.360 --> 36:25.120
to the fact that something dangerous is going to happen in that implicate order

36:25.920 --> 36:32.480
there are human values there the human values are embedded and this is the point I really want to be

36:32.480 --> 36:38.720
making to you that I'm not convinced that the best way of thinking about this implicate order

36:38.720 --> 36:45.840
is to try and call it consciousness or order the I think once we understand that human values

36:45.840 --> 36:51.600
are based in our hearts and move direct our movements direct our thoughts direct the quality

36:51.600 --> 36:57.040
of our relationships and our reactions to each other we're beginning to get ourselves

36:57.040 --> 37:03.040
earthed in the implicate order not the explicate order that's pre-orientation

37:03.600 --> 37:11.280
and our hearts a month before that were somehow discerning something that there's a direction

37:11.280 --> 37:17.760
that my life was going in and this event could have ruined it and whoever was driving that car

37:17.760 --> 37:27.680
was sensitive to the opposite move so I have to say that this this sense of personal value

37:27.680 --> 37:33.840
in the implicate order brings a life for me the conversational nature of reality

37:34.800 --> 37:41.920
and we can we hide it we lose it because of the way our brains orientate us in an explicate order

37:41.920 --> 37:52.320
of matter and substance so hollow movement is the emerging as systemic personal identity

37:52.800 --> 37:59.120
with it now I just to say I'm very fortunate that John Hunt publishers have recently agreed to

37:59.680 --> 38:06.240
publish a book on this subject so what I'm going to be going into explain how I believe space and

38:06.240 --> 38:13.360
time can be conceived in a new way coming out of this implicate order is much explained in much

38:13.360 --> 38:19.600
more detail in this book the title is clearing away unveiling the mental tricks that hide reality

38:20.480 --> 38:24.800
now I'm going to be giving you a very quick overview of what's in that book but really there

38:24.800 --> 38:29.920
would be too much information here for you to try and take it in and really work on it so I'm

38:29.920 --> 38:34.800
going to ask you just to sit back and take it a little bit like going to the cinema where you're

38:34.800 --> 38:39.920
just sort of watching the story unfold and then maybe at the end of it you try and tie it all

38:39.920 --> 38:46.880
together and be critical do I mean this is this is as I say it's hypothesis it's exploring what

38:46.880 --> 38:52.080
could be now I've got a colour coding in the next set of slides that are coming up the black

38:52.080 --> 38:57.840
headings are when I'm talking about tri-critical cosmology itself into the diversifying unity of

38:57.840 --> 39:06.160
life that we're part of that dynamic the red headings are about the concept of time and there

39:06.160 --> 39:11.040
are three perspectives like those three women three perspectives can be struck constructed on

39:11.040 --> 39:17.120
timing the on time that construct an idea of timing the blue headings go into the idea of

39:17.120 --> 39:22.400
space and substance as tri-critical hollow movement so that's the structure of what's coming up

39:23.040 --> 39:30.880
and it's all about synergy as conversational orientation when we enter into this communications

39:30.880 --> 39:38.960
feedback at whatever level we want to consider things synergic life starts to move within us

39:41.200 --> 39:46.800
so there is too much for you to take on board here so I really ask you not to try and take it on too

39:46.800 --> 39:54.400
much but the point is that here I've shown the standard tri-critra of you know of what's how the

39:54.400 --> 40:03.360
brain gets organised and here it is in this analytical direction when somebody takes a mental

40:03.360 --> 40:09.680
step back from the conversation to think about the forms and objects something strange happens

40:09.760 --> 40:14.720
inside the brain the way things are orientated and I go into this in much greater detail in

40:14.720 --> 40:18.000
the book to explain how it all happens in neurological terms as well for those who are

40:18.000 --> 40:26.560
interested but space and time become projected out of the observer identity people become an

40:26.560 --> 40:32.400
observer of life when they look at the forms and objects and the forms and objects take out with

40:32.400 --> 40:39.520
them the space and time leaving inside this sense of personal identity my thought experience

40:40.880 --> 40:49.120
and so an observer of life considers themselves to be a presence of mind I am a presence of mind

40:49.120 --> 40:58.320
observing reality and I retain within me how I change my relatedness to that external reality

40:58.400 --> 41:05.360
which is the origin of the empirical frame of mind the scientific empiricism I can act on this

41:05.360 --> 41:10.960
objective world in any way I choose to without any sense of moral obligation as being part of it

41:10.960 --> 41:17.520
because I'm acting on it now part of what comes with this is that the time frame here is an arrow

41:17.520 --> 41:25.520
of time as I previously said a linear cause effect sequence of causality things move from

41:25.520 --> 41:31.680
the past to the future in the arrow of time and so eternity in this view seems like an endless

41:31.680 --> 41:36.160
string of pictures like an old cinema reel and the present moment is one of these pictures in the

41:36.160 --> 41:44.880
middle and it's slowly moving along this line and spatial dimensions become the real context for life

41:44.880 --> 41:52.320
not a product of life so this is turned inside out what is really the conversational experience

41:52.320 --> 41:59.840
that the movement of relatedness generates space and time and a sense of reality but when you take

41:59.840 --> 42:06.560
an analytical step back from the conversation it looks as if I'm in a boat

42:10.160 --> 42:13.200
are you hearing what I'm hearing it's a very pleasant music in the background

42:13.920 --> 42:21.440
um so um so so that's the one particular analytical perspective and have worked

42:21.440 --> 42:26.960
linear time time sequence becomes formed this is what I call the structuralist perspective

42:27.520 --> 42:34.000
when pushed to an extreme it's the materialist perspective this becomes material but it doesn't

42:34.000 --> 42:40.080
have to be pushed to that extreme but the structuralist perspective will tend to say that the dimensions

42:40.080 --> 42:47.840
of space and time are part of the objective reality now if you take a mental step back to

42:47.840 --> 42:53.120
look at the conversation looking at the changes that are going on there the changes can be

42:53.120 --> 42:59.200
projected out is to my perceived reality and that becomes like a whole chaos of processes

42:59.200 --> 43:03.760
and living souls are making different choices and I really don't know what's going on but in

43:04.320 --> 43:09.440
here the human identity the personal identity becomes my own space my personal bubble in my

43:09.440 --> 43:15.600
personal space I create information that I can push out into this chaos to bring order

43:16.400 --> 43:23.040
and this what I'm calling an informationist view of life and in the last 50 years with

43:23.040 --> 43:29.040
information technology this has become like the dominant way of looking at the world

43:29.040 --> 43:35.040
that information is more important than matter but it can be pushed to an extreme where the

43:35.120 --> 43:41.200
information is given an objectivity which it doesn't belong the information if you see it as a

43:41.200 --> 43:48.000
verb is a dynamic that's going on between two things so people in this view believe they have

43:48.000 --> 43:55.280
to construct information as a noun that they transmit into the chaos to all to the movement

43:55.280 --> 44:02.080
that's going on there now in this one time seems like a time frame it's the story what's the

44:02.080 --> 44:06.800
you could go have a beginning and a middle and an end and I put stuff in that changes the story

44:06.800 --> 44:15.600
or makes the story and so that's a totally different way but it is still measurable just like

44:15.600 --> 44:22.240
linear time is measurable but these are actually different features in terms of the way the brain

44:22.240 --> 44:28.400
can construct a sense of time not spending too long on this now but the third view if one takes

44:28.400 --> 44:33.200
a mental step back from a conversation to start looking at the qualities of relatedness that are

44:33.200 --> 44:41.040
going on in this conversation something totally different happens in the brain and if relatedness

44:41.040 --> 44:48.480
in an extreme can get pushed out to become an objective reality itself as a life force a vitalist

44:48.480 --> 44:56.240
force a spirit a town and that the common thing about all concepts of life forces from any

44:56.240 --> 45:03.520
culture around the world is that they all course through space and they are like a higher power

45:03.520 --> 45:09.680
they are in a presence of a higher power to which individual people feel they must submit

45:09.680 --> 45:17.040
in order to come into a harmony with it for their health and their longevity or or whatever now

45:17.040 --> 45:23.120
what I want to say here is that what is retained in the sense of personal identity looking on this

45:23.840 --> 45:29.840
is that I become a participator in a life that is beyond me yeah and there's a lot in this this is

45:29.840 --> 45:36.800
a vitally important analytical perspective and I need to say very clearly at this point by identifying

45:36.800 --> 45:43.280
these three perspectives I'm not saying any of them is right or wrong they are all equally

45:43.280 --> 45:50.480
justifiable in logical terms but the difficulty is if they get pushed to an extreme extreme

45:50.480 --> 45:55.680
there are logical deductions that don't compare are not compatible with each other and the one

45:55.680 --> 46:03.520
here is that because the personal identity has changed of form retained as part of its identity

46:04.880 --> 46:12.480
this is this concept of my own time and I can return to eternity and come back again in a changed

46:12.480 --> 46:20.320
form and this is logically consistent with this particular view on life this perspective on life

46:21.120 --> 46:27.200
so reincarnation is logical in this perspective but in the materialist perspective it's totally

46:27.200 --> 46:34.240
illogical and in the individualist perspective the informationist it's an interesting idea but

46:34.240 --> 46:39.600
it's neither here nor there whether whether it happens or not so these perspectives give very

46:39.600 --> 46:45.440
different pictures of what's going on in life and I'm going to say this again in any one of

46:45.440 --> 46:51.600
these analytical perspectives you can get a view into the whole of life and see the whole of life

46:51.600 --> 46:57.840
in that perspective and make sense of it as far as it'll go but as soon as you try to integrate it

46:57.840 --> 47:02.480
with the way that it looks from another perspective you're going into problems and people then

47:02.480 --> 47:08.080
sadly end up criticizing each other and blaming each other and and running each other down saying

47:08.080 --> 47:14.800
you're wrong rather than you've got an interesting perspective can we compare those and see if we

47:14.800 --> 47:21.600
can match them to find common ground and that is what this tri-cletal model is all about it's about

47:21.600 --> 47:27.280
being able to recognize the different analytical perspectives but then to bring them together

47:27.280 --> 47:34.880
to explore how to integrate them into a way that we can delve into the implicate order of life

47:34.880 --> 47:41.280
to understand it better to really connect better into it so I want to emphasize I'm not saying that

47:41.280 --> 47:48.320
any one of these is wrong they're all equally justifiable but they each can only be right

47:48.320 --> 47:52.800
as far as they go they can't be the whole truth without trying to match metric with the other

47:52.800 --> 48:00.320
match it with the others and here we sit on the red heading and I just like to for a moment ask

48:00.320 --> 48:04.320
you to think back again to that incident with the driver in the car and myself on the motorbike

48:05.840 --> 48:12.160
just think about the dream and the event I just described three different approaches to time

48:12.160 --> 48:18.240
one is the eternal now throughout life and that we can move from eternity into the now

48:19.600 --> 48:26.320
and and get a very big picture of who I am in the whole picture the other is of time frames

48:27.040 --> 48:33.040
there's a story going on here how extensive is that time frame how extensive is the story

48:33.840 --> 48:37.920
and then there's time sequence was there a time sequence yes there certainly was

48:37.920 --> 48:44.880
there were time sequences going on through that story all three of them are relevant as we reflect

48:44.880 --> 48:52.240
on that unusual event so a triquet for relational balance can avoid dualisms because all those

48:52.240 --> 48:57.920
three perspectives construct a sort of dualism and avoiding dualisms can be found by reflecting

48:57.920 --> 49:05.040
in what I call a gap in time between the seconds of your mind we're now connecting with that poem

49:06.000 --> 49:09.680
between the seconds of the mind there is beauty such as always found

49:12.240 --> 49:18.880
it in the world it can be beautiful but also personal values can create chaos or turmoil

49:19.440 --> 49:26.960
that can actually create danger difficulty and the implicated order is basically a life enhancing

49:26.960 --> 49:33.760
order that generates life and can bring healing and restoration even when people's values

49:34.320 --> 49:36.240
cause destruction and brokenness

49:39.120 --> 49:43.920
so this is the last slide on time and timing so we talked about three different perspectives

49:44.480 --> 49:51.200
the timing of decisions some of you may know the zen art and arrow paradox that the art and the

49:51.200 --> 49:59.040
arrow are all one concept if you now think about the three analyses this is how we get into

49:59.040 --> 50:05.360
interaction the aiming of that why is somebody tensioning if they have a purpose in mind the

50:05.360 --> 50:12.560
tension is both in the person and in the bow the release of that arrow is a decision in linear time

50:12.560 --> 50:19.040
that the time is right there's a story about the whole context in which this action is being

50:19.040 --> 50:29.040
tensioned and aligned this is Karen Barad's interaction and in this tri-creatural concept

50:29.040 --> 50:35.440
of movement if you're in a what's called a positivist view that there are little bits of

50:35.440 --> 50:40.560
battle like atoms and so on that actually has their own reality that's the positive view of

50:40.560 --> 50:48.480
the world people talk about well what sets these things in movement and this movement of what these

50:48.480 --> 50:55.120
bits exist but what brings the movement but on a tri-creatural cosmology is turning that upside

50:55.120 --> 51:01.680
down and saying that what the things matter emerges out of movement it's emergent order

51:01.680 --> 51:06.800
from implicated order and this is process philosophy it's the emergence and dispersal

51:06.800 --> 51:12.800
of pattern forms among infamenity movement reshaping and releasing continuously as that

51:13.360 --> 51:17.920
archer and arrow is doing which means that when we start looking at quantum

51:19.520 --> 51:25.600
quantum physics or mechanics or whatever you want to call it we're not looking at quantum

51:25.600 --> 51:31.600
a quantum of energy as if energy is something that is pre-existent we're looking at quantum

51:31.600 --> 51:38.000
change a small package of change right which can scale up by further entanglements to create

51:38.000 --> 51:45.520
movement out of which particles and waves emerge and the whole explicated order eventually

51:45.520 --> 51:56.240
emerges in which we are intraactive so there's a few slides now looking at what is the concept of

51:56.240 --> 52:03.520
space and of substance into which this movement is in which we're in which we're part of the

52:03.520 --> 52:11.360
movement now the tri-creature actually has two forms the knot theory shows that it has a left

52:11.360 --> 52:16.800
spin in the right spin clockwise or anti-clockwise and here you can see the one here this line comes

52:16.800 --> 52:23.280
down in front of that one and here it comes down behind it this is knot theory and they have different

52:23.280 --> 52:30.800
dynamics they're each equal in terms of movement but there's a different structure to us so

52:34.000 --> 52:43.040
just moving on there when they pair up this is again the core icon is a double tri-creature

52:43.760 --> 52:50.160
this is where a single tri-creature actually gains existence a single quantum change has no

52:50.160 --> 52:58.160
existence on its own but when that change starts to communicate with another in a conversational

52:58.160 --> 53:04.640
reality it becomes a vibration one becomes an ecology for the other this is the core element

53:04.640 --> 53:11.120
of existence now when i started making 3d printed models of these i discovered the most remarkable

53:11.120 --> 53:20.800
thing that the left and the levone dextro l and d resonant quanta when they when diverse quanta

53:21.600 --> 53:28.960
quanta fit together the four ligands that remain on the outside of it lie in a horizontal two

53:28.960 --> 53:37.360
dimensional plane but if you get an ll and a dd so this this here is an l form that one is going

53:37.360 --> 53:44.000
behind that one and that one is an l form that one's going behind that one so this is ll and

53:44.000 --> 53:50.880
this one the ligand has to twist in order to allow bi-directional informational flow which means

53:50.880 --> 53:56.880
that the four ligands that come off from it orientate in different directions and here

53:57.520 --> 54:02.160
i'm going to make the bold claim we are seeing the origin of the three dimensions of space

54:02.800 --> 54:09.360
it is the movement of these entanglements that has to twist in order to preserve a harmonic

54:09.360 --> 54:16.080
vibration if that could not twist there would be no harmonic it would stop vibrating each

54:16.080 --> 54:22.400
triquid will change would separate and break up and disperse process philosophy but as it is

54:22.400 --> 54:29.600
when there is harmonic it becomes some this core of existence now in quantum computing

54:29.600 --> 54:35.760
they need three core states called plus minus and zero and i would without going into this i'd

54:35.760 --> 54:42.800
like to propose that these three core double tri-quitra are probably what these core quantum

54:42.800 --> 54:50.320
states are called qubits and qubits of information so i actually call them informational qubits to

54:50.320 --> 54:54.960
try and emphasize that its movement and not a substance and not an object in itself

54:55.600 --> 55:02.240
their synergic resonant movements vibrations at the plank length that really small length of

55:02.240 --> 55:08.320
quantum change now here we are not going to spend long on this but when these scale up

55:08.320 --> 55:14.080
further and entangle into long strings we end up with three different types of wave you can

55:14.080 --> 55:22.320
you see the side ligands from this all of these are blue i'm really have no time to explain this

55:22.320 --> 55:30.720
but the book will in greater detail all i can say is that these waves can develop a fourth dimension

55:31.680 --> 55:38.320
movement along the way backwards and forwards like a slinky going a long way and that fourth

55:38.320 --> 55:43.840
dimension movement can add time into the three dimensions of space and in fact there can be

55:43.840 --> 55:50.880
lots more spins and twists and curls and so on of these sort of things which add extra dimensions

55:50.880 --> 55:56.240
of movement and i would like to be proposing to you that the various dimensions of m theory and

55:56.240 --> 56:02.160
string theory are actually different types of movement at different scales scaling up

56:02.160 --> 56:08.000
in a spin foam of these waves that are connecting with each other i'm not going to go into the

56:08.000 --> 56:17.360
details here but when you get the ld diverse stable qubits they make a horizontal flat plane

56:17.360 --> 56:26.640
and it turns into a hexagon i've made models of these a flat hexagon and these waves of gravity

56:26.640 --> 56:33.120
and light and heat are running through this as a standing wave rather than progressing from it

56:33.120 --> 56:39.680
i'm going to have to move on but here this picture shows how you can get a progressive wave of any

56:39.680 --> 56:45.520
sort and stable domains can come off the edge of it and i'd like to propose to you that these

56:45.520 --> 56:50.640
stable domains as i call them are the seeds of particles we'll go on to the next slide to see

56:50.640 --> 56:56.480
that but a single stable domain can have several different waves coming off it and the waves can

56:56.480 --> 57:03.200
crisscross with each other making a spin foam and all of this is movement all of this is movement

57:03.920 --> 57:09.600
informational movement making a spin foam of the implicate order out of which one area becomes

57:09.600 --> 57:15.520
diverse from another so you get informational transfer between them but one area knows what's

57:15.520 --> 57:22.400
going on somewhere else in a synergic network informational quantum movement because of the

57:22.400 --> 57:29.920
utter interrelated interrelatedness of implicate order behind patterned matter that is in constant

57:29.920 --> 57:39.360
change it's the bidirectionality of movement now the single hexagon can extend into a high cone

57:40.000 --> 57:46.080
of stable domains all mixing together and the standing waves of heat and light and gravity

57:46.080 --> 57:53.600
can move through this this is the closest picture that i can get to of the implicate order but it

57:53.600 --> 57:58.320
gets more complex than this now imagine that this is a flat thing i've made a model of this

57:58.960 --> 58:04.640
but this extended stable domain there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't curl topologically

58:04.640 --> 58:10.640
in on itself in which case you can get these waves that might span internally

58:10.640 --> 58:16.560
within that topological pattern and those become the internal forces of a particle

58:16.560 --> 58:22.400
or whatever scale of particle you want to come to so those waves those three basic

58:22.400 --> 58:26.880
preqiful waves can either become progressive waves spanning the whole cosmos in terms of

58:26.880 --> 58:33.120
light waves and gravity or they can become the internal strong forces and weak forces that

58:33.120 --> 58:40.320
make particles and matter hold together but then also if these stable domain extended stable domains

58:40.320 --> 58:44.880
are curling around to make particles some of them will be very stable and some could be unstable

58:45.440 --> 58:49.760
and that is what i believe are particles are emerging out of this implicate order

58:49.760 --> 58:55.280
and scaling up into atoms scaling up into molecules scaling up into macromolecules

58:55.280 --> 59:00.160
which form into cell membranes and these components of cells which form the microtubules

59:00.160 --> 59:05.760
which help to move the amoeba to move through the environment and respond to its environment

59:05.760 --> 59:12.000
more widely which which help mitochondria bacteria to find a home inside cells and generate energy

59:12.560 --> 59:17.360
that all of this is going on in a cell which scales up into a higher order organism

59:17.360 --> 59:22.160
which tend to relate and they breed and create more and create families that communicate

59:22.160 --> 59:29.280
all around identical principles of movement movement is the changing relatedness of

59:29.280 --> 59:34.400
patterned forms at every level emergent from the implicate order

59:37.680 --> 59:42.560
now in current quantum theory i don't think there's any theory around that actually adequately

59:42.560 --> 59:47.920
explains how gravity and light can interact but this particular model shows that this is

59:47.920 --> 59:52.560
quite a complicated one to understand but i ran pipe cleaners through this this model of two

59:52.560 --> 59:59.280
waves interacting the orange one is a gravitational wave the green one is a light wave and both of

59:59.280 --> 01:00:07.600
them share a relatedness ligand now this looks as if one wave is passing through another but

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:15.840
that's the wrong picture of the implicate order the implicate order is a harmonic it's a spin

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:23.280
from network in which the there's or i would actually claim synchronicity between two ends

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:31.920
of a wave what becomes linear time is the movement of the fourth dimensional wave along these

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.160
tri-critical waves as i call them the tri-critical waves are forming a spin from network the implicate

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:45.120
order and through that implicate order can move linear waves and those are what science measures

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:53.040
science can compare one fourth dimension wave with another but it has no way of delving into

01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.320
the true nature of the implicate order we can only discern this by scaling our human experience of

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.560
being together in groups in conversations where there's informational transfer in a brain that

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:13.360
is designed to interpret it using these three principles that's what i'm proposing so this

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.640
is an informational model of movement in quantum gravity it's happening in every cell in every

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:25.280
cell membrane of your body including every nerve cell every synapse in your brain is moving according

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:32.080
to these principles the microtubules also move brain neurotransmitters to the synapse and release

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:39.520
them at the synapse it's the same chemistry that moves an amoeba and that is moving atoms and

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.760
molecules that are on movement everywhere above absolute zero is in movement so this universe

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:53.680
is a cosmos because it births life in its diverse ecologies and we belong in this concept of ecology

01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.080
with others we are not here on our own the the conversational nature of life is something that

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:09.680
we really need to to appreciate that when you look at an object you are seeing a brain construct

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.200
of changing relatedness a whole history of changing relatedness that we're interpreting as an object

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.720
so we can talk about it and manipulate it but actually it's evidence of the fact that we belong

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:27.440
in this cosmos we're in it we're interactive within it try to reach for quantum cosmology

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.680
the inner human heart is deeply synergic with life's movements and a much wider

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.840
concept than our explicate all the brains can take in the conscious mental experience of

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.840
orientation adds dimensional space and time right but we have a meaningful engagement

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.920
with relational life beyond space and time that's the input order in our inner hearts

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.600
in from energy is life moving in the background that we connect into and we try to make sense of

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.040
it like those three women in the conversation try to make sense of it from our different

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.920
perspectives but there is life on the go and and we we need the conversations to try and

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:16.480
really grasp what is actually going on now the final thing before I just close is that that

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.040
image that I gave you of the intricate order I haven't gone into this the book will go into

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.480
this in much greater detail so to properly explain it but imagine a group of people imagine that

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.280
those three women talking but imagine you're in a group of people having a conversation about

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.120
the day's events or planning where you want to go on holiday and so on and the exchanges that

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:46.960
are going on between you there's a whole raft of communications at an implicates a pre-orientation

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:52.000
level below the orientation horizons hold all those communications are going on passing

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
things back and forth about our values we then construct this impression or try to make sense

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.360
of what's going on now I'm not going to spend long on gravitational waves gravity holds together

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.480
at diverse places of the universe there's an enduring connection between every mass in the

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:18.880
universe now that to me is in the human experience could emerge as the equivalent of love love is

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:25.040
enduring connection between people an enduring ability to be responsive to each other even

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.760
though there might be fairly traumatic changes going on or fairly disturbing changes or maybe

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:37.120
anticipating very pleasant changes but that enduring sense of connection could be an equivalent

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.560
of gravitational attraction the warmth the thermodynamics of responsiveness the warmth

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.120
could be the equivalent of human kindness that as we respond to each other we're going with you know

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.680
as we're in this group together we maybe discern our differences but there can still be a warmth

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.800
of responsiveness of kindness that says well I can respond to you and you know keep this connection

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:07.280
worn alive but also the there is the sense of presence we can be present for each other or

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.600
you know when somebody's distracted and isn't really involved in the conversation you know it

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.360
and people sometimes take themselves away they hide themselves away they don't allow themselves

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.800
to be a presence in a social network and this is rather equivalent to the electromagnetic

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:29.360
type waves where where the electromagnetic magnetism causes two polarities I haven't been

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:37.120
able to go into that at all I'm afraid in this talk but the D and the L waves can run through

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.280
this network parallel to each other and will have opposite effects so you can have attraction or

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:49.440
repulsion between positive and negative charges and magnetism north and south poles and so on

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.920
but why why should all that matter be dualistic separated from our hearts from our inner hearts

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.040
we're embedded in it we're intuiting it we're communicating about it we're trying to understand

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.840
it by talking with people who see it differently and trying to edge towards a better understanding

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:13.520
of it and we need to be the presence of loving kindness for each other and that is a substantial

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:21.520
reality of a human being in this world that is the core substantial reality of a human being in

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:29.200
this world to be the presence of loving kindness for others in social settings or with the earth or

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:37.360
with god or whatever the spirituality is that is alive for you at that time and of course the love

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:45.120
unfortunately does not always feel like that comfortable warm cuddly joy of love when things

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.480
are going together love also is made known as grief where there's brokenness where there's separation

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.080
where there's misunderstanding or doubt or there's been offense taken or hurt that love turns into

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.280
a grief mode which you know we teach about in other areas that it actually has a positive purpose

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:07.760
a constructive purpose to help people to explore how to reconnect into that enduring connection

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:13.680
when change has pushed people out of a comfort zone but nevertheless that that grief can move

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:18.160
people to explore and if we have the warmth of kindness and we recognize someone is grieving

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:24.960
and we can be present for them then we can contribute to the healing of this world the

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:32.160
explicate order can get tied up in knots and we can help to untangle that we can be the presence

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:38.400
of loving kindness and we will be connecting into this implicated order discerning intuitively what

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.600
the movements of that order are what the values are that we need to bring alive in our relationships

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:52.960
now so this is the conclusion of what the the the triquetral cosmology brings us to a concept

01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:02.000
that the human heart is much more formative of our lives than our conscious minds which we need

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.680
to connect with others in conversations in order to discern and delve deeper into what's happening

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.720
in our human hearts in terms of values and interactions so I'll just come back to that

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:21.520
original slide the iconic slide of triquetral cosmology two self-organizing units that are

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:28.960
in communication with each other there is a mutual transformation that is synergic that is

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:37.360
life emerging and that synergy can we become an ecology for each other and that can bring

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.600
forth fruitfulness in life after that so this I believe I'm going to come back now to the final

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:52.240
slide is the implicated order within which mysterious things can happen things beyond

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.800
space and time things in which substance disappears but I'd like to say to you that that

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:05.600
inspiration that I had to write that poem and just think this is now 50 years ago

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:11.920
angle's turn and lines forgive criss-crossing of the mind I hadn't even didn't know about

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.440
triquetra but I wrote that angle's turn and lines forgive criss-crossing of the mind for here

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:26.160
in the world there is beauty such as always found between the seconds of your mind

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.520
so thank you that's what I'd like to be sharing with you very much indeed

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.080
Trevor that was fascinating and and I think it'll take us a little bit of time to get our heads

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:45.440
around your new concepts but I find them very very beautiful and especially as they relate to

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.800
to David Bohm and I just a couple of remarks before you know we have a five-minute break

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.120
and then we'll come back to the question announcements and questions and one form of pattern

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:06.320
recognition that I would associate with David Bohm would be meaning and and maybe we can come back

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.880
to that in the in the thought because he was meaning and being he talked about

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:18.080
and he he didn't like the mind matter idea he he he put everything into into into a different form

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.640
so that was one observation and the second the other two observations related to Ian the Gilchrist

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.920
because I think the brain that makes matter in substance is affected by left hemisphere left

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:39.200
hemisphere cognition and the right hemisphere is what enables us to understand betweenness

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:46.160
yes betweenness is is crucial to your model it's also crucial to his and I'd just like you to tell

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:54.400
us I'll clarify for us how exactly you would define the inner human heart I didn't quite get that

01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:01.840
clear use the term a lot yes is it in is it the intuition is it the what what is it exactly

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.960
do you have a definition for it well I I think it is going to need clarification in a fairly

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:17.600
extended way but the one way is to distinguish what in our human experience is not actually

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.040
orientated in space and time so below the orientation horizon if you think how much

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:30.160
for you imagine you are embedded in this explicate order world right around you that's above the

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.360
orientation horizon but there's a lot of experience to do with intuition sensing

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:44.080
that is is not framed in that way yeah it's very subtle it's very subtle yeah it's

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.040
nuanced it's dynamic and it's movement and and it is exactly as David Bohm is saying it's about

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.840
meaning it's I'm aware that there's some dynamic going on inside me but I cannot believe that I am

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:02.560
isolated in this this world this cosmos right what is this mentor of connection where do I belong

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:09.600
in it because what I see with my senses what is constructed into the simplified order

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:17.760
is not the whole story you know Ian's perspective as well that you have to think that we emerge from

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:25.760
within something and we're not apart from it absolutely and that's that in his whole his whole

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.440
chapter on the sense of the sacred you know makes this point anyway I'm we're going to have a break

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.760
now so back at 50 and then we'll have some brief announcements and then I'm sure there'll be a lot

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:49.920
questions thank you

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:58.880
um I think what popped in my mind when when I was reading a lot of you know the what if

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:06.960
questions it certainly is true that I believe the explicate order that our brains construct

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.560
everybody knows about the blind spot you know how our brain sort of fills in consciously

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.800
where there is no sensory input to the retina and we have all sorts of anticipations in life

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.680
that make us focus our attention in various ways and screen out other things and that's more the way

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.240
I look on this informational processing is because of our focus of attention we screen certain things

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:39.920
out and I believe that the whole brain works on feedback loops and we can we end up a little bit

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.360
like that film the matrix you know making our own reality in a way so so that's what those three

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:51.440
analytical perspectives are that the more you push yourself down that line of maintaining your focus

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:58.960
on certain areas of life the more you become separated from the ongoing in implicate order

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.960
conversational reality yeah you go off into your own mental world and you can talk with talk

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.800
with like-minded people and it'll sound as if everything's sensible and you're seeing it all

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.240
together but there will always be a limit to that one perspective just as a Galileo project

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.440
has said there's a definite limit to materialism but what what can we explore alternatively

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.280
that's the same is true if you if you if you take the vitalist view to an extreme

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.640
I'm afraid to say while I am a great believer in that participatory view of life

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.000
I'm I'm you know I don't believe I can just think it all into existence I'm not sure that

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.200
you know I think there is a material reality out there that that implicate order actually is

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:51.040
making particles and waves and the particles scale up into things that do behave deterministically

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:58.400
now we can work with that at different levels but the idea that just with our conscious minds

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.640
we can sort of dissolve it I just feel that's maybe going to a step too far there's sort of a

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.000
middle ground of paradox that we need to be living in where we're that's why we need the

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.840
conversations to explore that middle ground very good I mean what what you're saying also

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.200
we're doing a Bergson because the Bergson said the brain is the organ of attention to life

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:28.320
and and part of part of that attention is exclusion yes and if we if we took in all the

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.160
information that that we potentially could we'd be completely overloaded and we're already overloaded

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:42.160
and but we'd be completely swamped absolutely absolutely and and thank you

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.280
so what I'd like to do if I could just sort of build on this point a bit more I've said the

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.680
brain works on feedback loops now I personally believe that and you're asking for my concept

01:15:53.680 --> 01:16:02.560
within a human heart I think many people are aware that decisions choices are made emotionally

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:09.200
yeah they're made through the limbic brain and the core brain which is pulling together all

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.600
sorts of associations and sales psychology of course is expert at this they know how to influence

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:24.960
the emotions to influence the government right yes thank you and and so decisions are formed by

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.480
feedback loops between the core brain and the limbic brain and the cerebral cortex but also

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:38.000
coming into the core brain is all of our sensory input and there are filters in the core brain

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.560
that filter the sensory input on its way up and the outgoing motor in outputs

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:51.600
feed those filters they put a priority and that's part of the attention-focusing mechanism

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:58.160
yeah which of course a neuro neuro linguistic program is very strong on all of that sort of

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:05.600
filtering of information now that's what I believe the values are they're actually the priming of

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:11.520
filters in the core brain and the limbic brain that allow through certain things that we're

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:18.720
anticipating or magnify things that don't fit with it mismatches so that our attention focuses

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:25.040
on what is not going right so we can target our activity towards that purpose the purpose that

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.560
we have in mind the problem is the purpose we have in mind is our purpose not the bigger

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:38.720
purpose of the universe yes well there may be some sort of alignment there but we can't tell

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.840
yeah absolutely let's move on to the next question it's Julie Henshelwood does the

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:52.240
implicate order imply potential this is 2105 that's your question I think an absolutely

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.480
core thing that's going on for me is that discover all the the the Nobel Prize in 2011

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:04.160
which they had proved that the universe is still expanding at an ever-increasing rate

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:11.600
the universe is an open system and again in the book I would go into how I believe the open the

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:20.480
the tri-critical model allows the open generation of of new areas new new substance even you know

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:27.680
that my experience of life and I have had these personal experiences is that substance can

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:34.000
transform miraculously I simply have to say that is my experience that does not fit with

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:42.320
the laws of science and the laws of thermodynamics and so there is something about open system

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:48.720
thinking which as Julie is saying is all about growth and opportunity and potential

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:55.120
and the potential can grow but through conversational interaction it can stabilize

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:03.360
those stable domains are absolutely the core of what makes life sustainable right so there's a

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:09.200
constant movement but and those stable domains can form and they can disrupt and they can split

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:15.760
but nevertheless the fact that they stabilize movement and change and that that can scale up

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:22.240
to a level of predictability and determinism you know also allows because it's rooted in movement

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:28.560
it allows the miraculous and unusual transformation of those stability I think that's the key point

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:37.920
really and when I said we're David Bohm you're starting from the dynamic hollow movement and I

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:44.880
was just bowled over when I read The Implicit Order in about 1983 he spoke at the Mystics and

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:52.480
Scientists conference that year in fact with the Sheldrake and I'm also thinking that the closed

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:02.960
system is associated with linear thinking and a linear idea of time so I think this is as it

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.720
were systemic if I'm understanding you properly because once you've got an open system you're also

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:16.160
open into well we are consciousnesses there is our access means for the whole of what we're talking

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.480
about and but but once you're open you're open outwards and inwards if one can even make that

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:30.240
distinction I'm just totally with that but it all depends on our sensitivities and our willingness

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:37.760
to create gaps in time so that we can just step back from all of our constructs and just engage

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:44.800
with new sensitivities but then we need to affirm that through conversations with others who see

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.680
life differently because otherwise we just go off into our own you know our own imaginary worlds

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.840
if we do that we need this conversational interaction to find our own stabilities

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:02.080
then we are coming on to Peter from Scotland where it's still light it's totally sharp

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:08.960
yes indeed it's light but I'd like some light cast on my problems I might

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:18.240
I'm going to I can't formulate it properly for you so I ask you to be very tolerant of what I'm

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:25.440
saying because I haven't come to the a full understanding of what we're doing a number of us

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:35.760
in Bacillus is one of them are looking at random number generators and we're looking at the way

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:42.800
they go out of randomness now what is interesting about this is that we're looking at it what happens

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.440
when people die and we have reason to think that this will be a point at which the random numbers

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:57.360
will go out of randomness and also and this is much more interesting much more important

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:08.160
is that you link random number generators to specific people and specific events by forming

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:16.960
a relationship with them and the event so that's three three events there's a generator

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:26.000
there's the event and there is you who is doing it and it seems to me that there is going to

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:38.960
as time moves on the relationship between the random number generators and people and events

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.720
are going to increase enormously you'll have one in your pocket and you will to some extent see

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:52.400
the intensity of what somebody is thinking also time is a material and space is a material

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.920
now with that rather poorly formulated question can you can you help

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:08.400
um I'm really not sure what a random number generator physically is it's a presumably a

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:16.160
mini computer correct and what is the actual product you know what and what form does the

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:23.280
number remember so my model about whole movement at the input order is that it's the changing

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:33.680
relatedness of formed patterns but the formed patterns um it are of movement there there are

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:40.320
cyclical synergic you know spins or vibrations or progressions of energy

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:49.120
through this spin foam so what does the now random number generator do it produces streams of

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:58.320
noughts and ones and noughts and ones and these are either totally random as the pattern you get

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:06.000
or in fact they're less random they have structure in them and the structure it seems to be given

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:17.520
a remotely uh and there is a space is is not counted and uh um okay the thing the thing so

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.760
as you were telling you know your story describing the situation what popped into my mind

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.960
was the time when I was using the Qing and thinking about divination and there are the

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:34.400
settings and religious settings in which people try to divine um what is the dynamic that's going

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:40.960
on in hollow movement uh or in the implicate order uh and I came to think that there really

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:47.840
there's no need to use sticks and stones to do that um you know if our hearts are open to a

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:54.320
relationship with the implicate order we should be able to increase our sensitivities enough to be

01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.320
able to discern intuitively you know wise courses of action now I'm just wondering whether you're

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:06.560
describing the opposite you know which is that if I have made a relationship with uh an electronic

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:16.080
random number generator right that that relationship uh with it actually brings my heart level values

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.560
and here I would say rather my thoughts I'm repeatedly going to come back to my values

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:28.480
we bring my values into a dynamic relationship with whatever the um the quantum level

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.840
substance of your random number generator is I can't really be more precise I wonder whether

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.400
there's a form there's a form of entangled one going on here yes thank you that's probably a

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:45.680
helpful word there yeah um yes because in other words you you become somehow related

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.920
to the dynamics of the system which you aren't initially um but you become so through interacting

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.040
yes it's a little bit like the biofeedback system but if you if you have a belief that

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.560
this random number generator is something you can have a relationship with then perhaps you can

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.120
that I think is an interesting premise because and in fact I think I think I write in saying Peter

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:16.160
the the skeptics trying to do this often have um negative correlations

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.000
yes there we go we create our own realities yeah you see that's really interesting okay Peter

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.720
thanks so much let's go on to actually before I go on to Bernard that's what I want to ask

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:37.440
this question from Craig Hayengar about um the comparison of your triquetras with trefoil knots

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.800
yes and he did a bit about that so maybe you could just say a little bit about that

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:49.280
yes we looked at that the first um computer assisted design um models that we were making

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.640
the guy who was doing it uh it assumed that I was talking about a trefoil

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.600
and the the mathematics of a trefoil has been extremely well worked out they know all the

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.920
formula of the different curves um obvious and so he thought oh this is simple we just

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.520
string trefoils together and it just didn't work at all but the reason being that a trefoil

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:17.440
the what is a point on a triquetra is an angle that turns internally or becomes a ligand that

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:24.560
extends into the neighboring uh triquetra right it's a movement that either angles in on itself

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:31.920
and reflects internally or it becomes part of a synergy with an entangled one now trefoil that

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:39.280
angle is actually a curve now it's more like a ribbon that called curves around and goes back in

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.760
and it definitely is the same sort of eternal movement there's no question of that you know

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:50.560
they're both describing eternal movement but the trefoil doesn't include within it a model by which

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.920
it can entangle and we proved that because we tried and failed good okay I think we'll just

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.600
leave it at that because we're going to have 10 minutes or so and there's still people in the queue

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.120
thank you and it's our president burnard car next right hello bernard hello trevor

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.800
trevor thank you i enjoyed your talk very much um but there was quite a lot to take in and i don't

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:17.760
understand all of it so um but and so i was particularly interested of course in in the

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:23.840
emphasis you put on the triquetra and all these beautiful diagrams um i've really of course i'm

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.080
aware of triquetra in as a sort of Celtic symbol but i hadn't seen it applied in all these ways

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.800
and i really like the way you're applying it in all these different contexts both in

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.360
representation of particle physics the representation of the brain a representation of

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:48.320
relationships it's also reminding me a bit of dna and i was wondering why if you could apply it to

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.080
life in some sense you know but that's that could be a big question but the the more specific

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.120
question was being a physicist because i was particularly interested in what you said in

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.840
terms of its relationship to string theory really and quantum gravity and you made references to

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:12.640
spin foam but i couldn't quite work out to what extent you've really worked this out as a physical

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:19.200
theory um and to what extent it's just sort of um a qualitative discussion have you have you had

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:25.200
any feedback from string theorists on this sort of a right no you put your finger on the issue here

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:31.200
because uh remember i'm starting from a neurophysiological angle yeah i'm starting from the

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.480
level of human dynamics of systems of people and the way they communicate and how they get into

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:42.000
habits and routines and so on how you can break those habits and i've described in that

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.480
principles of organization that's the key term and then realize that those principles scale up

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:54.080
and scale down and of course my studies have taken me scaling down into cellular chemistry

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:59.760
macromolecular chemistry atomic and quantum i am new to everybody's new to it really aren't we

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.320
we're all guessing our way through it but what i'm saying my theory but my hypothesis

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:13.360
is that these principles of organization the brain has evolved to engage with so that we can have

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:19.760
consistent social relationships yeah that's the theory that same set of principles can scale

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:26.080
right down into an implicate order with entanglements that is a an order of movement

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:35.600
which comes below the level of any it's itty bitty you know building block you know that

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:42.480
it is the movement this primary that as those entangle because of the sine wave

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:50.480
ligands that form between them it generates the three dimensions of space yeah it actually

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:56.960
generates those but then where you get it stringing out into a long what i call a triquetral wave

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:04.560
just like a slinky you can get a fourth dimension wave moving along it yeah that's the that's so

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:12.160
if the stable domain curls into a particle which is held together by internal waves you can get a

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.760
vibration of that particle that's a fifth dimension you can get vibrations between

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:23.440
particles that's a sixth dimension any ligand can spin that's a seventh dimension i don't know

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:30.320
no here i'm guessing so you're absolutely right this is a qualitative model at the moment and my

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.280
i set off once i was working on it i set off on a search to find a quantum physicist who

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:41.040
would help me to apply their mathematics to this model to see that if it if it does match

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:46.240
experimental findings uh and so we can then modify it according to experimental findings

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:53.040
and i will simply say over a year's search i have not found a single uh quantum physicist who's

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:59.360
willing to talk to me so maybe about celios we'll talk to you well yeah i'd love to i

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:06.240
i want to search for one but but it needs to you know this is very much angular um angular mechanics

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.280
and so on it's the whole lot is curving all the time yeah well of course i'm i'm very fascinated

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:15.280
also with with what you just said about the link with dimensions and indeed the links with

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:20.080
hard dimensions which is one of my own interests i just one one little point you made the beginning

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:25.520
which i sort of disagree with which i'll just say very quickly um when you talked about the link

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:30.800
between open systems and the acceleration of the universe i wasn't really convinced by that because

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.920
it is true of course that the universe is accelerating but i mean even if the universe

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:43.360
wasn't accelerating um you still have this concept that you can violate the second or a thermodynamics

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:49.280
because of you know chaos there in things nonlinear effects because you can you can locally form

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:55.840
ever-increasing levels of complexity simply because you're not violating the second law

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:01.040
of thermodynamics globally because you know it's just a small fraction of the universe involved

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:06.000
in these this increasing structure so i wasn't really convinced by that argument in other words

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.920
even if the universe hadn't been accelerating i reckon your your argument would still go through

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:19.680
well that's helpful thank you learned because that would fit with the way um i again we're not

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:25.360
going to have time to go into this now but again in the book i do but uh but it's i actually believe

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:33.760
that an extending tri-critical wave moving into nothingness can actually induce movement

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.720
in nothingness right can you can actually and we actually could look at the process of continuous

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:44.560
creation uh through that sort of dynamic that's changing never mind the details of that it comes

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.640
back down to another couple of zen paradoxes in the way that that all works um but what you're

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:59.360
saying is that yes at any locality yeah at at any locality that same dynamic could be happening

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.800
and that is why the universe would be expanding at an ever-increasing rate because it is also

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:10.640
happening in micro-localities yeah that's that's how the expansion is happening at an

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.400
increasing rate because it's happening everywhere so i totally in agreement with you that yes that

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:24.240
the the chaos the complexity principles um can scale up in in any locality and the problem is when

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.160
mentally we make closed systems and believe we can experiment on it right and that that experiment

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.320
tells us the truth it doesn't it tells us what goes on in the closed system that we've created

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:42.000
yes i i think we've we've only got five minutes left um i think that it would be well worth trying

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.880
to develop this in in within the context of a working group within the Galileo Commission

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.640
and Vasilio you know can be in touch about this because i think there's there's a lot of

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.800
very interesting detail um to be worked out here and which really needs a much more extended

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:04.320
conversation than than we're able to have in in this context of some kind of questions and answers

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.680
well David thank you very much yes yeah so i mean uh Jerome sent a message to me saying does it need

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.920
a um a special interest group but i think it's probably more within the Galileo Commission

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.840
and and so i'll put you and Vasilio in touch um to talk about that Bernard thank you very much

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.920
indeed yes thank you Bernard uh Trevor thank you very much it's been incredibly rich

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:32.880
even and also from the the questions um a couple of points one i'm i'm put in mind of um

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:40.960
Gregory Bateson pattern that connects oh yes yes i mean his it's always worth going back to

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:47.600
Gregory Bateson because his he has actually incredibly fertile so amazing absolutely and

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.720
so i'm sure you will find new new connections there and then the other the other observation is

01:35:52.720 --> 01:36:00.960
is a relationship between the implicate and the implicit and and the tacit um um sorry

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:08.160
Sheila we we haven't got time for any further questions um the the as as with David Bohm

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:15.120
the the implicate or the implicit is what's enfolded or tacit and i'm using tacit in the sense of

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:22.080
the microplan use um know the tacit dimension the tacit and the explicit and and so when we

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:28.160
David Bohm talks about this when we explain something we unfold it into the explicate order

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:35.120
because to explain literally means to unfold explicory and and i i i think this whole metaphor

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:43.520
of implicit explicit implicate explicate is extraordinarily fruitful and what you've done

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:53.520
is to multiply its dimensions and put it into a variety of contexts um which i think is extremely

01:36:53.520 --> 01:37:00.320
fertile and and uh what i also very much like which is something we all need to do and again

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:07.200
Ian McGilchrist does this in his new book primacy of process primacy of relationship primacy of

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:14.480
betweenness and we got so used to our sort of subject predicate um their distinction our dualistic

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.720
in a in a mind matter um that way even our language and logic is structured um so that you've

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.280
got subject and predicate and Bohm kept on saying what about the verb yes the verb the

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.640
dynamism of the verb is in fact the most important element in a defining relationship between the

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:42.560
subject and the predicate and and rick tarnas is very good on explaining the origins of this it is

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:51.680
book um they they um make the passion the western mind um the background Aristotle and Aristotle

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.640
codified Greek logics absolutely fascinating i haven't read it for years but it just sort of
